inventor beta getting the latest Xubuntu
alpha and building and developing for
your very own home brew foxy box all
that and the squeaking snubs on this
episode of hack 5 this episode of hack 5
is brought to you by domain.com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain calm GoToMeeting and
Squarespace hello welcome hack 5 my name
is Darren kitchen and this is of course
your weekly dose of Technol us it's hack
5 season 8 episode 1 I'm so stoked to be
starting another season you know it was
just six months ago that was it really
six months by I guess it has been six
months since 7:01 started the season
seven transition seven and you know I
wish I could say that it's not going to
be kind of similar but it is except we
have something freaking fantastic for
nine so I'm like really really really
really stoked plus we've got like
Shannon Jason coming out here all the
time so it's gonna be good and I am so
stoked because this show we're playing a
little role reversal yeah you might
imagine Jason's on and no he's not doing
any Android development I am he's doing
Hardware stuff with motherboards and
whatnot like what crazy talk I know I
know but it's gonna be really good
we're talking a little bit of Boxey
we've got Shannon coming on a little
round table with GTM it's gonna be hot
taking some of your questions about
virtualization Linux and speaking of
Linux I am making an honest effort this
season to do almost everything that I
can
in Linux as opposed to any other
operating system just cuz you know why
not right taking the plunge actually
I'll be honest I totally borked my
windows partition and I really don't
feel like reinstalling it it's like why
would I need that you know I've got an
awesome editing rig and when it doesn't
cut you know when it's not Premiere yes
to answer all the emails I do edit in
Premiere cs5 whoo yeah without premiere
like there's really no reason to be on
the windows side so I'm having
a lot of fun and then speaking of Linux
let's talk Android that's what we've
been doing for quite a while and I'm
loving the fact that I just got my
invite for this sweet new system here I
don't know if you guys have had a chance
to play with this or get in on the beta
but App Inventor for Android is a
freakin sweet web-based system that
allows you to write applications for
your phone without you know a lot of
complicated SDKs and stuff like that as
you know Jason has talked thoroughly
about SDKs and will continue to with the
Android development I think he's even
doing some Boxey development but I
thought I doubled because well you know
how my code is it's it's like duct tape
right I mean look at my PHP stuff in the
first season but hey you know what this
is totally cool it's open source it's
based on the open blocks Java library
which is also based on an MIT project
called scratch language and it's all
open source and good so I figured as
long as we actually own our phone and
that is the difference with you know an
Android is you don't have to jailbreak
it and stuff you own it from the get-go
Google allows us to go and mess with it
and create our new fantastic stuff and
in a ridiculously easy environment where
we drag and drop blocks and stuff when
we can create programs visually without
having to actually get down to lines of
code I mean there's lines of code but
they make this beautiful interface on
top of it that kind of takes that all
away so I thought we would go ahead and
dive in right from the a block and check
it out so why don't we go ahead and get
started so first of course what you're
going to need is either an Android phone
or Android emulator we've talked about
that with archiver a few weeks ago and
I'm just going to go ahead and get
started with my Droid now you will need
to make a few changes to your phone
before you can set it up with a computer
and that is to go into settings here you
want to go into settings and
applications you want to make sure that
unknown sources right here is checked
you also want to go into development and
make sure both USB debugging and
stay-awake are checked so I'm going to
hit back twice go back to the main menu
I'm running Froyo here so 2.2 if you're
not it'll be sounds and just play on one
line
why's two different ones you go into
display or sound in display and what you
want to do is make sure that the
auto-rotate screen is not checked so
there you go with those two settings we
should have what we need on the phone
side to go ahead and connect it to our
computer and start sending it some good
stuff so here's what we're going to need
if you have been accepted into the beta
what you can do is head on over to App
Inventor Google Labs comm you'll see
that I have a couple of apps already set
up here under my projects and they've
got a fantastic site that'll help you
you know get started and learn more and
first we want to go ahead and get
started on our Ubuntu machine so we need
to set up our phone to our computer
you'll need Chrome or latest version of
Firefox you could use Safari I guess or
I but this will work on Windows Mac or
Linux I'm doing this in Ubuntu 10.04 and
we'll also need the job of 1.6 so with
those things already what we need to do
is go ahead and grab the drivers and set
everything up in Linux now the software
is pretty easy to install but we will
actually need to head to the command
line to set up some of the USB stuff and
this is very similar to I think what we
did in late season 5 or early season 6
with with tethering but you know on the
Linux side it's a little bit more
difficult when it comes to setting up
the USB than it would be on a Mac or a
Windows machine but not too difficult
all we have to do is open up prompt here
and I've become route real quick and we
want to head over to @c and you dev and
go into rules D and you'll see I've
already set one up here 91 TAC Android
dot rules and if I cat this real quick
you'll see what I've done is set it up
with the with the USB so set it up as
USB with the vendor ID and you know the
sim link and the modes and setup who the
owner is and whatnot you can find all of
the information here at the Android SDK
where it shows you you know
what to put in for your particular
device and I can verify that this works
by popping open another terminal here
and I think I have it installed wait not
as root so CD yes so in Android I have
under the tools the ADB the Android
debug bridge and that's a program that
allows us to do all sorts of fun stuff
with our Android device so I'm going to
go ahead and not plug my USB into an
Ethernet port instead I'm going to plug
it into the USB pop it in here on my
phone all right
yes yes you're right you did see that
that is kenny loggins
danger zone I know I know what I ride a
motorcycle really fast what can I say
so with that plugged in I'll go ahead
and issue ADB devices and as soon as
that starts up it should list there we
go we see my device so if I were to
unplug this run that again it would not
show any devices so there we go our
phone is connected to our computer we
can start using it we just need to
install the inventor software now this
is really really super simple if you're
in a Debian based operating system like
Lubuntu they've got a Deb for you so I'm
just going to go ahead download the
installer which I've already done here
and it's just you click through hit
install and what you'll end up with is a
bunch of tools in slash user slash
Google I believe and there we go we've
got the App Inventor extras like the
commands you know and it's very similar
stuff it's the ADB it's the emulator
it's all the things that the Java site
on the back end is going to need to talk
to your device it's really really slick
when you get this all set up because
what you do on the web page mimics
what's going on on the device almost in
real time so you get to see as you build
your application it's showing up it's
very very WYSIWYG it's so cool so with
that installed let's go ahead and since
we're already logged in
I can see that I have a couple of you
know programs written here already I've
already done the hello world stuff and
we're gonna go ahead and create a new
one real quick because I'm going to show
you what's happening here with Darren
taking the plunge and saying hey we're
gonna do an entire season olynyk's only
and well you'll see okay so new we're
gonna call this temp three cuz you know
third time's the charm right yeah all
right and here we go we are in the
interface let me go fullscreen this you
guys can see all that good stuff
f11 boom so over here on the left what
we have is our palette menu ok we can
see the basic stuff buttons checkboxes
images labels stuff like that we can
also see that we can import media we can
have like a player play some sound play
some video there's even animations built
right in social stuff so we can do
texting we can actually write an
application to text message different
stuff accept incoming messages parse
them do different commands maybe we're
on a botnet in the background so you can
send text messages to somebody's phone -
you've infected and make it do weird
stuff like take pictures and sent you
just say that matter so uh get Twitter
put it right in it's pretty sweet
sensors is one of my favorite ones I'm
playing with the accelerometer at the
moment and you know screen alignment
stuff and then I love this
not-ready-for-prime-time so you know as
you can tell it's a Google product it is
in perpetual data but we're going to
have a little bit of fun here and
attempt to create a real quick hello
world by going ahead and opening up the
blocks editor now the blocks editor is
the java package that interfaces with
that debian package that we've been
stalled that then talks to the phone and
makes it all sync up so that when I like
for example drag a button over here we
get a button I'm gonna remove that
button now cuz I don't want that because
I'm probably gonna crash the system if I
do that alright so with a blank project
I'm going to go ahead and open the
blocks editor now it's going to give me
a jnlp file which I want to open with my
Java JDK you can see I've already got
that as my default web 6 so okay
see I've downloaded that a bunch of
times so it should pop up here at the
bottom in just a minute there we go we
can see it's downloading
come on little Java thing you download
and perfect alright it's gone ahead and
downloaded we'll wait just a moment
it'll pop up and we do have to say yeah
we want to run this we trust Google
right yeah of course why not
alright so here we go this is the blocks
editor what the blocks editor allows us
to do is do all of the backend stuff
that allows what we've written on the
front end on the interface to actually
go ahead and do things like operations
and logic and stuff
so you'll see if I come back over to the
main inventor window and under my
palette I don't know dragged over a
button right and over on the right I see
the properties for this button I can see
that it's centered and that font size 14
now let's make that like 22 boom big
button sweet and then the text for the
button is gonna say hello world cuz you
know we have to that's just the way it
is and there we go we've got a button on
the screen we could drag over a whole
bunch of different stuff and what will
happen is when we do that come back over
to the App Inventor
under the my blocks tab over here we see
button 1 there we go so I'm gonna click
button 1 and you'll see this is where
the programming is and it's so
beautifully laid out and it's so you
know intuitive that you see when button
1 click do this I mean it's it's a
simple you know if then but they make it
so intuitive so I'm going to grab this
this when event here when button 1 is
clicked okay so it's completely empty
you see that there's a space here for
something else what I'm going to do is
let's add a let's add another thing
let's add a sound so under media I'm
going to drag this sound in and you'll
notice that it's not actually in my
interface it's down here under
non-visible components okay so with this
down here even though it's not invisible
I can it can interact with it in the
open blocks editor so with the blocks
editor I'll see now I have sound 1 I'm
going to
that and I have a bunch of different
things now if I had actually uploaded an
mp3 file a wav file I could make it play
that that's not what I want to do
actually within sound is also vibrate so
you know because that's a sound I'm
gonna drag that in and it's gonna snap
right in place and it clicks in so now
whenever I hit that hello world button
is going to vibrate but you'll see that
it's not complete we've got a little
piece of the puzzle over here what we
need is a little bit of matte so if you
just click anywhere in an empty space
you get where you can add text list.map
all that stuff so I'm gonna grab math
I'm going to choose a number here okay
so one two three is the basic thing for
a number now these are milliseconds you
can see when button one click do the
sound one vibrate for however many
milliseconds well 123 milliseconds
that's not going to cut it for me let's
click in here let's make it a thousand
milliseconds so there we go we've made a
hello world program it's really just a
button on the screen and when you hit it
it's going to vibrate your phone for a
second now the next step is to actually
get this on our phone so far we have not
told the open blocks editor to connect
to our phone so what we're gonna do is
click connect the phone you'll see we've
got a little icon here saying it's
connecting and if we take a look at our
phone to change here in just a moment
and we can see App Inventor starts
running we've got screen one and it is
listening for the new app and there we
go we've got hello world I want to click
this I don't know if you can tell that
on that mic there oops but I'm gonna go
ahead and click this yeah and there you
go if I were to come back over to the
App Inventor
and add something else like maybe a
label could just drag that over here
let's say text for label one and this is
where the problem arises this is where
everything is supposed to sync up I go
back over to my App Inventor I don't see
my label in fact I try to click into
anything now everything is completely
non-responsive as you might imagine this
is a beta and it just came out or became
available for a lot more people so if
you haven't already go ahead and and
sign up get in on the invites so you can
have fun with this
we do have an Android device good stuff
and I've been checking out the
you know Google Groups discussion on
this and and in the official IR C's and
stuff trying to figure out what exactly
this is turns out it's a problem that
more and more people are having with who
boon too so hopefully that gets nailed
down I really want to show you some of
the other apps that I've already started
to write some fun things that interface
with the accelerometer and stuff like
that so what we're gonna do I know this
is gonna I should have told you this
upfront really sorry worst a block ever
if you haven't noticed hack five has
gotten a little bit behind so with the
beginning season eight we need to get
right back on track and man do we have
some great stuff coming up for this
season like well hey what do you know it
finally got the the Wi-Fi hardware I
need to build the wireless access point
on one of these so that's good we've got
USB rubber ducky stuff coming on Jason
is gonna be flying down here real soon
to build us a Arduino based garage door
opener webcam interfacing with the
internet iPhone application I don't know
crazy crazy talk right but this being
hack 5 and this being just the way that
it is when you try to just dive right in
and there are inevitable problems with
you know everything not quite working so
well with the Linux and me spending
hours trying to debug I'm just gonna say
hey this is what I've got so far but
check it out we've got another episode
coming for you this week where I'm going
to show you the rest of this we're going
to have a little bit more fun with the
Android development plus we've got Jason
with more boxy development Shannon's
coming on with some other good stuff so
anyway stick around
awesome awesome series kicking off with
2 episodes it's like a double feature
this week and you know with all that
said if you have any recommendations for
things better than gtk-recordmydesktop
which gets out of sync if you do more
than 6 FPS completely non related to the
rest of the things in this segment or
fixes for Java SDK happenings with the
with the Android inventor let me know
darren at hack 5 org and with all of
that rambling I know right where's evil
server when I need him
just need a co-host right here in studio
with me where'd my Watson damnit Shannon
get your ass over here anyway with all
of that said let's actually kick it
right over to her but first
well thank one of our excellent sponsors
registering domain names in the
showerhead
weeks Oscar means get a dozen poets with

domain.com is the place to save 15% off
a check out with coupon code hak5 we've
got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain com
using the power of the internet and goto
meeting when our powers combined i'm
darren kitchen and i'm joined here by
shannon what's up Shannon
captain snubs II from Missouri Missouri
all right and then over in Northern
Virginia what's up Jason fire sorry
we're done with that bit yeah yeah so
there's some exciting stuff happening
last week with Boone too and that's
probably the first and last time I'm
going to pronounce that correctly this
segment but have you guys seen the news
about 10.10 I've seen the news about the
multi-touch thing yeah this looks really
cool so ubuntu 10.10 to add multi-touch
gestures as you guys know the Alpha just
recently came out and you know going
with the normal numbering 10.10 means
2010 in October as opposed to 10 point
o4 which is what we have which was which
was April of 2010 I know I love
versioning numbers that actually makes
some sort of sense but now I'm really
stoked about this because maverick
meerkat meerkat with oh what the heck is
a meerkat tomorrow meerkat is no okay
have you ever seen the Lion King guy
that hung out with okay you'll have to
send me a link later but the song happy
well anyway going along with that it
seems that we're going to finally have
multi-touch gesture support in Ubuntu
which means if you've got one of those
magic touch I
crappity crap what are those cheese and
help me out here but regardless cool to
see that you know the Linux is stepping
it up and you know what the way that I
look at this this is just like this is
totally what canonical does they it's
Ubuntu is like the most mainstream Linux
operating system that just kind of jumps
on these trends and you see when like
the netbooks kind of came out and we had
the Acer Aspire wands and the EPC is
battling it out like two years ago that
when we saw the the netbook remix
version of Ubuntu become like an
official build and I think we're
probably hopefully going to see similar
things where you know maybe we can like
do a little jailbreaking on a device
like this and turn it into something
actually you know useful for more things
than just Angry Birds if you're holding
up you know iPad it would be really cool
if you could jailbreak it or root it and
put Android on it cuz that's that's kind
of what the whole one button interface
or two button interface I really think
that Ubuntu is targeting the the II pads
or the netbook tablet convertible things
because I think that's really where this
is going as opposed to a dedicated
device I mean I really like where
they're going with this I just I don't
know if it's too little too late because
Androids you know steam them along to
tablets now or is it better to have the
option well we haven't seen a whole lot
of these other than you know your
craptastic iPads and I'm sure you know
we're gonna see more but that the the
canonical actually says that they're
targeting the Dell X t2 is their
development environment for this and if
you've seen the XT - it's like a fifteen
hundred two thousand dollar table old
tablet old tablet old gang the key word
here 2007 old tablet yeah but I mean as
a development environment I understand
if it's a piece of hardware that
actually has the the support that if
they need to take advantage of that so
it looks like we're going to start
seeing in 10.10 right now in the Alpha
we can actually see some of the stuff
that they've done with multi-touch and
the new API is but it probably won't be
until eleven point four or eleven point
oh four next April that we're actually
going to see the major apps like your
Ubuntu One and your you know calendar
and stuff like that that are actually
gonna take advantage of this so Darren
how can we get this and how can we play
around with it right now well if you
already have a Ubuntu machine set up I
actually have a virtual machine here
with 10.04 you can actually update it
and just pull up my virtual machine here
let's take a look if we if you go to
system and administration down at the
bottom you'll find the update manager
and typically if this is like a
a final release you'll actually find up
here a option to update to whatever that
new final release is but since this is
just an alpha what we need to do is just
pull up the run menu so alt f2 and then
to type in update tak manager kakdi and
that tak D option it's going to give us
a new little nifty thing here where all
of a sudden we see that a new version of
ubuntu 10.10 is available and simply a
matter of just checking upgrade here and
then going through this process and i've
recently done this with an older system
I went from I think nine point ten to
ten point oh four on my laptop and it's
a painless install if you have if you
just want to do a fresh install we've
got links in the show notes to where you
can just go ahead and download the
desktop version or the server version or
the coupon two version of 10.10 alpha
but you know it's it's still very new
it's running a kernel two point six
point three four it's got the updated
gnome updated KDE and one of the sexiest
things that I think built into the
Installer is a check box and I don't
check out the the new installer but it's
sexy but there's a checkbox there for
non free codecs it's kind of so you it
kind of replaces mint in a way kind of a
mint you know kind of shipped with the
code acts I think movement was the first
one to ship with with Kodak's the non
free codecs yeah I actually used mint as
my primary skype boxes because it just
works all the time I love how you just
install it and has all of the non free
software already ready to go it makes it
very very easy for newbies to get into
Linux and now that Ubuntu is offering
the option at the install level to just
go ahead and check a box that says hey
you know I actually want to be able to
like play that you know WMV file or
whatever it may be that's really awesome
yeah but that simplifies a lot of a lot
so you need to go out and gather all
those Kodak's this Installer makes me
makes me like Ubuntu just that much more
because it's it's much more attractive
and it's so much easier alright well
thank you guys so much for joining me
Shannon over there in Missouri
hopefully the fleet gets a loop you know
nicer out there
and Jason as well thank you
all right take care guys yeah and I just
want to thank Citrix for their
GoToMeeting software and making sudden
Slyke these possible let's face it
you've gotta meet with the clients and
colleagues but with an average business
travel costing like a thousand dollars
it's why I highly recommend doing more
and traveling less with GoToMeeting with
just a click you can host a sales
presentation a training session or
collaborative sessions right from your
desk plus voice over IP and phone
conferencing is included it's so easy
you'll have your first meeting up and
running in seconds

roundtable a hack 5 org you know I've
got way better content on my hard drive
than I do or watching cable so you know
I need a home media center PC to move
that content from my hard drive to my TV
but you can't just be any home media
center PC I got some strict criteria it
needs to be fast you know I don't want
to sit around and watch loading screens
all day need to be quiet because nothing
ruins good TV like fanboys and you know
it needs to have a remote control remote
controls are much more you know suited
for watching TV up down you know as
opposed to a keyboard mouse you know
keyboards kind of awkward and you've got
to put a mouse you know running a mouse
on your arm I don't I don't know what
you do with a mouse on the couch but you
know a lot of people do it I'd prefer mo
control and most importantly it's got to
be able to run custom apps because hey
it's me
it's gotta run custom apps but you know
let's talk hardware I did a lot of
searching for hardware and I found out
that an Adam board is probably going to
be too slow but an Adam board with an
NVIDIA GPU would do just the trick
that's where this ion board comes in you
know the lot of people you know ITX
boards you'll find your just atoms and
they've got fans and they're not really
suited for this but this board is in a
nascent board that has the ion chipset
like I said Atom CPU combined with the
NVIDIA GPU gives you a pretty fast box
but not more importantly this box or
this board in particular comes with a
lot of really cool extras built in power
supply built-in Wi-Fi
HDMI out RCA out for audio Bluetooth and
you know it's just all around good board
because also comes with the
all-important remote this is a pretty
board pretty easy board to get set up
you know since it has the built-in power
supply you can go ahead and plug in your
you know plug in your power plug in your
SATA I drop in RAM pretty much good to
go so you know now that we got the
hardware situated let's go ahead and
talk software software is pretty simple
on this you know there's a couple
different options but you got your XBMC
which will sit on top of most Linux
platforms then you've got box II which
is derivative of XBMC which is for you
know Mac Windows and Linux and then
you've got mythtv which is a lennox a
full Linux operating system based off
coupon - it's a whole boot CD which you
know incorporates TV tuners foxy and
XBMC you really aren't set up to do that
right now but um the most important
thing is boxing supports custom
applications with those custom
applications you know we're going to
dive pretty deep into creating them
because it's pretty cool you know you're
able to write software they can run on
your TV you know and next week we'll be
covering all of the software creation
but this week we're just getting a
system set up so now we got the whole
system set up we'll turn it on let's
play with foxy okay now the warned box
see this is a really nice interface for
using a TV it works great with a remote
you know really big buttons really
intuitive but the thing you care about
right now is the app so let's go ahead
and head into the apps inside the apps
this is just pulling from there
repository you know then the move in
order of most recently used you know I
use the Netflix app and then you have
the revision3 app which you know that's
a good app as well but these are all
apps based off of XML and there's some
Python code you can do and there's a
couple other SDKs but we'll get into all
that later and you know down here I want
to draw your attention to the extras you
can add repositories your own
repositories in fact other applications
so this is a pretty straightforward boxy
set up ready to go for next week when we
dive into foxy app development so if you
