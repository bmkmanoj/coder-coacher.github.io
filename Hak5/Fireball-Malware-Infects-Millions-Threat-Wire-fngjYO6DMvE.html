computers worldwide a one login breach
creates headaches for users and
WikiLeaks is back with another vault 7
leak all that coming up now on threat

this is threat wire for June 6 2017 your

privacy and Internet freedom real quick

it's a really great way to contribute to
lots of your favorite podcasts on
patreon so check it out and now on to
the news big thanks to Bessie matrix on
patreon for sending in this story over
250 million computers worldwide are
currently infected with malware dubbed
fireball which originally derived from a
Chinese company according to checkpoint
researchers the Beijing based company is
called Rosso tech and they sell digital
marketing in mobile game apps to 300
million customers worldwide
but when a user downloads seemingly
legitimate software from the provider it
is also bundled with fireball which is a
browser hijacker that has the ability to
execute any type of code on a victim's
computer oftentimes bundling is done
without a user's consent or knowledge
when they download an actual product
that they actually wanted in fireballs
case it changes the user's browser to a
new search engine then collects private
data then redirects to an actual search
browser like Google for example
fireball also installs plugins to boost
advertisements which obviously directly
benefit razo tech monetarily the scary
part is that although fireball simply
does those two things which could be
considered trivial its potential is much
more serious fireball could be a Trojan
horse waiting for the right moment to be
used for a lot more a huge attack Rafat
ex fireball bundle does include a legit
digital certificate but fireball still
acts like traditional malware in that it
hides its true nature countries that
were hit the most with fireball include
India Brazil Mexico Indonesia and the
us including get this 20% of worldwide
corporate networks so one out of five
corporate networks have been hit with
fireball which could create a huge data
breach if fireball was ever used for
even worse campaigns if you are worried
that you are infected you should
probably just make sure that you
recognize your homepage your browser and
the default search engine and that they
were indeed downloaded and set by you if
you do find that you have been infected
with it you can try uninstalling the
bundle and you can clean your machine
with anti-malware or adware cleanin
software remove unknown extensions or
any kind of add-ons from your browser
that you don't recognize and lastly
restore your browser to default setting
on May 31st one login which is a popular
cloud-based identity tool for businesses
posted in a blog article on their sites
that they had detected malicious access
on their us operating servers the
attacks started around 2:00 a.m. PST
that same day and it was shut down by
9:00 a.m. when recognized by a one login
employee the attacker gained access to a
set of AWS keys that are used for
authentication on that server and they
did reconnaissance on the one login
server until being noticed while on the
server they had access to database
tables with information on users
applications and various keys at this
time one login doesn't know if they were
able to decrypt any sensitive data so
they are asking customers to take some
action and precautions the company is
working with law enforcement as well on
an investigation
now since what login allows users to log
into sites and apps via one whole
platform it can also be a serious target
for attackers since according to
messages one log is sent to affected
customers the compromised data included
the ability to get this decrypt
encrypted data so this means that
customers have to make new API keys and
ooofff
tokens create new security certificates
update any kind of stored notes and
obviously update all of your passwords
this breach of one login servers comes
less than a year after a previous breach
that happened in August 2 2016 where a
bug in a feature called secure notes
allows to logging in via plaintext now
of course with any breach it is wise to
change your passwords turn on two-factor
authentication
and recycle old data that is stored in
the tool also make sure to keep an eye
out for any kind of phishing attempts
sent to you via email because those
would grant them lots of information
WikiLeaks has done some new data from
the CIA vault seven documents titled
pandemic on June 1st pandemic is yet
another CIA project that installs itself
with persistence on a Windows machine
and shares files and programs with
remote users on a local network
if the target computer attempts to
access a file on a server where pandemic
is installed pandemic will send the user
a malicious version of that file which
delivers a Trojan to the users machine
it does take advantage of Microsoft
Windows file sharing on local networks
which is called SMB which we have
mentioned before along with this thing
called Windows file system filter driver
which is a driver that is easy for des
to build in higher quality leading to
less bugs than legacy drivers and it
requires a valid digital certificate to
be installed now when a user accesses
the file via SMB protocol the filter
replaces the legit file with a malicious
one this will spur many more infections
on the same network such as a disease
outbreak would hence the name pandemic
huh go figure
pandemic takes about 15 seconds to
install and it can replace up to 20
files at a time on a server according to
security researchers this seems like a
tool for a very specific use case
scenario and no examples have been found
in the wild the release of documents for
pandemic was somewhat small compared to
previous vol 7 documents and the CIA has
still never confirmed or denied the
authenticity of the documentation thank
