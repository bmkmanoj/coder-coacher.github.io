by domain.com hello and welcome to this
episode of hack 5 my name is Shannon
Morse and this is your weekly dose of
Technol esthe and as you can see
unfortunately Daren is not here this
week but maybe we'll see him later on in
this episode along with some awesome
feedback from you guys but first off I
wanted to thank Greg again for joining
me Greg with his awesome blinged out
bling at Ron I loved his necklace don't
you looks good on him and I wanted to go
ahead and jump right into my segment for
this week now you guys remember last
week I checked out Cali Lewis
I mean Kali Linux just kidding and this
is the newest refresh of backtrack it's
pretty cool its feature features hundred
of pentesting tools for hobbyists and
for experts well this week I'm checking
out REM nuts which is a Linux distro
specifically made for reverse
engineering malware now as you already
know malware is basically malicious
software that can be hidden in a file or
source in the form of a code scripts
active content or other software
so generally malware is hostile and it's
made to disrupt or collect sensitive
information or change a computer in some
kind of way malware can be scripted into
the backbone of a PDF file it can be in
JavaScript or flash or other sources as
well now the distro grubnic's hopes to
make reverse engineering easier for the
masses and it brings us pre-installed
tools and software specifically for this
task now you may have already heard of
REM nook so it's been around since like
early 2010 so you know almost three
years already but it was recently
updated to version 4 in April of 2013
right now REM NOx is best used as an ISO
image or virtual appliance and this can
be useful to run in a virtual machine or
it can be used to analyze malware in
that isolated environment so that you
don't end up harming it well your laptop
or your usual workspace it's also an
Ubuntu
based distro so it's really easy to use
and it runs on a nice little desktop
environment now to run rum nuts I'm
using an ISO image from mine and just so
you guys know your username whenever you
get into it your user is rum nuts and
the password is malware in case you end
up getting out of your username for any
reason or you need to use sudo for
example so when you glogg in this is
your main page you'll automatically get
a terminal up here you won't be
connected to any sort of wireless
networks until you choose to and you got
the nice little background from next
tada
now a couple of things to keep in mind
about this it's made specific
specifically for malware analysis so the
tools that are in here might not be the
same tools that you would see in for
example Kali Linux so if I go down here
in the GUI you'll notice I have things
from accessories graphics internet I
have office stuff other things there's
tons of things in here
programming sound in video system tools
in wine so when you look through this
you'll think ok well there's not very
many applications to choose from but
turns out many of the tools that you
might want to use for the terminal are
not included in the GUI list so you'll
actually have to go into the GUI or go
into the terminal and find those so to
give you a couple of examples of some
things that are included in here for
flash malware for example there's plasm
there's SWF T tools Network activities
you can do Wireshark of course honey D
there's also JavaScript analysis like
Firefox Firebug quick Java and for web
malware you can also use the Firefox
user agents switcher extensions tiny
httpd is also included they also have
tools for a shell code for suspicious
executables like upx Packer ID byte hist
all sorts of different ones and then for
malicious documents like PDF documents
that might have malware installed they
have Didier Stephens PDF tools origami
framework etcetera etc also for memory
forensics there's volatility framework
bulk extractor there's even RSA key fine
an Aes key finder now lots of these
aren't found again in the graphical
interface you'll have to go into the
command line to find those so you will
need to check their cheat sheet to
verify if something is included for sure
and if you're wondering what that cheat
sheet looks like they have this nice
little tool that's already installed a
PDF guide which shows you usage tips for
malware analysis on Linux and they go
through not only just getting started by
examining malicious websites they also
have a lot of information on here for
document files and other files as well
so if I click on one of these like I'll
go to PDF ID
so this will automatically pull up where
you can find all sorts of information
about how to use PDF ID for example and
I'll go ahead and close this they also
have some general commands for use with
REM Knox which you probably already know
how to do most of these because they're
pretty much the normal things that
you'll find in Ubuntu operating systems
also they have a bunch of really cool
aliases as well so if you go into bash
aliases you'll find a whole bunch that
are already pre-made for you for
different commands that you may want to
use now last but not least if you go to
their website go ahead and close that
I was typing REM NOx since I don't have
it bookmarked
so if you go to your the website you'll
notice Lennie zeltser is the man that
made this he has let me quickly scroll
down here
so if you go to his website you'll find
that he also has the cheat sheet guide
on here in PDF form as well as a
printable if you need it for any reason
he also has a link to a nice little
webcast that they had recorded about the
essentials of using Remnick so if you
have any questions about how to use REM
Knox or if you want further information
about it you can always check out that
webcast as well so I'd like to thank
Lenny because this is not only a really
easy to use distro because it's based on
Ubuntu but it's also very minimalistic
so you're only going to find the
software that you need to run on this
and it's going to be really quick and
easy and then you can get back to
whatever you're normally doing of course
this is only for malware analysis so
most of that normal stuff that you
normally want to do you're not going to
be finding in here so it's not your
day-to-day Linux operating system but it
is something that may become useful if
you ever do find yourself needing to do
any kind of an analysis of PDF files or
what-have-you
now after all that you can always go to
their website and enter in any kind
feedback or bugs that you have found he
has his email address right there as
well as his Twitter on his website and
he also has the webcast again now I'd
like to go ahead and throw it over to
Daren or whatever is going on after this
segment we'll see and we'll be right
back after a quick break
oh hey there how did you even notice you
come in oh yeah I'm just in my kitchen
here trying to cook something yummy up
really don't have much food in the
fridge you know what I do have a hook-up
on domain names by the way this is about
as recursive as you're ever going to see
Darren kitchen yeah maybe it's a galley
anyway let me tell you about these
innovators imagine yourself an innovator
and entrepreneur
I mean yourself a startup well plenty of
these guys they're turning the dreams
into realities and it's all backed by
one of the coolest TLDs in the universe
is actually the third best Tod in all of
the universe of the net it's right there
behind command dot de and it's one of my
favorite TLDs see if you've got com
already like I do with my hack across
America calm or darren kitchen calm you
can protect your online brand identity
by getting that net I've done that for
both of those domains or if say the
domain name that you want is already
taken well that's not nets actually a
perfect alternative but of course
getting like a hundred and forty
character com that's crazy sauce don't
do that when crazy sauce should be made
up in here anyways when I get myself
Nets I do it over at my favorite place
to shop for domain names
that's domain comm you guys know it
they've been a huge supporter of hack 5
a huge fan of yours and they want to
hook us all up there really a lot of fun
to do business with even paint the town
red with so you can find them on twitter
at domain.com and you can save 15% off
their already affordable domain names
and web hosting all you have to use is
the coupon code hak5 a checkout and that
will get you those big savings so don't
forget use coupon code hak5 when you're
at domain coms check out and what do you
think domain names think domain.com i
think about getting groceries really
there's anything in
thanks Shannon I am at my home I don't
normally record here but I've been here
all week and will probably continue to
be for another week just to catch those
up who haven't been watching my video
blog by the way a video blog I just had
some surgery I'm okay everything's fine
it was oh yeah you need to watch the
video blog and find out how you can text
me during segments is how help me at
this and and anyway I'm also really
loopy if you couldn't tell I'm on a
bunch of medication right now so that's
why I'm home and recovering but
everything is cool I'm going to be fine
I think I'm gonna be right back on my
feet in about a week and then back to
finishing the build-out on the van but
what I wanted to talk to you guys about
in this segment is seeing that I'm home
and I'm and it's you know tax season and
I'm trying to do a bunch of ketchup work
and a bunch of administrative crap that
I don't want to do before I set off on
the road and just go you know
happy-go-lucky hacking around the world
America North America Canada is included
what I would like to do is talk to you
guys about what is it called Google Docs
I love Google Docs I can't lie like they
are so convenient and one of the things
though here being on my my windows box
here because I'm doing much of Photoshop
Illustrator stuff is that one of the
things that I notice is my habits my
workflow habits have always been I have
a thought I need to get it down windows
are notepad yadda yadda and that's great
up until you know you move machines your
hard drive crashes however it is that
you lost your file we've been there
right or you can't find your file
because it's in C colon backslash temp
backslash temp - backslash temp 3 anyway
I have horrible habits when it comes to
that but I do love Google Docs because
I'm able to search them there in the
cloud and the yada yada with the cloud
net stuff so you guys know all about
that we've talked about ways to sync
Google Docs in the past I'm
fan of I keep saying Google Docs and
it's Google Drive now but I'm not a fan
of the Google Drive client for Windows
it's really lacking there isn't one for
Linux and I wanted to talk about some of
the tools that you might use your
disposal to make Google Drive work
better for you and the first one that I
found here you know the web interface is
great but what I really want is that
notepad experience and for that there's
an awesome windows style notepad style
Google Docs or Google Drive application
over at code.google.com Knox and Knox is
really awesome because it's it's really
lightweight here it is right here you
see you've got a tab different you know
you can have new documents to your
heart's content in these different tabs
you can do the same kind of stuff you
would find in WordPad you can even
change some fonts but essentially it's
it's notepad right and what's beautiful
about this is I can say little world and
when I go to save that I can choose my
folders I can enter a destination gotta
yada and if I'd like an just do file
browse Google Docs and as you can see
it's tied in and so I can you know pick
up any of my Doc's of course any of the
formatting may look different if it's
rich text but for those basic I want to
jot something down I want it be synced
to the cloud and I'm you know one a
notepad plus plus style kind of with
tabs and whatnot this is an awesome
thing Windows only but for those Linux
users I found an awesome thing that we
should talk about which I bet in sync
how's your 90's boy band trivia huh now
let's go over to my linux mint vm
because i've got over here an awesome
tool that is free in beta free while it
is in beta
NSYNC is a alternative to the Google
Drive client for Windows Mac and Linux
currently Linux is free during the beta
it's ten bucks after that but seems
pretty cool because it's got you know it
allows for multiple accounts and a bunch
of other features and then above the
regular Google Docs one or the Google
Drive application but I'm interested in
the
the one for Linux here and if I just
come down here download and I'm using
cinnamon it's a fairly basic installer
and I feel like in sync has done a lot
of things right here so let's check it
out so since I'm in a live installation
I'm going to start it up from the
command prompt which isn't normally what
you would do and integrate with your
shell better but basically in sync I
even ended with an ampersand and we get
this icon down here in the bottom right
hand corner where we can see our in sync
errors and any changes that have
happened we can go to the website check
out the folder polish syncing the same
kind of stuff that you would find in
like you know a share file or a Dropbox
but what's nice is it pops up or
accounts at Google I'm going to log into
a Google account that I have here and I
will allow it access so it's using the
OAuth mechanism there whereas Knox which
I was not a fan of this with Knox
actually asked for your Google username
and password thankfully if you're doing
two-factor you can set up a you know
one-time use password but it's just
something to consider
now we'll link this machine I'm going to
name it minty minty mint because I've
had a lot of pain medication and that
sounds good
alright and with that said now I can
actually just fire up my my regular file
browser here and I'll see you have a new
folder called in sync and really it's
just matter going in there and you see
your name and hey there's my hello world
text I can create I can see other
documents that I have like here's a
Google spreadsheet that I have for tech
news today and if I open that up it just
opens up in libreoffice like I would
expect to a Native Client which for many
people might be what you're looking to
do and I like this because if you're
offline you can still access that and it
handles all of that synchronization
get back online and as you imagine you
know same thing with creating new
documents you know we can use it just as
a regular file system without having to
think about what's running behind it is
it fused is it you know whatever have
you and it builds on top of some of the
other stuff that Shannon's talked about
in the past where we'd actually use en
cfsr in confess to do encrypted
filesystem with this we can use it to
you know we can put regular volumes in
it no problem and and I like the idea of
just more synchronization goodness so
yes that is a very loopy Darrin from me
to you talking about Google Docs on the
windows and the Linux with the syncing
and the stuff and I want to hear what
you guys use because I'm all about
optimization and efficiency when it
comes to whatever it is day-to-day and I
have had the hardest time weaning myself
off just like notepad but you know what
do you guys use if maybe there's a vibe
with actually with this you wouldn't
need by with sink or an axe with sink
because it's just a directory yes
again very loopy Darin for me to you
feedback or the comments and I will see
you guys next week hopefully feeling a
little better Cheers it's now time for
