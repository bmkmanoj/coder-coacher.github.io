honour of hosting the buzz outloud a ten
year reunion at our new warehouse in
studio space I can't begin to tell you
what a pleasure was to give back to Tom
and Molly
Veronica Jason and the rest of the bol
crew longtime hak5 viewers will know
that these people were instrumental in
bringing hak5 to the San Francisco Bay
Area you can reference the foreshadowing
episode 526 dubbed nerdcore vacation
where we visited CNET and revision3 and
while times have surely changed since
those days in 2009 since then we've been
blessed to work with and learn from the
finest folks of buzz town I surely hope
you remember it as fondly as we do and
if you haven't already you can find the
full reunion episode at youtube.com
slash hak5
we'll be back in studio with a regular
episode of PAC 5 with Shannon myself
next week until then enjoy so the things
that I learned on this show like I I owe
so much of what I'm doing now to buzz
out loud aside from the fact that we
just got along as well as we did in the
studio and just really enjoyed ourselves
is just kind of get in there turn on the
mics talk a bunch of bull and see what
happened well when I first got the
physical challenge I wasn't sure that my
team was oh wait this isn't a reality
show it was amazing just to be able to
get the band back together for a little
bit and see all the fans in person you
know I wish we had even more time to get
more people from all over the country to
come down but I know it's a it's a huge
commitment but you know being able to
bring in people on skype and and talk to
other people who have hosted the show
before helped produce it you know it's
it was 10 years and it doesn't seem like
that long ago but our lives have all
changed so much and so much has happened
since then
but we can all really kind of go back
and look at buzz out loud as being this
thing that really propelled us into the
next stage of our career and I'm forever
grateful for that and forever grateful
to the people who helped make it happen
so we were just looking at this logo
which has these one of generic cutouts
of stick figures and I remember that we
were putting that together because we
needed some kind of logo we had one of
the graphic designers that seen it make
it and we said like it'll be close
enough we just need two dudes I mean one
of the that dudes substantially shorter
and the other ones substantially fatter
than Tom and then we thought well we'll
just get some sort of something
miniskirt and then eventually it morphed
into actually the three of us on the
logo but this is like the oldest of
old-school logos on the screen right
there know-it-all series this this was a
lot of fun and it felt good to be on
stage with those folks again and and
hang out and talk about stuff and and
not feel like we made mistake or that
you know we wish a whole thing had been
different but just kind of celebrate
what it all has grown out of that so I'm
really really happy and I'm really happy
to see how well everybody's doing not
just among my co-hosts but also people
in the audience who are going on to do
amazing things it's really cool I mean
they really I mean the one thing that I
learned from this show that will stay
with me forever is the is what strengths
and what what reinforcements you get
from the community now the number of
people who you interact with in a
community is relatively small but
they're the representatives of everybody
right there the elected officials and if
you can interact with them if you can
win over them if they like you it's if
you get so much from her Tom said
something earlier on he said I'm doing a
show without a commute without a chat a
live chat he feels
we said naked or something but you feel
unprotected or at sea there's so much
you get from having a live audience of
people you know who will call you out on
your mistakes and still love you at the
end of the day it's there's nothing like
it yeah I know it's been I mean
spectacle fest has just been in the
works for so long and we've put so many
thousands of man-hours into it at this
point and you know it's hiring all the
food vendors and and all the people who
are coming to showcase their newest gear
the permanent like just having to renew
those permits year after year after year
you know I suppose at this point I've
been I've been you know run through the
dirt on it already
I pretty much I know what to expect at
this point spectacle Fest is so elusive
I feel like we were close this time
we get so close that it gets ripped out
of our hands and it's just been I
basically have sunk my entire life
savings into it at this point and you
know I'm just I'm feeling really
positive that next year is gonna need
the year you know I've got the location
down I've got a lot of the performers
down we've got the fireworks permit
again and the elephants I don't know if
that would help at this point I mean
like I said my money is all gone I I
don't I feel like I can't take other
people's money at this point that I
would feel really responsible you know
when inevitably we had to cancel again
and postponed have you Kickstarter we
should start a Kickstarter for spectacle
next year because then you then you have
to do it being privy to the inside
access of the reasons why and kind of
what needs to be done to make it happen
next year I'm pretty I'm pretty
confident some of the things that
they're trying to do with this you're
gonna need a few permits just a couple
yeah we're talking about a spectacle
here it's gonna be amazing and I I hold
out hope personally I hold out hope yes
spectacle Fest is happening next year it
will happen 2016 is the year spectacle
Fest is real yeah thank you thank you

look this is kind of leading to another
thing that I've been meaning to ask you
now that we've you know happily hosted
your 10 year reunion hak5 is having a
little bit of a anniversary in August's
and I was thinking we could just have it
at your place yeah you know what you
guys should come on my my capacity is
about the same as yours
it can hold 3 well no I was thinking
maybe we could take the over both the
upstairs and the downstairs
oh then 5 yeah well and then if we tell
you if we put Django in the backyard 6
there we go see yeah so you know with a
little creativity I bet we could get it
to 10 we could almost get the entire
cast in one room so look forward to that
