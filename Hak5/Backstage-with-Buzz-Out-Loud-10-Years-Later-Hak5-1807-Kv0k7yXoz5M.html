honor of hosting the buzz out loud a
10-year reunion at our new warehouse in
studio space I can't begin to tell you
what a pleasure was to give back to Tom
and Molly Veronica Jason and the rest of
the bol crew longtime hak5 viewers will
know that these people were instrumental
in bringing hak5 to the San Francisco
Bay Area you can reference the
foreshadowing episode 5 26 dubbed
nerdcore vacation where we visited cnet
and revision 3 and while times have
surely changed since those days in 2009
since then we've been blessed to work
with and learn from the finest folks of
buzz town I surely hope you remember it
as fondly as we do and if you haven't
already you can find the full reunion
episode at youtube.com slash hak5 we'll
be back in studio with a regular episode
of hak5 with Shannon myself next week
until then enjoy so the things that I
learned on this show like I owe so much
of what I'm doing now to buzz out loud
aside from the fact that we just got
along as well as we did in the studio
and just really enjoyed ourselves is
just kind of get in there turn on the
mics talk a bunch of bull and see what
happened well when I first got the
physical challenge I wasn't sure that my
team was oh wait this isn't a reality
show is it it was amazing just to be
able to get the band back together for a
little bit and see all the fans in
person you know I wish we had even more
time to get more people from all over
the country to come down but I know it's
a it's a huge commitment but you know
being able to bring in people on skype
and talk to other people who have hosted
the show before helped produce it you
know it was 10 years and it doesn't seem
like that long ago but our lives have
all changed so much
and so much has happened since then but
we can all really kind of go back and
look at buzz out loud as being this
thing that really propelled us into the
next stage of our career and I'm forever
grateful for that and forever grateful
to the people who helped make it happen
so we were just looking at this logo
which has these one of generic cutouts
of stick figures and I remember that we
were putting that together because we
needed some kind of logo we had one of
the graphic designers that seen it make
it and we said like it'll be close
enough we just need two dudes I mean one
of the that dudes substantially shorter
and the other one substantially better
than Tom and then we thought well we'll
just get some sort of something
miniskirt and then eventually it morphed
into actually the three of us on the
logo but this is like the oldest of
old-school logos on the screen right
there no in all seriousness this was a
lot of fun and it felt good to be on
stage with those folks again and and
hang out and talk about stuff and and
not feel like we made mistake or that
you know we wish a whole thing has been
different but just kind of celebrate
what it all has grown out of that so I'm
really really happy and I'm really happy
to see how well everybody's doing not
just among my co-host but also people in
the audience who are going on to do
amazing things really cool I mean they
really I mean the one thing that I
learned from this show that will stay
with me forever is theme is what
strength and what what reinforcement you
get from the community now the number of
people who you interact within a
community is relatively small but there
are the representatives of everybody
right there are the elected officials
and if you can interact with them if you
can win over them if they like you it's
if you get so much from a Tom said
something earlier on he said doing a
show without a commute without a chat a
live chat it feels I don't think that
naked or something but you feel
unprotected or
there's so much you get from having a
live audience of people you know who
will call you out on your mistakes and
still love you at the end of the day
it's there's nothing like it yeah I know
it's been I mean spectacle Fest has just
been in the works for so long and we've
put so many thousands of man-hours into
it at this point and you know it's
hiring all the food vendors and and all
the people who are coming to showcase
their newest gear the permanent like
just having to renew those permits year
after year after year a lot of people
are asking if this was going to be
spectacle spectacle Fest is next here
next year all right it's a planning the
planning is really coming along I feel
really positive but this is gonna be the
year that we get spectacle fab you just
stay tuned stay tuned buy your tickets
now you gotta bust paypal account yeah
you know I suppose at this point I've
been I've been you know run through the
dirt on it already I pretty much I know
what to expect at this point spectacle
fest is so elusive I feel like we were
close this time we get so close that it
gets ripped out of our hands we know
better and it's just been fine I
basically have some of my entire life
savings into it at this point and you
know I'm just I'm feeling really
positive that next year is gonna need
the year you know I've got the location
down I've got a lot of the performers
down we've got the fireworks permit
again and the elephants
it could ever be a reality I don't know
if that would help at this point i mean
like i said my money is all gone i I
don't I feel like I can't take other
people's money at this point said I
would feel really responsible you know
when inevitably we had to cancel again
and postpone have you kick started maybe
get me to do keeps you turned red we
should start a Kickstarter for spectacle
question is dear cuz then you then you
have to do it ya no eres Darren may
decide but the starting a start-up
respectable fast we only need what ten
million dollars we can wait 30 days yeah
sure being privy to the inside access of
the reasons why and kind of what needs
to be done to make it happen next year
I'm pretty I'm pretty confident some of
the things that they're trying to do
with this you're gonna need a few
permits just a couple yeah i mean we're
talking about a spectacle here it's
gonna be amazing and I I hold out hope
personally I hold out hope yes spectacle
Fest is happening next year it will
happen 20 16 2016 is the year spectacle
