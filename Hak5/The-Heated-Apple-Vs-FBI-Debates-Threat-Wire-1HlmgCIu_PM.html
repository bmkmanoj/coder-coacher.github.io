heated secure socket layer version 2 is
broken why are people still using it and
the Turing award goes to hmm all that
coming up now on threat wire hello world
I'm Shannon Morrison this is threat wire
for March 4 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom patrons be on the
lookout for a new security episode by
Darren kitchen it will be on the patreon
feed this week and of course if you want
early access to extras check out our
patreon page over at patreon calm /
threat wire and on to the stories the
first one being a big one first off I
would like to toss some props over to my
co-host for his very informative summary
of the Apple versus FBI debate story
this is an ongoing topic so I would like
to build upon what we already know if
you are unfamiliar with this please
refer to our last episode of threat wire
it has much importance of it so much has
happened since last week's widely
debated controversy involving Apple's
technology and the FBI wanting access to
a noun deceased suspects iPhone
including Apple not complying with the
request several different tech giants
including Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook
and sundar Pichai of the CEO of Google
have spoken out about their support for
apple during the court battle an amicus
brief was also written in favor of Apple
by many many crucial iPhone security
researchers as well as top security
professionals in the field now while
support of other companies and persons
can only get you so far in a lawsuit
Apple does have a really strong defense
in this case claiming that their
unwillingness to create an alternative
operating system specifically designed
to backdoor this iphone is
unconstitutional under the First
Amendment now since Apple would have to
sign this new code with their digital
signature to allow it to work on an
iPhone they're saying that this would be
covered under the First Amendment which
states Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
or abridging the freedom of speech or of
the press or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble and to petition
the government for a redress of
grievances so surprisingly code
is considered a form of speech so it
would be covered under the First
Amendment and it has been protected
since the Bernstein versus US Department
of Justice trial in the late 1990s and
early 2000s ha surprising thought now
this is the first of its kind when it
comes to digitally signing code Apple is
also using an argument and gets the all
writs Act which the government is using
to try to gain access to the phone
through apple now the all writs act
which by the way was passed way back in
the 1700s yeah so it's kind of old
authorizes the United States federal
courts to quote it shall all writs
necessary or appropriate in aid of their
respective jurisdictions in agreeable to
the usages and principles of law end
quote the communications assistance for
law enforcement act or kailia for short
from the 1990s is also being used by
Apple as a defense because this law has
written protocols about what can and
cannot be requested from a private
company no where in cali estates that
encryption must be broken or cracked
although it does allow the government to
use electronic surveillance in
telecommunications which are very very
different indeed and I have links to all
of those different logs and regulations
down in the show notes below on YouTube
now the heated debate is under the
scrutiny of people in the US as well as
worldwide because of the precedent that
it creates for a future privacy and i
know you have heard that word way too
many times this week but i'm going to
repeat it again precedent it's very
important which it's starting to look
more and more like reality in cases that
have nothing to do with terrorism but
everything to do with breaking
encryption all current cases in court
involve the all writs act an apple with
one so far ruling in apple's favor yeah
so Congress has started hearing
arguments as a march first in oral
arguments are scheduled for March 22nd
this fight is nowhere near over and it
will be a huge priority for privacy
advocates across the board when it comes
to our safety our security and our
privacy are they all one in the same or
do you consider one more important than
the others close to twenty-five percent
of the top 1 million websites on the
worldwide internets are susceptible to
an attack on TLS the transport layer
security protocol nearly 11 million
websites total across the tubes being
vulnerable
now this attack it's called drown for
decrypting RSA with obsolete and
weakened encryption uses the TLS
protected RSA cryptosystem through SSL
version 2 which is secure socket layer
version 2 which was retired two decades
ago and upgraded to TLS so that's the
cell version 2 goes to CLS should have
been retired people are still using it
and an attacker would have to use SSL
version 2 to connect to the server over
and over again eventually gaining enough
data on the encryption key that is used
on that server so this attack opens up a
floodgate of information for this
attacker while this shouldn't happen
some TLS communications haven't been
configured correctly and this problem
kind of sneaked in so open SSL for
example an implementation of TLS has
been confirmed as being susceptible to
the attack so for open SSL users it has
since been upgraded and been fixed you
can upgrade to version 1.2 g or one
point 0 point 1s ASAP and for others you
can use a firewall to kind of protect
yourself and filter ssl version 2 from
connecting now lastly the researchers
who found this vulnerability have
created a form to run a check against
your own server at their website and
that is linked below lastly for today I
wanted to congratulate the creators of
the diffie-hellman key exchange protocol
what field diffie and martin hellman on
the ACM turing award of 2015 4 1 million
dollars back in 1976 they wrote about a
protocol for crypto key exchanges called
diffie-hellman which was the originating
protocol for pgp TLS in so many more now
their paper was one of the major
highlights of public and private key
handshakes and how the encryption works
and it is currently being used to build
even better cryptography to this day so
congrats guys you deserve it and now
early access to show summaries
behind-the-scenes pictures darren
kitchen security videos it's all
available for patrons over at patreon
com / threat wire plus when we hit our
very next goal which we are creeping
closer so help us out and share the show
we will make in RSS feed if you are
already a patron thank you so much and I
hope you're enjoying all the button
behind-the-scenes content our show is
