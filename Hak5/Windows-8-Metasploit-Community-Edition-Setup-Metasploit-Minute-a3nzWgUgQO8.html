Community Edition on Windows 8 this time
on Metasploit minute this Metasploit
minute is brought to you by hack 5 and
viewers like you
support us directly at HHH all calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me mix in
this minute we're going to be setting up
Metasploit Community Edition on Windows
8 the very first thing we have to do is
download the Installer and you can do
that let me show you at rapid7 comm they
give you two options one is Metasploit
Pro it's a 7-day trial that you can try
out the cool version cool features of
Metasploit Pro as well as Metasploit
Community Edition I've clicked through
this and gone through and filled out all
the information you got to fill out so
we already have the Installer downloaded
and this really is just next next X
finish that we're we going through but
let me show you just some of the little
tweaks that are going to have to happen
yes for UAC prompting next I agree so
this is kind of the first important
piece you want to put this somewhere on
your disk where antivirus is not going
to pull it away so if you have an
anti-virus installed on your system
this is an exploit development or
exploit framework so by default it has a
bunch of exploits in it now your a/v is
definitely not going to like this so if
you put this anywhere on your system
that AV is going to scan it especially
during an installation it's going to rip
it right out
so either disable your antivirus or put
an exclusion for this particular
directory now this ssl port is where
you're going to be hosting the community
edition web application now if you have
anything on 70/30 790 already which you
probably don't you can change it right
here but it's best to leave it as
default next this is your SSL
certificate next it's just basic self
signed stuff and in
all now we just wait alright now that
our installer is finally done and we're
going to access the Metasploit web UI
wiki or whatever it's going to be the
the web UI for the Community Edition
that we talked about so finish it should
pop up let's get this a little bigger so
you guys can see it ooh not that button
there you go
welcome Metasploit blah blah blah blah
blah click on the little button and we
set up our very first user name so one
of the big features of the Community
Edition and Express and pro is that it's
multi-user right so there's not just one
way to get to this thing so we set up
let's just say hack 5 as our username
and our really long password that we're
definitely going to remember act 5 msf
hack 5 org Metasploit unit create an
account done so this is where we have to
get a product key for the community
edition if you have a community edition
you can still use meswick console and
we'll show that another time without
doing a product key but just getting a
product k-y-t's pretty simple you you
have to input the same information again
license
here we go daytime number 8 6 7-5 309
alright we got our license copy paste
activate and that's it we're good to go
so that's it what do you think hit me up
at MSF at AK 5 org and stay tuned and
Metasploit Metacom for more shows like
these until then imma bik's and I'll be
hacking til the cows come home
maybe named anemia may remember purple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
