down meet me here bring a camera you
didn't tell me what it is but it's got
something to show me so let's check it
out Barisan what's up Darren how you
doing alright so I stole the show liked
it a lot I got something might want to
take a look at all right check it out
cool
you know what's up dude what's up John i
doing pretty good bro I got Darren from
high point five sweet yeah I'll just
work up some code for a pack point five
actually so it's up to you to show them
on which he did yeah it definitely this
there's a lot of buzz going around on
the internets about installing mac OS x
on a pc so we're going to show you the
easiest and most simple method to do so
oh sweet but for chill bro let's get to
it show me what you got well take a look
holy dude that is gorgeous sweet
you think you can do it to this gateway
yeah all right so when we need to get
started okay well first of all you need
to make sure that you have the tiger
disk image it's been floating around the
internet so if you don't already have it
go buy a mac second you need to make
sure that your processor supports sse2
instruction sets now you can do that
with a little tool called cpu-z and when
you run it it'll tell you exactly what's
instruction sets your processor does
support okay now you have to remember
that you won't be able to run Rosetta
without sse3 but you can run tiger with
sse2 next we're going to be using a
linux livecd in this case we're using
knoppix 3.7 okay um and we also need a
removable hard drive or a network drive
to store the disk image so let's get
started I'm going to go ahead and pop in
this knoppix CD simply restart the
computer and boot off of it so we got
knoppix loaded the next step is to make
a directory and mount your network drive
under this computer
so I'm going to make a directory called
Tiger 86 do samba mount
go ahead and enter your password because
we're connecting to your computer there
we are all the files are there now the
last step is to run a command
go ahead finish it off
alright so what's it doing right now
basically now it's going to load the
disk image from your computer onto this
machine and erase everything on this
machine's hard drive so basically you're
going to lose everything that's on there
pretty much yet so as soon as this
command finishes all we have to do is
reboot the machine and select you in
Darwin and that'll be it so we took a
quick break and I took the liberty of
shutting the computer off now all we
have to do is turn it back on and see if
it worked all right let's boot in the
Darwin looking good so far yeah starting
middlesex how we're doing is wait for
that login screen right now make sure to
enter your top secret super secure
password notice and we're in what do you
think so there you go Darren to run a
few things is to make sure it works
let's pull up the terminal and it's
looking good so far there you go guys
Tiger running on a PC dude thanks so
much that was a great hack everyone
gorgeous moron hak5 one last question
before I leave was that legal actually
yeah it definitely is so think of it as
a shower application try it out get a
feel for OS 10 and then go by Mac not
planning on it all right remember
winners don't do where's right I will
see you next time to fight peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
