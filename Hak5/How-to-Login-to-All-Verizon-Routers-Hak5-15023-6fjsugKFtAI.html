Sail University that just about wraps up
this week's episode of fact 5 but before
we get going we do have some cool
questions from viewers we've got fun new
stuff happening in the hack shop I am
red on bread did you you're so blending
right now it's great
yeah that's an awesome shirt so thank
you that I got this Annie Seattle at the
living computer museum in episode there
was fantastis it was fantastic I agree
let's get into the message okay so I got
an email here from Bob and Bob writes
funny story today at DSL line installed
and the Verizon tech told him that the
that the administered is password 1 and
with an emphasis on uppercase P and and
the 1 &amp;amp; 2 him he responded he's like so
Verizon doesn't like you to change the
password on your modem this way all of
the text can get in if necessary and
he's like wait hang on are you saying
that every Verizon DSL modem has the
same crappy login it's like uh-huh and
it's like dude security convenience
always so I just I love that so thank
you for sending that by in fact this is
not the first time I've seen password
one oh yeah
I wish I could tell you about the
horrible remember when I worked in in
the DC Beltway area doing like insulting
for a bunch of like government
contractors and stuff and my pen tester
people in the audience know like yeah
password one oh that's funny
got any more emails from that this is it
right now but feedback at hack five org
I want to talk about the drone dude okay
so we have a brand new product in the
hack shop if you haven't seen it yet if
you went to DEFCON you definitely saw it
no no we have a brand new adventure when
Jason and I got drunk at my birthday and
we're like having fun with some UAVs and
were like dude what did we strap the
pineapple to like an RC plane with HD
camera feeds and then we could totally
run that thing all over where
to get your packet sniffing on and
there's like a really tall fence with
like our way and so so just just for fun
just for a likkle look like this will
these will probably be gone or like a
week ago
screaming pineapple because you guys
have been seeing the graphic behind over
Shannon's shoulder for awhile and so I
thought hey what better way than to
bring it to life and the idea is pop a
pop a Wi-Fi pineapple on there and then
with the control stick video yeah you
get a live video feed a record HD and
what I love is you see how the ailerons
and elevators are moving themselves so
it's got like an auto pilot and auto
stabilizations that you like let go and
it just to keep the maintain stable
flight that's not really cool yeah Missy
oh and it's lightweight yep and it comes
with an extra body right yeah yeah your
buddy
let's get this out of here did okay
that one's not going back to that shop
anyway so this is just us having fun I
wanted to remind you guys before we wrap
a backpack across America we are I'm
gonna be doing your granny Texas huge
and doing you know what is a Dallas
Houston Austin the fourth fifth and six
so that's gonna be pretty big so if
you're in Texas come on out and then
Minneapolis on the 19th
yes what's oh you'll have to see we've
got we got a fun stuff planned but yes
hey I know a place in Springfield
Missouri you could go to yes there's a
cyber defenders in Springfield Missouri
that one maybe well now as well as
Kansas City as well as you guys emailed
me there's a cool hacker space there's a
bunch of the hackers in Missouri turns
out you know we're all a bunch of geeks
all we do is sit in our rooms and we
aren't the ones that actually tilt over
the couch yeah sure cow tipping as I've
learned you can take the hacker out of
Missouri but you can't take the Missouri
out of the hacker had better watch
follow is a place that you could go and
follow the hacker that be on all the
social networks she's at snubs I'm at
hack five Darren Paul doesn't do Twitter
but he's on there he's gonna be like
he's gonna be like I was leaving Twitter
before leaving Twitter was cool so way
