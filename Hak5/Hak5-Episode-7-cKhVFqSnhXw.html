hack point five
welcome to hack point 5 i'm your host
darren and i'm your host west and this
is lucky episode number 7 kind of yeah
because it just so happened that we've
released 13 different episodes of
content well 13 releases in all episodes
but happy yeah so this could be unlucky
i don't think so i think we'll just
split the difference and call it even
sounds good to me anyway so we've got a
power pack episode for you kind of
darren is bringing us a way to encrypt
your VNC connection through ssh it's
going to be awesome so you won't need to
worry about Harrison like getting in
there and listening to drinking have it
yes and wes is going to be doing a hack
/ mod kind of you're just gonna have to
wait for the next segment check that out
and we are so stoked okay oh man what is
faster than a speeding bullet stronger
than a speeding locomotive and you can
leap tall buildings in a single bound if
you answered Superman you or one hundred
percent correct this is awesome gun mo
from a mac today and I would just
flipped out totally because right here
on issue number 648 of The Amazing
Adventures of Superman this is the V
Superman comic that's been running for a
long long time and this makes me so
happy because down here page well
there's a page there are page numbers
about halfway down I say command n logo
oh wait wait what's this on the back of
this hat holy and alive yes hak5
apparently there's an animator over a DC
net loves independent media and
apparently we he likes us so we love DC
now that's good stuff yes I've always
liked DC dude totally I mean Susan lamb
he could let's not even getting get into
the superman/batman debate because I
wasn't about to I was just gonna say
Batman's part of DC to really I feel
schooled I really thought he was Marvel
Marvel's all the mutants oh like the
x-men x-men fantastic 4 X Factor well I
stand corrected yeah I'm definitely
stained sorry we're not very well right
now you see Wes decided that it would be
a good idea when we went out for dinner
this evening to twist my arm and force
us to
have some what were they come on it
wasn't my idea he forced me yeah I'm
sure anyway we had a cup we had a two
shots of buttery nipple and what is in
the drink that is butterscotch schnapps
baileys irish baileys irish cream sounds
tasty and it really was and if you're if
you're a legal drinking age in your part
of the world go ahead and enjoy it
because we sure did oh yes and we shall
enjoy summer uh-huh his birthday
tomorrow so send your happy birthday
email to West hak5 Dorgan gonna get off
the stool here but and um so shall we do
what we do let's do it well and let's
jump right on into my mod segment enjoy
okay so you might have seen this
floating around on the internet CBS has
started marketing these new disposable
digital cameras both still and video and
they run about 17 15 bucks american
dollars for the stills and about 30 for
the video problem is everything about
them is proprietary you have to take it
back to CBS have them pull the pictures
or the data off of them put them on CD
for you and give them back that's
another like an $11 charge so you're
looking at it like thirty or forty
dollars just to get about 25 pictures
that my friends is a ripoff alright so
there are some geeks out there that
agreed with me and they discovered how
to make these cameras reusable using
some custom made software some tools
they've programmed and USB here's your
list of supplies you're going to need a
USB female b connector soldering iron
solder a multimeter a dremel and some
hot glue okay before you take anything
apart what you're going to have to do is
find out what firmware version your
cameras running you do this by holding
down the shutter button in the Display
button at the same time and then hitting
the on button it will come up on the LCD
what firmware version you're using ours
was using 6550 and that's what all this
is based off of if you're running 6520
you're lucky because that's a lot easier
okay now they know what the firmware is
you can go ahead and disassemble the
camera there's three screws in the back
and a bunch of locking tabs all around
it now take all the screws out and when
you're popping the lock tabs be careful
you need to save them try not to break
them as much as possible once you open
it up you'll see the board in front of
you with the LCD and on the left hand
side you'll see the proprietary
connection that CBS uses and we're going
to be soldering leads on to that that
lead to our USB connector okay we'll
have a picture in the show notes telling
you where pin 1 is on this proprietary
connector and we're going to be using
pins 6 7 8 and 9 pin 6 is your positive
5 volt USB pen seven is the USB ground
pin 8 is your USB positive data and pin
9 is USB negative data okay first of all
now that you have it open
find a place that's going to be
convenient for you to mount the USB
female connector then from there you
just follow the pinout diagram on the
connector and solder accordingly to
those proprietary pins okay now that you
have all your connections made and your
plug is mounted just figure out where
it's going to be on the case draw a
little marker on it use your Dremel and
cut out a hole so that way it's nice and
tucked away it doesn't look bad and
you've got easy access from there go
ahead and take the board mount it back
to one half of the cover so you still
have access to the back panel snug it up
because now we're going to move on to
software and we still need access to
that board okay so now we can go ahead
and start gathering all our tools
software tools that we're going to need
to do this first off is going to be the
PV to tool 2.13 the lib USB win32 filter
bin ODOT 180 and the live USB win32 bin
odot 180 from here we can go ahead and
install the lib USB device bins and the
filter bint now once they're installed
gain access to the lib USB INF file and
you have to add strings for 27 28 to be
2f and 30 we'll have the full string
line in the show notes for you now we
can go ahead and run the pv to tool and
you just plug the USB cable in to the
connection you made and your computer
now with that board exposed please be
careful and avoid the flash capacitor
that's 200 to 300 volts it's going to
zap you hard now with PV to tool running
and the USB cable connected between the
camera and the computer go ahead and
click open and pv2 tool hopefully you'll
see PID 27 if you're using the CVS red
camera find the ram module behind the
LCD starting on the bottom pin count up
to the sixth one take the probe from
your multimeter bridge pins six and
seven well while they're still bridged
unplug the USB cable wait a few seconds
plug it back in hopefully you'll hear to
death beeps are very distinct you'll
you'll know what they are if you did
great we can move on if you didn't just
lather rinse repeat until you do at this
point I'm assuming that you've heard the
to death beeps go ahead and on bridge
six and seven on the
click open in the pv two tools and then
find your sdram key scan what that's
going to do is scan the keys in the
firmware and pull them down then click
unlock this is going to unlock the
camera so that in future uses we don't
have to go through this process every
time okay at this point we can't take
you any farther we have this crazy
little thing in America called the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act which
forbids this but the software will walk
you through it you're like ninety-nine
percent of the way there now so don't
don't fret we'll have links in the show
notes that will take you to all the
pertinent information that's hopefully
not on American servers but there you go
that's how you hack the red CBS camera
all your pertinent information links in
the show notes thanks a lot okay next up
is our viewer questions and first off we
have Jay and he's asking us about a
batch files more specifically for
defragging and he wants to know if he
can run a batch file to defrag on
multiple disks at the same time or do
you need to set up a batch file for each
individual days do you don't actually
have to set up a batch file for each
individual disk but I would really not
recommend defragging multiple disks at
the same time especially not if they're
partitions on the same disk that's just
really really system intensive I
wouldn't do it it's just not amazing
it's hard on the disc itself truly so
what you really just need to do is take
the code that we shared last month and
just add at the end of the batch file
that you've scheduled with the I commend
to you know miss defrag c drive whatever
you just me drive you d dr e drive etc
and then as the batch file progresses
and defects as individual drive so go on
to the next one right pretty simple okay
so you can just kind of a pen yeah all
right now Scott writes I'm running
multiple monitors and every time I open
up Firefox it's appearing in my second
screen I want it to appear in my primary
monitor is there a way to force it to do
so yeah
okay that's actually kind of like a I
don't know if it's a feature or a bug
Microsoft calls mall the same thing the
easter egg sure yeah well uh which bill
made famous and with the antilog on of
course that's what he was talking about
her and basically what you need to do is
just drag your firefox over to the
screen or the position or really
anywhere that you want it to open every
time you click the firefox icon and hold
down the ctrl key and click the X in the
top right to close it and every time you
open it ever ever since then it will
always open in the same location a
matter what yeah holding down control
and hitting X says hey windows next time
open this application put a ray here Wow
yeah two useful tip it is it's you know
that's the way it works so up next is
Lazar f I believe as I Peninsula sure
it's like trying to pronounce my classes
last name Michael is hazard Lazaro but
left it that's a tota I can't remember
like anyway side of the point another
bad script question um this particular
guy wants to know if he can set up a
batch script to kill a process at a
certain time he's got band with each
issues where you know he's got like pink
bandwidth and off time bandwidth like
the Australians yeah it's like a cell
phone kind of thing and his torrents are
killing him okay so he's like running
his torrance at night but at a certain
time he needs to close those torrents so
that he's not killing his you know on
peak usage ban you exactly okay well we
covered this in episode 2 and the really
the easiest way to do that command line
is to just kill the process you can do
that a couple of ways the easiest way is
when would the with windows XP is using
the command taskkill you can find more
information about the task killer
command they dress the bottom of screen
and that's very similar to a program
that we used in episode 2 which is
called PS kill it's from sysinternals
find that at sysinternals calm it's a
great little utility you can schedule
both of those using the add command
which we've covered before and that will
allow you to you know run a specific
batch file at a certain time
if you create a file that has you know
the command task killer PS kill the
process ID or the file name right it
will kill whatever torrent client you're
using whether it be as wrist or ABC or
you Lord or even the bit torn official
client right so that'll close your
torrents and that'll get that done be
you know it's just schedule you can
actually use that reciprocal reciprocal
Lee where you can use it to shut it down
and then start the process again you can
just give you bright a batch file to
start it again but you're just opening
up the file name right so he can oh you
can always have it set up so his biz
BitTorrent run on the off peak and that
would be great for a lot of our
Australian viewers that have to deal
with those bandwidth issues and off
beacon on peak hours right so if any of
you have any questions please feel free
to send them our way that's questions at
hak5 org and you know will answer you
the best we can and if it's a really
really good question that we think
should be shared with others we'll go
over it on the show great now coming up
next I'm going to be taking a look at
ways to secure your VNC connections
using SSH but before then I think we're
going to take a commercial break word
from our sponsors I was editing this
online TV show on an AMD based PC it
wasn't slow like those dull Intel
machines but then when I saw the new g5
Macintosh with the PowerPC chip I just
knew I had to have it so I started using
Final Cut Pro and it just screamed with
that PowerPC chip I like this dull
Intel's then I heard about that new
Macintosh four to five times faster I
was doing this big video job and I had
like this crazy
endline so I ran out and got one as soon
as I could it's like fast like really
really fast okay so I can't run a final
cut pro now we've got I movie and then I
site well Scrolls like butter my name is
Darren kitchen and I'm a video producer
sorta so last month's trivia question
was in 1904 the Koch curve one of the
earliest fractal curbs appeared in what
paper that was correctly answered by
Beamer who wrote it appeared in a 1904
paper entitled sir and no no no not bad
i'll try by gotta try it's actually at
the bottom of the screen if you can
pronounce it that's awesome called the
hak5 hotline and let us know I think
it's swedish i'm not sure that number is
of course 206 338 hak5 this one's trivia
question though kicks back to episode
four point five four and a half four and
a half that's where I did the Steadicam
well yeah it was said again well while I
was setting up Darren was so kind as to
turn the camera on and record me singing
in a horrible horrible voice that I have
I'm always looking out for you man yeah
I appreciate what we want to know is
what song by what band was Wes singing
what he didn't know the camera was on
good stuff so we want song title and
band name of course you can always send
those to the email address at trivia
ad-hoc five dot org and so let's just go
ahead and move on with the whole show
thing that we do right it's wes his
fault he made me drink so recently we've
been talking a lot about B and C getting
remote access to computers uh Darren's
done network install VNC on one of his
computers and then Harrison showed us
how to take access a BNC session using a
metasploit and we've also shown how
insecurities with simple tools like Cain
and Abel and ethereal but
talking to Dan we've he's told me about
a way to secure it he's an SSH and
tunneling right now VNC is inherently
insecure okay it does encrypt the
password but it's not very strong
encryption it can be easily cracked with
tools such as can enable like said so
what I'm going to do is use SSH and
tunneling to secure that traffic so I
explain these things B and C okay so
agent tunnel enemy now if you're just
tuning in you haven't seen the previous
segments on VNC BMC is a remote desktop
application it's a piece of software
they install on a computer that you want
to remotely connect to and then using
client software you can connect to it
and it will allow you to see the display
and interact with it with a mouse and
keyboard it's almost like being at the
computer it but remotely now SSH is a
way to secure securely communicate with
the server it's normally used to get
like shell access though like getting
das on a Windows machine or bash with
Linux or something like that exactly all
right right but one of the cool things
that ssh offers is tunneling and what
that allows us to do is take any normal
TCP traffic and tunnel that through an
ssh connection it actually encapsulates
those packets with encryption so that
they're secure okay so what do we need
to do to prepare our network for this
right okay now if you want to connect to
your machine over like your cable or DSL
internet connection the first thing
you're going to want to do is actually
port forward port 22 on your router so
that's as simple as logging into your
router and setting up port forwarding
the second thing you need to do is make
sure that on the server the machine that
you want to remotely connect to you open
up port 22 on the firewall okay um
commands for that sure now in this
example we're using the windows service
pack 2 firewall and that command to open
port 22 would be net SH firewall add
port opening TCP 22 SSH just enter in
that in the command prompt and that'll
open that poured up for okay next thing
we need to do is set up the actual ssh
server sorry I'm going to remotely
connect to my machine that has the ssh
server using VNC so again a little ahead
but i want to show something right here
and that is I'm running Cain and Abel
and I'm going to show how Cain and Abel
will just sniff up that packet and show
us his password so we've turned on our
sniffer and VNC or in Cain and Abel
we're going to open up VNC and as you
can see i'm connecting to 192 168 1 dot
139 the lan IP address of the machine
the other room but we're going to
connect to so we'll enter an that enter
in our password and here we are we're on
my machine and the hak5 chat room well
let's take a look at the ssh software
what i'm using it servers them yeah
there's various SSH servers you can run
one of them that's very popular is
called openssh and that will run on mac
on linux on Windows I since this is a
windows machine like this package called
free sshd because it's lightweight its
windows native and it just gets the job
done really easily ok but there's still
plenty out there that go there you can
plenty yes so we've already installed
the free sshd server and it's a really
basic installation in information on the
look the all the nitty gritties and the
show nuts for that so we'll open it up
here and as you can see the ssh server
is running what we had to do here is add
users so we go over to users tab and
would click Add we'd enter in a name and
in this case for authorization we'd want
to store the password in the sha-1 hash
we'll give it a password and normally
would give it a more secure password but
for time I'll go ahead and apply that as
you can see in what are all these
different settings yeah sure well these
checkboxes say that it's getting this
user has access to the shell in this
case CMD SFTP which is just like FTP but
it's secure and you'd use an SFTP client
nice and tunneling and that's what's
important so we'll apply that and then
we'll save and hide this that's all
there is to it on using ssh side now for
the VNC we're going to set up a VNC
server and we've touched on this last
episode there's several different
flavors of VNC my favorite is actually
tight VNC and that's the one that I'm
using right now you can also use real
VNC ultra VNC and many others so we'll
go ahead and open up the VNC properties
right here and
in tight VNC there's button advanced and
this is just the most important thing
after you set up the VNC server but we
want to check this box says allow
loopback connections so why is that
important well what this is is it's
allowing you to connect to the loop back
and there's a loop back on every
computer and what that is is your
localhost or IP address 1270 20 at one
and what we have to do is tell VNC to
let us connect to our machine from our
machine by default it won't let you do
that because why would you connect to
your machine from your machine and that
make us in this case since we're using
SSH we're connecting to that machine and
we're going to tell it we want to
connect to ourselves it's just going to
you know bring it to the other machine
so we just check that and hit OK now if
you're using another distribution such
as realvnc there's actually it's not as
simple you have to go into the registry
and there is a D word value that you
have to add and that's in the show notes
all right so we'll hit OK on that and
we're going to sign off of this VNC
session that was the VNC session that
was just done yeah it was yeah not plain
text but easily cracked so as we can see
here in Cain and Abel we actually have
the hash right here so all we have to do
is right click on this and say send a
cracker we go over to the cracker and
there's our VNC cash we right click on
that and I'm going to do a brute force
attack and click start and should take
just a moment there we go and there it
is so click exit and here we go password
on a fact 5 yeah so now let's do this
again keeping the sniffer running this
time using SSH alright so the next step
is on the client side we need an ssh
client and there's various ssh clients a
particular one that i enjoy is called
putty but because it's really
lightweight its windows native it gets
the job done so we're going to open up
this and we need to specify two things
first is the hostname and in this point
since we're already on the land it would
be the lan IP address of the other
computer if we were doing this over the
internet would be the public IP address
of a router and since we port forwarded
port 22 it'll allow us connect to that
machine ok where you've got a dime DNS
you could use that
so in this case it's 192 168 1 dot 139
and then we'll head over to tunnels down
here what we need to do is for the
source port add fifty nine hundred and
the destination port 127 001 colon 5900
we click add and then open now it's
connected to the machine and it said
well what it's saying here is that we
haven't connected to this machine before
or the key fingerprint of that ssh
server isn't in our registry and we
haven't cashed it okay it's going to ask
us do we trust this machine I know
that's my machine so I'm going to trust
it i'm going to click yes and it won't
ask me subsequent that's on your
computer now and we'll just go back to
that so now we just need to login with
the credentials that we've set up in the
free sshd server so in this case
usernames or bowlful entering my
password and there we go it I've got
shell access but I don't I don't
technically need shell access I want to
interact with you yeah I want to
interact with some of my programs on my
computer that don't have shell commands
so we'll go ahead and open up tight VNC
and remember we port mapped 5902 1270
2021 so we'll open up that localhost and
VNC viewer give it the password and
there we go and we're in the chat hello
guys so let's minimize this and head
back to khane enable it and look it
hasn't seen it that's just the hash last
time we have a new new flow that's the
cracker hang on the head of a sniffer
passwords nope we still only have one
hash from when we did it previously in
and this is really just fundamentals
that will work with any kind of protocol
now there's a various SSH servers
there's various ssh client and you can
do more than just VNC encapsulation you
can just about anything you could
encapsulate with the ssh and secure for
example few episodes ago we talked about
streaming music and my favorite way to
do that was / apache and i was running
an apache server with port 8080 i could
just add port 8080 map it to the same
exact thing and my mp3s would be secure
like I mean it's going to add some
overhead though because it's got to add
the encapsulation and the extra headers
so it's not really great for streaming
it's not like a good trying to play game
through it or something I wouldn't even
bother no but it is great for stuff like
B and C or any other server interaction
type stuff thanks Derek no problem um
bring up a detailed article yeah i've
got all the info you need to do to set
up the servers and the clients all the
nitty-gritty details are in the show
notes awesome so they'll be on the hak5
website in the forms exactly awesome and
if you like to leave any feedback or
have any questions please feel free to
post them on forms we're going to go
ahead and do something a little
different this episode and take a look
at some of the viewer submitted content
that we've been receiving and it's
actually been really really good stuff
and we've happened to pick out our two
personal favorites out of the group
definitely my favorite of course being
war hopping I mean we all know what war
driving is we're driving more shocking
more flattening yeah if you've got a
pogo stick and a Wi-Fi card it could be
war up into but this guy took it to an
extreme level this was crazy so let's go
ahead and take a look at that as you can
see looks like a I pack or some sort of
pocket pc uh-huh with a wireless card in
it oh and there he goes there goes yeah
that looks like a very happy bunny
doesn't it actually seems to see some
kind of like netstumbler or something
running on could be mini Stumbler yeah
and it's booked in I mean if you had a
like a whole massive heard of bunnies he
like sent them all over the neighborhood
they'd come back there's some GPS on it
that'd be awesome you'd have to because
you couldn't find shit well that's true
maybe they'd have to have I guess Wi-Fi
GPS and some sort of a like a cdma modem
so that it could actually send the
information I do a little dog tag no
doctor if found please send this war
hopper back to all right the war hopping
was pretty cool and that was thanks to a
fox yeah alright well my personal
favorite out of the group was halo 2
hacked yeah this is by Chuck and John
and they're from console athletics calm
and this is from well let's just roll
the video and then I'll explain it yeah
this is so cool if you're it you know
we're watching this right now and if you
look in one frame we've got on the
bottom right is in at the actual like
plane which was planing helical I don't
remember but basically the Warthog
that's the well I'm saying bye see ya
you can see it like that's the normal
plane or the other with the Warthog yeah
now you've got these warthogs doing the
same maneuvers it's like acrobatics yeah
well they explained that basically what
they did was they use this program
called Adi and it lets you make ed edit
it lets you edit the metadata and change
the values edit the metadata edit the
metadata something like that elicit
change the values and you can like
inject your own stuff it's very similar
to I don't know if you remember back in
the days of doom 2 there's a program
called D hacked where you could mess
with all the variables and all of a
sudden you could turn the bfg into the
plasma rifle really shoot like a
thousand you know bullets a second or
whatever Wow yeah that was some crazy
stuff so it lets you change the values
and you know inject them back into the
map folder ok of course this only runs
