thousand plus pages of CIA documents all
that coming up now on threat wire
screenings I am Shannon Morrison this is
threat wire for March 14 2017 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom first off
as special thanks to our patrons for
supporting the show every single month
if you want access to extras hit up
patreon.com slash threat wire for more
information this week is going to be a
little different than our usual show
instead of reporting on three to four
stories like we usually do I'm going to
be reporting on just one and it's the
vault seven WikiLeaks CIA leak this is a
huge story and rightfully so it's very
similar to the coverage that the public
read about during Snowden's NSA leaks a
few years ago which just so happened to
happen just a bit after we started doing
throat wire and it could have similar
implications to when it comes to
security and privacy and has already
surpassed the amount of documentation
released by Snowden according to
WikiLeaks this is the largest
publication of confidential CIA
documents ever and it's from a
high-security CIA network in Langley
Virginia
now while Snowden's documents covered
NSA's surveillance of a wide audience
the CIA documents pertain to development
of said tools but do not disclose any
proof of real life hacks keep that in
mind so onto the story on Tuesday March
7th WikiLeaks published several
different documents in an ongoing series
that they dubbed the vault seven from
the Central Intelligence Agency in the
u.s. they are starting with over 8,000
documents codenamed year zero with more
to come according to WikiLeaks press
release Year Zero documents describes
several hacking tools that the CIA uses
along with interception of samsung TV
microphones and weaponized exploits on
popular brands of smartphones operating
systems including Android iOS and of
course you have windows in there too the
documents are all dated between 2013 and
2016 so there's a three year wide gap in
there according to WikiLeaks the CIA
tools are built by engineering
development group which is
EDG for short within the Center for
cyber intelligence which is CCI which is
a department in the CIA tools built by
EDG include weeping angel iOS zero days
as well as Android zero days which are
used worldwide for surveillance included
in the PR analysis is a quote from
WikiLeaks quote these techniques permit
the CIA to bypass the encryption of
whatsapp signal telegram Weibo confide
and cloak man by hacking the smartphones
that they run on and collecting audio
and message traffic before encryption is
applied this quote spurred a heated
debate on Twitter between InfoSec
professionals and the media due to
misinformation about secure messaging
protocols being bypassed since the point
of these apps is to encrypt
telecommunications through the transfer
between two contacts which is why it's
called into end encryption it wouldn't
take a rocket scientist to figure out
that the CIA could invariably hack your
phone and steal data just by looking at
the screen before the app itself begins
the process of encryption and
transmission this does not mean that you
should not be using a secure messaging
protocol it just means that you should
use due diligence whenever downloading
things onto your phone not use public
networks and I don't know for example
don't give your phone to the CIA for
starters the docs do include large lists
of Android and iOS exploits used to gain
route or system privileges on a target
device along with what devices the
exploits work on one previously
mentioned in this episode was called
weeping angel which personally I love
because I'm a Doctor Who fan which is an
excellent used against Smart TVs to turn
on the microphone and record audio
without a user noticing to work malware
must be installed on the TV and the
documents mentioned via USB but it is
kind of unclear if that would work
remotely as well or if it's just
installed via USB so somebody would have
to like physically come in and do it the
malware would make the TV go into a fake
off mode which turns off LEDs and the
screen making the user think the TV is
off while in this mode the TV's
microphone would turn on and record
audio since the development notes still
have a to do future work section it's
also unclear if this has ever actually
been used in the wild or even sin
the analysis also discloses the CIA's
hoarding of vulnerabilities in which
they secretly keep donor abilities to
themselves and never tell the brand
which are affected this can keep the
public at risk of infection by anyone
else who might just so happen to find
the same vulnerability by not telling
the tech company involved be it Apple
Google Microsoft or whoever it might be
they can't fix it and if other state
sponsored hackers have found these same
vulnerabilities and have been taking
advantage of them against anyone then
that would have been an extremely
negative aspect of keeping these bones
secret WikiLeaks continues with
information pertaining to a covert
operational base at the Frankfort US
consulate for the CIA where hackers are
able to travel freely to 25 different
countries from and they describe the
CIA's ability to evade many consumer
antivirus tools many of which are
extremely popular an entire section is
dedicated to personal security products
and how to get around their detection
the CIA has documents about Avira AVG
Komodo and BitDefender just to name a
few
another section is for evaluating USB
penetration testing tools such as bad
USB and the USB rubber ducky which I may
have heard of before it seems as if the
CIA is attempting to create their own
USB exploits by taking code and hardware
components of current devices and
rebuilding them for their specific use
case scenario surprisingly all of this
information from the CIA is unclassified
so CIA officers can't be prosecuted for
publicizing the docs online and folks
can pirate it as much as they want for
free none of the documents include code
for actually implementing malware or
scripts for actual hacks so it seems
like most of the data is
conversationalist in essence and it
reads like a dictionary of terms for
most of it the CIA uses for their
hacking tools while reading through some
of the documents my mind wasn't
necessarily blown away by much of
anything that was released we have seen
malware several times in the past for
Android a few for iOS and tons for
Windows we have known about USB hacks
and we even built one ourselves and of
course Internet of Things devices are a
convenience over security choice that
consumer
make and if there's a microphone on a
smart TV it could potentially be used
for evil but all these tools that the
CIA has been using they seem to be
targeting specific actors not used for
widespread public surveillance such as
the NSA Doc's showed us of course you
should use any means necessary and
available to you to protect your own
data and privacy but are you being
targeted by the CIA most likely not
currently it's unclear who's released
the documents the WikiLeaks says it
could have been a hacker or a government
contractor we don't know for sure if it
was an operative inside the CIA or
somebody who gained access from outside
the secure network in a quick news
release from Reuters law enforcement and
US intelligence officials stated the CIA
has been aware of a breach since late
last year and they are focusing on
contractors as the likeliest source two
days after the release Julian Assange
who is the editor in chief and creator
of WikiLeaks gave a public statement via
the WikiLeaks Facebook page he chose to
proceed by working with manufacturers by
giving them exclusive access to the
technical details that WikiLeaks has
regarding the CIA zero-day exploits so
that manufacturers can fix any
vulnerabilities that are still out there
in responses to CNET Google Microsoft
and Apple all stated that their newest
versions of software fixed any kind of
security vulnerabilities that were
disclosed in the vault 7 leaked the CIA
ended up making a public statement via
their website as well about the
WikiLeaks vault seven documents saying
quote we have no comments on the
authenticity of purported intelligence
documents released by WikiLeaks or on
the status of any investigation into the
source of the documents however there
are several critical points we would
like to make and they go on the American
public should be deeply troubled by any
WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage
the intelligence community's ability to
protect America against terrorists in
other adversaries such disclosures not
only jeopardize US personnel and
operations but also equip our
adversaries with tools and information
to do us harm the full quote is
available in the show notes beneath this
episode on a positive note though some
of the agency
boys are definitely human beings they
use means to troll each other just like
we do to our friends on Twitter and
Facebook and they use Pokemon names for
some of their code names which isn't
super creative but is definitely cute so
is this whole story good or bad well
first off we don't have confirmation if
it's true just WikiLeaks word to go by
but 8,000 Plus documents I mean that
would be a really big amount for anybody
to falsify let alone take the time and
money to do it especially when some
products have already been proven as
real tools so while good and bad is a
very relative term it does create a
conversation of meaning does leaking
information from governments create
dangerous situations or does it further
the security of the masses or both
should government's be allowed to do
tool development like this in secret or
should vulnerabilities be disclosed I
would like to know your thoughts on that
in the comments below and we will
continue to follow this story as more
documents are released oh okay I realize
that was a lot of information to get
through but I tried to cover as much as
I could under like seven minutes before
