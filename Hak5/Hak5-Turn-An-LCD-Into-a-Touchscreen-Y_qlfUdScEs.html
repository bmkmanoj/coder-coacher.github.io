or the Panasonic I remember when all
gets home where you're shooting is I'm
not shooting on Saturday what we've done
it before you're not shooting this
Saturday why can't we do it this weekend
I had a long day because I think this
 that I have stuff to do I thought
no motors I go around God's green earth
come on it's gonna be cold
you're not gonna drive anywhere well all
I'm saying and a little help would be
nice because we do have to shoot the
desktop virtualization stuff and then
Jason Applebaum is coming down we're
going to do a touch screen LCD mod
in this episode of hack father brought
to you by goto assist express brutal
legend available R October 13th and
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain
good supposed to be polo oh yeah that's
the winning 2219 crap my thing is Wow oh
oh I'm saying funny on that where are
you Oh what
guys we really do need to shoot what do
you shoot I'm trying to shoot
Paul but Paul would shoot right
battle through a world of heavy metal'
brutal legend is a new epic action video
game from EA and legendary game designer
Tim Schafer's Double Fine productions
featuring the voice of Jack Black is
legendary rock and roll roadie Eddy
Riggs brutal legend is now available
from brutal legend com for exclusive
brutal legend footage from revision3
shows go to revision three.com slash
brutal legend
honestly I thought converting an LCD
into a touchscreen was going to be a big
expensive ordeal and to prove me wrong
Jason Applebaum a good friend coming
down to show me up yeah absolutely it's
actually really easy to do you've done
this before - with you yeah because they
actually have a small keyboard my big
hands just kind of you know fumble
around a keyboard so I thought it'd be
really nice to have a stylus for my
finger to be able to navigate right and
I gotta say the purpose for this project
was perfect we are video mixing system
involving a Mac Pro and lots of HDMI and
stuff like that requires us to use a 19
inch specifically for the resolution
monitor inside of this this video mixing
box here for Paul and the software that
were using would be so much easier Paul
could just touch the camera I mean
instead of that little touchpad Mouse
thing yeah so so I'm glad that this
worked out what did what kind of parts
what do we have to use to make this work
so all you're going to need is the
actual touch panel and they usually come
with controllers but if they don't come
with controllers it's pretty easy to get
one and you just have to match up this
one is a four wire resistive touch
display they actually go straight into
USB you're right in this we just pick
this up from you know one of the eBay
vendors came from Hong Kong - cool took
forever but what a hundred dollars in
$90 something like that they don't
aren't that expensive and the smaller
you go the less money they are this is a
19 you've seen them as big as 22
hopefully bigger and I've seen them as
big as 32 but that kind of blows the you
know the budget right out of the price
ring right but I mean for 22 at 150
bucks or even a 1.5 inch for 15 was like
$15 $20 kind of gives you an idea of the
range of what you would spend if this
the project that you you know might want
to tackle now if somebody wants to
tackle a project like this will this
work on any monitor for the most part as
long as you have a flat surface to apply
the the touch glass to it should work
just fine so maybe not so much with your
old 15-inch CRT with the bubble screen
yeah with it with the concave you just
the you'd be putting it on and you touch
any bending okay so will show me this
particular display and why this was well
suited for this project
well this displays really easy because
it's a achieve display very cheap
display B it comes apart really easy the
battle will just pops right off so it's
kind of scary
sticking a screwdriver the back it makes
some cracking noise and it just really
pops off the one thing to keep in mind
is you want to remove the the foot first
okay from the back it's just these
usually these four screws and the foot
comes right off and then sometimes
there's one or two screws holding the
bezel on okay but once you've got the
front bezel off what do you do with the
LCD
well the LCD is self-contained inside of
its own little metal casing so it's
actually fairly housed fairly housed
fairly safely so usually their screws
usually their screws here and here that
will allow you to just pull it straight
out on the other side as well what
you're trying to do is gain access to
the back or because you actually have to
take the LCD out of the housing yeah you
gotta take another complete housing
you're trying to put the the controller
board it's a little controller board
it's about that big and you got it's
just like the size of like a gum sticks
it's exactly the size of a dime stick so
what it does is it takes four wires in
or four five six or eight wires and
depending on what type of touchscreen
you get and it converts it over to USB
so we just have USB coming right out of
here and you just pop another hole where
the DVI would go yeah so all I did took
some
exacto knife cut a little hole and fed
the wire through to hookup I tied a knot
on the end of the hole so it's not gonna
yank out excellent I guess if we were to
do this if this wasn't for special a
specialized project we might even just
put like a little USB extension yeah
just something to disconnect or you can
even mount a jack with some hot glue
nice
now what about putting it all back
together I'm assuming that we have to
pay special attention to how we merge
these two pieces so the first thing you
don't want to do once you get your your
controller board attached to the back
somewhere is you're going to want to
make sure it sits flat into the bezel so
once it sits flat into the the back part
of the bezel or achieving the back part
of the housing you're gonna want to go
ahead and clean your the surface because
once you clean it with a microfiber not
not Windex and nothing abrazos yeah
so once that's clean you're gonna go on
and lay your glass and line it up along
the edge here you can actually see the
difference between the
just a flat glass and where the touch
area begins okay you're gonna want to
line it up pretty much equidistant all
the way around then you pretty much want
to keep it down along the bit along the
rim you're going to want to tape it so
it's not moving and shifting while
you're putting this thing back together
okay
an important thing to remember is when
you go to put your plastic on after
you've got it all taped down you got to
put your classic on don't push too hard
it's not gonna fit back the way it was
because you don't want to crack the
glass right now this doesn't look ghetto
but I do notice you know we've got
electric tape and I noticed that you
were having some fun with the hot glue
gun before yeah so what I did in order
to prevent having a rattle II bezel
because it's not really on there it's
just kind of sitting on there one or two
of the clips are in I filled the gap
with hot glue and then ran all the way
around with electrical tape so the place
is like on the sides where it didn't fit
and there really wasn't a gap it was
more of a distance from where it should
be been sitting I just went ahead and
ran around with game okay now is this
going to work for my mac or my PC for
what the the company that we ordered
this from gave us a touch screen that
they've actually got drivers from Mac
Linux PC and they even had 32 and 64-bit
versions of for Linux excellent and
they're constantly these being updated
or we're gonna be stuck with like OS 9
there is uh
there's already Snow Leopard drivers and
Windows 7 drivers way to go alright so
even though it came from eBay from Hong
Kong it's actually not a piece of crap
no not at all alright well now how does
it exactly work because software-wise
does this just show up as human
interface device like does it emulate a
mouse for the most part okay what you're
going to need more than more so than
drivers is you're going to need a
calibration software so that basically
what you can do is come in here and say
okay this part of the screen is the top
the top left and then this is the top
right bottom bottom right bottom left so
that it's not going oh I'm touching here
where are you actually touching right
because when you get this thing first
hooked up and and when you do first hook
this up because you're going to want to
test it to make sure you've got the
right side of the surface you're going
to notice that if you touch here it's
gonna make your mouse fly off somewhere
else that's a big things calibration and
there's use
for point and a 28 point or 25 point
calibration let I never had to do that
in my pocket pc of my hands burn guys
are sitting there forever okay one
little bit too little right now if you
were gonna do this again or there any
lessons learn after doing a couple of
these panels how you would do this
differently the the big thing to keep in
mind is where your cables coming out of
and where they're gonna sit inside the
back because if you look in the back of
this one there's not that much room in
here
so make a wedge the board exactly
considering fact that there's room here
in room here but in this top area it's
really not that thick so I got I had to
reposition that board a couple times now
what kind of touchscreen technology is
its using am i going to be able to do
the you know the Apple multi-touch you
know multi-touch this is a resistive
single touch so it only responds to to
one point at a time the the
and it does work with the stylus because
this is resistive okay and as opposed to
capacitive capacitive requires you being
the other point so instead of taking two
layers and smashing them together to get
your to get you can point you're taking
one layer and your finger and smashing
it through a membrane and there and
there's your point that's why the iPhone
doesn't work with a stylus or with
gloves for that all right with gloves
ya know how does that technology
actually work like like how does it know
where your you know your finger ends up
so in K in this case there's two
positives and two negatives and it's
actually getting the voltage difference
so by pushing here you'll get a
different voltage on one lead than the
other and that will give you your X and
your Y okay so if I'm person up here I
might get you know one volt and nope you
know down here might get a half but
whatnot and it between the X and the y
kind of just figures it out and that's
what the calibrations for exactly it's
so you can know where where is where
excellent well I'm excited to be putting
this into our video mixing console I
know Paul's excited that he doesn't have
to be using a little thing a little tiny
touchpad anymore so thank you so much
for coming down I'm actually anytime to
having you down more often now because I
hear you're in the area yep
just move just outside of DC excellent
so instead of 10 hours - if I - in
change yeah anybody that lives around
the Beltway knows what we mean about
excellent well thank you so much for
coming by where can people find more of
your exploits yeah just check me out
Jason Applebaum comm work follow me on
Twitter twitter.com slash Jason al Kalam
excellent and for more information about

are you doing it's a free spot diet
that's ridiculous no no it's a real
thing I didn't watch a research so it
turns out you can lose a lot of weight
on this you can eat anything you want as
long as it's a praise topic guaranteed
to lose weight so I kind of figured out
how to edit Wikipedia it's a stupidest
thing I've ever heard
actually it's the best idea ever and I'm
gonna share with the world by
registering fries pop diet com
no I'm gonna rinse for free stop diet
come first and put a picture of a goat
cuz you're moron too late I just got it
how I use domain.com it's domain
registration without all the BS rooftop
pool with coms for less than 10 bucks
without pushy upselling reseller
dedicated servers with cPanel and killer
VPS hosting with root access
domain.com is the place to go next time
you're looking to start a website or
build your new massively multi skilled
side business best of all they're
offering hak5 fans sweet deals on domain
names private registration and web
hosting just go to domain.com and use
coupon code hak5 that's hak5 at checkout
to get 15% off your order got a great
idea it all starts with a great domain
domain.com so I'm doing development from
the next VPN segment I had well virtual
machines virtual box yeah dude
VirtualBox sounds really yeah just like
I'm gonna own you as soon as I figure
out these controls let you put down the
controller banks up now is reading the
VirtualBox forums after you went on your
little spiel on Twitter about it and
realized how many people actually have
problems with that software it's kind of
amazing when
you go to a mile minor incremental
upgrade and are you kidding me this race
thing about dude every time I exam your
stuff that's supposed to be working on
oh that's the beautiful thing everything
works and then I open up VirtualBox is
like hey the new 3.0 point by 8 point
something is out and I'm like sweet and
I go download it and you know what they
add features like 3d graphics just came
out and break more no nothing break
anything for me for you I got comp is
working I could probably play like Duke
Nukem 3d if I really cared I'm saying is
I have always used workstation and the
nice thing about workstation is there's
a direct upgrade path to an
enterprise-level product so most more
recently we actually took a workstation
at appliance and converted it to an ESX
appliance and you could do the same
thing on VirtualBox no really yeah you
can come and it'll do your standard
which ones changed weapon
why you can basically you know do what
is it called a virtual appliance things
it works with all those standard formats
and if you really wanted to you could I
guess install VMware converter on one of
your VirtualBox machines to convert it
to that ESX if you really want to do ok
which version of DirectX is I don't
remember I'm not sure 9.0 yeah but how
much the work session costs I mean you
want to get the VMware stuff you get
Player for free whoo I can play VMs I
can't create new VMs dude this the
action version what's full feature you
can create games and play around why am
I stuck under this you can create the
now again one Beckham on last week or so
you know boxes got what's that an open
source sdk so if you want to extend on
it if you you know BAM right there
you know DM work out what enterprise
level support dude you can get the same
thing from Sun you just call your son
representative says right wait is that
Oracle now oh I can't remember they've
changed name so many times it's hard for
me to track I'm sorry
it really is development teams names you
know the people that make that awesome
software that Jason loves Java yeah well
dude check this out the best thing in
the world I can RDP into a Linux box
with it why would you want to because
RDP is pretty much universal there's an
RDP client for just about everything but
your windows your iPhone has one can't
you show why would you do shell when you
can get a full-featured
RDP and get USB / RDP how do you use the
rocket launcher right thumbstick alright
but i'm that just looks so my question
to you is why you're gonna actually run
an application which have so much more
overhead machine well it doesn't do -
are you kidding it's like way faster
than a workstation like seriously I'm
running this on my quad core right now I
got eight gigs of RAM had 30 no I had 12
vm's open a barely touching my system it
was awesome and it's got that like you
know the integration thing we you're in
Windows and you got your start bar at
the bottom but then you can also have
like the Ubuntu bar at the top like
integrated whatever let's go unity yeah
it's got that it's awesome to be a more
started desert yeah well VMware cost too
much really yeah because last time I
checked you can get VMware for half-off
okay so what half did they take off bad
app does then I might be interesting you
know what that whole corporate support
thing again yeah kind of comes into
based on me callsign oh yeah yeah cuz
they're gonna fix it right away
No well you know what we can both agree
on that lease is not QEMU well pair
prepare the original Power PC emulator
ed was so slow that it took like an hour
British system no no Michael not only 46
days okay well anyway all I know is for
me when I deploy virtualization
solutions like to my clients dude I want
the customers you know what I want a
mouse and a keyboard really what
happened a quick - yeah look you know
what
let's play some quake - you love you
want to give it some quick to live no
yes are you sure yes are you sure yes
I'm sure it's like the broken piggy yeah

oh the camera is crooked that's fine
it's alright alright well we'll say
ready crimp well that just about wraps
up this episode of hack 5 and we promise
next week we might even make it to the
studio instead of playing Halo a game
that's two years old
and what if it is maybe figure out how
to use one of these controllers but
until then we're reminding you from your
tech know us why are we just looking up
and spinning because you're dumb
if zoomits I mean as long as you can
tell we're actually playing because
otherwise it looks like we just like
playing with their Wang's I don't want
people to get the wrong impression like
Matt neither this look to you Wittering
on the couch do you want to see Scott
right now let's start now you're rolling
right now yeah let's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
