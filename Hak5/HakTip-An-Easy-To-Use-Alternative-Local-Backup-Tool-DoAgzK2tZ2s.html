Squarespace welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and I team
ninjas I'm your host and Morrison today
I'm checking out easiest to do backup
utility my whole life is on my computer
and if I lost all of my photos to like a
dead hard drive or a PC milltown I'd be
at a complete loss you can pay loads of
loads of money for online storage and
cloud service backups but you can also
use tools to back up to your network a
server or another hard drive this one is
called easiest to do backup utility
found that to do backup calm this
program features backup scheduling full
system backup and recovery file and
folder selection and incremental backup
which is something that I really love as
it only backs up when the files have
been changed or added since the last
backup it is supported on all newer
versions of Windows including 64 bits
now you'll need to install this program
like normal and restart your computer
and after opening it for the first time
you'll be greeted with some options
there's backup recover schedule a backup
or clone under the backup tab at the top
you can create a disk or a partition
backup file backup or manage how backups
are processed that's right here in the
recover tab lets you recover files disks
or partitions under tools over here you
can check images of files make a
bootable USB use tools for your hard
drive like erasing and wiping data or
you can mount an image I'm going to go
ahead and start by backing up some files
so I'll choose backup and it's going to
be a file backup since this is a brand
new file backup I can only choose new
file backup I can't choose incremental
file backup so new backup and I'm going
to call this comic con fo
hose because they were awesome and I
don't want to lose them click Next now
since I don't have another computer hard
drive plugged into this computer I'm
just going to go ahead and back up this
folder into another folder and to do
that you need to backup mice choose my
selected file i'll choose comic-con day
one photos and she's a destination make
my destination my pictures you'll need
to create a new folder name and click
Next you can also choose if you want to
do it now later daily now all that jazz
and proceed announce the waiting game
wait for the backup to finish we ok once
it is all finished you can also go into
your recovery mode and click finish over
here go into recovery and you can choose
whether it's a file or a disk or a
partition that you need to recover all
you have to do is just click on the name
of it and it also tell you the time and
date in case you're curious about which
one you're choosing click Next click
Next again and choose where you want to
recover it to or choose your specified
files
under schedule back up i can choose a
folder choose it to back up
incrementally and i can choose what I
want it to happen you will need your
windows username and password to
schedule backups and if you need to
cancel a backup or delete a backup go to
the backup tab under backup management
and choose the weight back up Oh too
