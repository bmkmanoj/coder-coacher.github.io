paying for Wi-Fi at the airport can you
resolve DNS we had over to move X's
layer to learn about SSH tunneling over
DMS then stick around for our interview
with Tyler McAdams Linux DNA developer
and find out how this custom distro is
changing gaming on Linux all that and
more on this episode of hack 5
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by go daddy Netflix
Squarespace and viewers like you
hey everyone welcome to this episode of
hack 5 I know it's a little bit
different from your usual episodes but
keep in mind we do have awesome content
and next week we have been working on
this great project for you which I'm
sure you're going to love so make sure
you watch that episodes first off I did
want to thank our viewer lien who has
put together an entire torrent list of
all of our old episodes I know a lot of
viewers have been asking for that so we
finally got it for you right here first
I'm gonna kick it over to mu bik's at MU
byxis secretive lair but I also have to
thank our sponsor Netflix with Netflix
you can rent over 90,000 titles online
including lots of blu-ray titles with
free shipping both ways to your home
they now have over 40 shipping centers
so almost all deliveries happen in just
one business day
Netflix plans start at $4.99 and as a
new member you can get a no-risk two
weeks for each trial membership check it
out it netflix.com slash hak5 and please
don't forget the wwws let's shoot it off
over to mu bik's
so have you ever been at like an airport
or a coffee shop or somewhere where
they've got Wi-Fi but it's not free you
could try to go somewhere and it takes
you to this portal page or once you'd
like sign up or pay 15 bucks or some
crap like that and you want to get
online with one of these or one of these
well we're gonna show you how to tunnel
through DNS to get your traffic on and I
pass those pesky restrictions and figure
out how we've come down to move IX's
layer so move X what is this all about
oh it's it's real simple once you get
everything set up its point-and-click
one-liner so what you start off with is
checking at your hotspot or some other
places that we might talk about later
but back to that hotspot go on Google
comm banging them damn it I got a pay
hmm not quite so just to make sure this
all work we open up a command prompt or
shell and ping Google comes back with an
IP we're in nifty but what kind of
software are we going to need to put
this together so the great thing about
this is cross-platform and Linux Windows
Mac OS you can use it all as long as you
have SSH cool set of Perl scripts called
Ozzie man a domain and a little bit of
luck excellent I'm excited about putting
this together so let's go ahead and set
up our DNS first right all right so we
got to set up the server side first and
what the server side is is a actual name
server but it's telling DNS instead of
doing lookups or reverse lookups or
anything like that it's letting us
through our server at home from wherever
we are behind the hotspot and how we set
that up is we get a domain or a
subdomain of something we already have
or dime DNS I think has allows you to
set name servers up and then point it
towards wherever our servers running our
name server are telling servers working
and that's that's pretty much it so
we're going to show you how to do that
so we're here in GoDaddy comms domain
manager and for crack five org and you
can see that the name servers are set up
for NS 47 and then it's 48 of domain
controller
and all we have to do in here is really
just change the name service for so it's
pointing somewhere else
we do that by clicking nameservers going
to custom name servers and we're gonna
change the name servers to something we
already setup for our home IP address in
19's so it's music's owns my own DNS org
and the big my blog org they're set up
they both point to the same IP so it's
gonna work
hopefully and ok so we got our name
server set up and we have pearls set
with the correct modules and we'll have
those in the show notes there's just two
of them that you have to make it work
and we downloaded dan Kaminsky's ozzie
man
so Aussie man is great because that's
all you need to get it working it's just
Perl scripts so we're going to show you
how to set it up on the server side now
that you've set up your name servers and
port forwarded that Linksys so that 53
is coming on through alright so we've
downloaded Aussie man and we put it in
its own directory and we're just gonna
run it with we're gonna run the Nnamdi
Perl script that's our server we tell
the interface IP 0.0.0.0 that's for
everything should cover all bases and
then we put crack 5 org and that's it
you hit enter it's olicity on port 53
tcp and UDP and waiting for connections
so we're at the hot spot we connected
wirelessly you want us to pay $9.99 an
hour that's BS let's ping see if we can
get through our Dean DNS tunnel ping we
get an IP back no YC and P replies but
that's fine we're just looking for DNS
to work so then we we have our Perl
scripts already on our Linux box that we
have going because we run them in the
Linux right all right it works on
Windows too and all we have to do from
there is SSH SSH with a little bit of a
command our proxy command added on to it
so SSH attack D port we're gonna listen
on our socks proxy for taxi
o proxy
and this is the important part root or
sash and then you tell it where the the
D root Perl script is that's the other
one so there's the to scroll trip it's a
server one and the client one D routes
the client Nnamdi is the server and then
right here we're gonna do a subdomain of
our forwarded domain so we're going to
type ssh dns so that are the VNS so that
we have a sub domain of the domain we
set up crack 5 org and then you then you
tell what ssh server to connect to so
i'm going to connect to the one that i
have already have going because you have
to have a DNS server to connect to for
your SSH tunnel to work your dns Donald
org it works we're all set now we have a
proxy going alright so not only set up
our browser we go into edit preferences
go over to the Advanced tab on our
network under settings use manual proxy
go down to Sox we're going to say
127.0.0.1 port 8080 like we setup hit OK
and that should be it we should be able
to get to Google calm without having to
pay if I wasn't in an offline mode try
again
dah google.com alright so we shown you
how to tunnel your track your traffic
over DNS over SSH tunnel proxying all
that happy guys you can find out more at
room 362 comm which is my blog you can
download Ozzie man at Doc's para comm
and let's just go into some other evil
ideas that have come up so one of the
problems with the pineapple is it
doesn't have that much space so if
you're dumping stuff it only can store
it for maybe a fraction of a second
before you get anything well what's this
DNS tunneling happening it's going
through your home computer so where can
you run your all your good stuff so you
put the pineapple somewhere its DNS
tunneling back it's sharing out that
free internet and your home computer
just might be sniffing all of that in
clear text so wait there's one more
thing double dragon 3 from the IRC from
the hack stalkers actually mentioned
something cool over in Denmark and other
places they give free Internet little 3G
sticks that you pay via a web front end
that has DNS working oh yeah so unless
you think about that and the legalities
of that but thanks for tuning in back to
either
alright guys get ready to play this
month's LAN party we're gonna be playing
insurgency modern infantry combat and
you can join us in the game at
insurgency dot hack v org on March 28th
at 3 p.m. Eastern and if you're not into
the whole insurgency thing why don't you
go over to hack 5 land squarespace.com
and sign up and vote and maybe we will
choose your land party for the next one
and I gotta thank Squarespace for being

just one year not just two years the
life of your contract next up we have
our interview with Tyler McAdams but
first I want to tell you guys about
revision to a brand new show it's from
those guys that brought you the one up
video game show they're gonna be
bringing together journalists and
developers everybody to talk about video
games so if you're into video games like
me you can check this out every Tuesday
at revision3.com
next up let's kick it off over to the
interview so Tyler how would you define
the Linux DNA project in your words so
Linux DNA is a small agile Linux
optimization ChopShop and we do these
optimizations through the ICC Intel
Linux compiler okay now when you say ICC
what is ICC - anybody that's you know
not down nitty-gritty with the compilers
right so ICC stands for the Intel C C++
Linux compiler it's a highly optimizing
compiler that works with Linux it also
works with Windows and it works for Mac
OSX as well okay so the Linux DNA
obviously you know trying to be
optimized
for gaming give me some kind of idea of
like how the project works on an
end-user level okay so basically Linux
DNA tries to get as personal with the
user as possible and we do that through
an optimization that's called pgo or
profile guided optimization and this
optimization basically works in stages
first we compile a system with profiling
information and then we let an end user
use that as a test system they get on it
they they play games they do their work
just like they normally would and then
we take that information that's been
profiled and then we can recompile the
kernel with that information for the
specific use that these people are using
that system for so tell me what's the
difference between the kernel here and
it's something that we would see in a
distro of the month so our kernel is
something that is specific to the CPU
architecture other Linux distributions
and Windows as well have to account for
multiple architectures backwards
compatibility things of that nature what
we do is we specialize in the particular
CPU that we're optimizing for now
specifically Intel so what does that
mean for anybody on the AMD side of the
fence here well uh AMD can be optimized
for two actually and they optimizes very
well using icc using icc yes interesting
now you are telling me a little earlier
about another platform kind of exciting
news here you want to share with me
what's going on with Dream Linux and the
atom right so we've got an exclusive
relationship I'm happy to announce here
for the first time that we're working
with Dream Linux and if you guys haven't
seen her in Linux you got to check it
out especially for anybody who's working
on Windows but wants to move over to
Linux they make it real easy we've got a
project that we're working with them on
right now specifically for the atom CPU
for netbooks like the Asus Eee PC right
now
Lenox only has optimizations for the
atom CPU through ICC GCC right now does
not have anything they have stuff in
development but it's not it's not
seasoned like it is for the ICC's so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna make
a netbook second-to-none that's gonna be
responsive and it's going to be great
for desktop use okay so does that mean
that there's possible gaming on a
netbook in the future absolutely
absolutely
now let's talk about gaming is this is
this practical is this something that as
a gamer you would consider switching
over to to get like can you give me some
idea of like maybe some figures or
benchmarks of what you would see versus
your typical Windows box and I don't
know pick a game absolutely so let's
start with an oldie benchmark that
everybody has plenty of data on quake 3
when we optimize a system we see not
even with ICC compiling we can get 200
frames per second more on average with
Linux so if you're a hardcore gamer and
you want a system that you can take to a
land party and you want to you know do
nothing but game on this system you can
dual boot into this Linux environment
and get a system that's gonna be twice
as responsive as a system that's based
on Windows now I'm new to Linux on the
desktop played with it for years and
embedded devices and whatnot but just
this season took the the dive on my
actual desktop here or my netbook if you
will now give me an idea as far as the
actual titles is this a feasible thing
or am I just going to be playing tux
racer well yeah that's kind of the thing
in the past is you know Linux has kind
of been this you know second horse and
right now we've got some you know
exciting events that are developing for
the Linux platform like in specific the
steam platform is being uh is being
ported over to the Linux environment so
yes in the past it's been you know the
main titles like quake 3 doom unreal but
you're going to start seeing a whole lot
of games that used to be just windows
titles they're going to be ported over
to Linux ok so the big names in an epic
already on the platform you're saying
valve is heading over yes they are if
that's exciting
now these optimizations are they just to
the operating system or can we see any
sort of optimizations in the the games
themselves with the ICC goodness
right so with games it it's a little bit
tricky because you know you've got a lot
of color source titles these aren't
going to be able to be optimized with
icc however we can optimize system code
Firefox for example but you know basic
system low-level binaries can be
optimized with ICC so in that respect
you will see optimization and
performance scaling okay now God asked
you why may not be an emulator but is it
something that would benefit from this
absolutely and dream linux excels at
wine it uses wine doors for example and
it does a great job of porting any of
the desktop you know applications that
would be quote mission-critical
for windows over to linux so what about
like is this something that I could use
to bring some new life into like an
older machine yes definitely and the
reason behind that is because we can
optimize for that specific CPU you know
there are a lot of CPUs out there people
you know money is tight right now and
these CPUs aren't going anywhere you
know people are gonna have to use them
for a while and that's where the Linux
DNA project is going to shine because we
can come in and custom compile and get a
new CPUs usage out of an old CPU great
so where can people get involved with
the project or even just play with it
themselves right so I would encourage
them to go over to Lennox DNA we've got
the source there we've got a VM there
that they can download and use also to
go over to Dream linux.com and download
Dream Linux because it's an awesome
operating system cool
I'll check out the live distro awesome
well thanks so much for coming on I'm
taking a look and see maybe we can get
some classic quake 3 game and going on
in a Linux box
a lot of fun awesome I Adam sounds great
