copyright bill Google Play apps are
hackable again emails can be hacked with
a simple code and 14 million people just
got doxxed all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings and happy summer
solstice I'm Shanna Morrison this is
threat wire for jun 22nd 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom first off a
huge thanks to everyone watching the
show three times a week and supporting
us the news has been crazy lately so I
vote we just get right into it so hey
what's up with Australia passing some
interesting laws down there I see the
copyright amendment online infringement
Bill 2015 was just passed by both houses
of Australian Parliament allowing
companies to block overseas sites from
viewing if their main purpose is for
copyright infringement unfortunately as
pointed out by australian national
university college of law professor dr.
matthew Rimmer it's a little vague quote
he said what is primary purpose there's
no definition what is facilitation again
there's no definition so this means that
there could be accidental censorship or
censorship made for emotional purposes
not necessarily covered under the law
now this is the part where I'd say hey
VPNs FTW which Australia's communication
Minister named Malcolm Turnbull echoed
so he says take using a VPN to access
Netflix for example Turnbull said quote
where someone is using a VPN to access
for example Netflix from the United
States to get content in respect of
which Netflix does not have an
Australian license this bill would not
deal with that because you cannot say
that Netflix in the United States has as
its primary purpose the infringement or
facilitation of the infringement of
copyright so kind of sounds okay other
than dealing with piracy and copyrighted
materials though another argument for
the bill is that it would save jobs in
the arts sector but then we have the
australian bureau of statistics which
fact checks that idea basically jobs
have been steadily increasing in the
arts so why did they come up with that
who once
an answer would be to add legit sources
of content delivery as well which
wouldn't it gate the need to pirate so
that would be my vote will be watching
to see how the bill affects our
Australian friends in yet another
Android bug report again several popular
apps in the Google Play Store with over
200 million downloads collectively are
just giving out user passwords left and
right as if you get a password and you
get a password and Paul gets the user
password the reason being is they aren't
implementing HTTPS correctly or at all
when a user logs in so if someone is on
the same Wi-Fi network as you are as an
example they could view in plaintext
your username and password when you ever
you log into your favorite application
from the google play store so if they
actually got accepted so this includes
match.com zaps safeway zap the mba's
apps and Pizza Hut so stop ordering that
pizza from Pizza Hut the problems were
found via researchers at at bugs and
many were reported to the faulty apps
months ago 14 million people are
affected by a huge data breach from the
office of personnel government run by
the US government to store information
on everyone who works for again the US
government this includes everyone from
uniform eighteen-year-olds to
intelligence personnel the breach was
reported to agencies in early May with
the numbers being around 3.2 affected
but new evidence this week makes that
number much higher the Obama
administration has called for a 30-day
cybersecurity sprint to patch holes in
the networks an ad better authentication
many of these networks haven't been
updated since the 1990s link to the full
story below WTF and in this week's
social engineering report first
announced by symantec via a YouTube
video in some cases all you need to take
over someones email account is their
email address and the recovery phone
number sadly this hack isn't very hard
to do if you forget your password you
can generally send yourself a
verification code at your phone number
to prove your identity and then change
it to a new password an attacker could
use this to send your phone number of
verification code from your account and
then send another text asking for that
same
verification code the attacker could
then simply type in that into the email
provider and then change your passwords
and boom they have access so how do you
protect yourself you can still use this
as a way to verify your identity just
don't send anyone that code just don't
send it to anyone else ever if anybody
ever asks for that code other than your
email address provider on your computer
don't send it to them even if it sounds
legit also two-factor authentication it
is available and it's really important
and if you can get it for your email
provider use it thank you again to our
