Mac and customizing the boon to 1604
xenial xerus all that and more this time
on hack 5 hello welcome to act 5 my name
is Gerren kitchen my name is Shannon
Morse and this is your weekly dose of
techno lost yes it is I'm very excited
we've got a fantastic show for you guys
we have an entire month of Awesome
episodes planned yeah they're really
coming together okay what are you
talking about for once we just had an
amazing like two months series and drone
building that's true I'm gonna get a
little bit more into that we've got some
extras coming on to talk about fpv we
planned ahead it's so exciting
we have to cuz hacking across the planet
mm-hmm I'm in Japan
yeah actually as you watch this we may
in fact be in Japan no I'm not gonna be
in Japan I'm gonna be in Australia
you're gonna be in Japan that's right I
will be if this is before my meet up
make sure to go to snubs EECOM slash
blog to verify where i'm going to be no
they should they should just go to the
new hack 5 org hak5 o RG and sign up if
you're gonna be in the Gold Coast or
Sydney or Tokyo and then you'll find out
why am i holding a weird coin and it's
not rehire as enough for you to even
understand right now but you'll figure
it out if you come to the Meetup
so I guess we should get right into it
right I'm very excited because we have
swapped places I am hi graded to a
Windows box and I know Windows has its
place yeah and it's code in the kitchen
I'm sorry I'm the kitchen and I just
made that joke on act 5 again no I've
just been doing it for illustrator in
Photoshop and I didn't inhale but you've
switched fully to Linux exciting why is
this so exciting you're like oh this is
such a hard thing for snubs to do or no
it's not that it's hard for stuff to do
it's just I have done it so many times
and I have dedicated machines for this
for this reason but I just I you know
and and Windows - she doesn't treat me
good but I keep going back to her
because it's the only thing that Adobe
runs on so it's like you know bring the
Creative Suite that's it that's it so so
with this
gnu/linux installation this new
operating system installed in my switch
from Windows I found there were a few
nitpicky things that I had to fix and I
needed to change in Linux so I figured
why don't I share those with the world
because I figured somebody might find
them useful yeah so I guess I should go
ahead and start it off with startup
commands this is kind of cool in kind of
nitpicky as well so I found out when I
was using this Linux machine for some
reason my wireless router was going to
sleep or my my wireless card it was just
going to sleep there's no reason for it
it was just doing it this is probably a
hardware if you particular to your
laptop that may in fact be fixed in 16.0
4.1 which by the way is usually when
these long-term releases come out I'm
not saying I like to wait for the next
point release but the next point release
is usually really good so yeah by the
way there have been a few updates to
1604 if you have installed it since the
first day it came out so make sure to
just hit the hit up those installations
just in case they are important luckily
none of them have taken long to install
alright so start of command so what are
you doing New Year's so with startup
commands turns out that you can list
specific startup commands which wouldn't
generally be in your year terminal as a
GUI application that will automatically
run whenever you're starting your
computer so what are you running when
you're starting your computer so I'm
running this thing that I just decided
to call wake up Wi-Fi so first off I had
to go into my terminal of course and
hopefully this is big enough for you
guys to see and I had to run iw config
because turns out this is no longer
wlan0 it's WL P 1 s 0 Y that's my face
of disgust why did you do that to us
everything was beautiful eth0 wlan0 it
all made sense and then one morning I
woke up and everything was different so
if you go into unity and you search
startup you'll find this application
called startup application preferences
it's this one in the middle here and
there's already a few things that are
already
set to startup whenever I start up the
computer and whenever I boot up I
decided to add a new one so I just click
Add and I named it wake up Wi-Fi and I
put in this little command right here I
ww0 scan so that's going to scan my
interface for any wireless access points
in the area and yellow and behold it
wakes it up again I don't know why that
works but it works it was the strangest
thing and then you know what I have to
say this comes from an odd
troubleshooting thing where Shannon's
like wait the Wi-Fi worked and now it's
not and I'm like are you talking about
if your card works your card works here
let's do a scan first instinct is like
okay cool
pull up the terminal and see if the
radio can actually see any access points
and as soon as it can then it can see
them all and then network manager
connects so that's just a fun one in
that it's it's a workaround for an ugly
bug yeah one of those random things that
you run into when you're running
different laptops with a new operating
system so moving on from that we also
have some of the customizations that you
can do to the look and feel of your
system so if you go into system settings
obviously you have appearance appearance
is going to let you change you know
there's simple things wallpaper and the
theme of moon no it's not and it's not a
squirrel either but you know what that's
okay so you can change a few things not
very many and you can also change the
behavior so if I wanted this to be
hidden I can hide it if I want it to
come up at a certain time I can do that
that's just the built-in stuff Shannon
and I want to get to the boon to tweak
and start getting your little tweaks on
right so apparently going to tweak is no
longer being supported well yeah so this
is kind of interesting let me pull up
their website apparently this project is
no longer under maintenance as of just a
few days ago bummer
yeah that's over at launchpad dotnet
slash Ubuntu - tweak and also if you go
to Ubuntu - like tweak comm or something
instead it's not there it was fun while
it lasted yeah it was fun while it
lasted and fortunately it's not there at
the moment maybe it will come back but
there is a replacement and this one is
called unity tweak tool this is in the
in boon to Software Center so it's
automatically built-in and it
additional customizations - so I was
able to go into unity tweak tool pull
this into the middle here and it has a
ton more customizations that you can do
a lot of this is just look and feel but
it's kind of important whenever you're
using this as your day-to-day computer
now you're probably wondering about
themes since I'm using unity at the
moment I haven't switched over to gnome
you can add themes to unity these are
some additional themes that I was able
to install from Ray affinity which I
found that site from oMG Ubuntu Co UK
they have tons more themes that they've
done reviews about and also installation
directions so perhaps to Ong abou - I
love that website so you can go over
into your command line and to install
these additional themes and this is
again just for looking field just hit
sudo add apt repository so we're adding
a new repository repository PPA okay so
you're adding a PPA ya your system it's
a people which is interesting because
1604 is the one that brings the concept
the idea figure what they're calling it
snaps yeah we wouldn't have you know
this PPA hell but you know this is also
a one is when was that theme made so
yeah athle in a future episode nice
18:04 that will no longer be the case I
I hope that is true so you type in sudo
apt add apt repository PPA ray affinity
- project slash PPA and that's going to
go ahead and install them and then you
type in sudo apt-get update and sudo
apt-get install ambience flat colors
radiance flat colors so these are a
couple of different options that are
going to give you a whole bunch of
different looks that you can choose to
use for customizing your own operating
system right so apt being the package
manager and the repository system that
is popular in Ubuntu what you're doing
is you're adding another repository so
by default
Ubuntu is shipping with their own
mainline repositories where you're
saying hey I want this software and so
it's going to look it up from a boon to
and say hey do
a package named this and they're like oh
yeah this is the package here you go
so in this case you will the package
doesn't exist in the mainline repository
because it's just a theme it's not
missing critical why would they list
everything so now I'm a new repository
now I have everything and everything is
in you the unity tweet tool
automatically comes over you just have
to re re start unity tweak tool and then
you have the option to change your
colors you can change your icons and so
on and so forth ya look seems here icons
obviously I chose the pink highlighting
and then I changed these up here because
I have a very dark wallpaper so I wanted
to be able to see these I could change
it with humanity dark so I was able to
do some cool little tweaks there you
know and now that you just now that
you're adding repositories you can
install tons and tons of software and
then gunk up your machine yep and when
that happens you need to have something
that will do system cleaning for you so
I found a tool it's called bleach bit
weird name but it works maybe bleach
because cleaning so bleach bit is a
system cleaner for cached and unwanted
data that's just taking up space on your
system it's very very customizable but
just be careful with any cleaning
software that you decide to install and
use don't remove anything important you
know keep that in mind so if you're just
removing like cache data for example you
can just go in here and choose that
cache data from the list like right here
yeah it's just yeah they're all just
temp files so yeah sure you know cookies
like stuff like that just make sure that
you're you're not erasing like you know
your operating system which which which
funnily enough Linux still lets you do
which is fantastic RM Tech RF slash try
to home kids how do you get this oh it's
easy sudo apt-get install bleach I asked
because that's a perfect example of what
we were just talking about about the
repository yeah
bleach bit is part of the mainline whoo
boon to repository in that you didn't
have to add a new one to be able to
install it which means that I give it a
trustworthy thumbs up because if the
folks that were on your boot to trust it
to put it in their own mainline
repository then I do okay
so moving on we had a little issue with
mounting drives did we not yes well
we're it's you know maybe we just need
to change the infrastructure here at the
warehouse but because it is such a mixed
environment we end up using Samba shares
for our network shares in that Windows
computers can get to them easily and
because the majority of computers are
still windows
well OS 10 and Linux boxes can mount
Samba shares as well just so they can
get on with all the happy fun good stuff
that said Ubuntu doesn't play the nicest
when it comes to mounting those shares
it is really easy to mount drives
through your GUI temporarily that's easy
you just you know you connect to your
server let's say I want to go they
already logged into the scrap and mount
there you go yeah I just hit connect us
what luckily connect to servers just
built in and then I choose my connection
mm-hmm login and then I can connect to
my the server but then I have to mount
these folders all separately which is
kind of a pain in the butt and it's just
temporary so as soon as I restart the
computer they're going to be gone again
and I'll have to re login and it's kind
of annoying whenever I have to do that
so I don't necessarily enjoy doing that
I would prefer a permanent fix but
permanent fixes are going to be a little
more complicated I mean it's not the end
of the world but yeah this is a very
good article worth pointing out here
article basically you're going to need
to install a couple of tools basically
some libraries that allow you to do
winds in addition to DNS which is
something that Windows networks do and
then you're gonna have to make some
directories and add some amount points
in your filesystem table so if you don't
mind
editing your FS tab I would say go ahead
and do this I am most curious in just
how this is going to break when you are
off-site and turn on your laptop and it
tries to connect to those network shares
that it doesn't have access to so I did
also motion a under the Ubuntu wiki
mount windows shares permanently and it
does look like it's regarding samba so
this might be another option for us as
well that's going to be something fun to
look into and
well yay you know here's the thing if if
what you need to do is Mount a Samba
share then you probably don't have the
flexibility that we have here in the
warehouse to just be like you know I'd
forget it we're gonna move to a
different architecture completely or
different protocol so yeah let us know
that's actually a fun one I want to know
if anybody has like oh well dude did you
not see samba tweaks or something let us
know lastly I also wanted to mention
battery life because I complained about
this on our other show tech thing that I
do with Patrick Norton
my battery life dropped to about two
hours when I switched over to the Ubuntu
operating system while I was on Windows
it would last for you know seven hours a
full day I would get an entire workday
out of it and not have to bring my power
cord into our studio so battery life is
really important to me it was terrible
on Linux when I first installed it so I
did a few of those obvious things I
turned off bluetooth lowered my screen
brightness so it doesn't automatically
go up to the brightest level I also
checked the built in battery settings
and I fixed a few things there however
Darren did a full episode it was hack 5
episode 1225 that one yes that's about
to say like like as you started this bit
I'm like Shannon you know we've covered
this right yeah he's gone through a
whole bunch of fixes that we can do
specifically there's a really good one
called TLP settings so you can go over
to Lynn Runner de and they have a whole
intro about how to install this and how
to get working with TLP yeah you know I
actually that is a really long wiki uh
yeah you can basically just install TLP
go to the default settings and you'll be
fine like that'll get like 90% of it
yeah that's what I've read so I'm gonna
try it right now I'm running at 4 hours
and 52 minutes so that's a lot better
than 2 hours or otherwise check out hack
5 episode 1225 in addition to Linux
laptop battery optimizations Shannon
teaches you about using encryption with
Dropbox and that has not changed there's
a great second I forgot I did that hey
if you're new to so we've been doing
this for a decade see a lot of catching
up to do I think that's about it yeah I
was
able to customize quite a few of the
things that I was worried awesome I'm
glad that you're going to experience is
coming together and you know it's
speaking of decade old Oh a software
Center works again yes aalverson yeah I
know a podcaster that who has also been
podcasting for over a decade
and her name is amber McArthur I did the
most amazing thing this morning I had an
idea and I brought it onto the Internet
let me tell you how I did it I went over
to domain.com and I use their epic
domain discovery system to help me find
the perfect domain and then the quick
and simple checkout system had my
website up and online in no time I I'm
not lying guys this is literally what I
did like a couple hours ago and I used
coupon code hak5 you know why because
domain calm has been supporting hack 5
for years
they love what we do they love you guys
and they want to hook you up and that's
why we have that special code that saves
you 15% off so I just wanted to remind
you guys that you should tweet at
domain.com and say hey thanks for
supporting act 5 all these years and
then when you're thinking about getting
your next domain go to domain comto
Shannon and I do get your website up an
online real quick and easy when you
think domain names think domain.com so
what's really wonderful about hack 5 is
that we've been podcasting for over 10
years now which means that there is in
fact someone in our audience that
started watching the show just when we
began in 2005 and it has since gotten
married and had children and is now
wondering okay I love hacking oh no dear
God I have children I'm here to make
that all better what else as you all
growed up and stuff I know this is Amber
Mac from command and Fame and all of the
other og podcasts on the internet it's
so awesome to run into in San Francisco
it's so awesome the CEO I think last
time we were together we were in an
Adventures of Superman comic book hacks
live and commanded many years ago
highlight of my entire career
I know raisin we pretty much could have
stopped at 2006 but we did it we did not
hurried on we did and you know what have
you been up to lately I hear oh so much
good stuff yeah a little bit of
everything you know doing lots of
television
and still doing some podcasting some
radio all those fun things and of course
writing I just wrote a book so that's
very exciting
that's what I wanted to ask you about
because we have cliff in our audience
who is just like dude I got a kid now
it's Karl just came in it's Karl
it's always so Karl has a kid who is now
entering the age of the Internet
that's a scary time it is a scary time
you know it's kind of interesting
because I'm a big fan of the show mr.
robot and last summer I was bending on
the show and then I met one of their
security advisers on the show his name's
Michael Bozell and then we were chatting
we were both kind of saying that one of
the questions that we get asked the most
when we're at events is hey I have kids
you know what do I do in terms of
keeping them safe on the internet
whether they're preschoolers or teens
and then we both got talking you decided
hey we're gonna write a book and that's
exactly what we did it's out on May 16th
that is amazing you guys are
self-publishing which is really exciting
so I'm sure you're going to be going on
tour I'm excited to be the first one to
have you on to talk you are the first
and so so give me an example of like
what maybe what if I were to have
children right now obviously I would
just make sure they have dial-up that
would slow them down that would give me
time to figure out what to do with them
right that's very smart
yeah if you can't get dial-up and you
have high-speed Internet in your home
and you're wondering what to do I mean
we really broke the book down into a
bunch of different chapters so we focus
on the different social networks like
Twitter and Facebook we talk about
snapchat and all of the new apps that
are out there and one of the things that
we talk about is a couple of things one
way to really monitor what your kids are
doing online you can use some of
Michael's tools that are available that
allow you to find out hey what content
are my kids liking you know what photos
have they post on the and all those
things are kind of dig up all that
content they're posting on a regular
basis and in the middle of tax on your
kids running melty go and yes yeah of
course that's exactly why I am there and
you know also the other side as far as
screen time you know how much time
should they be online you know how do I
know if there are warning signs if
they're running into trouble if there
are predators out there I mean we get
into all of those things that maybe
parents don't really want to talk about
but we know that you need to know this
stuff and it starts at a young age a lot
of kids are getting smartphones as young
as six years old this is new territory
and I mean I mean absolutely so you have
a seven-year-old yourself I do have a
seven-year-old you know he wants to be a
big YouTube star and I'm kind of
struggling with what do you do at that
point to maintain and protect their
privacy
so the book is really a handbook for
parents and hopefully one of the best
out there that allows you to get a sense
of you know what do I do with my kids
how do I train them to be smarter on the
Internet
and how do I monitor them if they're
getting into trouble well I don't have
kids personally but could you give me an
example for of course our friend cliff
Karl that that's wondering like what
what should you be doing I thought
you're propositioning me like I don't
have kids but you know maybe you're
totally out there yeah you know I think
for the most part you know if you buy
the book you're able to kind of read it
at your leisure depending where your kid
is at what state you know if there's a
younger kid or like younger kid like
damaged yeah so I would say stages 6 to
18 so if there is young as six you want
to start with the chapter that's all
about screen time if they're in their
teens maybe you want to jump right into
Facebook and Instagram and what they're
doing there how to deal with bullying
and all those things so the reality is
it really is for all parents and the
younger you can start the better so we
want this to be something that's on
people's bookshelves that you refer to
as time goes on and since we're
self-publishing we're gonna update it on
a regular basis which means if you're an
18 year old hacker and you're concerned
that your parents are getting all
involved in your facebooking and stuff
then it might be appropriate that you
grab a copy of this to figure out what
your parents may be doing to watch you
on lock yeah that's exactly it it's
called outsmarting your kids online so
even kids might like it too arts month
exactly exactly awesome cool what other
fun stuff you've been up to then just
awesome to just run into you amber in
San Francisco I know it's been a long
time so lots of different things you
know you can follow everything I do on
Twitter at Amber Mac I'm constantly you
know traveling I'm doing series online
and you know just kind of geeking out
and doing lots of fun stuff awesome well
it's so great nebula Tech 5 right yeah
high five hack 5 that's how we do it
right yeah I don't know Carl please help
me out you think finally finally ok and
with that we're going to jump back in
studio but enjoy the rest of your tour I
will I can't wait that just about wraps
up this week's episode of hack 5 but
before we get going that's why you tuned

of I love that we were able to take this
platform and like use it to build up
more brands and shows it's just like if
one big happy family over here and I
wanted to throw out two we just made a
intro to hack 5 video it's just like a
minute long so if you have any friends
that might be interested in hack 5 and
they've never seen it before they don't
know where to start maybe throw them
over to our little one-minute videos on

always a lot of fun so I mean we're
venturing into even new cool fun
territory next week as we go into 360
cameras they're gonna have Kevin McKay
to come down and talk to us about fpv
and other really esoteric awesome fpv
racing avionics stuff it's it's really
good yeah it's gonna be a lot of fun so
stay tuned to that feedback a hack 5 org
