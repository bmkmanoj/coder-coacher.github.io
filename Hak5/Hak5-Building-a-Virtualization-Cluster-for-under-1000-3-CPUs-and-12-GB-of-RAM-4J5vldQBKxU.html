virtualization cluster 16 cores under a
gram and it be done find out this time
on hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by goto assist express support smarter
with go to assist Express domain calm
got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain calm and dead space
- in stores now hello welcome to hack 5
my name is darren kitchen and this is
your weekly dose of techno we have a
fantastic show for you guys this week
because we're talking virtualization
we're going to do some fun happy stuff
when it comes to building clusters we
talked about a few weeks ago proxmox and
open source virtualization environment
it's going to help you setup yourself
little KVM and openvz action and we're
taking a little quad core box that we
few weeks ago and adding some more to it
we're adding you know just a couple more
members of the family in fact the
challenge is to build three more nodes
on the cluster for under grande we'll
see if we can do it will i-5 goodness
and yeah that should be a lot of fun but
first and foremost all of this
virtualization stuff that we've been
doing has really tied in with a cool new
project that we're having fun with
called the hack 5 hacker challenge we
just had our first one last Saturday and
just a resounding amazing amount of
feedback coming from you guys a lot of
people joined in participated in the IRC
got into the virtual machines that we
set up using GoToAssist Express and had
a lot of fun you know throwing attacks
against each other and doing some of
that so I thought it maybe liked a
little highlight you know give you guys
a little recap if you missed it because
basically what we set up with 64 virtual
machines on the little poor little quad
core here and that's that's actually why
we're buildings more Hardware because
yeah that's that's a little too much for
this poor little guy so but yeah we had
all of these XP service pack 2 machines
unpatched right but armed to the teeth
with that great tool that we talked
about last week
Armitage the front end for Metasploit as
well as all the other stuff that you
would expect like your end maps and you
know cane and and netcat and you know
Wireshark and everything else right so
so we let everybody in and it was
basically a free-for-all
ok and this was a really fun soft launch
great first
time to get in and see how people were
going to experiment with it we actually
set up a dedicated line at a local ISP
here so that it's on a completely
separate network about to upgrade that
to probably about 50 megabits up and
down or well we'll see what we can get
but I think we can get about 50 megabits
which will make things I hell of a lot
faster and also with the new fad new
hardware that we're building for the
virtualization cluster I'm going to take
this idea really run with it because I
got so much great response I hope you
guys can join in for the next one
because we're going to be adding a lot
of different elements to the mix we're
going to be adding kind of a co-op
element where if you're like in the IRC
chat room you could coordinate with your
fellow hackers rather than you know try
to patch your machine while at the same
time hack everyone else right and the
idea of the last challenge was that each
participant had a JPEG of a kitten on
their desktop a unique kitten just to
them and the object was to protect your
kitten you still could not modify or
delete the kitten photo sorry couldn't
touch that but you know you know put up
your firewalls update get your patches
on all that good stuff well at the same
time trying to use remote exploits to
break into the other computers and steal
their kittens so it's really a not a
capture the flag more of a capture the
kitten and we're going to go with
something like that with future ones
where we'll be adding some other servers
specifically meant so that you can try
out things like you know SSH brute
forcing and some remote exploits and
stuff like that that we'll be talking
about here in the future
we've got Moo bik's coming on to talk to
us about pivoting and enumeration and
you know post exploitation stuff it
should be awesome and the idea is that
we're going to set up a bunch of servers
like Metasploit able maybe an MT 4
server who knows we're going to have a
lot of fun with this and now that we
have the hardware to do it I think it's
going to be so great so I hope that you
can all get in on this because yeah
we're having a lot of fun I'll be even
going to set up a live stream so the
next time we can like commentate on it I
was sitting there in my room with like
the 328 inch monitors with like VMs
everywhere just watching people's
desktops and it's really interesting to
see how people work and it's just so
amazing to
like like one guy was actually
installing panda antivirus I'm like I
don't know what that's going to do and
another guy was was uh ARP cache
poisoning the entire network using Cain
and Abel and actually he wasn't the only
one doing it which was really fun to see
like two hackers on a network both
trying to ARP cache the entire it's just
packet mayhem things were just like
falling out of the sky it was so much
fun
so I hope you guys can join in with next
one and yeah that's just a little hacker
challenge recap and I want to thank
Citrix because they were so great to
sponsor this and they're going to
continue to with the you know the next
coming sessions of the hacker challenge
and they've you know provided us with a
great way that you guys can get in on
the action using go to assist Express so
one take a moment to tell you guys about
that as you know a I provide technical
support to a lot of people online
whether it's friends and family whether
if it's you know my co-workers back at
AIT job on the East Coast go to assist
Express is one of the best ways to
provide technical support online when
you can't be in there in person you can
remotely control your computers you can
wreak wickley resolve technical issues
and it's helped me to be able to just
take care of my friends my family my
co-workers and we encourage you to go
ahead and try it out for free if you
head over to go to assist comm a slash
hak5 you can get yourself a free 30-day
trial again for the special offer visit
go to assist com slash hack five and we
want to thank Citrix for helping us out
and sponsoring the show and now helping
you guys get in on this challenge good
stuff right so proxmox as you guys
recall the other week for CES I think it
was we built our first virtualization
node and yeah you know it's running all
right
he is a quad-core q95 50 so you know the
older-style Intel quad core running at
2.8 gigahertz got eight gigs of RAM in
him and he was peaking like crazy with
the virtual machines that we set up for
the first hacker challenge so I realized
you know
not actually RAM limited in this case
it's really CPU so it's time to throw
some more CPUs at it and the challenge
for me to upgrade the hacker challenge
is to create it just as much as big of
as big and badass of a cluster as I can
for under a grand and let's see if I
could do it so here's what I've come up
with using an asus board this is the
Asus P what is it well anyway it's it's
that guy it's the p90 for something
anyway where do they put those they used
to so ah the pbh 67 tac ml e whatever
anyway it was the least expensive
motherboard I could find that would
support the you know i3 i5 i7 chips so
picked up a couple of those the 2,400
seems to be a pretty good
middle-of-the-road I five to play with
and mmm let's see so I got to twenty
fours and a 2500 k interesting part
about the 2500 K is that it's actually
unlocked so you can you know overclock
it to your heart's content for these
purposes I'm not really going to worry
about that I'm just going to you know
pop these in stock I'm just trying to
make things easy for myself as I can
that's so much easier than back when you
used to have like to use a screwdriver
hated those days right so figured hey
you know most mostly CPU limited in
these instances this guy with quad core
with eight gigs really didn't use all of
his RAM so I figured four cores you know
it's a quad core i5 3.1 to three point
three gigahertz per chip so eight gigs
of ram should be good enough there we'll
see and yeah I just want this with the
you know the stock cooler I'm not
looking for anything super crazy here I
think they should hold up and I will see
in the weeks to come
one of the other things that I went
ahead and did
is rather than using desktop hard drives
I just went with 7200 rpm laptop drives
it's going to make a little lower
profile and you guys are going to see
we've got some interesting things that
we're doing with case modifications in
the weeks to come
that are going to be really spiffy so in
this case I actually needed a two and a
half inch hard drive 40 bucks on special
so can't really go wrong there so I
don't know if what you guys do as far as
building inexpensive boxes but I say if
there's one thing you can cheap out on
it's totally the case so you may notice
here that the the case on the the one
node I'm looking at is not necessarily
the sexiest case you've ever seen
actually it's it's the case that comes
with the motherboard that's right all
motherboards come with cases it's a big
cardboard box you know get your box
cutter out and you're all good to go
right so cut out a little bit for the
power supply area for the fan your i/o
on the back hey I call it a day that
will work for right now until we get a
little bit crazier here with the case
modifications but you know the challenge
here is to build three i-5 machines for
under a grand and let's see how we did
well not so much I tried I really did
maybe if I ordered online rather than
going down to like you know the local
fries and micro Center I would have done
a bit better but for the most part did
about $1,200 so not too high over budget
and you know I really think that it was
worth the little extra to get the better
processor and you know to get ample
amounts of RAM and stuff like that but
there we go I think I just about
finished building this computer ok well
I'll get back to this guy a little later
on the show I actually have one finished
over here so let's go ahead
boot him up and add him to the cluster
because you know our proxmox machine he
wants some friends man doesn't let sit
there all by his lonesome just serving
up virtual machines
okay power switch no I didn't set up a
power switch what did I do
I set the bios so that he would just
turn on when power resumes this is
plugged in it's plugged in over there
why are we not getting any power hmm
okay let's see what we can do about this
now I'm like having like a side panel to
open yeah you just break out your box
cutter oh you know okay nope that's just
a network light mine so you network
lights and I'm like I was really on but
that's not okay so another fun thing you
can do if you haven't installed a power
switch I had set these up so that rather
than actually setting up a power switch
that would come with your case since I'm
not actually spending Dexter money on a
case
it goes okay actually it was on oh I
just have a little power supply issue
where the cable is running across my
feet sink fan across against the stop
what did I do here Darrin come on what
are you doing man what are you doing I
had it great on the this one's running
great I'll clean up the cable management
we're building some case mods for these
anyway but I was going to show you that
you know if you're not if you don't want
to go ahead and spend the money on on an
actual switch you just find the two pins
on your motherboard use anything metal
short them out machine comes to life I
like to enable the BIOS to to go ahead
and just resume power state on power
failure you know power on and there we
go so now we have our pizza box of
course to live demos that has to fail
right okay our machines online let's see
if I can start pinging it and well
that's going I'll give you tour of the
little proxmox add-on so we've done with
this guy's so I'm pretty sure this is
1070 331 3 no that's not it
maybe your five will plug a monitor into
him and see what he is maybe he's just
not all the way up yet
I know I have some monitors around here
somewhere right
yes no there we go ah the fun of life to
tape so what's going to essentially
happen here is when we add additional
machines to the cluster there they're
going to be you know independent to a
certain extent it's not like a single
virtual machine is going to be using the
resources of all of the machines across
the network rather it's just going to
allow us to have a nicer administration
interface so that we can see all of the
machines in one console view so that we
can Oh keyboard air press f1 to continue
Wow
really Darrin you didn't disable the
keyboard error on boot let it go I was
up light but up late it's building three
of these machines back-to-back so anyway
just pop some USB loving in here and we
should be all set to go that's like one
of my favorite errors you know a
keyboard error f1 to continue yeah so
anyway it's each of these our our let's
say discard changes in exit great so
this guy will boot up now
what other thing was that each of these
are individual proxmox ve installations
just like we had done on Episode eight
2021 and really we're just going to add
them so that they can talk to each other
all of the virtual machines are going to
run on each of these individual boxes
but what it's going to allow us to do is
migrate them as the CPU load changes on
the different boxes so say like we've
got you know a bunch of servers that
we're trying to attack on one machine
and then we've got like clients on the
other and maybe I need to move some
resources around it makes it really easy
to say okay well you know cluster node
number four isn't really doing
much of a cluster node number one is
like totally pegged out so let's move
one of those machines over there and
that's one of the neat things is it's
going to allow us to do so it's booted
up we basically just go ahead and get a
text prompt here that tells us the IP
address of our new server so let me just
ping that make sure he's online and
there he is so let's add them to the mix
all right you don't need a monitor or a
keyboard anymore there we go
so I'm logged into proxmox ve the
administration interface here on the
first machine now I've decided to make
the quad-core the first machine we built
the master of our cluster and to do that
basically what we have to do is SSH into
it okay so I'm going to just fire up
some putty action here and head over to
proxmox one login as root and it takes a
little while for it to even prompt me
for password so while that's going on
let's just talk about some of the
benefits and approach to talked about
this at the very top but some of the
benefits of doing this you know it's a
single password a single login and
password for all of the VMS since we can
control everything from our single
master this means that you know we get a
single console to see all of them again
like I said being able to migrate VMs
between nodes and has it's pretty good
stuff and then later we'll talk about
how we can actually add like an NFS
server so do backups to that
alright so password okay so we're here
and if I do there's a command PVE CA for
for proxmox virtualized environment ves
and proxmox ve CA s 4 cluster
administration so if I do PvE CA tak L
it will give me a listing of my cluster
and you can see cluster ID number 1
this machine that I'm logging into up
here it's a 1070 331 to its role as M
for master state is a for active it's
been up for two days and you know it's
just chillin well we created him as the
master by using taxi and we can check
the status with tak L there's also a
couple other things that we need to
consider here most important is making
sure that all of these have the proper
date by default proxmox is set up to get
its date from NFS so as long as they're
on the same network they all should you
know supposedly get the same date I'm
going to log in to the other server here
and that was dot three yeah we're going
to accept those keys let's put these
guys over here alright
now you can see here on proxmox admin
console that already I have two proxmox
posts on my cluster I see proxmox and
proxmox two I can see their activity I
can click in here and see oh okay this
is a you know Core i5 2500 K at three
point three with four gigs of ram go
back here and see the other one and when
this is all said and done we're going to
have four nodes on our cluster maybe
even five depending on what we do with
our previous wall mounted server all
right so I am logged into this new
machine he would like to join the
cluster so in that case really it's just
a matter of checking out PvE CA tack a
four add to the cluster and then tack h
and then we give it the IP address of
the master so in that case it's 1070 331
to do that we're going to say yes it
essentially ssh is over to that first
machine now if i go back over to the
first one we can actually check the
configuration of our cluster if ikat or
let's use less slash ET c /p v e /
cluster CFG and you can see it's just
got the you know RSA key
and the IP addresses and the names and
all of that stuff for each of the nodes
in our cluster so we give it the
password for the root account on the
master and the first time I ever did
this I did run into a little bit of an
error where it was not syncing correctly
and it was because the date was wrong so
just run the date command and make sure
that you know your time and date is
identical between all of the nodes in
your cluster
all right cluster node successfully
created so they come back up to here and
do a PVC a tack L I can see and this is
the error that I got before and that
will actually what was it I was similar
to the error I got before anyway I got
that and it essentially was just because
it was still in the process of syncing
but come over here and hit home I'll see
that there is there it is the node
ticket the invalid ticket error right I
got that one before and it was I don't
know it just seems to be a quirk in 1.7
I did a lot of you know forum browsing
to figure it out and essentially it goes
away after it finishes syncing the other
issue could be of course the date that
is how you add some more notes to the
cluster we've got our second node here
our third node coming up thrown some
errors I'll get that fixed for here and
then our fourth one being built going to
add in probably the wall mounted server
and then we're going to do some really
fun case mods probably getting a season
9 and yeah that should be a lot of fun
so I'm really looking forward to hearing
what you guys think about proxmox stuff
I know that there's a lot of solutions
out there but this one is a really quick
and easy way to get KVM and openvz with
a beautiful interface the clusters and
does backups all built in in just a
matter of minutes so hit me up feedback
at hak5 org if you've got questions or
comments about setting up clusters or
other virtualization related stuff and
on that note I'm going to go ahead and
think one of the sponsors that makes
this all possible and you guys know that
I'm a huge fan of domain comm they've
been in business since 2000 they're your
one-stop shop for domains they've got
you know domain names reliable Linux and
Windows hosting they've got
to private servers in fact hak5 the org
has even run on a virtual private server
from domain.com
they've got affordable everyday pricing
for comms just 995 a year
private registration for $6.99 a year
and you can get their web hosting with a
99.99% network uptime track record fast
servers you know world-class hosting
infrastructure and excellent customer
support never had any problems getting
anything going with them and I want to
thank them for not only hosting hak5 org
but sponsoring the show and providing
you guys with a way to save 15% on your
order at domain.com all you have to do
use coupon code a k5 save yourself some
money next time you've got a great idea
you got to get that domain you got to
get that web hosting there your one-stop
shop for that so you've got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
com so I've gone ahead and fixed the
date issue on our new nodes to the
cluster net buy on the master associated
should do a PvE CA tack L you can
actually see there's all three of my
machines they are M for master n for
nodes and I can see the states are a for
active and s for syncing but come over
here to the web interface I can see it
it's actually saying no sync it's in the
process of syncing if I wanted to
manually I could come over here to that
new machine and do PvE CA tack s for
sync tack H and then 1070 331 to the IP
address of the master I'm just going to
let this guy sync it might take a little
while but let me show you what it would
be like to migrate some machines once
you have a new machine or new host on
the network so over in virtual machines
I can see here is the cluster node for
proxmox and I've got a bunch of VMs here
and then cluster node proxmox too you
want to make sure that all of these
machines are default installs of proxmox
but you do need to keep in mind that
their host names cannot be identical you
run some problems here so this one node
proxmox - I can see I have a VM on that
waiting to go let's go ahead and start
that one up and while that's starting
let's move
one so virtual machines I can see I have
this Oh this isn't very big its I think
this one's a Linux machine it's 12
gigabytes in size and what it can do is
come over to the migrate tab and then I
choose my source which is my first
proxmox machine my target which is the
second one node 2 in the cluster then
I'm going to just come down here and
select VM ID number 301 that that Linux
box I created and click migrate and that
will go ahead and start the migrating
process I can leave this tab that's
going to all go and yeah there's not
much more to it you know when I go back
over to my list eventually that will
make its way over into that part of the
cluster when this guy finishes syncing
I'll be able to move all sorts of stuff
around it'll be great you know so I
think our our other machine is all up
and running so let's open that VNC
console and there we go I'm freshly
booted into one of our Windows XP
service pack 2 boxes and I'm greeted
with this found new hardware wizard and
why is that well we talked about setting
up Windows machines and how that we need
to use KVM rather than openvz for the
you know full virtualization there and
if I go into the hardware tab of this
machine I can see that my ethernet
controller right here is vert IO or
virtio or however you want to pronounce
that I can actually create another
ethernet device for instance and I have
plenty of models to choose from like a
RTL 80 139 that's a real tech chipset
there's plenty of different ones that I
can choose from but the reason I want to
use vert I wear my Windows machines is
that since it is a KVM machine since
this Windows machine vert io is going to
have better performance and that's
because it is a para virtualized device
driver okay and I guess I should should
explain that virtio is basically an
abstraction layer that allows your
devices in a para virtualized hypervisor
to run so let's probably break that down
because that may have sounded like Greek
an abstraction layer how the hell or the
hardware
traction layer has been with us at least
on the windows side since you know NT
and essentially what that is is just
basically a layer of software that says
oh okay you want to have the modem dial
this number so you can send this command
right but every modem has like different
commands and different ways to talk to
it to send those commands but when you
were writing software say like you're
writing a modem dialer you don't want to
have to include every single way that
you could possibly dial a number for all
of the different models of modems and
all of that stuff and that abstraction
layer is just a piece of software that
sits in between and you can just talk to
it
and it will you know do the rest between
the different you know whether it's this
video card or that video card and all
that stuff so that that's basically the
idea of an abstraction layer the devices
obviously are the hardware and
paravirtualized basically means you know
the difference between para
virtualization and full virtualization
is say for instance full virtualization
we've got a Linux server piece of
hardware and we just want to go ahead
and download that into a file move it
over to our virtualization environment
and bring it up as a virtual machine
without ever having to change the
configuration of the Linux machine and
that would be a you know fully hosted a
full virtualization type of scenario and
then there's para virtualized which if
you're using say VMware or or what is it
VirtualBox on your desktop you're
probably used to having VMware tools or
you know or the guest add-ons for
VirtualBox those are special drivers you
know specifically for now Ethernet and
your video card that give them better
performance so that when you're using
them on your desktop they look a lot
nicer otherwise you know they just use
anyways just just nuts not as not as
fast right so para virtualized basically
just means adding a little piece of
software to your new guest machine so
that it can run with better performance
and while we could use any of these
other models here in our drop-down the
Vertigo has
the best performance because it's a
paravirtualized driver for our
hypervisor which is just a fancy word
for our virtualization environment in
this case proxmox or VMware or
VirtualBox or whatever you like to use
so how do you get drivers onto a onto a
virtual machine here for the network
card when you don't have network access
well in that case just like we see here
in the hardware we actually have mounted
an ISO and this is net KVM ISO I've
actually done a tiny URL for you guys
tiny or comm slash vert IO ISO and that
should take you to a site where you can
download just a CD image that has the
virtue of
Windows or whatever your operating
system may be so in this case it's
really just a matter of saying yeah sure
go ahead and install that from the you
know cd-rom and there we go
we now have Ethernet and we're online we
has tubes right alright so I hope that
was insightful I hope I didn't just make
that even more confusing but yeah that's
that's what's going on that's my project
for this week we're going to be doing a
lot more with these servers as you guys
know with the hacker challenge I hope
