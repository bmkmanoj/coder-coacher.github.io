t-mobile in the Samsung Galaxy s3
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I'm getting into
some more Linux terminal 101 so we've
been working with all these commands so
far but what exactly is a command it's
either an executable program a built in
shell command like change directory CD a
shell function or an alias a command
that we define ourselves built from
other commands now how do you know what
kind of command you're using this is
easy with the type command you can type
in type and then the command so if I
wanted to find out what kind of command
type is I would type type type bet so
let's check that out if that isn't
enough types for one sentence so this
shows me that type is actually a shell
built-in command you can type LS type LS
and this shows me that it is an alias
command the which command will show us
where these commands exist on the system
for example which LS like so is going to
show me that the LS command is found in
slash bin slash LS the which command
won't work for built-ins or alias
commands that are substitutes for actual
executables that's one thing to remember
for example which CD gives me nothing
huh interesting now that we know what a
command is we can find out more info
about it and the help with the help
command which I've mentioned previously
in some other hack tips you can type in
help CD for change directory and this
gives me all sorts of information about
a built-in command called CD tack tack
help is another option that will display
the command supported syntax and some
options as well so if I type in mkdir so
make directory and then tack tack help
and enter I get a listing of all sorts
of options and descriptions for each one
now after the break we'll check out why
what a man is in why why it exists hmm
man
I'd like to thank t-mobile for
sponsoring this episode of hack tip in
fact this entire episode is being
recorded on the new Samsung Galaxy s3 on
t-mobile it's loaded with features like
a huge 4.8 inch screen an HD camera on
the back Samsung's new share shot and
all share to connect with the world
around you and so much more when
combined with t-mobile's 4G network the
Samsung Galaxy s3 will let you do things
that you would have never imagined head
over to bit ly slash spin2win h5 and
learn more and maybe even win a phone or
other Samsung products in their spin to
win contest
we're back with man no really there's a
program called man that will show you a
manual or a man page I don't know why
it's gone man manual yeah I guess it
works so for example let me clear this
out I can type in man LS and I'll get a
nice little listing of a manual of all
sorts of usage very cool and probably
very informative I can also type let's
quit out of there I can also type man
woman and obviously there is no manual
entry for woman get it I know
terrible joke you may find yourself
needing to find a specific section of a
manual if so you may need to search one
of the eight man sections you can type
man five passwd for example to search
for the manual page in section 5
regarding passwd so I'll type in Man 5
passwd and this looks in all the areas
of section 5 for the words passwd now
I've linked a site that has a really
good list of all the man page
organizations in the show notes and you
can search man pages as well with the
command apropos so you can type a propos
floppy for example to get a search of
everything that has the word floppy in
it so let's check that out
quit out of here again apropos floppy
and it gives me a nice short little list
of everything that has floppy in it just
like it should awesome also if you want
to just take
quick look at what a command does you
can type in what is and then the command
so if I type in what is LS it tells me
LS is the list directory contents
command it gives me a short and sweet
description of what LS is and if you
want more information about it you can
type in info information info huh easy
so I type in info LS and I get a whole
lot more in a description page about
that command probably a little bit too
much information than what I've really
actually needed now how did you guys
learn the terminal there are tons of
handy websites out there that really go
into detail about how to use it I'm
learning and I want you guys to learn
along with me so tell me about your
favorites in the comments and email me
at tips at hak5 org and be sure to check
out our sister show hak5 for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your Tecna Leste
yay well done with that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
