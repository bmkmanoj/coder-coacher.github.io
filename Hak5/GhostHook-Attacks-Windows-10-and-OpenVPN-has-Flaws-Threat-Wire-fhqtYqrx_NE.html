a cry is still alive and kick'n the
cia's brutal kangaroo hits the web and
openvpn has flaws so make sure to update
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I am Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for June 27 2017 this is
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom

really great way to contribute to all
your favorite podcasts and artists as
well and now on to the news Microsoft
has not been having the best of weeks
researchers at cyber-ark which is a
cyber security company that focuses on
threats found a new rootkit attack that
works against the newest forms of 64-bit
Windows operating systems including
Windows 10 the rootkit can bypass
built-in kernel protections found in
Windows 10 operating systems that are
called patch guard and device guard by
using a flaw that is found in newer
Intel processors called processor trace
or Intel PT for short cyber art calls
the bypass ghost hook which is a post
exploitation attack and this basically
means that the attacker must already
have some kind of access to the device
hence post exploitation Microsoft is not
planning to patch the issue at this time
since it would already have to be
exploited to work now Intel PP allows
security vendors to monitor commands
that work in the CPU so that they can
identify any kind of attacks that happen
before they actually hit the operating
system so it's actually a good thing but
because of the way that Intel PT
software talks to the operating system
and is implemented it allows for ghost
hook to secretly work without being
noticed according to cyber arc while
Microsoft isn't currently working on a
patch cyber-ark will work with security
vendors to ready patches along with this
ZDNet tested the new Windows 10 s
operating system that is now available
on new surface laptops to see how it
stacked up against its claims of no
known ransomware running on the
operating system they asked the security
researcher
hacker house named Matthew Hickey to try
it out Hickey was able to break the
security of Windows 10s in about three
hours that's all it took
now while 10's has no command prompt no
scripting tools no PowerShell or an
ability to download apps outside of the
App Store it actually sounds really
boring to me personally Hickey was able
to break the operating system by writing
an exploit and saving it in a Microsoft
Word document with macros enabled which
bypassed the app store restriction
eventually using Metasploit of course he
was able to get a shell with admin
privileges and download a payload
allowing him to own the box
Microsoft denied the claims and said
Windows 10s has no known ransomware
although I can see definite ways of
probably getting ransomware on there now
lastly epic tons of Microsoft source
code data was leaked online on Friday
along with images software details and
more to the sound of 32 terabytes of
information the data was available on
beta archive comm and was from
Microsoft's shared source kit including
data on Windows 10 PNP code the
operating systems USB and Wi-Fi stacks
storage drivers and kernel code as well
in the hands of the wrong people it
could be used to find vulnerabilities to
exploit in attacks the source code that
was released was for very specific
customers and partners with Microsoft
Windows obviously it was not for the
public and beta archive is scrubbing
much of the data from its site and
Microsoft did confirm the leak when a
cry has not been out of the news cycle
for very long but another rash of
victims has reported outages due to the
ransomware attack first office Honda
Motor Company who stopped production at
one factory in syama Japan for over 24
hours due to one of cry infections on
its network the syama plant manufactures
over 1,000 vehicles per day for Honda
and Honda shuts down the entire plant on
June 19th after finding the ransomware
they were back up and running about a
day later in according to Honda when a
cry was found on multiple systems across
their regions second wanna cry also just
hit 55 traffic light and speed cameras
in Victoria Australia via their private
camera operator red flex patches were
applied and the ransomware was removed
from the
acted cameras an official suspect a
targeted attack via a USB Drive as
opposed to something that just happened
it's not surprising that many different
businesses have probably not patched
their networks yet even though a fix is
available and the ransomware was first
reported on over a month ago
so patch your stuff another CIA tool has
been released by WikiLeaks in their
ongoing vault 7 leaks this one is called
brutal kangaroo brutal kangaroo makes up
a suite of tools that target Microsoft
Windows machines allowing for attacks
against air-gapped machine specifically
brutal kangaroo can be installed via an
internet connected machine inside of a
target network if a user sticks a USB
flash drive into the malware ridden
machine the drive is infected with
malware as well and then it can be moved
on to other air gapped machines without
their knowing by opening windows
explorer while the drive is plugged in
new malware is released onto the
computer now if multiple machines on a
network have brutal kangaroo malware
infections they will create a covert
network to coordinate attacks in
siphoned data
now since brutal kangaroo is a suite it
does come with several different tools
including one for the thumb drive
infection and one for automated
infections on servers it also comes with
a persistence mechanism along with a
post processor that automates processing
of different kinds of collected data
according to the documents certain
anti-malware products like ones from
Symantec and BitDefender would throw up
flags alerting a user about the harmful
malware so far the CIA has still not
come out and said that the documents are
real OpenVPN a popular VPN tool
available for free on several different
kinds of systems had two recent security
audits which were done on behalf of P ia
which is private Internet access in a
second by quarks lab with crowd funding
from the open source technology
Improvement Fund the two audits found
several different kinds of
vulnerabilities and patches were made
available for the critical issues about
a month later Guido
Rankin a security researcher from the
Netherlands found four more security
vulnerabilities and open VPN that were
not previously discovered by the two
audits now two of the vulnerabilities
are server-side issues and another is a
client-side bug that would allow an
attacker to
proxy access on the VPN the first
critical server-side one would allow a
remote attacker to authenticate with the
server send a fake certificate and then
cross the service or allow for remote
code execution
the second issue takes advantage of the
way Open VPN connects to the Windows
ntlm version 2 proxies this would allow
for a remote crash or stealing the users
password from the memory leak the last
two would allow for remote server
crashes and since all four of these
issues were reported to Open VPN patches
are already available so you can
download versions two point four point
three or two point three point 17 which
are both safe at least until another
security researcher finds new
vulnerabilities yay that's it for this
