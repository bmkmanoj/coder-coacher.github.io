Vegas a couple of rubber ducks here if
you want to use them no you had to they
were already set up so it's like yeah
those are set up to I don't remember
what payloads they're running though
okay I will definitely test this I have
no problem putting it into my computer
just what is the worst that could happen
just unplug it if it starts doing
anything really
nefarious yeah oh it's just hello world
I like that I want to use this payload
because this is just really okay here
unplug it already close that window yeah
yeah okay
basically the rubber ducky is the
keyboard I can't tie you know thirty
five thousand words a second this can
sew it when it plugs in it goes and says
I'm a keyboard and I'm typing it can
literally open up notepad and instead of
saying hello world write the program the
trojan or the malware write it save it
execute it and then go all done in
humanly fast because it's already
pre-recorded on the chip yeah so we
started this project about eight years
ago and we've since been refining the
the product for me the biggest
excitement is building tools like this
getting to see them used in the field
that's just like cream on the cake no
it's not at all I mean all of these
tools can be used for good or bad and is
just like you know guns and police have
guns in fact the you know law
enforcement and intelligence agencies
are some of our biggest customers so I
mean it really comes down to how you
want to employ the device what I do are
security awareness engagements I don't
actually physically take any of their
stuff I'm showing them the potential
without actually having them worry about
their data leaving their network
bringing a lot of these devices in and
showing the hello world that's not an
actual that's just payload it could have
been
my hope for tomorrow I would say like my
my you know my golden ticket would be
that Jason fails and I it says that's
not for me like I think Jason always
hopes that he fails it means that that's
a you know they are on point right so I
try to get caught it's always good to be
able to have that feeling that you know
that the next morning you're gonna have
lots of fun doing something that you
love something that you have a passion
about and the end result is not just the
fun that you're going to have but people
are better protected because of it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
