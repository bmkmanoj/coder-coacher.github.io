by fresh books welcome back to act by
I'm June is about to get herself
redefined radio on the pertain I wanted
to I wanted to kind of riff on your
trivia setup do you know what the first
can since you are talking about ABS B
and aviation related stuff and your
software-defined radio series um I
wanted to ask you if you knew what the
first female pilots were called oh yeah
um koalas koalas is absolutely correct I
can't believe you got that I am so clue
aviatrix aviatrix yeah that's a whole
name is yes aviator yeah I would name a
kid that yeah sounds like a superwoman
right
aviators yeah yeah no I was definitely
going with the Wonder Woman lust and
then you just brought kids into the
picture and yeah well I was something
new to show today and this is building
on top of my segment from last week
about the one using what was it SDR this
week I'm using something called a d SB
are you familiar I am familiar with a d
SB we actually should reference the
episode of PAC 5 that you should all
check out with render man who gave us a
look at con 20 about this awesome new
part of this system called next-gen
that's going to allow air traffic
controllers to cram more flights into
airports and overall increase the safety
of the whole network
yay we'll get into some interesting
intricacies of its security or lack
thereof later but uh but yeah a DSP let
stand for okay so it means automatic
dependent surveillance broadcast and
basically a DSP is a cooperative
surveillance technology for tracking all
sorts of different kinds of aircraft
whether that's the small ones or the big
ones so the aircraft determines its own
position and then it broadcasts this
over radio which is why we can pick it
up ad SB is one of the technologies that
was selected as part of the next
generation air transportation system and
the European cascade program surprised
Bret so this is why you know the FCC
tracks it
why a lot of different airplanes and
aircraft carriers use it so most
aircraft respond transponders transmit
data at a frequency of 1090 megahertz
yes they actually use a 978 megahertz
and notices your show dose that's for
general aviation so your little Cessna
172s and fun things like those yeah
interesting I didn't know that part yeah
but just for the big boys 1090 well they
can receive this transmission if you
want to you can receive it but you need
a receiver for this frequency like an ad
SB receiver yeah or in our case this $20
real rtl-sdr yeah which in this segment
is the ad SB receiver yes awesome so
it's very easy to use we'll be using
this SDR dongle of course send the hack
shop for like 20 bucks so super super
inexpensive and then we have a computer
running Windows 8 you can pretty much
run anything and to programs so the
first one is called a DSP scope and the
second one is called a DSP sharp so how
this works and the reason why you need
two different programs is because the
first part is your antenna so this is
where all the frequencies are coming in
all the electromagnetic waves the second
part is the SDR dongle the USB part that
you plug into your machine so this takes
the code and puts it into the first
program called ABS be sharp a DSP sharp
takes all that data that's going through
and decodes the data that has to do with
a DSB and turns it into an actual GUI a
nice front-end that gives you pretty
plain pictures which is a DSP scope ah
so that a DSP sharp thing that you're
talking about is actually decoding these
well their packets essentially but
they're known as a DSP frames if you
look at them actually like plot it on a
scope it looks like well it looks just
like a Wi-Fi packet and it does yeah
very similar sentence oh you got a
preamble you've got some header stuff
you've got you know the icao like
callsign of the plane and then you've
got the data payload I think it's like
56 bits it's really small this is just
like a tiny chirp that goes off once a
second from these aircraft and they just
say here's my longitude and latitude you
know that they got from GPS and so I
wonder if you're if you're just using a
regular software-defined radio
program will just show up as a you know
a really bright waterfall and a yeah you
could probably just pick it out of
waterfall but that's the nice thing
about this front-end program that you're
using a DSP sharp there's another one I
forget the name of it
it's something something ten ninety I
forget I was usually I was doing the
complex way you found it usually really
easy way to do this right I was using
another piece of open-source software
that was a lot more complicated but
essentially what you're doing is you're
decoding that frame that that packet of
data and then putting it into a sequel
light database that your front-end
system that plots it on the map can use
and access and yeah in fact a lot of
these systems here the stuff back with
flightradar24 really Finder net and a
bunch of other websites where you can
actually kind of contribute hey I saw
that and if you get enough people that
are saying hey that's all that above me
and then putting it all on the web then
you can have a worldwide network of hey
where all my plans are that's amazing
we're only looking at what you can see
with you're just looking at my location
my geolocation so the first thing you
want to do is download a DSP sharp and
I'll put the links down there in the
show notes and of course you need to
plug in your SDR dongle so I got my
dongle plugged in and on my computer
over here
I already unzipped the file and
everything so you just click on a DSP
sharp ok so this is the program running
it looks stupid simple but there's a lot
to it basically you want to keep all of
the default settings like they are right
now if you change them that might mean
that it's not able to transfer the
information over to a DSP scope and we
don't want that to happen for this
example so we're just going to keep
everything the same right now and go
ahead and hit start so once I hit start
you'll notice in a few seconds I'm also
noticing that you're on port 46 and 800
is that it yeah you could actually have
multiple a DSP sharp like that's true
obvious unit yeah so you could say take
a Raspberry Pi in a Pelican case and a
battery pack and a USB SD our dongle
rtl-sdr dongle and put them around
different places yes and that is true
over say a Wi-Fi network get access to
all of them so four seven eight oh six
for this example is the exact
port that I want to use for this exact
type of dongle and for this exact
program so I just kept all that stuff
the same the next thing you want to do
is download a DSB scope and of course
that link will be in the show notes as
well so I already have that one open I
already installed it in everything so
you just click on ad SB scope so when
this starts up its really big program so
I'm going to minimize it just a little
bit so you can see everything that's on
the screen okay so over here on this
side we see we have a map so you can
tell down here we have San Francisco
Richmond Oakland Berkeley yeah so it's
basically the entire the whole Bay Area
yay so I'm going to Center it around
here okay so this is what kind of what
the program is going to look like the
first time you start it up you have your
geolocation you want to move it around
with your mouse so that you get your
Center and then once you do that you
click over here the navigation and you
set your receiver location and it's
going to tell you this will change the
position it just changes it changes it
to Center it on the actual map on your
map on your GUI so I click OK and it
changes it to pinpoint right there so so
far everything's good right yeah close
enough I like it looks good so now you
want to change a couple of other
settings in here so first we're going to
go up here to other click on network and
then choose network setup also you're
just listening on localhost on that that
port number yes exactly so I see yes
seven zero zero one for the URL yeah
like I was saying those could be like if
there's other people like hosting these
online you can be turning into their
radios that's true yeah you can that's
crazy so much stuff is going on in the
air around you so my port number is the
same for seven 806 if you're using any
of these other SDR clients you can
choose those RTL 1090 that's what I
mentioned beast is another one ad SB
scope ad SB sharp is the decoder that
we're using so I click on that one if
your port number changes that's okay
because it's supposed to default to
whatever's correct for the program and
then you want to click on local because
you're running a DES
scope as well on the same machine hit
close okay
so that was the next step very very
simple so far good to go now we want to
go over to other again and then choose
network and change this over to raw data
client active okay now hopefully we
should start seeing some planes after a
few minutes of having this run Oh yep
just got a plane okay so you just got
some flames so this took about thirty
seconds or so for this to load up looks
like I can click on it okay okay so we
have you al 1483 United Airlines 1483
nation USA it's at ninety four hundred
feet thirty one thirty six feet per
minute wow that's fast so it must have
just taken off is the yeah it looked
nice to just taking off women down here
or Oakland yeah you're right
nice so we're all the way up in Richmond
and you're picking up from oh oh and
also a crazy little antenna isn't that
crazy
yes that little antenna I was gonna in
Oakland like you want me miles I I was
honestly like expecting at the end of
the segment to have to good you on to
build yourself like a quarter wavelength
antenna what you should do anyway let's
get some rg59 and make some I would be
fine but yeah Wow why isn't that crazy
absolutely impressed so as you keep this
running for like half an hour an hour
you're gonna start seeing planes going
all over the area and luckily we live in
a populated area we've got three we have
airport turnaround big airports plus we
have a whole bunch of like rich people
up in Napa that are flying around their
own little teeny tiny pool again that
would be where we would tune into 978
megahertz and that actually isn't
mandatory for every so we're seeing like
bigger airlines were saying you know
FedEx was a yes was a big I don't know
would you say like testbed for this I
mean the the integration for this have
been happening for the last decade and
will continue on until 2020 yeah so not
every airplane is going to have this
just right now that's just a lot of them
do I know it's so cool and then there's
a couple of different customization
things you can do in here as well that I
just wanted to mention you can change
the color
years of your map so if you find that
you have a lot of you know water around
you and you want to change your state
borders to be blue then you can do that
or if you like you really like pink then
you can change them to pink so you have
pink borders now see the plane it's
circling oh so cool yeah so awesome we
could totally transcend a little bit
east well we're gonna run out of range
though at a certain well yeah eventually
it'll just disappear so range rings
these are the rings around you let's see
if i zoom out yeah I see you've got a
bunch of aircraft now actually just over
there on the table yeah so these are all
a bunch of different aircraft that are
showing up not all of them are going to
show up on here just come it might be a
little bit out of range south of
Sausalito yeah there's another one yay
so yeah they keep on showing up for you
and you can customize this any way you
want you can't really break anything
once you have it going so you can just
change different ways that your map is
showing up if you want to there's tons
of different configurations that you can
use in here so I definitely suggest
checking those out and making it as
pretty as you want cuz it's really
really fun to watch these it's very
important that I think what you just
said is you can't break anything you can
freaking no no but I stress that with
these little $20 real tech dongles you
can't because these do not transmit so
feel free to use them for whatever
because you can't accidentally send a
packet yes that's true this is where I'm
just real quick want to make a tiny rant
which is to say I know that a lot of
times on hack 5 we have a lot of fun
nefarious fun with is em band stuff you
know rate a 2.4 gigahertz for example
Wi-Fi right little packet injection
totally cool never hurt anyone okay
never hurt anyone please okay so yes
technically speaking if you saw render
man's talk at Def Con or you've been
seeing some of the other research that's
been coming out of you know Nick Foster
and some of these other people this is a
totally unauthenticated and unencrypted
system do not end up in jail because you
decided to transmit a BS b packet out of
new radio telling aircraft control that
there was a flight called your mom
that's no good okay
oh my god please don't do that in fact
if you really are interested in getting
more into this radio stuff as we are as
well as I am listening side
you know like eavesdropped to your
heart's content that's totally legit but
a ARL org if you want to find out about
actually getting licensed in this regard
and would you have to be a ham that's
where you would get a ham yeah you start
there and find out your local club and
stuff like that but I just want to make
it perfectly clear that this is really
cool but these are you know big metal
shiny things with people inside of them
and that's not something you want to
hack so this is all days some yeah I
just want to point that out in a little
cya because it is like there's there's a
lot of interesting research that's going
on in this ad SB stuff I can't believe
it's totally unauthenticated random and
pointed out a whole lot of awesome acts
that are a potential for as far as like
jamming or injection attacks where you
could spoof another plane closer to
another thing there's a similar system
called tks that alerts planes in air of
other obstacles that relies on a fixed
fixed delay that you could do a what is
it called a timing attack where you
could actually like spoof that there's
another plane closer to this and
actually on some Airbus aircraft
actually get the autopilot to make
evasive maneuvers to aircraft that
aren't actually there so yeah it's
really kind of scary in that regard to
just be careful and be legal but this is
really cool and I feel like this is the
kind of stuff that's going to usher in
like you know as air travel gets less
expensive and and you know more and more
people are flying and we've got like a
limited amount of runway and stuff that
that this is going to allow for like
tighter separation of planes and allow
you know just just going to be better
for everybody but I just wanted to make
sure that we cover that and also to
point out there that I have the utmost
respect to everyone at the FAA that and
especially everybody in the towers those
air traffic controllers do not get
enough respect my god uh friend that
does that yeah you have a Missouri
really yeah stressful job uh yeah you
ever listened to um you can actually
listen to I forget that I forget the
name of a live ATC net is an awesome
site where you can actually just go
ahead and tune in to say you know boss
actually Newark listen to Newark just
listen to the or and and you'll thank me
later
cuz that is a fun just go ahead and
listen to the ground clearance on that
man they have a tough job ahead of them
so they don't need hackers screwing
around with it what they need are people
like render man who are pointing out
some of these vulnerabilities and trying
to you know say get the FAI to I don't
know listen and maybe make some
modifications before a a giant
unencrypted and unauthenticated system
is put into place worldwide I that
somebody with the wrong intent could
have new various fun with yeah yeah well
thank you for that spiel sorry I'm not
trying to step on your segment I'm just
saying this is really really what I love
watching all of that stuff but I I know
it's a hacking show but please don't
hack the friendlies guys ya don't have
the friendly skies hey check this out I
want to show you something this is
pretty cool on my computer mm-hmm see
that big one yeah this is is it a hasty
nine nine eight huh huh so it's what
who's that Pacific I don't know pa c919
in the other program that I was using
and we'll have to show this off later
there's another front-end that you can
use to visualize all of these had the
ability to click on the plane and then
do a Google Maps query of the tail
number because if you if you Google that
tail number you're gonna find out that
exact plane and maybe it's like an a380
or something that's really wonder if
there's a way to do these addisam I
don't know if I can zoom that straight
from here yourself I'm looking through
all the different logs I don't think
there's a way to do that straight from
thee
sure but you see the registration number
it says registered November 4 5 0 papa
alpha
yeah so you just put in n450 PA into
google image search and you would see a
bird that's awesome yeah okay
I'm geeking out again I'm a bit of an
aviation nut um
but yeah it's fun yes okay this is too
much fun and so let us know what you
think yeah of course and let me know if
you use a different program for ATS
because I think it's really cool and
this one was very very easy I used
a guide online that was not from the
original websites links you'll have all
the stuff right yeah I'll write that
below and yeah let me know what you
think in the feedbacks at hack fives and
dot works with that we're gonna take a

week and this one comes from Daniel he
sends us this drawing that he created
for hack five and he said I love the
flashback episode let the hilarity
continue also please do more funny skits
and bloopers there's something uniquely
hak5 and set you apart from everyone
else like this guy now on a different
note I've attached your Christmas
present I drew it hope you enjoyed it
it's called the spy pineapple that's so
cool
I love it when people give us art like
that it's awesome thank you so much for
sending that in Daniel and of course if
you have photos you can send those to
feedback at hak5 org
and use the subject line techno west
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of hack 5 beep beep oh we get
going we have he doesn't know what's
going on what is going on feedback at
hack 5 org that's where you can let us
know what you think of the show what you
don't like to see on the show like him
and then what you'd like to see us cover
every single week ever for the rest of
our lives
yes also we have a gift from a fan we do
yes so maybe we should this is actually
from it's a it's a gift for you and it's
from your biggest fan who is me and this
is a hack 5 toy which I would encourage
you to have fun with it is from ettus
research what and now everybody's
nodding I don't know what is this it's a
floppy it's a 5-footer
Wow ok and you still don't know what it
is yes sir just uh it's just a micro ITX
board and oh boo does computers this who
is this for me is it a home PC it's a
computer bits actually the little bits
that are most important oh let's say we
have that's a USB dongle
we have our cables we have antennas yes
for antenna oh why do you have a Wi-Fi
pineapple antenna in here no no that's
just this is very the only one this is
from like no days it's just an SMA
antenna and so are these and they plug
into the minutes okay
the USRP what is a USRP it's a universal
Siri uh yeah it's hey ya hear us are P
universal software radio peripheral
that's yeah that's a big SDR dongle does
lots of frequencies oh this is gonna be
so much fun so this is just to encourage
as you're getting into radio - you're
gonna get me in so much trouble no cuz
she is not going to transmit and we will
stay on is M yay
I'm so excited oh thank you you're
welcome hey make pakka d5 radio back
don't talk back I've got a hack RF in
the car - I just didn't go so fun oh I'm
so excited oh I have stuff in my car - I
need to bring up cool okay
anyway look let's take a hike five field
trip down to Shannon's car and we'll see
you know what's in her trunk fun dead
bodies now of course we always value
everything that you guys share with us
so you can always email us but you can
also follow us if you want to we have a
Twitter accounts and the Facebook's and
the Google pluses and all of those links
are at hack 5 charge slash follow yes
and I would like to thank everybody who
has directly funded this show by going
over to hack shop comm that's where you
can find all sorts of fun gadgets like
USB rubber duckies and Wi-Fi pineapples
these twenty dollar SDR radios if you
want to follow along at home and um
thank you so much because it supports
hack five as well as hack tip and
Metasploit minute and my beer money and
allows us to continue doing what we do
and we love you for making this happen
so thank you so much yes I agree
it helps us pay for things like beer and
with that she's Shen unless I'm Shannon
I'm done in kitchen
I chose don't like no last yeah oh what
a people server
cool Oh actually there is what I found
evil so welcome back good well gonna
head back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
