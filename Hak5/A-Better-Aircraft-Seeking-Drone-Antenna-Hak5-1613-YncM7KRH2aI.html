by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
it's your weekly dose of techno list and
we've been doing so much fun stuff with
SDR we've actually gotten a lot of good
feedback now we've got two concurrent
series going on right now our SDR series
and our drone series and we're gonna see
both of those converge with a whole
bunch of other really cool technology
and I figured today we're gonna continue
failing forward continue failing good we
fail on a weekly basis which is why
we're ahead
we don't necessarily fail every week but
we learn from the different things that
we've been researching in if this was
our first episode it would be worse than
if it were as it is now coming up on our
ninth year you believe that Def Con we
hope to see you at Def Con we're gonna
have awesome party yeah yeah party yes
sure no details forthcoming but so why
don't we get right into it with the
feedback yes we have a ton of feedback
both between some of the what was it a
DSP stuff we were doing and some of the
other radio so you wanted take it away
take the first one yes so this one comes
from Inuyasha and he said the auto gain
for the rtl-sdr is still little buggy so
the best way to get good performance is
to use manual gain the best way to
configure the game needed in your
location is to first tune to the a DSP
frequency using SDR sharp then in the
settings for your SDR adjust the gain
manually until you either notice the
floor noise floor increase slightly or
some a DSP signals start to clip
whichever comes first
once you get that make not make make
note of the game used and set the a DSP
application to use that game here in New
York doing this has taken the tight the
frame rate from around 150 to well over
400 using the stock antenna Wow pretty
much centered between three different
airports
okay OSA speaking that explains it
that's that's an amazing frame rate and
yeah we have actually discovered that
exactly what you're talking about here
it is it's not the greatest but then
again we're talking about a $20 radio
dongle that was meant to pick up TV
stations and you can also use to do all
of this other stuff so
a small price to pay but I think it's
something to note for sure and we're
going to take that into account today
when we try this again we're not we're
not at an altitude of 3,800 feet we're
actually pretty close to sea level in
fact but we're still going to have a
good test I got one here I have one here
from Chris and Chris writes to say hey
guys got a couple of thoughts on your
ATSB test one I think that much beyond
eight links in your antenna would be
fairly fruitless due to the cable loss
from which the antenna is composed of
yes in fact we are now down to simply
two elements in our coaxial collinear
like this is where the rubber meets the
road in radio all the time is like
theoretically yes if we have 16 segments
it's going to be awesome if we got 32
segments it's going to be banging
however much over the lawyer it gets you
get a little bit less you get more noise
the larger yeah it's it's just salt
problems all around so we're gonna keep
it simple to 400 feet is really pushing
it for Wi-Fi without good directional
antennas which we have here on our
pineapple drone and we're going to be
using a yogi
Budhan array on the ground station good
call
starting to look a little ridiculous it
is 2 3 the side of the van makes an
excellent reflector which will provide
some gain for some instances which may
be why when the drone was lower and in
front of the van we were picking up a
lot of stuff and then once we got into
the sky nothing it was there too
one of the many reasons in fact we will
get to sow all really good stuff and
then forth Chris points out that the
drones high current motors and their
electronic circuits which he assumes
work under PWM or pulse width modulation
and yes they do make a lot of EMI or
electromagnetic interference and that
would reduce the sensitivity of this
software-defined radio ok and he further
goes on to explain that it's a very wide
band 2 dongle like we've said this is
this dongles mainly used to pick up
digital TV broadcasts however it's also
happens to be very wide as I forget the
the frequency range something like
what 60 megahertz to 1.3 gigahertz it's
really really wide and so what we would
be better off doing is having a bandpass
filter in place and that would reject
everything that's not around 1090
megahertz okay
so we can say like I'm only interested
in this frequency you know everything
else through UTF oh yeah right so thank
you Chris
that's cool okay ready for the next one
yes all right so this one follows along
with that this is from kome and he says
hey everybody just think about why you
like the signal from the airplanes when
the drone took the antenna up in the air
my questions would be a was it caused by
the drone changing its position into the
air V or was it caused by the distance
between the drone and the laptop getting
farther C or is there any chance that
the drones control signal interfered in
any way or D how about the drones gyro
and motors being more active and
interfering higher in the sky if it's B
you can experiment by moving the laptop
away from the drone by drone I mean the
DGA DGI and the Wi-Fi pineapple plus
rtl-sdr an antenna without launching the
drone you can then pick up the laptop
and start walking away from it to see if
the number of signals drop very good
point
and as for C so that one's about the
drones control signal interfering you
can keep the drone hovering right next
to the laptop while walking away with
the drone controller so you could
actually figure out if that's an issue
I'm a software engineer not very versed
in e/m interference so I'm listing
everything I can think of I'm curious if
the Wi-Fi pineapple or any part in the
drone changes its behavior ie increasing
power or such when it gets farther away
in the possibility interferes with the
antenna I know the radio bands are all
different but we are dealing with very
weak signals aren't we
or it could be the obvious one a the
drone just happened to fly in front of
one of those big microwave antennas
which is totally possible anyway I hope
you can experiment somewhere like in a
nearby parking lot or park in fact out
as far as like flying in front of those
giant microwave antenna array things
essentially the bandpass filter that I
just spoke of would help in that
instance and also some of those are at
crazy like hundreds
wotz like hundreds so it's kind of crazy
to think like our poor little pineapple
they're just it didn't stand a chance
pineapple but we learned a lot we dumb
and to that effect I wanted to read
John's emails ear he says that ran
across the show a few days ago and just
had a few minutes to watch the one about
the 400 foot quad antenna first awesome
episode you always learn more from
failure than from success I know I feel
like all the time I'd make it absolutely
does we just don't know his document all
of it
second I predict that when you test both
parts of the antenna when you get back
both of them will be electrically
perfect and yes the antenna is great
there's nothing wrong with the antenna
so third he's pretty sure that the
problem wasn't a software or radio
interference problem yeah so he's quite
convinced that I just rediscovered
something that's common with this kind
of radio setup and that is documented
and easily fixed and I should be able to
easily surpass the results we're seeing
from the van antenna episode so it turns
out we don't have a ground at all really
well I know when it flies it's obviously
not grounded but right because it's in
the sky and there's a way to to fix this
Paul can you pause for don't pause the
cameras I have I forgot the name of the
thing what's the name Lee counterpoise
counterpoise thank you thank you
you'll want to get tight on this or we
knew and b-roll okay so what we've done
is actually added to here's our our
two-part coaxial collinear okay two
elements yeah but this guy coming off
the end this little dongle here this is
actually a half wavelength oh yeah and
it's got a special name here it's called
a counterpoise counterpoise thank you
essentially this is going to act as the
ground because this will be way off the
ground weird yeah and it is at a half
wavelength so since we were talking
about 1090 megahertz that's 27 and a
half centimeters so this
is half of that and it's literally just
a pigtail this is like what 16-gauge
yeah now this is it's just 18 gauge wire
that has been soldered on to a circular
connector and put in line with the SMA
where the SMA reaches the f-type that's
funny has just been screwed on to there
that's it that's all you need and that
should serve because a lot of times what
will happen is your body in fact can act
as that ground sorry I'm learning a lot
of really cool stuff here as far as
that's concerned and that's one of the
things that we'll be testing today
because I think that make may make a
huge difference I think it will yes and
as such we should probably get into the
sky should we is there one more for this
I got one okay one more go through yes
all right so this one is from dick who
is apparently a ham he said just watched
your last go at a DSB aircraft watching
on top of the mountain your problems
were caused by overloading the dongle
the dongles are by nature a very wide
receiver no front and filtering etc the
top of a mountain is used for many
different services including 900
megahertz I would have expected you to
have all sorts of problems with
everything from 120 megahertz to up to 4
gigahertz in that environment you could
if you could find a place like your last
one without the antenna farm you could
see many airplanes out of 275 miles or
so I have a DSB receiver at 50 feet here
in Phoenix Arizona
I see aircraft 200 miles away one way to
expand your distance would be to use
something called a preamp with the
receiver inside the preamp box the
preamp use is an SI w filter assault
filter to keep the other signals from
getting to the dongle while boosting the
desired signal about 20 decibels away so
give it a try we need to get some
bandpass filters and some preamps cuz
that's great it's all about like getting
better data into our dongle before we
even start processing any of that stuff
so this is something we're investigating
and we'll come back to those so I guess
today what we're doing is we've upgraded
I'm gonna fly our ground dish it's not a
ninja turtle this turtle is holy no no
this is not a shell this is prototype in
fact of pineapple drone stuff we're
working with Peter to build a
open-source paparazzi day
yes wait paparazzi I hate popper no
steals everything this is a good
paparazzi this is a open source flight
controller and as part of the series
that we're currently in with Peter
building an awesome completely unmanned
aerial system with autonomous features
instead so today I'm actually gonna be
following all of this manually because
all we're doing is lifting up our
pineapple with our SDR with our coaxial
collinear now
with our Center help me out here
counterpoise are counterpoise and I
don't know for some reason I'm blanking
on that all day plus we have our panel
antennas pointed down to our ground
station so we should have a reliable
link there okay and yeah so why don't we
just go ahead and fire it up and
serenity let's do it do you remember
your first domain name mine was GWD
Gamescom I wanted GWD calm but it was
taken we were the great white doughnut
we had a really awesome land party clan
back in the 90s it was it was killer it
was rad we played UT 99 anyway that's
not what's important what's important is
that you can snag yourself a killer
domain name in no time at all over at
domain.com because they've got that
quick domain discovery system and an
easy checkout process and honestly your
website will be up and running in no
time at all
I love domain comm because it's
affordable reliable it's easy to use and
they are so active on social media it
really makes it a fun place to do
business you can tweet at them in fact
you can tweet at both of us tweet at
hak5 Darren and at domain.com and let us
know your first domain name was it a 90s
first person shooter clan anyway the
guys over at domain.com huge fans of
hack 5 and so they want to hook you up
with an extra 15% off that's right all
you have to use is the coupon code hak5
at checkout so when you think domain
names think domain.com use a flat cannon
all right so drones powered on
pineapples
up and running yes we have power main
screen turn on so and we're ssh into the
pineapple yes there we go so just make
sure to point the yogi in that direction
yogi aunt at enemy yes and let's go
ahead and to Tim ten ninety now we're
setting the games specifically now yes
cuz we don't want it to meander decibels
yes and then interactive was that that's
going to give us a readout now we could
use the infusion but again we don't have
internet access out here at the park and
so we don't have the nice pretty Google
map to plot it all on
however we will get like a nice little
it kind of looks like air dump if you're
familiar with that like finding access
points except instead of access points
we're talking about yes so let's go
ahead and fire it up enter a three are
this plane for yep those planes now it's
showing us all yep let's give it a
moment to normalize while it's on the
ground let's see a one two three four
five six alright so we've waited a
couple of minutes we only see six planes
let's see if we go up we get some more
all right time for me to aim and fire I
should probably turn this on hang on too
bad there's not bullets in here so I
could be like pew pew pew
there we are Paul so we've got quite a
bit of payload on here and I haven't
really upgraded the battery system so
this is gonna be a short flight but I'll
get us to pretty high altitude which I
can see in here and anyway we go
how we looking Shannon Oh looking good
more planes yeah just a few but
definitely a few more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6
well they didn't all disappear as soon
as we know they didn't we're holding
steady nice we're holding steady with
the yagi pointed straight at it okay and
still holding steady we have about seven
right now okay
and we're gonna have to bring it back at
200 feet okay yep it's just way too
windy up there right now hey Paul you
want to get this coming down fast
oh that dog is totally gonna eat it look
at the dogs oh I actually can't lift it
any higher Paul I'm at max throttle oh
you're good you're over the fence yeah
yeah you're good there we go
this dogs got really excited all right
wow that went way quicker than I thought
so that was fun that alarm you're
hearing is um the matter Edina battery
yes so lesson learned all right it's
time for an octocopter
oh we're just gonna have to do that can
we get one for dogs today we're gonna
have to go with big props huh that was
cooled so we we kept steady around six
to eight okay Plains so is it a
noticeable improvement I mean it was
noticeable in that we didn't just lose
everything as soon as we shot leaving
Scott we continued to get the same
amount and it was pretty steady the
entire time okay I think we've learned a
few things but I still want to put it on
a bigger airframe yeah take it back to
the same place yes Lauren do a lot more
maths cuz we're gonna need some of those
bring a dog bring a couple of pups yeah
that would help yes and then do it again
in the same location with a bandpass
filter so we're gonna try to keep as
many variables the same as in fact I was
really surprised because this is
actually a carbon-fiber frame yeah
carbon-fiber has a tendency to absorb
some of those radio signals but like
yeah so I tried to keep everything away
from the frame as much as possible still
yeah okay I would say in that it wasn't
an epic failure that it was a win but we
definitely need to make some upgrades
before I can confidently put this at 400
feet definitely yeah okay I'll say let's
do that it's that off cuz I look crazy
so my vocals are staring at us
yes with that we would love to hear your
feedback and there's one place you can
do it it's either down below in the
comments or feedback at hack
Dorgan and hack shop a JK shop.com
yeah like all sorts of cool stuff
including the real tech st ours and
we've got your own pineapple now oh yeah
there's the pineapple configure rates
were cool as well as hack RF which we're
gonna be getting into on the show you
make just you know yeah Mike emailed me
to just to let me know he just sent me
one so I've got yeah that's gonna be fun
I'll be awesome and what else oh you
should come to tour camp tour camp org
all I'm gonna say is I had a samosa
nearly geek spiritual experience there
two years ago a little bit and it was
amazing if you like camping if you're
into anything geekery related you just
you can't find a more wholesome
community and I encourage everybody to
go in and check out tour camp org
because it it's just words can't
describe it I'll come up with some
better words for next time but
essentially I will see you there and it
is going to be epically not gonna want
to miss this I don't like going outside
okay well you can stay here with your
air conditioning but yeah and Def Con
where I can stay inside yes ac yeah
there's there's less there's uh anyway
good stuff no bugs right well there are
bugs at shmoocon but they're not of the
nevermind ha different right story I
think that's about it yes that does wrap
up this week's episode of hack 5 um and
without further ado i'm darren kitchen
I'm Shannon Morse
trust your techno lust trust you'll
triple lost
oopy love you oh I heard a bird that was
making that exact sound what yeah it was
the puke you bird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
