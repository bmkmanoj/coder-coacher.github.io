you by domain.com hello welcome back
five my name is Darrin Kitchener two
weekly dose of Technology we're building
a 60 watt point-to-point Wi-Fi link
that's right yeah you guys know I love
Wi-Fi we've talked to the odd about it
in the past the is M bands the rules for
the different regulatory domains for
example how in the United States on 2.4
gigahertz were limited channels one
through eleven whereas Europe special
and they get to use 12 and 13 or Japan
is really cool and they can use channel
14 well today I'm continuing that
conversation with a fun new mesh
networking project the mission here is
actually to relay the hak5 network
across town using a point-to-point 2.4
gigahertz link and so typically when we
talk about 2.4 gigahertz we understand
that your typical base station or access
point if you will is limited to well one
watt of power but it's effectively 14
watts that's because of what's known as
a I R P or equivalent isotropically
radiated power now it's a mouthful but
basically it's the theoretical output of
the radio combined with the gain of the
antenna so in the 2.4 gigahertz an
access point typically configured for
point-to-multipoint meaning it's going
to serve multiple clients at once it's
limited to a 30 DBM output plus a 60 B I
gain antenna I know okay so like boom
right in we're start talking a bunch of
techie stuff let's go ahead and define
these terms so DBM
that is basically the power output in
decibels
to milliwatts
and that's the actual transmit power of
the radio now whereas when we talk about
antennas we talk about dbi so DB I is
actually well it's the decibel decibels
isotropic now that's the forwarding gain
of the antenna so
now II IRP is what the actual transmit
power of the full system so and I should
really preface this by saying that when
we have this conversation we're talking
about here in the United States with the
FCC so depending on where you are in the
world your jurisdiction it's all going
to be a little bit different but at
least here in the US this is the way
that it works and the e IRP you know of
the transmitter system it's the radio
and the antenna combined it's calculated
by basically just adding the output DBM
plus the antenna gain in DB I so your
typical base station with a 30 DBM radio
and a 6 DB I gain antenna will have a
total a IRP of 36 DBM which is 1 watt
now just as a little cheat sheet we're
going to go ahead and get them some
common DBM 2 Watts here because we're
going to reference those but basically
we have our DBM here and our Watts here
what we'll end up with is say 24 DBM is
a quarter watt whereas say 27 would be a
half watt then of course we've got 30
which is 1 watt got 36 just 4 watts
we've got say 39 which would be 8 watts
of power you could go all the way up to
40 we've got 16 it's kind of a bell
curve here 42 would be 1644 would be 25
and 46 would be 40
and 48 would be 62 and finally let's
just stop here at 50 would be a hundred
watts how awesome is that okay so you
might be thinking to yourself this is
sweet
let me just go ahead and hook up
something like a nine dbi antenna to a
radio at 30 DBM and well that'll give me
eight watts of power I'll be I'll be
right here at 39 not quite okay so the
FCC rules in addition to part fifteen
are as such when it comes to 2.4
gigahertz here in the US the max power
output is 30 DBM or 1 watt right here
okay so your radio can't exceed this the
actual output of your transmitter stays
there
whereas the maximum ERP must be 36 DBM
so that's right here which is actually
effectively 4 watts so to put that in
perspective you could have a 30 DBM
radio paired with a 6 DB I gain antenna
to achieve that maximum 36 debe ir d BM
e IRP right or you could say have a 27
DBM radio or a you know that's a that's
a half watt radio and couple that with a
9 DB i gain and that would give you 36
again effectively 4 watts that is the
limit however there's a fun third rule
which is actually the most interesting
to us because it's an exception for
fixed point-to-point links so what that
means is where we actually have a
station-to-station backhaul we can
exceed that 36 DBM limitation and it
works something like this so as opposed
to point-to-multipoint where is your
typical access point serving like all of
these different people we can actually
say listen if we've just got this
rooftop transmitter and that rooftops
transmitter and we just need to get like
a little backhaul between these two guys
we can go ahead and increase our ERP our
affective total output by this little
formula here what it is is for everyone
dbm of power that we reduce from the
radio from that beginning maximum of 30
we can actually add 3d via a 3d VI of
gain to the antenna so for example if we
were to lower our power output from that
32:29 instead of using our typical six
dbi antenna we could actually use a nine
dbi antenna which would give us 38 DBM
of our totally IRP our total output but
which is actually about six watts which
is a lot better than four likewise
so that would be let's see let's go
ahead and paint that here I'm going to
use green for our DBMS so that would be
if we were using a twenty nine and
coupling it with a 9 DB I gain so this
is our DB I and that would be nine
whereas twenty nine is our the B M or
the output power of the radio and that
would give us that total there of let's
go ahead and do that in black of 38 DBM
so 38 which is six watts
I mean furthermore we could go ahead and
say drop it down even further we could
drop it down to 27 which is actually a
half watt so at 27 we can go ahead and
couple that with eight twelve dbi
antenna which would give us a total of
40 DB m e IRP which is effectively 10
watts and you can see how this can keep
going if for example we were to go ahead
and drop this to 26 DBM we'd could put
in a 28 dbi antenna and that's 44 DBM
total which is 25 watts we could in fact
go just a little bit lower than fact
this is where I find to be the sweet
spot for my particular application and
that is actually to come down here to 24
DBM output which is a quarter watt right
and couple that with a 24 dbi antenna
which is going to give us 48 decibel DBM
e IRP which is effectively 62 watts now
as you can imagine you know we've talked
about this in the past with a bunch of
the other Wi-Fi food stuff this is
actually pretty easy to achieve I mean
basically in Linux you know typically
it's just a matter of setting your
regulatory domain and then setting the
TX power so for example you would you'd
first do if config let's say W LAN 0 is
our interface and we'd set that to down
so bring our radio down we're going to
set iw reg set that's setting a
regulatory domain to in this case us for
United States and then we can use iw
config and then again W land 0 is our
interface and we can go ahead and set
the TX power to in this case 24 DB M and
then with all of that it's just a matter
of doing an if config wlan0 up so once
we've brought our Wi-Fi interface up
it's going to go ahead and start
transmitting at 24 DBM and then we just
plug it in with a very nice directional
20 24 DB I gain antenna and we can use
that for our point-to-point link legally
creating a 60 decibel or a 60 watt Wi-Fi
link which is fantastic in fact coupled
that with the the Wi-Fi pineapple mark 5
which we're going to be using in this
case you know we can actually take all
of those commands here and then string
those together as a boot mode using the
dip switches so that whenever we have
those dip switch is loaded it's going to
go ahead into that mode and what's
really cool about the mark 5 is since we
have two distinct
videos here on the same board one of
them say our radio zero can be set for
24 DBM and we can couple this we can
unscrew this guy and then you know grab
ourselves here like now one of these is
actually what is this guy this guy is 14
right so we would actually be able to
say I don't know where would that be
that'd be around 26 26 and 14 would be
good but even with a larger one we can
go ahead and just you know couple these
guys together right and then our radio
one here we can actually leave as is at
30 because we haven't changed the
antenna we're still using the 60 VI game
and that would be for a
point-to-multipoint so it would have
this really nice backhaul you know just
point-to-point link going at 60 watts
and then we can you know legally and
then we can also legally use the other
interface here to go ahead and create
our point-to-multipoint
at a nice happy for watts
ERP so this is something that we're
going to be getting into soon and of
course I welcome your comments on this
so please email feedback at hak5 org but
until then let's go ahead and check out
this preliminary system and then as we
get more into this series we'll be
adding some nodes and I can't wait to
see where this goes
so again feedback at hak5 org
no I'm gonna have to call you back
actually hang on just second you know it
really doesn't matter if you're a monkey
in the middle or a hacker working for
bananas you've got that killer idea when
it hits you need to snag that domain
name and the web hosting fast with
domain coms quick domain discovery
system it's easy to check out and having
a website up and running no time I mean
I love tomato comm they're affordable
reliable easy to use and they're on
social media at domain.com on twitter it
makes it a really fun place to do
business because there are huge fans of
hak5
so they've got to hold up get this 15%
off they're already affordable domain
names and web hosting I have to do use
the coupon code hak5 a check out that's
right they've got the hook-up hak5 so in
you think domain names think domain.com
yeah no 40 tons of bananas
we're back and now it's time for the
trivia question of the week so last
week's trivia question was spaceship
earth
the iconic Disney World Epcot attraction
was designed by which sci-fi writer and
the answer was Ray Bradbury now this
week's question is what is the name of
the MIT graduate and NASA scientist who
in 1991 designed a virtual reality
system to drive Mars rovers from Earth
an apparent real-time despite the
substantial delay of Mars Earth Mars
signals you can answer that at hak5 org
slash trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack 5 goodies that just about
wraps up this week's episode of hack 5
of course this being the first in this
big project very excited to be start
doing some mesh networking stuff looking
forward to your feedback so feedback at
hack 5 dot org course follow us on all
the social networks PAC 5 dollars has
fallen for all of the links and a check
a shop comm to support us directly very
excited bunch of new announcements so
