assist welcome back tip the show where
we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and today I'm
checking out netcat for file transfers
now since we've covered how to get in
that cat and how to use it for chats
we're going to delve a little bit
further this week with file transfers
now normally you would use FTP or
another option to transfer files but if
none of those are available netcat
offers an easy way to transfer files of
pretty much any kind so let's say I have
a text document and I need to get it
from my Windows computer over to my
Linux one and I'm Way too lazy to walk
over to my office or up the stairs
because well I'm a nerd I just want to
sit down at my computer and play games
now I open netcat on the Windows machine
and mine is located in the Documents
folder so I'm going to go over to my
Windows machine and so I'm going to
change my directory over to documents
and if I look in here I see netcat Exe
is there I'll type in netcat NC Tech age
to make sure it's running correctly
alright so I'm ready to go on this one
okay
so I have this text document on my
desktop that I want to get transferred
over to my Linux pace PC so this is
located in Shannon desktop and then it's
called techno les dot txt so on my
Windows machine again and this is
considered the listener I'm going to
type in the into the command line so
over here I'm going to type in NC Tech V
Tech W 30 and then the port 3 1 3 3 7
Tech L less than techno lust
dot txt now let's break these down
first off NC is netcat Tech V means
verbose using tech V gives you feedback
during an operation on the screen Tech W
30 tells netcat to wait 30 seconds
before timing out after a transfer is
initiated it will also terminate the
connection 30 seconds after the transfer
is complete and again tac p31 337 is the
port Tech L means this PC is the
listener and the angle bracket
inequality sign less than alligator
carrot whatever you want to call it
means that you're taking the file and
pushing it through to the listener
machine now that we understand the
transfer side let's look at the
recipient after the break working in IT
means constantly jumping from one
problem to the next each issue needs to
be solved fast and every minute counts
so don't waste your time juggling
different tools and duplicating data

let's go to assist com promo code hak5
on my Windows computer but we haven't
initiated it by pressing enter just yet
so first let's take a look at my Linux
machine which will receive the
transferred file this is what we will
type on the Linux machine first off
you'll type in NC 4 netcat tak v-tach w2
10 dot 70 3.30 1.179 3 1 3 3 7 the port
greater than and then techno list dot
txt so again what does this mean it
means NC is netcat so you're opening
that cat Tech B is verbose Tech W 2 is
wait two seconds before canceling the
transfer if there is a loss of
connection this is not the same as the
listener peach PC which was 30 seconds
because you are more likely to get an
error on the listener side than the
client so we are going to give the
listener 30 seconds wait time instead of
2 and of course you can vary this
depending on your own needs
now the IP address is my Windows machine
with the same port 3 1 3 3 7 and then
the carrot the greater than tech no less
txt means we are taking what my Windows
machine outputs or is offering and then
outputting it to a new tech no less txt
file now once we press ENTER on both
machines first the listener and then the
client if all goes well you should see a
few updates so let's go ahead and do
that I press ENTER on Windows press
ENTER on the other machine
okay so it now tells me that that port
is open for that IP address and after a
few seconds I should see it update and
go back to my normal command prompt now
you'll notice on my Windows machine it
says it has connected the snubs aspire
which is my Linux machine and then it
goes to my command prompt so that
basically means that it is finished now
if you want to make sure that everything
has transferred over to your Linux
machine to the client correctly then you
just need to type in for this text txt
document I'll just type in cat and then
techno last txt and it gives me the
output of the txt files so yeah I know
it works now make note that netcat will
overwrite a file if it is of the same
name or you can append a file with two
greater than signs or carrots or
alligators or whatever you choose to
call them now do you use net cat send me
