pineapple gets a major man-in-the-middle
revamp backtrack Bien's data recovery
credit card validation and check sums
all that and more this time on hack 5
the segment of fact 5 is brought to you
by goto assist Express hello welcome to
hack 5 my name is darren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse of course your weekly dose
of techno list and it's delicious it's a
delicious you know where I went this
weekend where'd you go I went to San
Diego oh how was that it was pretty good
yeah it just went down for a couple of
days to visit family but I enjoyed it it
was nice to get away for a little bit
yeah yeah yeah now I'm back working hard
on the hat back on on day number 63
happy day 6 oh yes it's 11-11-11 happy
Veterans Day
when we're recording this is also for
you hex fans out there day 0x3 out oh
man I forgot to tweet at eleven eleven
eleven at 11:00 11:00 a.m. at eleven
eleven in a seconds oh yeah both at the
habitat p.m. so there you go this who
uses 24-hour time but yeah military time
I know
Paul Paul up back there it's like yeah
that and the rest of the international
audience you know this is just like this
weird stream just a little ball of
deliciousness I mean did we get any
gifts we did actually we got a box of
gifts yeah I'm like I'm getting excited
for every a block because it's kind of
heavy
this is sounds yeah this is a gift from
cool dusty Jonathan he says I'm huge fan
learned a lot I especially like the hack
tips I work for a industrial printing
equipment repair shop one of the
technicians was recently fired and he
was a bit of a hoarder when he left we
filled two Gaylords with a dead or
couplet useless old junk for example he
saved about 10 10 kilobytes per second
nix and this box of CPUs why would you
keep a 10-gallon kilobit a second Nick I
don't know this is so little
- well the one thing about these p2s
here is that much like your Nintendo
cartridges you get to go and then put
them in there and see they'll play yeah
that was good times yeah I'll do that
I'm so well yeah I'm so glad we moved
away from sockets me too hooray for what
is the socket a or socket one I'm
telling you we need to take all this
stuff and make some kind of art we do we
need to make Triceratops is and
Tyrannosaurus rexes yeah yeah out of
computer parts snobs asaurus rex thanks
so much guys
as you know 548 Market Street you know
the address and send us some goodies and
we'll build a transverse Rex out of your
computer parts and things of that nature
yes yes oh you know how I've been
playing with Ubuntu yeah I've been um I
found this game it's it's free for
download it's over in the software
Center
it's called pipe walkers are most things
for Linux does that sound familiar to
you pipe Walker yeah humming mmm
basically it can connecting your own
network it's so cute
okay so I have one word irony right here
you've got like a computer networking
you got to get all the nodes to connect
to the server
yes so we have that all right on the
recorder yeah yep nifty and stuff that's
cute
yeah so we have the little Linux penguin
the tux that appears on the computers
when you get them connected and when you
finish it and it goes it starts up the
network and you get these little stars
it's so cute and it's kind of an
obsessive game like there's just like
hundreds of puzzles you know I mean
honest yeah how is that any different
than managing an enterprise network
right oh look at this one see how small
it is oh my god thank you
okay I'm not at that level yet anyway
it's it's really fun so if you haven't
played it just go over to the software
center download it good times
cool building up with me is that the
segment on CBS aired so we'll have links
in the show notes as you guys want to
see that thing yes I have two sound
bites that I had that were the most
dumbed down possible I know things but
it's easy yes I listen to and I was like
wow they're making people
really scary and also stupid yeah but I
get it it's like mainstream is always
going to be like super dumb down in
that's what their instantly you're going
like you shouldn't connect to open
networks cuz it's really dangerous
yeah a quote was something like a quick
they reject it to an untrusted Network
don't trust it I mean like duh but you
know like sometimes people need some
clue bats and that's true yeah that's
why I love our long-form Internet
content stuff we're not to pander to it
I agree but yeah it was fun to be able
to show this off though with the the the
news people and have a lot of fun
because I was totally able to snipe her
Twitter password and her Facebook
password that's awesome and do you think
she's changed him no I will not go and
find out because unethical thing to do
but I'm jittery yeah good for you yes
now this is all I've been working on for
the last several weeks you know that the
show has been a little odd and it's
because it's Derby con I've just been
coding we have been o and joked about it
cuz this is the episode where we get to
like like for xo1 all over again years
later and it's the mark 3 I'm super
happy and very proud of this because it
basically all of the like feedback over
the years of the Wi-Fi pineapple and but
to get through something like super
slick but I thought that I just talked
about this one fun hack that I learned
well in development of it that was just
like one of these what and it's about
this thing called no hop and if you're
like a Linux UNIX whatever program or
you're probably familiar with this
basically it tells the system to ignore
what's called a hang up signal and we've
talked about this before in the past in
the sense that like I think we did a
series or a segment on yeah we did a
second on this awesome tool for Linux
called screen where you're able to have
basically like multiple bash tabs and
then when you log out they're still
running and then you can like reconnect
to the screen and things of that nature
and the idea what this is no hop is just
a command where you run no hop and then
whatever you want to run then you can
log out and it's still running in the
background I bring this up because one
of the things that I've done with the
pineapple 3 is and put together pretty
cool
yes meets like consumer router yeah
interface where it's like pretty simple
to start turning on and off different
like services all the man-in-the-middle
stuff built in so like you want to start
snarking URLs and you click start well
it's all in PHP and PHP is just telling
it to like run a system command right
yeah so that's where a no-help came in
in that like with PHP there's there's
system shell exec and exec which are
functions for like you know you tell the
PHP script to actually execute something
on that server except it'll sit there
and wait until it's done and no putting
an ampersand at the end of the command
doesn't do it so and I didn't have no
help on this guy but a really fun cool
hack that I learned is that the act
command is used to schedule events I
know that Act commands on Windows as
well actually so no wonder this would
work with with that but I but
specifically on Linux if you echo the
command you want and pipe it into at now
it schedules the tasks to happen
immediately and then it's actually
running the command so PHP sends that
and then it's like my hands are done
yeah and I can go back to whatever else
I'm doing and I don't know I just
thought that was just like the most
bizarre weird hang-up that I had no pun
intended with the new hopper that I was
having with this thing and I thought I'd
share that with you guys because I'm
just like and of all the crazy hacks you
have to get some of this stuff working
sometimes and that was a really fun one
yeah I'm sure now I'm gonna get emails
like oh well you should have used no hop
nice or some other weird ways to do that
I'm sure you will try out all the
different ways that you can do it well
that that's the other fun thing is I'm
not done with this let's just call one
point 0.1 of the mark 3 right now but
the last function I added and it gets to
be like feature creep right an is like
she's like finish it up already I was
like yeah but I just want to add this
one more feature and it's like all right
it's like when a really more future one
more feature done yet fine last feature
was an update thing so you can actually
like ah you know so if I like improve
upon a can like really it's a thing
where you just copy and paste some stuff
and then boom your yes
you know up created to the latest
firmware I guess you could say okay
I know well now let's find out about the
latest in weaponized wireless fruit mmm
delicious
pineapples man it seems like just
yesterday I was here at well a similar
cafe in Williamsburg Virginia talking
about the very first Wi-Fi pineapple I
guess in that case though it's actually
inside a real piece of fruit and then
onto you know the the original the the
Gaza guy you know the the karma on the
fawn and then later like in a plastic
pineapple and the open mesh versions the
mark 2 and very excited now about the
mark 3 because this hardware is is a
step better and the software I just have
had so much fun with this so I figured
that you know and come back here to the
you know the usual suspects the
target-rich environment if you will and
kind of do a demo of you know what it
all is and what's new and it kind of
give you a a little look at what's under
the hood and then talk about you know
upcoming projects but you know the more
I think about it the more I'm realizing
I've done this before how many times
have we been at the cafe we should
probably just go get a beer does that
sound good to you Paul yeah alright
let's just let's pack it up and go do
that that's all it's like more fun
hey hey Jason I'm alright
thinking of boot of Oktoberfest would do
the trick a bit so if you guys are new
to the show we're new to yoga in general
basically let me give you a brief
overview I know I've talked about it a
lot in the past but we do have some fun
new stuff in the Mark 3 so now let me
just kind of like lay the groundwork
essentially what yoga is is a modified
wireless access point wireless router
that that does something pretty unique
it implements Karma and the way that
that works is that it replies to pull
requests and lets them see what they
want to see so if you're familiar with
like Harry Potter it's like the in the
first movie how there was that mirror
and whatever Harry looked at in the
mirror he saw what he wanted to see this
is that wireless access point form and
essentially what will happen is when we
turn on the karma in yoga is going to be
the yes man or the yes air actually it's
kind of apps that were in a German bar
because you know it is German for the
SMAN in that when your smartphone when
your tablet when your laptop turns on
most of the cake most of the time with
most operating systems what's been
implemented is a feature for convenience
and as we know convenience always
Trump's security where the device in
question will automatically send out
what are called probe requests saying
hey is my home network around is my work
network around any wireless access point
they've connected to that open and
remembered it will try to automatically
connect this is the default state for so
many devices I can't tell you how many
times in testing I've had BlackBerry's
and iPhones and laptops and tablets and
just you name it devices connect to what
they think is
the free Wi-Fi at the airport at the
coffee shop a lot of times like
in-flight Wi-Fi and it works very well
on open networks and that's kind of key
because hope networks are the public
ones I mean obviously you couldn't have
a wireless network at the airport and be
like oh you know we're providing free
Wi-Fi for the patrons at the airport
here's the WPA key but that wouldn't
work you know what you typically find is
it's an open access point and then
there'll be like a you know like a
little splash page where like here's our
Terms of Service agree to these and
whatnot so that is the aza got bit in a
nutshell and we're really stoked because
it is such a powerful just very on a
fundamental level such a very powerful
thing to just say yes because it
violates that inherent trust that the
computer has that that the access point
is who it says it is and it's kind of
crazy to think that oh the computers
just gonna trust this access point
because it said it was you know there
are so many aspects to what an access
point is more than just the SSID but
this just sees hey here's a request for
this SSID yeah sure that's it and I know
that it gets really complex and like
enterprise networks and whatnot till I
kind of manage like you know all of the
other aspects but dude seriously there's
way more to identify an access point
than just that there's the bssid there's
the channels there's all of these
different elements that go into it and
yet none of those are parts for security
and for users convenience and user
friendliness we just remember those in
automatically connects you don't have to
type a password every time you boot up
what a pain and they
that would be so anyway that's what
we're doing we're violating the inherent
trust that that has in in just a Wi-Fi
setup and using this we can become the
man in the middle and that's where all
the fun stuff comes in and that's where
the mark 3 really shines now first and
foremost I have to give a big cheers and
thanks to Robin wood of course for all
of his wonderful work with the Aussie
guy which this implements as well as
Sebastian and move expel their support
in the development of the mark 3 and I'm
really excited because basically we've
taken a look at like the way that the
first two versions worked and some of
the hang-ups that the biggest issues
that people are having within the
biggest like features that people wanted
with it and and I think the biggest
influence was that the first one was
kind of considered like an access point
running yoga and this one now is kind of
more considered like a router running
yoga and what I mean by that is before
it was all like passing through and you
would have your DHCP server and all of
your tools on the laptop that you're
hosting your pineapple with which is you
know great but if say you want to you
know batter power leave it somewhere and
do all your even bidding that way it
wasn't as easy and there were
configurations to do it that way but it
just wasn't easy and that's really what
I've gone through here is trying to do
rewriting the web interface and just
making everything simple so what we've
done is the DHCP server now lives on the
device itself and so the clients they
connect they get an IP address from the
pineapple and you don't need to think
about how that interfaces with your
laptop anymore
and
the tools they're not all of the tools
some of our favorite man-in-the-middle
tools the D sniffs sweet and grab the
aircrack-ng sweet things of that nature
have been moved over to the pineapple so
that you can do that stuff and then to
make it really easy rewritten the web
interface so that all of those services
just like before with Ajax in web
interface same idea I've kind of gone in
a direction of 300 sort of done years
I've got inspired by your standard Soho
routers as well as my old bulletin board
system days and come up with a interface
that's I'm pretty proud of the idea here
is across the top you've got your you
know status configuration advanced and
about pages and within those you can
change configuration files and set up
different properties of it and turning
on and off services like the URL snarfer
the DNS spoof ER and network grepping
and things of that nature are really
just kind of a click away and on the
Status page you just get a dynamically
updating list of you know connected
clients and and what access points they
think they're connected to in the DHCP
log and the URL snarfer and Daniel or
network rapper and our fishing log so
it's really just a concept of trying to
make everything easier moving the tools
onto the device and now it's super
simple to basically get started like for
example internet connection sharing is I
just run in Linux a script where I
answer a couple of questions like what's
mine you know the network and you know
we've set it up on a one seven 2.16 dot
42 X and then it'll ask you like what's
the interface between you and your
pineapple and my case ETH - and what's
your interface - the internet and since
I'm using a 3G dongle PPP zero and then
just kind of like hit answers for the
rest of the questions and automatically
sets up IP forwarding and IP tables and
all of those things so that the internet
just kind of passes through and on
Windows it's just a few clicks as well
just saying here's my inner
connection and here's my pineapple
connection just kind of make the stuff
work so that's really exciting that's
really kind of the fundamental change
there so I figure you know why don't we
do a little demo since the coffee shop
is just next door
there are two things IT professionals
and their clients have in common they
want the job done right and they want it
done fast and that's why I highly
recommend go to assist Express by Citrix
