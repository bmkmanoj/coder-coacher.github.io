with cow patty and look-up tables
building a nice cozy nest for vmware and
bypassing local logins with calm boot
all that and more on this episode of
hack 5
this episode of high five is brought to
you by go daddy Squarespace and the
Adobe Flash platform Adobe Flash
provides everything you need to develop
cross-platform apps content and video
revision three was at Adobe Flash camp
and has the latest on flash builder for
flash catalyst and the open source flex
for framework stay tuned for the video
at the end of the show to learn more
about Adobe's new announcements hello
and welcome to hack 5 my name is Darren
kitchen I'm at less talk and I'm Shannon
Morse
got an excellent show for you guys
tonight and we are playing with all
sorts of fun Wi-Fi scuzzy ESX and con
booting Windows hack it's what yeah yeah
it's like it's pretty much you know what
we've been talking about the last couple
weeks but I think we've kind of found a
niche of you know people want to do more
and it's want or want us to do more and
they want us to show them the different
options that are actually out there and
you know my series and you your Wi-Fi
hacking and stuff like that and Shannon
with her destroyer of passwords skills
it's you know I love that right like
your segment in particular your series
on the virtualization just sprawls like
my motorcycle journeys on the backwoods
you know like the little backward you're
like I wonder where that goes hmm
oh wait train tracks huh oh you know
it's like what the hell is everything on
you know but I love it cuz it's all time
you can that's IT right that is like
exactly what happens because you that's
a beautiful thing about our industries
you come to work one day everybody in IT
knows this but even program or system
ins engineers you come to the NOC the
office whatever and it's different shit
different day
well I mean and it's the thing you know
you get to do something and then you
know the need is presented to the point
where it's off track I gotta learn this
now you know and you're like and then by
the end of the learning process you you
start to realize that was actually kind
of that's why I think that in at least
in our industry experience is worth more
than education
yeah I'm not knocking anybody that's
getting a four-year degree do do that
yeah um but you know it really speaks
volumes when you're just because you're
learning on the job constantly yeah for
ever and ever and ever never never I
don't have four years of college no
technical college just let me said this
before no so unless they're right yeah
yeah work your ass off yeah so we could
say hey end of season four is coming up
soon we need to finalize to date or I'm
sorry end of season five is coming at
the end of our fourth like our four year
anniversaries yes real soon we need to
buy the next episode to have the details
for the Busch Gardens trip okay Busch
Gardens meet up I'm just putting that
out there
I got we'll sit down and finalize the
details on that but August 5th will be
our five-year arm sorry four-year
anniversary of doing the show so you
know if you can come out to Busch
Gardens Williamsburg Virginia we could
have a grand old time so keep that in
mind
I'll just fit so I'm thinking like a
beer in rollercoasters dude the
hofbrauhaus you doing down to the German
area where they got the big like in the
legislation in yeah the hall yeah in
Vegas I don't know about that you
remember if there's not a lot about
reveille guess I do remember I remember
the Vegas with a chairman for almost I
have no clue what it was called so it
was awesome anyway I think we should
just go ahead and get into the the beer
and meat of it and let's go ahead and
continue on with the you know the beers
that we had over and Hoboken and start
doing some practical stuff so last week
I was talking about the advancements in
cow patty right it actually turns out
that the developer named a cow patty not
because he was trying to make a mockery
of WPA but that he really thought his
code was shit yeah it's actually really
good code I think you know so new
version for everything compared to your
code is great yeah anyway so 4.5 is out
excellent piece of code this like we
talked about last week add some too very
big new features first of all you can
you can verify that the information that
you've gathered with your you know
packet captures has what you need to
start an attack because if you don't
have everything why bother going through
an attack just to say no keys found and
second of all you can do you can crack a
WPA connection
using two parts of the four-way
handshake and more details on that on
the previous episode and also awesome
links in the show notes so you know not
going to get into too much detail there
but what's important what we're going to
talk about practically here is this is
the proverbial shitty Netgear and I'm
sorry Nick here it's not you it's just
that there's a lot of crap routers and
we're just using the shitty Netgear as
an example it could have been a link
says I could have been a d-link this is
just what we had in the closet so this
little guy is what your grandmother is
on the internet with right here I mean
this is grandma router right here yeah
it's right your parents route right and
you set them up and you thought you were
doing them justice by hooking them up
with the WPA the W Wi-Fi Protected
access as opposed to that WEP crap Oh
why are blending there are no wire
equivalency protocol anyway it's
supposed privacy
perhaps you anyway it's only weapons
only supposed to be as good as wired and
well we know how good that is so anyway
we're going to go ahead and show you how
to audit your own home network not how
out of your neighbors but how to make
sure that your system is all good using
using Cal patty so I've got a little
demo set up I actually was going to use
my acer aspire one with virtual machines
and the backtrack for and all that fun
stuff a little bit of problems with
virtualization I'm going to talk to you
later about that and I actually said
Matt you know what I'm just going to
break out a real machine so I broke out
the EPC to which you said it looks like
a virtual machine to me anyway so EPC
and my favorite little if you hadn't
picked up an alpha get this this is the
alpha aw you 0:36
H this is a beautiful little 500
milliwatts USB Wi-Fi card that does a
fun stuff you can get in mono mode you
can do much fun stuff with it so on with
the fun stuff so I'm here in backtrack 3
and let's go ahead and get started first
thing we need to do is scout around for
an access point write down a few key
things so first I'm going to go ahead
and set airmon-ng start wlan0 that is my
eyes eros they're my alpha and you can
see I'm in want to run
and I'm going to run kismet with taxi
and it's an RT 8180 w land 0 alpha okay
and I did that wrong somehow
Oh 8180 you know this EPC keyboard Oh
sometimes L sinister DK well no the
offset that there's supposed to be the
tilde next to one so they pushed over
anyway so I can see here that here is my
Netgear and what's important here that
I'm going to need is obviously the name
of the network which is all caps Netgear
I'm going to need to know the bssid of
the network and I'm going to need to
know what channel that's on so we're
going to write all those things down and
once we have those written down let's go
ahead and start sniffing we don't need
to associate with the access point
anyway but we can tell our card to
listen to channel 11 particularly
listening for traffic connected to this
net gear so I think I already have that
right here so we're going to run arrow
dump ng with taxi to set the channel to
11 the bssid that we just found we're
going to write the file out to Netgear
underscore b and that's on w and 0 so
you can already see we have our
connection going on and this is where we
talked about earlier last week that if
you you know you want to kind of like
see for the 4-way handshake
we're now at least in some cases just
two parts of it you get you have to get
that handshake and normally to get that
what you'll do is you'll love is a
couple of ways we talked about creating
a honeypot or there's also just staking
out the access point and waiting for a
connection and that's what I'm doing
right now on this laptop or if there's
already a connection and you'll see on
backtrack here I now have a connection I
can see that it is from you know this
address I can see how many packets are
going and whatnot and if I wanted to I
could go ahead and issue a D auth so
let's go ahead and show you that real
quick it's pretty easy so using another
part of aircrack airplay
engi with tax zero to specify ad auth
we're going to send I don't know a 30 D
auth packets and we're going to say it's
to the bssid of zero zero the client
that we want to do to this guy here so
if I can maybe move my window around of
course W land zero as our interface so
go ahead and run that and actually what
I'm doing is sending a D off and there I
just went ahead and did that now if you
look over in the other window what
you'll notice is you see that WPA
handshake because I used you know this
and promiscuous so we've gone ahead and
sent all these D off packets we've
actually got kicked the Machine off of
the network and it has rejoined and what
it did we saw right over here it says
hey there we go we got the WPA handshake
so I can actually stop capturing these
packets here I'm going to go ahead and
stop that and now we have a big ol
packet capture file that we want to go
ahead and send over to cow patty now cow
patty does a couple of different things
right so we can use cow patty to take
two parts of the four-way handshake
sometimes or four parts and I'll have
more information on why that is and we
can either do dictionary with like a
word list or we can do a rainbow table
attack actually it's not really it's
it's a pre computed time memory
trade-off and it's not technically a
rainbow table to lookup table point
being
we've there are available from offensive
security the people that put together
that do stuff with it's part of remote
exploit people that do backtrack so
awesomesauce they're right they have a
huge list of all of these different
rainbow tables that you can get for
different access points so remember we
talked about that 40 gig
all-encompassing right that was are
separated separated out for Linksys or
Netgear for dealing gotcha exactly so
instead of that 40 gig I just downloaded
a 1.8 gig specifically for Netgear so I
have that going on here and actually let
me let me see this will actually be B ok
so we're going to run cap at eat a car
to our net gear capture that we just did
TAC D to the net gear WPA those are the
rainbow tables we downloaded on my USB
drive and then we have to specify the
SSID so that's Netgear there and I'll go
ahead and run this and you can see
already it is at a hundred thousand
attempts now this is a he this this
rainbow table contains a ton of
different keys right but it's able to go
through them so much faster I could show
you in comparison
I'm only doing on this machine I can
only do 33 attempts a second on
dictionary attacks and you can see here
I'm doing tens of thousands a second so
you know this is about ten thousand yeah
so let's go ahead and take a look speed
this up and see if we can get the
password so there we go the password is
password and that took well we search 32
million passwords at twenty nearly
twenty-six thousand a second now this is
on an Asus EPC right I was like nine
hundred megahertz seller on under clock
to six hundred megahertz I would
recommend not trying to crack one of
these passwords on a EPC especially not
when you're trying to do a podcast and
get it done before midnight because it
doesn't work no so but yeah I mean it so
that really did take like nearly a half
hour on this thing but imagine on a real
machine which would be like ten times
100 times class or whatever than this
there's a couple things I want to
mention right so like I said you can do
dictionary attacks with this you can do
this rainbow table this rainbow table
let's see we got 232 million I'm sure it
kind of could have kept going yeah
there's a ton of passwords in here and
it's kind of fun to just read in be like
really weird ones that that's golf well
yeah but I mean it's it's it's the other
thing is it's not just care it's not
just the alphanumeric there's also got
the rackets and all this crazy other
there was a password in there though it
said it is of no consequence
that's a passphrase I had spaces and
everything anyway so so before so uh my
advice to you is is WPA passwords I
think it's eight to 63 rate to 64 think
it might be 63 use them all just make a
long password special characters
yes good nobody's going to bother making
63k well okay you right now right now
in 2009 nobody's going to bother doing a
63 character set for the SSID of Netgear
because as we said the patch is based on
it what you really want this is somebody
off have the default Wireless ID and
just make a 63 nothing but Spyder I
don't know there's enough gigabytes or
terabytes or pay device the hard drives
for that point being the other thing to
note though is that Cal patek be used
with standard in and standard out right
so you can couple it with something like
John the Ripper to do a brute force
attack so you could even take your
regular dictionary file run it through
John the Ripper that passes it over to
cow patty to take things like password
to change it to P for dollar sign dollar
sign you know right and do the Li defi
and all that stuff and then with
different characters and numbers on all
the happy stuff so a couple of things to
take a look at if you want to audit the
security of your own home wireless
network or your corporate wireless
network with permission something to
keep in mind anyway when we get back we
are going to be talking about scuzzy I
scuzzy I scuzzy with ESXi and ass and
and it's too many acronyms for me but at
this point I'm going to go ahead and
kick it over shannon and see what's
going on this week in the LAN party

Squarespace we'll be back with some ice
cozy right after this
virtualization sans I scuzzy what is I
scuzzy it's the implementation of scuzzy
hard drives which you all know all too
well over an IP protocol TCP the easiest
way to do it for free on the cheap is
using something like open father or
FreeNAS now today I got questions our
previous era questions on how to create
virtual machines and you know to set up
the I scuzzy and stuff like that so
we're going to kill two birds with one
stood Oh two birds one stone
and we're going to destroy the universe
ready here we go
first we're going to go ahead and we're
going to launch our VI client which is
virtual infrastructure client 1010 Oh 55
is our server that is actually running
in the corner over there
root is the username and half five is
still the password we're going to
connect up here what we're going to do
is we're going to create a virtual
machine the virtual machine is going to
be FreeNAS now you're kind of wondering
why I'm creating a virtual machine
inside of FreeNAS just because it's easy
and I don't have a separate box to
install FreeNAS on and then configure
ESX so follow along we're going to
create FreeNAS as a virtual machine and
then we're going to connect the host
which is hosting the FreeNAS virtual
machine to the ice cozy target which is
inside the virtual machine on top of the
host ready let's do this there we go
we're going to right click on our server
here we're going to create new virtual
machine and what we're going to do is
we're going to do a typical and we're
gonna click Next and it's going to be
FreeNAS and we're just going to stick it
on the second datastore okay
this is going to be a other 32-bit you
can download 64-bit FreeNAS but don't
really need to 32 bits good for now
moving on is free BSD and one virtual
processor is fine 256 Meg's of RAM sure
that's fine as well now when you start
ESX it automatically creates a VM
network on your primary bound Ethernet
interface you can set up multiple NICs
if you have multiple networks like a DMZ
or
red Network so on and so forth this is
already pre-configured as we only have
one network card in this system this is
the only network interface that we
actually have to choose from so we're
going to go ahead and select next and
we're going to create I like to run my
eat my FreeNAS boxes with two drives
primary for the FreeNAS OS and secondary
for the data stores or data or whatever
so we're going to make a one gig primary
and we're going to click finish and then
we're going to expand out the listing of
virtual machines and once it's actually
completed we're going to edit the
settings and we're going to add another
hard disk ok
we're add a hard disk with a size of 250
gigs and we're going to store it with a
virtual machine because we don't need to
store elsewhere click finish and ok it's
going to go ahead and create the virtual
machine hard drive file the VMDK and
once that's done we can actually start
the machine and we're going to need to
do is we're going to need to transfer
the free Ness ISO up to the ESXi server
and you could do that simply by clicking
on the datastore create a folder and
upload your image right from your
desktop to the datastore so we've
already got the FreeNAS ISO in there and
we are going to right click on this edit
the settings we're going to edit the CD
drive with a datastore ISO it's in
datastore - in ISO images and the
FreeNAS and we're going to connect it at
power on click ok and let's start some
virtual machine lovin and open the
console here so we can actually see
what's going on and here it is beginning
the installation of FreeNAS now while
it's loading FreeNAS we're going to have
to think about okay what's our network
and stuff like that blah blah blah
easiest way is just to use DHCP to start
off with it's going to assign itself and
address and then what we're going to do
is we're going to then apply the FreeNAS
installer
image itself onto the one gigabyte hard
disk that we created initially okay so
FreeNAS the live CD has completed its
installation and now we need to do is we
need to configure the system it's
already got land Ln c0 which is our only
interface bound to this virtual machine
in there what we need to do is we now
need to set the land dress so we're
going to hit option 2 and we're going to
use DHCP for this no I don't care about
ipv6 so it's going to initialize the
interface and there we go so our DHCP
server has assigned us an address of 10
1001 52 and we can now manage the
FreeNAS server on port 80 but first we
need to deploy this live image to the
disk so we're going to do is we're going
to hit enter well that's definitely none
of those and we're gonna hit option 9 to
install or upgrade to hard disk or flash
flash device we're going to install the
full OS on a hard drive and data and
swap partition we're going to select ok
that is the source of the CD live image
and then there are is our one gigabyte
VMware virtual disk on channel da 0
we're going to hit OK 128 for the OS
partition minimum is to 128 so let's say
256 ok do we want to add a swap
partition doesn't really matter if you
do or not because you've got enough
memory we'll say no ok so here we go
FreeNAS is now installed on da s1 you
can now remove the CD and reboot the PC
so we're going to do is we're going to
come up here ctrl + alt BM edit settings
we're going to disconnect and make sure
that's ok and click OK and we can exit
now ok so just for good measure we're
going to make sure that the virtual
machine actually starts with that image
that we've just installed it is select
yes to reboot the system and now we're
going to go ahead and reboot okay so
we're rebooted and unfortunately it
didn't get a DHCP address so we'll go
ahead and set the land interface again
we'll select YES for DHCP no
initialize the interface once again and
then from here once the device is
initialized we can go to our web browser
and we can actually start to set up the
ice cozy device so that we connect ESX
to the ice cozy drive now obviously
you're not going to use this in a
production environment simply because
there's absolutely no reason to why
would you create a nice cozy target on
top of your data store
nobody would but for this for the sake
of showing you how to do it we're going
to show you here so we're going to ctrl
alt out of this this is pretty much done
we don't need to use this console
anymore 1010 Oh dot 152 so let's go here
and I believe it's admin and password of
freeness all right so here we go
the nice pretty interface of FreeNAS
it's a lot better than it has looked in
the last couple versions so let's go
ahead and dive in first what we need to
do is we need to go ahead and add a disk
the disk itself is going to be the 250
gig we'll call it our is cozy disk click
Add apply changes ok let's come over
here to services on the I scuzzy target
we need to add an extent the extent
itself is what VMware is going to see
and it's going to be a device because
we're going to bind it right to the
device which is da one I scuzzy disk
click Add apply changes and now we need
to add the actual I scuzzy target now
this I scuzzy target is going to be what
accepts the request from VMware ESXi to
say hey I'm over here
I have extents good stuff so we're going
to make it read writable it's going to
be extent 0 authorize network 10 1000 /
24 comment scuzzy disk see where we're
going
click Add click apply let's go over here
to enable come down here save and
restart
okay so now that's done now if we did
everything correctly we can go back over
to ESXi and select our host come over
here to configuration and two storage
adapters we need to do is we need to
select the I scuzzy software adapter
because we don't have a hardware HBA
click properties configure enable it
select ok
there is no chap authentication on our I
scuzzy target so we don't have to worry
about authentication or anything like
that simply because we're not running
we'll call this a separate network
dynamic discoveries what we're going to
do click Add 10 10 0.1 50 to default
port is 30 to 60 we're good with that
select ok close and yes we want to
rescan so here we go we've rescan the I
scuzzy HBA correctly and we can here now
see a VM HBA 33 with this capacity of
250 gigs now if we come over here to not
that one yet we need to click storage
and we actually need to create a VMFS
system on this this new data store that
we that we found so we click add storage
disk LUN because I scuzzy appears to the
system is just another physically
connected device disk LUN click next and
boom there is our 250 gig capacity this
is there's your sand identifier there's
the actual device that VMware sees click
Next click Next as the hard disk is
blank we're gonna call this FreeNAS I
scuzzy 1 click Next now this is
important a lot of people have been
bitten by this in the past and you need
to capacity plan before you actually
continue on this step the maximum file
size that you're going to be able to
have on a specific data store 2 terabyte
file sizes are obviously for people with
very large databases in a single file we
had a client with you know a one and a
half terabyte
database dump that they gave us in a
single file and we had to shuffle
everything around so that we could
reformat our lung to accept a file that
big don't get bit in the ass and
accidentally undersized your block sizes
so we're going to select 256 gigs simply
because that's how big our LUN is we're
going to maximize capacity click Next
and click finish now what it's going to
do down here is create the VMFS data
store so right now it's actually
formatting that I scuzzy LUN and what
it's going to do is allow us to then
create a virtual machine just as if we
had another connected you know direct
attached storage media even though it's
actually on the other side of the data
center traveling through our TCP network
so while this is in progress what we can
actually do is make sure and there it is
so it just showed up in our storage list
and we can come over here right click
new virtual machine typical I'm just
going to fly through this real quick and
here we now see that the freeness I
scuzzy target with a capacity of 256
gigs is now in our vailable data store
list click Next click Next yes next next
next finish and let's see if it actually
creates the virtual machine because it
formatted it it should be ok
and there we go so now if we come over
here and go to summary we now see in the
data store that we've got eight gigs
taken up by our newly created virtual
machine so once again let's go into an
overview obviously you're not going to
have FreeNAS with a nice cozy target
under the host that you're going to end
up connecting to why is this good
well FreeNAS is really easy to set up
obviously you can install it on a
machine that you have from 6 years ago
as long as you have a big enough case
for the number of drives and the you
know you can do software raid or if you
have you know a hardware device that's
on the free Ness compatibility list you
can do hardware RAID it really is the
cheapest of the cheap way to deploy a
nice cozy target in an enterprise-wide
environment now when I say enterprise
obviously you know multi-million dollar
companies probably aren't going to be
using the sxi and free nests but for the
sake of learning it's a great tool that
it will allow you to you know know the

show you how to bypass some window
security by using con boot alright so
that about wraps up this episode of hack
5 but I have a nifty little treat for
you guys okay so Jason you know he
brought his laptop Jason Applebaum so
you see he's down every because in the
Christmas in New York um I decided that
I was going to hack his laptop with your
krad ultra elite miss yes so I don't
know his password right now you know I
get I get the usual error code I'm just
gonna go ahead and show you this cuz
it's way cool shut down bitch she
totally just killed a machine I did
so if VJ loved us right now and it
actually showed us what was going on on
the television screen for you guys I'd
be able to show you that this thing
called con boot is booting up right now
right off of a CD it's just a little ISO
file that you download off the
Internet's I like them
and you burn to CD I assume it's crypto
slogic crypto slogic yes it's by umm
pure tour banya alright calm I'm not
really sure how you say that but those
are things I created its called con boot
it's really really simple all it does is
it grabs the Windows kernel and changes
it up a little bit so you don't even
have to know a person's Windows password
you'd basically just get to the windows
password screen where as for the
username and PW and you press enter and
you get in and then you can mess around
as long as you want
and then you just log out take out your
CD and nobody ever knows so basically
what you're saying so it is way better
than off crack you showed that a while
yes yes we're off guys like you had to
use a rainbow table and if it wasn't a
very easy password you probably wouldn't
get it or it would take a really really
long time if you
had a huge rainbow table and hopefully
you did with this you don't even need
that you just press ENTER a couple of
times
you don't even need the password but the
nice thing about this is I mean without
going through that or one of the other
utilities where it changes the pass
right I have on numerous occasions
legitimately at the office you know say
like a user leaves the company right
repurpose the laptop they don't give us
the you know they're being a bitch
whatever use the NT offline password and
registry editor I think is what it's
called there's a bunch of them that will
I mean you don't have to do that one but
there's a bunch of them that you just
boot and it you know resets the passer
but it resets the password for good
right so it's just a temporary fix
because you're just booting off the CD
exactly
so we've rebooted now we've rebooted
we're back to the username and password
screen XP Professional good no Vista I
love you just press enter ok that was
too easy
Jason what's your password it doesn't
apparently it doesn't matter because I
can obviously log into your computer you
ain't hardcore we got and you know I
love it I got your you crazy
when you first mention this to me I was
like oh that sounds like the anti
password boot love-love-love thing yeah
I I asked mobic sebat it I'm like hey
have you played with these like tried on
three different machines and I can't get
it working I tried it on two different
machines and it worked on two different
machines and I hear that there's a
version that maybe works in Linux two
points yes there is also another version
just for Linux and that one does pretty
much the exact same things changes up
the kernel we're gonna have to play with
that I gotta say though there are ways
to protect yourself there are ways to
protect yourself you can obviously put
on a bios password
okay there's wicked also doing well
that's showing ways around that and you
could also use something as simple as
TrueCrypt and just TrueCrypt your entire
hard drive and they wouldn't would not
be able to see your stuff you come back
next week to show something so I could
come back next week and tell you about
that another thing I want to mention is
if you are deciding to do this you can't
go in and change somebody's password so
you can't change that so no matter what
once you log off they won't
it's basically more like again you know
for people who they're companies who you
know shelve machines for a certain
period of time yeah before or you know
keep something for government purposes
right forgot the password but we still
have the machine it's just sitting there
for you know retention purposes this
would be yet in their change something
at a file there's a setting and act
goldmine don't worry about you know
crashing the entire drive it just kind
of yeah if Darren leaves the household
and he wants me to get on his computer
and he has like a rescue CD here's a
rescue CD listen like I can a block at
the top of the show as always with all
of this stuff we're encouraging you to
totally go to your high school oh no no
no no wait wait did I get that wrong
yes other way around use it for home and
educational purposes only that's what I
meant to say don't listen to polls you
know Windows 7 oh here so you can find
his yeah don't find yourself with an f5
felony on your ass because you decided
to have a lot of fun with Cain and Abel
on your University's network and then
your email and Darren saying hey I'm
getting hit with the class 5 felony
because I did something stupid and I
didn't change my spoof my MAC address
we'll have to do a second a just a
little scary point being don't do stupid
stuff so I'm gonna give you on network
your stupid stuff to your own systems
yes he did and then get paid a lot of
money to do to other peoples when they
pay you to there you go all right well
with all of that said I think this was
an excellent long-winded awesome episode
of technical goodness we're gonna get
yogurt Jim's gonna be like guys what did
I say 15 minute episodes have you ever
done a 15 no I don't see 15 is she sick
sorry sorry anyway if you enjoyed what
you saw today definitely hit us up we're
up over at feedback at hack 5 org and
also remember we've got the stuff coming
out of the store so head on over to hack
5 dot org slash
shop is everything else we do yes
all right let's hack chopper way out of
your bitchin
and as always we are reminding you to
trust your techno read alright well do
throws I'll recycle pres I'll recycle
throws I like it alright got it
I didn't tweet this in a memo Oh No
he's recording me it's gonna be blooper
I'm going to stop I know the word that I
would describe today as is game changing
what we're working on and what's
happened with flash is it really evolves
the technology from being the original
animation player on the web to really
growing into a full platform now and we
have three main themes for this release
and basically most people start an
application either thinking about the
design or thinking about the data so
we've really tried to enable that in
Flash Builder for the power lived in the
wrong hands when it came to designing a
really rich Internet application the
designer would hand off a static comp to
a developer and then lose all control
over the actual final look and feel of
an application Flash Builder for I think
really enables a much better workflow
between designers and developers what
this release does is it really puts that
power back in the designers hands to own
the visual appearance all the way into
building an actual flex application they
can build out whatever design they
envision they can import that into the
flash builder you can add all of your
data connectivity and really keep your
design the way the designer intended it
I'm a developer so Flash Builder is is
home for me the features that are most
important to me are harmless silly you
know things like the package viewing a
navigator there are things that help me
be more efficient so all of the types of
like growing pains we go through with
the new designer or a new project where
we're sort of fleshing out what it's
going to look like what its how it's
going to work having some tools that
sort of support and facilitate good
communication is pretty awesome so
still gonna save me big-time like time
and effort Lesko much easier to reduce
the complexity of workflows and then you
write all of your business logic in
flash builder and deploy a great
application that's just sort of going to
revolutionize the kinds of expressive
exciting apps that you can build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
