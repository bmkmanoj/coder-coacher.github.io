photography at this time on hak5 hello
and welcome back five my name is Darren
kitchen my name is Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of technolo so
come to this super exciting and fun show
it's gonna be a good one I'm very
excited
are you its documents exciting I am into
taki Maz excited I don't even know what
them what did I just say I don't know if
there's like a proper translation for it
but it's what you say before you eat a
meal okay
well then where's my meal I'm at work
right now what if we could get paid to
eat on the podcast wait that would be
weird No thank you very much so you've
camera is we're gonna be talking about
360 degree cameras today and having all
sorts of fun the first we have sisters
is new one so Darien I think you know
the story behind these this one kind of
freaks me out a little bit
I love him capitated goat with a rainbow
going through his head you know it's not
until you just said that I realized he
is decapitated like cut off the bottom
so you can't see that so there is a
local artist I don't know I'm just gonna
put that guy right there yeah but
there's an art Omaha tech in town which
is really exciting
basically you pop a few coins in oh and
this is from an awesome surf shop that's
been hooking me up lately awesome so
that goes there
101 surf sports in San Rafael yeah and
so automatic the idea is you pop some
coins in you press the laver and then
you get a sticker okay and I just
realize how cute that is because you are
a My Little Pony right now sneezing my
little look at the spin around let's see
them my little pony miss you got to see
the bottom of it oh wow
yeah it's like rainbows and that's why
you tuned in talk about stickers and
sneezing you will see we've got rainbows
coming out of the decapitated go ahead
and you are the physical embodiment of
such so weird
so we
actually have a lot going on in this
episode I think we should go ahead and
get started but first I want to start it
off with a quote from renowned
photographer Elliott Erwitt so he is
quoted as saying photography is an art
of observation it has little to do with
the things that you see and everything
to do with the way that you see them so
today we are stepping outside of our
traditional 4x3 or 16x9 very exciting
yeah so speaking of which I know you
said it's fine like and you've been
using this for a while you've really
been dabbling with this so what is 360
degree photography it is something that
breaks my brain it's I mean it kind of
breaks my bit too it's just a foot of
photography technique it's not that this
is like new it's it's actually it's not
that new I mean this has been going on
for a while in fact we've all seen
panoramas and things of that nature I
love that in photography which is a
really geeky hobby of mine that there
are so many facets of it and this is
just a new fun one but the idea here is
that with 360 degree photography so it's
360 180 right we're getting the entire
scene and not just an angle okay right I
mean there's still angles involved
there's still a little bit of
composition involved but it breaks
traditional photography means and it's
sometimes called 360 degree panoramic
photography I've seen it called VR
photography or 360 video tours you know
it's it's hot in real estate spiracle
photography stuff of that nature I've
actually seen a hotels do this oh yeah
like one of the hotels I'm staying at in
Tokyo has 360 degree photography of the
hotel room that I'll be staying in and
then I've I think we did a demo of this
years ago with Microsoft I want to say
they had like a photo stitching whoo yes
you could take a bunch of pictures and
it would stitch them together Photosynth
Photo Center was the Anna had and so
that was a really interesting one where
you would take photographs and it would
analyze them and come up with the
geometry of the scene based on just the
the pixels in the photo yeah so it's
very like old-school
how do you do it nowadays well it has
changed a lot you know typically in the
past you had seen things like rigs that
would take I don't know anywhere between
three and 50 GoPros and and then put
them all together and then you would
record - you know slam sink them and
record individual SD cards and the
newett ingest those and use very
complicated software to stitch
everything together and it has gotten so
much easier and I bring this up now
because it's a really interesting time
in that we're at the very beginnings of
basically this becoming a mainstream
consumer technology yeah so that's why
this is really a technical last segment
but I wanted to share this with you
because we're kind of at a really
amazing point here both in consuming the
media and making the media as more and
more platforms get on to the scene that
that accepts these formats and more
devices and cameras support this kind of
stuff we've seen some really cool
innovations coming out of Google or
sorry Google at Facebook faux pas
Facebook's f8 where they're open
sourcing this this entire suite of
systems to put this stuff together which
we'll touch on later but it's really
cool stuff so I just think the one time
I'm gonna say Oh Facebook is doing
something cool you know a lot of times
they do they actually do some really
cool stuff as far as IT infrastructure
things are concerned and and also drones
so just you know an Internet org which
depending on who you ask is cool yeah
point being 360-degree photography has
come a long way from the multiple GoPros
on a rig you can still do that but it's
at the point where you can just go and
get a piece of equipment and not have to
think about anything and press the
button and get a 360-degree photo so
here's what it looks like this is from a
recent trip to Honolulu Sebastian and I
and actually we spin around Hey look
there's Mike and there's mommy
and this is just at a at a little tiki
bar that's in Waikiki which is really
awesome and so I just wanted to kind of
give you guys an idea of it because
rather than capturing a photograph like
this right here if i zoom in I could say
like oh well this is a photograph yeah
but it's more so than
because really what I'm doing is I'm
capturing the entire scene in fact
there's me taking the photograph and you
know you can really explore it which is
which is interesting because you lose a
lot of the traditional concepts of
framing and angles and such like there's
I forget the name of that waterfall but
there's a waterfall in hanging out yeah
hanging out of a helicopter and so
that's kind of fun because it's like
well where'd it where is the you know
where is the photograph where do you
look right it's still it's still kind of
flat when you're seeing it on a computer
though right and that's the really cool
thing is you can manipulate these images
in so many ways so like it in fact
viewing them is it's like right now I'm
showing you just on a computer yeah but
there's so many ways to view them like
I've got the gear VR here as an example
because you know you can put this on and
do the whole you know VR experience and
then it's a really interesting way to
share an experience because you weren't
just capturing a photograph of like this
is what I want you to see instead you're
like this is the whole surroundings and
so the same thing with video it can be
really immersive and cool some of the
video players you know if you're not
going to do the VR headset thing yeah
YouTube for example supports this now
and on your phone for example you can
use the gyroscopes in your phone tilt
your phone around and see all throughout
the video or you can just swipe you
swipe with your finger yeah I think that
was like a Michelle Obama interview that
The Verge did maybe it was 360 degrees
it was so cool it was like you're in
you're in the White House like oh cool
it was really neat so how do you capture
360 photos well traditionally you could
do this with really any kind of
equipment that takes photographs so if
you have a high-end DSLR you can use
something like that you just have to use
specialized stitching software to then
take that in if you have an Android
phone you probably already have this
capability just in your phone today in
that photo spheres which is basically
like a Google branded idea of the same
thing which is where you take multiple
photos and it's it's really you know
there's an art to it because you have to
rotate on the lens
and not you know in the center of the
camera but in the where the lenses yeah
and and you just take all of those and
put them together and then you have a
sphere if you've ever used Google
Streetview
you've seen this it's the exact same
concept okay yeah and actually if you
have one of two cameras currently on the
market you can actually upload your own
360 photos back into Google Maps as I
have done and I'll show you those in a
sec so what are these specialized
cameras so there's only two on the
market that are off-the-shelf Google
Streetview compatible one of them is
several thousands of dollars and then
the other one is only a couple hundred
bucks and it's this here which is the
theta s so this is a fun little camera
it's very simple to operate there's
basically a power button and a shutter
button and it'll do video and
photographs some others might include
the gyro optic this is a really
interesting camera you can see so cute
rather than two lenses this one actually
has three and so you know some form
factor differences I'm not going to get
into the hardware too much yeah just
more of a conceptual thing there's a
bunch of these on the market for example
and I've played with a bunch of these so
that was the theta there's also the gyro
optic the bubble is another great
example I just had a chance to play with
that a little bit I've played with the
kodak SP 360 i had to send it back
because it was terrible
and then the thing that i'm most excited
about is actually this nikon key mission
360 which has more of like a like a
GoPro factory no it's not out yet but
like i said this is why it's so exciting
cuz right now
the technology for both consuming the
content and creating the content is
ever-growing
so it's a good time to get into this
because it's very experimental because
Samsung is doing one - yeah the Samsung
gear 360 which again I'm very excited
about these are things that will
hopefully bring it into the mainstream
now do these do 360 video - yeah most of
them do 360 video I mean it's the same
concept it's just photography at 30
frames per second you play it back with
some sound we have video yeah so tell me
a little bit about 360 video well here I
can actually show you an example I have
yes right y'all let me find my videos
and so here is here's a video that I
took on this helicopter youth that wow
it's so it's not that exciting when you
look at it like this essentially what we
have here is a 1080p video with both
lenses and so when you look at this
camera you can see that essentially we
have a 180 degree lens in the front 180
degree lens in the back and then in
camera they get stitched together for
the photographs and we'll get into how
that kind of works for the videos we end
up with a video file that's really just
these bubbles so what ends up happening
is you have to run this through a
stitching process which will go ahead
and I will close this so you can see
this is the end result after it's been
stitched now that's kind of a really
weird distorted view right yeah you're
in a very janky helicopter it's not
janky it's the white 500l copter come on
yeah there we are going over
oh that's cool the the beach Theron
Waikiki but what you really need to do
is you'll actually well this gets into
editing and that's another segment all
event itself but what happens is once
you have the video stitched you can go
ahead and ejected with certain metadata
that allow you to put it up on a video
platform for instance YouTube and let's
just watch that right now right now it's
pretty much just Facebook in YouTube
there are some other like you know less
well-known out there yeah like theta for
example has their own social whatever
service but it's it's not it's not a
Facebook or a Google kind of clout and
you have to have that metadata to be
able to have this work yeah so what it
is is when you convert that video it
needs to be able to know like what
format it's in it needs to know where up
is and all of that stuff so there's a
little bit of metadata and like this is
how earlier we are into this system that
in order to
upload this video to YouTube I could
just upload that video file that
everybody would see what I just showed
you in VLC so in order to actually see
it in 360 you have to use a tool that
that Google or YouTube has developed
that's basically like a meditative data
injection tool is for Windows and Mac
and of course it's cross-platform
because it's like literally they gave
you a Python file so you can't just use
the purple the the regular conventional
like upload thing no well you do so when
you like this file I uploaded you do the
metadata first and then you use the
regular conventional upload but YouTube
is also grabbing that data on the back
end so it knows that is 360 yeah it's
essentially exif data similar do you
have any like a photograph okay and so
it just tells because i guess they can't
detect like hey this is a neck
particular format we'll get into that
but essentially you take the video file
from the camera then using the special
software which is vendor specific right
now because all of them implement it
different you know the theta what does
it with two lenses and the gyro optic
with three so they all have their own
software sadly this stuff for the theta
is only Windows and Mac which is why I'm
using the Windows right now and then
once you've converted that then you have
to do YouTube's little inject II stuff
to get it to end up looking like this
and so when you upload it now you can
spin around and if you were to put this
in the goggles there there I am looking
all weird and stuff and uh and then you
have a 360 degree video which is that's
cool which is pretty cool I wish I had
one of these when I went flying over
volcanoes in Hawaii right that would
have been amazing that's the thing is
this is just so interesting and novel
and experimental yeah that it's just fun
to this is definitely going in my pack
for Australia because is some of the
more interesting things or stuff that
you didn't know when you took the photo
was like behind you right you're like
you can totally grab photo bombers now
you'll be like I knew he was there
mm-hmm it's really cool because like
basically these are taking the images
from the two disparate cameras
and then using the software converting
it into a format that these video
platforms like YouTube and Facebook can
understand so that we can experience
them in VR and so it's like trying to
get even closer and closer to that
shared experience yeah you know a
photograph like this a photo is worth a
thousand words and things of that nature
I don't know how many words a VR photo
is but it definitely feels more surreal
like you're there so you mentioned a
really weird word equi equirectangular
equirectangular so basically this is a
way to map a sphere onto a flat surface
because as you saw this this is you know
like a flat 2d plane here on my computer
screen yeah I'm going to want to you
know see that here on the computer and
be able to upload it to a video service
yeah but I want it to be a spherical
right and that's how it's captured so
the concept is to in fact I've got a
great example here this is really cool
this is invented by a mathematician
you're like a Greek mathematician back
in like 100 AD so it's been used for a
while and you are probably familiar with
it because oh we ha that's called a
globe there we have a globe but that's
what we're capturing because we're
capturing it as a sphere and you
probably have experience with seeing
this rectangular format because it's
exactly what you get when you take that
same globe and you stretch it out to
there and you notice if we if we flip
around to America's hat Canada isn't
actually that really wide and weird and
crazy I mean it is in other ways but you
end up with this skewed top portion I
mean Greenland doesn't actually look
like that you can spin around a
Greenland on the globe Greenland's
actually and it's not exactly so what
happens yours weight around the equator
everything you pretty normal but then up
at the top things get a little squished
yeah
which if we switch over to that video
again you can actually see that the top
and bottom are kind of squished and so
that's the format that has become
basically the industry standard in this
area to be able to you know map this
stuff out and that's really cool because
these are what are being used by the
viewers to
be able to do that faux 3d so that you
can put on a pair of VR goggles and
actually have that experience with faux
depth as if you're really there so I
know you've been experimenting with this
a lot can you give me some tips and
tricks for taking my own pictures
absolutely hang on just second we have
some audio huh so basically like I said
it breaks your traditional concepts of
photography so framing and composition
are totally out the window different
mm-hmm you also because you have such
wide lenses you end up with a very
different look and based on where you
put the camera you're going to get a
different experience when you view this
back so I'll give you some examples like
here we are
on the beach and we're really short
actually it makes sense though because
so our subjects were really short okay
you know here's another example I'm near
like a blade of grass so I'm an ant
right now and this is actually some kind
of like star photography and stuff like
check that out this is a really long
exposure this was at night and you can
you know see the stars in the sky which
is pretty cool so it really like here's
another great example you know here we
are and I can actually see did you take
it from a drone that's what it really
looks like and what's interesting about
well about the way that the theta does
if if we look down all we'll see is this
little aberration right here where I'm
holding the camera see if I can zoom in
to that and that's that's pretty much it
we'll get into the equipment that I use
but that's being able to get that shot
is really cool because then you can take
any of these that look good like here
where the Sun is coming through and even
if you're not planning to use it like
360 you could say oh well now I'm going
to crop this and it becomes a you know
non 360 photo what if you want to take
yourself out of the picture okay so
that's tricky here we go here's another
one from the same abandoned building and
I'm in it but if I go to the next one
all right so this is that building again
and I can spin around and you'll notice
where are you are you creeping behind
that window zellers yes I am actually
that you can see a little bit of my
shoulder right there so it takes a
little effort to remove yourself from
the
photograph in fact I think I have
another one right here so this is again
I'm an ant this is at muir woods and
this is being done with a remote shutter
using my phone and then actually that's
just Kirby cuz kitty
because Kirby because of course or you
know this is another really weird one
where it's like well where is this when
I show this to people who are like oh
cool what drone did you use to get that
photo because I'm hanging over these the
Carson falls here in Marin and then
here's the last example this is actually
check this out that's pretty cool
did you know that there is a swing
there's like a rope swing overlooking
the Golden Gate Bridge no yeah for all
the Bay Area locals if you haven't found
Kirby Cove which funnily enough Kirby
but yeah here's one in the Marin
Headlands where I am removed from the
photograph and it's a little tricky
because you have to use like the remote
shutter which has really terrible Wi-Fi
performance so I'm actually hiding
behind that rock right there and so
there are some inherent problems with
some of these like for instance it's
kind of obvious where the camera is
based on that shadow yeah so there's a
lot of different is in the techniques
it's very experimental it's fun because
you're no longer thinking about
capturing an angle as much as you are
the entire scene and then the way that
you position the camera still has a
major difference on the tone similar to
cinematography if we were shooting this
from above you might feel like a fly on
the wall if we were shooting it from the
below you might feel like an ant if your
head level especially if you're gonna do
VR videography you really want to be a
head level because otherwise everyone
feels like I don't know really weird so
what is in your arsenal of gadgets you
have a lot of stuff yeah so that's
actually the problem with that I was
really excited just because this camera
is so small I like to pack very light I
haven't brought my DSLR on a trip and so
long because it's so large and Wow but
the thing I'm excited because it's so
small and it's kind of my go-to right
now just because I really like the
workflow it's sadly the best there is
out there I'm not saying this is
fantastic but I've tried
of these and and they're not all great
yeah but it does take some equipment to
to make this look good so for example
one of the essentials is a tripod yeah
so I'll either use this guy right here
there you are
so the tripod that is a tripod and
that's a Joby Micro tripod these are the
guys that make the grip like this right
and so that gives you just a little
something better to you know stick that
camera on it uses a standard 1/4 20
mount so the same thing that you'll find
anywhere else on cameras I also like
this this is by Nova flex yes I'm
familiar it's incredibly light the nice
thing about this is it works very much
like a
ya Tinkertoys so you just pop these legs
out and then you end up with you know a
pretty stable platform and I say pretty
stable because it actually is the way
that these are so wide the reason that I
do that is because I also bring a selfie
stick I know of course I'm on set with a
selfie stick because I like to be able
to get a little bit of length because
I'm not gonna leave it somewhere no it's
not this is honestly a specific to pod
this is all controlled through your
smartphone over the with ease okay so so
I'll attach this to there but actually
the one that I'm bringing to Australia
which I'm really excited about this is
brand-new for this year from Manfrotto
which I love their equipment this is a
monopod right so this extends out like
you would normally expect yeah and
you've got your regular quarter-twenty
head you know if your tripod there but
in addition to that on the very bottom
you also have 1/4 20 which means that in
fact I'm going to extend these down so
that we can actually see it on the set
which means that I can go ahead and put
the theta here on the end and now I have
essentially a selfie stick right but
what's really exciting about this is if
you just use something as simple as a
quarter 20 nut that's really long
essentially this acts as a coupler so I
can go ahead and screw come here I can
screw this onto the bottom
of the handle and now screw this onto
here and I've just turned a little bit
of kit into essentially a tripod that's
awesome and what's nice about this is my
DSLR though yeah well this'll go 55
inches no it won't but all of these 360
cameras are pretty pretty light so there
we go and this is almost head height so
that if I were to shoot a photo like
this and I wanted to us to be in it then
it would be at the right angle because
if it was on the floor we'd be looking
up at us and it would just be like a
nostril cam nobody wants that so what
about to view them so to view them are
you bringing this with you know the gear
VR is a fun toy and if you have a
Samsung phone that supports it it's
worth the hundred bucks to check out
otherwise any Google cardboard viewer
will do the trick and as far as
cardboard viewers I can't speak highly
enough about these little guys I just
carry it in this tiny little case and
this is you know there are a couple of
people that have integrated this exact
design but check this out that just pops
out like that and then slips onto your
phone and now you know wherever you are
you can go ahead and experience that
photograph that you just took which
totally adds a different element to the
photo
completely and I guess I'll put some
links in the show notes to these these
are really inexpensive yep those work
with glasses oh yeah hey that's pretty
cool it's pretty cool find out about
that so what's next for 360-degree
photography ubiquity I'm hoping my hope
is that what we'll see is as more and
more cameras are coming out we sell a
bunch of stuff at CES we're gonna see
the availability of the Samsung and the
Nikon are the two big ones that I feel
like are going to bring this to
consumers GoPro has announced that
they're working on one they have
traditionally had just like giant rigs
where people with feeling that mouthfull
GoPros it is well you know they're
coming down like we're in kind of the
four or five hundred dollar range here
for what essentially are the point and
shoot equivalents of 360 cameras but to
see the likes of Nikon getting into this
game it will probably begin with action
sports kind of stuff I mean this is you
know really cool if you're doing like
some kite surfing or something like that
you
only one have one of these on your
helmet to share that experience because
I would love to put on a VR viewer and
feel like I'm you know catching those
waves yeah totally
the other big thing that's going that
needs to happen in addition to more
ubiquity in the camera space and that
price dropping so that it can become
like a really you know consumer action
camera device is the social media
platforms need to catch up yeah so right
now we have the likes of Facebook and
YouTube supporting these four videos on
Twitter please not currently I want this
on Twitter no I want this on Instagram
how dare ya and so yeah right but it's
currently not supported on Flickr or
Twitter or Instagram or you know pick a
social network basically it's video on
YouTube and Facebook and that's that's
kind of where we are right now and I
would love to see as far as like the
mainstream popular networks so what it's
the chicken and egg thing but I feel
like we're moving into the industry if
you're watching this in 2017 this
segment is already totally old but
anybody really uploads it and puts the
name 2017 on it you know it's old yeah I
love it when they do that what's next
for me though is as you might imagine
coming out of the series that we've been
doing here recently was gonna put this
on a drone are you absolutely why
wouldn't way yeah well it's gonna be an
interesting I mean it might put you over
250 grams it definitely will and it will
make for an interesting design
requirement in that the CG is gonna be
all over the place considering how tall
this is so that's one of the reasons why
I'm actually really excited about the
Nikon just the form factor along here
but yeah it's really cool thanks yeah
there's that that I'm leaving for Tokyo
in like two days because I I want to
bring one of these with me oh it'd take
like 360 photography of the temples we
might have converted the snubs well you
currently can just go ahead and search
your app store of choice depending on
your smoke smartphone for 360
photography tools there are a number of
apps out there you can already take
photo spheres with yours it just takes a
lot longer yeah so yeah there's
something to it there's so much more to
this let us know what you guys think
could get into the nitty-gritty of how
the math works or how to actually do the
photo editing or the video editing and
stick to this all together because it's
a fun little rabbit hole similar to the
drones but I just thought I would share
one of my new passions I love it techno
lust as it were with you yeah this is
great it was very much like
show-and-tell yes
show-and-tell for techno less mm-hmm

everyone to come to the warehouse for
workshops to build drones fly with hack
five calm and we did it with domain comm
made it happen super quick and easy had
the website up and online in no time
