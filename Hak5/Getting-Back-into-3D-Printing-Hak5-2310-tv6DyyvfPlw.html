solid joins us to talk 3d printers all
that and more this time on hack 5 hello
everyone my name is Shannon Morse
welcome to your weekly dose of techno
last hack 5 I am joined today by my
wonderful friend who I haven't seen in
ages hi it's so good to see you good to
see you this is David Randolph he goes
way back with us like many many days but
before we get into your story I want to
remind our fans out there and our
viewers that we've got a 30-day security
challenge over at youtube.com slash tech
thing that you can check out really
really fun full 30 days worth of videos
about all sorts of different security
related things great for consumers so
really easy to get into and kind of get
started on security and we're also
running a contest over at hack 5 org
slash contest it's still going for a few
more days throughout the month of
November so check that out if you're
interested in winning some free $100
gift certificates for the hack 5 shop
that's a big deal
and Metasploit minute with mu bik's he's
coming back youtube.com slash hack 5 is
where you can check out that entire show
but David I want to know what's been
going on because we go way back I mean I
remember the days when I was watching
you one system but we also worked kind
of together through discovery discovery
digital networks which is our the the
company that were networked with on
YouTube but you've been doing a lot
since then right I have been all over
the place I I used to also work for
Discovery Communications as one of their
engineers there yeah and on the side I
was actually running a laser cutting
business laser cutting and closures and
3d printer parts yeah and that business
got so big that I actually made that
into its own separate company and it was
doing that full-time Wow and then it got
so big after that I had to consolidate
down I actually joined with my buddy
Matt Gordon and he owns printed solid
and I sold my company into that and now
I'm co-owners of printed solid nice ok
cool so so back in the day you guys
might remember
there was a time when we were doing
episodes a hack 5 out of a garage that
was David's garage when Darren first
moved out here to California and then
since then even dad you started up print
and solid calm with your co-owners so
you've been doing a ton of stuff behind
the scenes like it's been a while since
we caught up it's been a while it's been
about four or five years now and I've
been all over in fact I'm all the way
over in the East Coast now yeah and you
know what Delaware Delaware is oh how
interesting Delaware but it's a great
place for the business to be located
because it lets me get to New York down
to DC and anywhere in between and
actually be physically there because
there's a lot of makers there there's a
lot of hackerspaces there's a lot of
community projects there's a lot of fun
government projects and we get to play
with all those people as well do a lot
of Education okay education so tell me
what does printed solid do I know that
you know you sell filament and stuff
like that but what else do you do well
we sell the filaments we sell the
printers we actually have in store
classes where we actually teach people
the intro to 3d print and we have an
advanced 3d printing we even have a octo
print class that we teach there as well
don't print octo print so we do use it
as the basis to teach people a little
bit about Raspberry Pi and get them
started on the Linnet got it and you're
gonna teach me more about that in a
future series absolutely absolutely
yes that's gonna be fine and we also do
a lot of manufacturing there we actually
have a separate warehouse where we do a
laser cutting manufacturing Wow and we
do a lot of 3d printer enclosures and we
also do a really interesting project we
do medical medical jigs for operating
rooms so it's it's it's a really cool
industry to be in yeah it sounds like it
so we've done a lot of that for a lot of
people we've done some other companies
that you know can't talk about the
product we make for them but we've
actually do manufacturing or extremely
niche companies as well for 3d printing
laser cutting as well yeah and it's
interesting because our specialty is
filaments it's not just plastics anymore
there's a lot of really
unique materials out there like what
well an example is that in the old days
there was just PLA and abs and that was
it yeah yeah that's what I remember
working with back in the day so I would
constantly ask people at CES like Oh
does your printer print abs or PLA like
I knew what I was talking about right
and there's so much more now there's
actually quality great differences
between different PLA s there's really
tough PLA s
there's PLA s that have mixes in them
and examples like this one is PLA based
but it actually has bronze in it and it
makes it really dense and heavy very
heavy but it actually will shine up and
have a bronze look to it there's pillow
mints that have stuff in it like wood
this actually has a wood pulp and so it
actually will take a stain to it as well
and really ban that with wood sandpaper
oh it's so light too and it's really
light so you get interesting looks
yes shiny ones shiny to work with
gorgeous my favorite is my favorite one
is the coffee one as well so I I might
have licked that and it did not taste
like coffee no it does not but let's say
this your 3d printing something that
needs to be brown yeah and it's early in
the morning
well this smells like coffee while it's
printing that's the only time smells
like coffee its primary purpose in life
is to smell like coffee while it's
printing really yes I'm gonna hold you
to that
yes while you're here since you're
visiting for a few days I'm gonna make
sure that we try this and if it does not
smell like coffee I'm gonna make you go
buy me some Starbucks
alright that's that's a fair deal okay
so and that's what and that's what I
like to say is that's what makes the
filament so unique these days is that
you can get that specialized if you want
to that's so weird
okay so I know it's been a long time
since I built my own 3d printer I have a
lot of questions about what's been
happening in the 3d printer world I've
been so out of it lately Aqua Net I have
a very serious question about Aqua Net
is that still a thing it's still a thing
but not as much um people have moved on
if they're slightly better surfaces in
the old days it was Aqua Net and Captain
tape for everything yeah and and that's
still kind of popular for people are
still doing ABS printing okay but the
better surface these days has always
been the pee
or even playing glass printing oh yeah
yeah so what is Pei
well Pei is a material that actually
when you have a heated bed yeah it will
actually heat up and the pores kind of
expand a little bit and as you print on
it it locks whatever you're printing on
to it and then when it cools to room
temperature the piece will come off
sometimes I'll even pop off and jump off
the bed it's really just right oh that's
cool and all that requires is you just
keep it really clean you don't have to
keep applying stuff to it all the time
and it it last a good long time okay you
maybe only have to replace it ever you
know thousand hours of printing that's
awesome so pretty far with it there was
one thing though that I messed with back
in the day and I feel like I might have
done it wrong acetone yeah really sure
what I was doing but I think I was using
it incorrectly well the thing is is that
acetone is extremely permeable and very
volatile yeah so when you wear gloves
you know like the latex gloves or
anything like that it actually won't go
through the latex into your skin and we
do have trace amounts of acetone and our
blood already but when you over expose
yourself to it there can be some medical
problems from that so if you're messing
with acetone do not do it without rubber
gloves and wearing a respirator oops
so this it's a good protection I I'm
sure you're fine but people that do it
way too much yeah
there are people that are experimenting
with ABS and acetone vapor bath thing we
do that a little bit unhealthy and it's
very unhealthy and very dangerous and
very flammable okay we do a little bit
of that in our shop and when I say in
our shop I mean outside in the parking
lot with a fire extinguisher nearby
where you get that good ventilation the
good ventilation and if there's a fire
which can very easily happen you've got
to be careful with it so and I will say
this we don't teach people how to do
that because we don't want people doing
that we don't feel that it's safe enough
for people and mess with yeah just skip
that whole idea skip that whole idea if
you want to there's other people that
have done YouTube videos on it stay away
from it if possible
now you mentioned fires and I feel like
lately I've seen a lot more metal
printers as opposed to what I built
which was a wood printer and does is is
the fire issue is that anything really
to why we're not seeing wood anymore as
far as 3d printers go or is that
something different the the wood part of
it is not so much about the fire it's
that wood expands and contracts with
moisture and warps over time and for a
3d printer to be very accurate wood is a
bad idea yeah it was a great idea when
we first started making 3d printers out
there and a good way to structure it
like we would laser cut them right laser
cut yeah and everybody could build their
own 3d printers so it was super easy
super easy and that's how it kind of got
started was everyone was figuring out
that's the fastest way to make it now
with metal open build extrusion stuff
like that it's gotten a lot easier to do
pure metal 3d printers nice and you
don't have to worry about the fire thing
now fire is still an issue with some 3d
printers okay and if you buy really kind
of cheap Chinese printers their wiring
is not so good and you can actually see
a lot of stories out there about how
their printer caught fire because of bad
wiring and so you got to be careful with
those and so the higher quality printers
you get the less likely they are to
catch on fire and those companies are
more concerned about that with the
wiring and what-have-you
so another thing I'm curious about is
when I built my printer brought 3d
printer the calibration was just a
nightmare like I could not get it right
and it just it was so frustrating but I
know that a lot of them are
plug-and-play now kind of will kind of
plug in play you still have to put a few
parts together but do you still have to
like manually calibrate everything most
of the higher-end printers actually
don't have that now I mean I think
there's a look several printers
underneath you know $1,000 these days
that have auto bed leveling and auto
calibration you're under a grand where
have I been
so it's great something really good I
mean high-end printers are still under
three grand yeah and really high-end
printers are still under five grand I
mean the prices have maintained while
the quality has gone up okay which has
been really wonderful that's so nice now
while you're on the subject about
different kinds of printers MakerBot and
Printrbot were the only names that I
really knew about like four to five
years ago what kind of brands do you
have now like who's the big name the
it has really spread all over the place
I know like this I see printers all the
time at CES but I'm just like I have no
clue who you are
so who's who's a good one so a good ones
these days are I mean ultimate and
lulzbot definitely kind of lead the
good-quality out-of-the-box pre-built
printer okay good kit printers these
days is actually from Peru so they
actually make a good little print kit
version well the reason why is because
they were the first people to Joseph
Russa who actually is the owner and the
Venter he is designed that primary
concept so whenever you see that $200
cheap printer yeah they used his
open-source designs to make that but he
makes a really great series of printers
um a semi CNC makes a really good you
know kit printer as well and both of
those are under $1000 all right there's
still a lot more in just the Chinese
market there's probably 20 30 companies
that are trying to all make ripoffs of
each other and stuff like that
so there's so many to choose from but
like let's say I'm gonna ask you for
some recommendations let's say that I
don't have a lot of money but I want to
get into 3d printing I just want to like
you know put my feet in the water and
see if it's a hobby that I want to get
into what would you recommend for
somebody who can only spend like a few
hundred bucks
so the Fisher Price my first 3d printer
that I would recommend
exactly is the monoprice mini it's kind
of my little favorite it's a sub $200
printer okay and it does a pretty decent
job doesn't require too much tuning it's
got a very small build volume that's
nice but it's enough to say I like this
industry I want to do more okay we
actually teach an intro class at our
place and we as part of the class we
give everybody that printer just so that
they can go home 3d printing right away
that's cool yeah kind of get them
started into the idea of how to use it
and everything like that get them hooked
get them hooked
exactly no but if I am a hobbyist and I
want to have all that fine tuning and I
want to have all that customization
abilities well then you move up and you
have to decide do I want to build my own
3d printer right oh I want a printer
that works out of the box
right if you want to build your own 3d
printer you get into like the proofs of
design that's probably my favorite you
know build that you build it yourself
printers out there but other ones to
think about is like the Cree ala TC art
as a good sheet printer is about 650
bucks give or take and you have to
assemble it but it requires so much
tuning and tweaking I still consider it
a kit printer good to know then you move
up into I want a working printer out of
the box experience yeah that's
definitely where Lowell spot comes in
they make a printer called the mini
which has a decent size a little small
build volume great printer it's about
$1,250 then they make this giant test
six printer which is about $2,500 and
that you know you can be up and running
under an hour on that and then you also
have ones that are like dual extrusion
right you can do different colors and
work with other even more specialty
materials so there's a printer it'll do
dual extrusion but they'll have it
they'll also extrude this PVA material
that dissolves in water so all the
supports you just throw your print in
the water so not all printers are going
to use the same exact filaments there's
gonna be some printers that can't use
like whatever film in the filament you
might want to use correct okay and the
in it varies about a big contributor to
it is the temperatures so you have to
think about how hot the bed can really
get how hot the novel get okay so let's
take like the lulzbot since we got one
shipped here that we're gonna mess with
and I'm super excited about that like
what kind of temperatures can that one
range
well the extruder itself will could get
up to 300 degrees that's how hot it can
get the plastic outs okay it can work
with just about any material right out
of the box because 300 degrees is the
ideal temperature to work with then you
want to make sure your bed will get at
least to a hundred degrees as well a lot
of printers still don't have a big issue
for me when I was messing with printers
back in the day I just couldn't get her
to get up to where it needed to be and I
was I didn't know how to fix it and you
have to be careful because some some
manufacturers out there especially the
cheaper brands and no-name brands they
tend to say all our bed can get up to
this temperature and our nozzle we can
get up to this temperature yeah most the
time those are just bold-faced lies so I
still called you out I know but I tell
them
realistically go and check somebody else
that says I absolutely got it up to this
degree an example of this is like the CR
10 yeah I think it's a great cheap
printer but they advertise their bed can
you have two
degrees internals won't get up to 300
degrees their bed will never get above
80 their nozzles never realistically
gonna get above 250 oh so that's good to
know
you get limited on what materials you
can work with so that's one thing to pay
attention to and obviously price is
another good thing to pay attention to
is there any other information that you
should throw out there for people to
pick a 3d printer as far as like
technical specs that they should pay
attention to and stuff like that the
build volume I tend to find that the
bigger the printer the the less quality
you can get out of each individual print
why is that well because there's a
bigger frame to it so when you're
working with a bigger frame there's more
chances of a little bit of wiggle wobble
or yeah you got those much longer frames
so like it might move back and forth a
little bit just a little bit shake just
a little bit and so you decide how big
do you really need to print okay if you
need to print small stuff all the time
and that's all you really think you'll
ever print just get a little one get a
little printer you don't get the big
printer to print little stuff okay I I
have unfortunately way too many printers
in my house and if I'm printing
something small I use the little printer
if I printing something big I use the
big printer how many printers do I have
nine working in my house you're working
I have a graveyard at my house as well
this is not including how much we
actually have in our shop running right
this is just my personal collection okay
so speaking about a collection of
printers do you have any recommendations
for how people should store like the
filament and the products and things yes
you you will notice a lot of kind of
information out there and people say oh
you need to put all your filaments and
he's you know desiccant based boxes and
vacuum seal and each time you use them
keep them in a container here's the
thing you don't want expose in the water
take them out put them on your printer
use them when you're done put them back
in a ziploc bag okay now if you forget
and leave your filament out for too long
which is let you know like four or five
days you've left it out there and you're
just forgot about it you can get a food
dehydrator and literally just pop the
filament in the food dehydrator to dry
it back out and use it again people have
done it where they put in their oven to
dry it out and stuff like that I like to
stay away from that because the people
screen screw up their ovens too much and
you end up with a pile of melted plastic
Oh
No and because they set this temperature
on food evaluators rarely get above a
temperature that you have to worry about
something perfect for rejuvenate in old
school okay I also say the worst rumor
that was ever spread out there was that
desiccant is the magical substance but
I've been told desiccant is amazing yes
it can save my smartphones it's the same
kind of you know bad rumor of throwing
your phone and rice dries it out and
saves your phone you're telling me that
doesn't that doesn't work because if
that was true then rice would become
soft at room temperature from all the
moisture in the air that's a good point
the same is true with desiccant it does
absorb moisture out of the air okay but
it only absorbs that you know based on
their be moisture in air it doesn't
necessarily suck moisture out of the
filament it keeps moisture from going
into the filament okay so if you ruined
your filament and it's already moist
desiccants not gonna do very much for
you good to know if you don't ruin it
it's not bad to throw a packet in there
okay
that's the secret well since we're
talking about rumors are there any other
like terrible rumors you've seen out
there that you just like what to debunk
while you're here oh boy um there are so
many rumors my favorite is all of the
surface prep it's out there the Aquanet
versus glue stick versus tape and I'll
tell you and I guarantee you if anybody
comments on this they're all gonna and
they're 3d printing people they all have
really strong opinions about painters
tape works the best dad you see the same
thing in InfoSec horrible very strong
opinions about very specific ways that
you should do things and in the same
things true here but I'll tell you this
Pei is the magical substance and it's my
personal preference across the board
okay the only problem I have with Pei is
that when you print a BS or nylons or
TPU or TP materials yeah you sit there
and go I have to put a little bit of
glue stick on there because it sticks
too well to Pei okay so the glue stick
ends up making like a little layer
between the Pei and your PLA so that
when it prints it doesn't end up filling
those pores and not being able to get
out well with PLA you don't have to
worry about you don't want glue stick
down for PLA is for
more exotic materials okay since most
people are printing PLA I find Pei is
just an amazing surface to print on yeah
if you don't have to put anything on it
you don't have to put anything on you
have to just keep it really clean where
have I been so and then the if people
that don't want to go and mess with Pei
I say use glass yeah and then glue stick
by the way the best room are allowed to
say is people that say hair spray is
better than glue stick and all that
stuff
Aqua Net Aqua Net the reason why I will
net works is because it has PVA units
the reason why glue stick works is
because it has PVA in it they're the
same okay the difference is how you
apply it and here's the problem you take
hairspray and you spray it on your
printer it goes everywhere yep it gets
all over your gears your rods and
everything else so unless you can remove
your plate take it outside spray it down
let it dry put it on your printer yeah
use glue stick so you don't get it all
over the rest of your printer cool good
to know well you have a ton that's in
store for us I'm super excited because
this is the start of a whole series
about 3d printing I'm super stoked to
have you come on board with this I can't
wait to hear more because I feel like
I've been missing out for four to five
years I saw the beginning of it I got
scared and I left so I'm really excited
to come back and like embrace the whole
3d printing experience well we'll get
you addictive we'll get you back again
well yeah bring you back into the fold
so we're gonna be building a lulzbot Taz
6 correct correct we're gonna be talking
to lulzbot
about doing an open source business
model which is very exciting I know
Darren's excited to talk to them about
that what else are we gonna be doing
we'll talk about materials right we're
gonna go over a lot of materials and
just kind of give the gamut of what's
going on with materials now yay we're
also going to do a little episode on
octoprint octopi I got the Raspberry Pi
sweet and then we're gonna dive a little
bit in the Marlin and talk about a few
studies and they're Marlins the firmware
that's used on all the 3d printers out
there quite a bit this is so exciting
thank you so much David and by the way I
did a nice little extra project that's
just for hack 5 did you really yes I did
what is it oh we're not gonna tell you
got the watch oh you'll have to wait
although I might have posted a little
teaser uh-oh I think I know what you're
talking about I might
posted a teaser on my Twitter account
but it was my personal Twitter so
there's a lot of people that haven't
seen it yet there you go yeah I think I
know oh that's that's gonna be really
fun I can't wait to do that one well
where can people find you if they're
interested in if they have questions
about 3d printers because I know we will
receive some questions so they can go to
print us allcom you know we have the
normal you know II Q&amp;amp;A sections cool
we're on all the social medias that
instagrams the Twitter's the Facebook
all that stuff we're most active with a
lot of our support questions on Facebook
so definitely come hit us up over there
and you also have a coupon code for hack
five viewers yeah we want to go so that
you know they can get a good discount on
all these premium filaments if we're
gonna get you guys into higher-end
filaments we don't want you to you know
it's our pleasure and my favorite is is
that you know we spent forever thinking
of you know a really complicated code
that couldn't be hacked and all that
stuff and we came up with it after much
deliberation and it's hak5 oh that's a
hard one write it down folks that's a
it's a tricky one that's a hard one to
remember
HHA five for 10% off on checkout it
printed solid calm cool very thing well
thank you so much really appreciate your
being here we're gonna have you back
next week to build the lulzbot I believe
super looking forward to that so make
sure you stay tuned and subscribe to
youtube.com/americancasinoguide
oh I would love to see a 3d printed
squirrel holding the packet squirrel
like a whole nut oh I like that what did
that be cute it's like that alright hack
five org define all of the other shows
that we do and until next time trust
your techno list
if you have a great idea bring it to the
web the way Shannon and I do and head
over to domain comm with an awesome
domain discovery service and a quick and
easy checkout process you'll have the
perfect site up and running in no time

fans which is why hak5 will save you an
extra 20% at domain.com or just send my
tweet and say thanks for supporting hack
5 all these years so when you think
domain names think domain.com Shannon
your hair looks great thank you David
why did you go back to natural color
because I felt the purple was a little
too aggressive for the audience don't
look back
ray alright we're done here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
