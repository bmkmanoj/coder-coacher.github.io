and last.fm 2012 hacks get leaked and is
Ford going to introduce a new way to
unlock their cars all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for
September 6 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom make sure to subscribe

our patreon to see how you can help the
show grow patreon calm and now it's time
for the news now while hillary clinton
isn't at time of recording being charged
for anything by the FBI she is under
public scrutiny for her use of a private
email server to send and receive
important job related and sometimes top
secret emails from other government
staff the FBI has now released documents
pertaining to their investigation in a
60 page report that we've linked below
starting in 2007 some of the Clinton's
emails were on a Mac being used as a
server in their home which was later
transitioned to a couple of Dell's
running Windows Server in exchange a few
years later a private server hosted by a
networking company at their data center
was used for the Clinton domain emails
it was that same year in 2013 that a
Bill Clinton staffers email was hacked
with messages and attachments being
breached the problem was that many of
Hillary's emails were also stored on
that server including top secret
documents now while Clinton's documents
aren't known to have been stolen as well
the FBI did criticize her security as
extremely careless Clinton has also
recently come under scrutiny for not
releasing all emails for the recent
investigation which the State Department
has also taken some of the blame for in
a statement by the State Department
spokesperson Mark Toner quote it is
clear that the department could have
done a better job preserving emails and
records of secretaries of state and
their senior staff going back several
administrations we also acknowledged the
report's findings that compliance with
email and record management guidance has
been inconsistent across several
administrations that being said as a
result of concerted efforts to improve
the department is much better situated
today than during the historical periods
described in this report this
investigation is now closed as mentioned
but if any other security new surfaces
we will share that on the show or honour
social pages Dropbox was hacked back in
2012 in a breach that at the time the
company claimed was caused by usernames
and passwords that were stolen from
other sites and reused on the dropbox
site turns out more than 68 million user
email addresses and hash insulted
passwords were stolen at the time but
just leaked online last week Dropbox
does have two factor authentication
available so if you use Dropbox
definitely turn that on unfortunately
some of the passwords were still using
sha-1 which is a weak hashing algorithm
while others were using the stronger
bcrypt what is surprising in the dropbox
hack is how long it took them to take
such a basic step they finally reset all
affected users passwords but did dropbox
honestly not know about this blatant
hack of their systems for four years or
did they just want to keep the actual
truth secret we don't really know but we
have all the links in the show notes key
fobs those things that allow you keyless
entry into a car and sometimes you even
have a little button to start your car
instead of putting in a key well those
have been warranted as unsafe by infosec
professionals for quite some time now
due to their lucky encryption when codes
are sent to the car to unlock it thus
thefts have happened people have opened
doors and stolen stuff out of cars now
Ford has a patent up to use unique pass
codes to take control of a vehicle for
example you could set your passcode to
press the brake then honk the horn then
turn on the right turn clicker and then
the gas or something like that so it's
something that you know instead of
something that you have like a key fob
and it wouldn't necessarily have to be
used with a key fob to turn on the car
it gets a little bit weird or two fort
is also contemplating camera systems
that could authenticate the driver as
the authorized user for the car I don't
know how I feel about that but I would
love to know how you feel about it
last.fm a popular music site had a
breach of data way back in march of 2012
and soon after publicly informed their
users of the breach in june of that year
but the data from this hack has just
surfaced on the web along with dropbox
with site details including 40 million
usernames passwords date of joining and
some internal
data on the user's the passwords were
unsalted md5 hashes which means that
it's quite easy to reverse-engineer the
hash since the salting wasn't done in
fact leaked source researchers cracked
ninety-six percent of them within two
hours so basically if you used last
Stefan back in 2012 and you haven't
changed your password yet you should
probably do that like about right now
thanks again to all the fine people who
contribute to patreon.com/scishow and in
return we're going to build an RSS for
you and when we reach our next goal
which were super close to we will bring
on another episode every single week we
might even feature you're adorable fur
babies in an upcoming episode of throat
wire because they're so cute I love them
so keep on sending them in check out the
perk levels on patreon thanks again for
helping us keep this completely
independent in ad free of course if you
cannot donate hit the share button hit
the subscribe button share it on social
media and use the Haast hashtag threat
wires so that we can see it hashtag
hashtag threat wire that's hard for me
to say with that I am Shannon Morse and
i will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
