man-in-the-middle tools for linux
fingerprinting web servers the easy way
managing multiple ss8 sessions and
tracking government spy satellites all
that and more this time on hack 5 this
episode of hack 5 is brought to you by
domain.com your next big idea starts at
domain.com freshbooks online invoicing
and go to assist express support smarter
with go to assist Express well welcome
to high five my name is darren kitchen
my name is Shannon Morse and weekly dose
of technology my read is this a beer
it's a premier ale
it's a corked beer it's pretty it's
pretty easy I can say yeah alright this
is your weekly dose of techno so we've
got a great stuff going on this week a
lot of men in the middle of stuff and
got some OS fingerprinting which is some
spy satellites and we're finding out if
you are doing the Leia buns no no
actually we're recording the distance so
I guess because I started getting some
cases Twitter so yeah alright well then
guess we'll find out next week what do
you what do you having you having some
good stuff over there oh the camera guy
yeah what what's going on okay oh you
got the red rocket red rocket yeah we
just figured with you know do it
old-school like we used to and mix it up
awesome have some brews what do you
having I'm having coke Cola I'm driving
home today so I'm not drinking
right cuz I'm good no instead you load
it up on candy yes
alright well let's go ahead and get
right into the show I need to I didn't
say thank you dude because check this
out we got this wonderful note here from
Jeff from Upland California upland I
don't know it's actually found south its
downsides its downside spy I like right
so he actually wrote in and sent us get
this not only did you send us Windows NT
for
cute yes oh my god oh my god yeah yeah
he also sent to work maybe with all
spots maybe we could do a segment on
that he went ahead and also sent in some
discs for Microsoft arcade Windows 95
some C++ stuff Windows NT 4 Enterprise
Edition terminal server Edition and
Windows 95 with the USB support nice
yeah so I'm figuring those who's gonna
go up here with the rest of the goodies
we're gonna have a computer museum by
the end of the season because it's all
about 548 Market Street number three
nine three seven one seven six good how
29-foot 104 yes yeah I'm gonna get into
some headlines that we just had right we
just had a party it was so much fun
dude we had dual core there we had deal
cheese say it was amazing watching those
guys like flow off because they seem
like they've been like doing work
together so yeah yeah and they just like
Skype it was awesome yeah and we had the
silent auction you know it was kind of
just like hey let's have a silent
auction okay and we made we made $300 on
all the little but that's not for us
right no it's a hundred percent is going
to the Red Cross I donated about half of
it today and donating the other half
tomorrow actually
so yay I'm so happy we made some money
for those guys that's awesome made me
feel good I feel good that was a good
party and you guys didn't make it to the
party
stay tuned for announcements about
upcoming hak5 on the road doing some
BarCamp it may be in your town so you
know baby then you'll be able to enjoy a
read with us or or whatever you have in
your city like like mingling I know I
was thinking maybe we should go to the
East Coast so we could ever easily get
like Thanksgiving but until then it's
time for the hacker headlines
Jill breaking is fun isn't it again
jailbreaking is fun again red snow has
just been released by the dev team has a
nice and easy untethered jailbreak for
iOS for 3/1 it's available in Windows
and OS X for all of your Apple devices
except for the iPad 2 because apparently
the security on the new tablet has been
beefed up a little bit but you know
there's a lot of people out there and
I'm sure it won't take them long to
figure out a way around it
nice yes now check this out well we
don't typically report on the high jinks
of anonymous the group recently targeted
Sony's PlayStation comm with a denial of
service attack and left the website
periodically and accessible the group
released a manifesto announcing
operation Sony and pronounced Gio the
Gio ha lawsuit that we've been following
as an unforgivable offense against free
speech and Internet freedom which are
the primary sources of free lols sônia
later went ahead and tweeted that the
PSN may be inaccessible due to news you
know you can never do too much sporadic
maintenance yeah you know I watched that
YouTube video of anonymous releasing
that information to Sony saying hey
we're onto you and kind of a creepy
video we could do you could honestly do
a podcast called this weekend anonymous
and if you've got some spam very soon
not from anonymous in your inbox and
maybe because of a security breach at
epsilon Epsilon is the world's largest
email marketing service they say that
the only information that the hackers
got we're names and email addresses I've
gotten a lot of these emails so far from
companies all saying the same thing your
email address may have been exposed to
unauthorized entry into epsilon system
blah blah but it still means I'm now
vulnerable to phishing scams and all
sorts of stuff like that so just be
aware don't give out your info to any
kind of weird emails that you see
popping up from Victoria's Secret or
whoever wherever it is you shop yeah Tom
that we should have a segment on
phishing scams but mainly just making
sure that you're at the website that you
think you're at yes you know Bank of
America not Bank of America yes calm or
whatever it is RSA recently outlined how
their network was compromised in the
much publicized attack on their network
weeks ago turns out over a two-day
period attackers send two different
phishing emails to employees with
subjects like 2011 recruitment plan
which contained an Excel spreadsheet
spam buckets but they went into the spam
folder one of them retrieved it opened
you up the the spreadsheet attachment
which contained a zero-day vulnerability
for an Adobe Flash exploit and basically
from there the attachments yeah the
attacker was able to go ahead and
install a customized version of the
poison ivy remote administration tool
and basically from there escalate their
privileges across the network so now
yeah the vulnerability for flash has
since been patched and RSA claims excuse
me that the seeds used to generate RSA
keys have not been compromised and this
is just plain awesome to me
I'm absolutely kind of excited about
this so you guys remember the Commodore
64 right of course of course you do well
apparently Commodore USA is coming out
with a brand spankin new c64 with some
nice PC specs with advertisements
alongside the release of the Tron Legacy
DVD and also on blu-ray no detail
details on the specs just yet but I'm
gonna be checking back on their website
to find out more because pretty cool
yeah it's not the same Commodore though
you know the Commodores a Commodore
family that whole name has been sold
like um two billion times they've
resurrected and 97 games yeah in no five
they came to the u.s. in 2010 they start
these basically it's a mini ITX board
inside of mobile case I don't know it
doesn't have this it doesn't pull on my
heart strands the same way yeah I don't
think it has the same soul as a c64 it's
like a Centauri yarn damn jams gen
jogger yeah I know right
alright hey why don't you say we before
we get to the practical challenge
checking with Kirby's Carrie find out
about the internet protocol of the week
do you have what it takes to compete in
the crack the code challenge brought to
you by goto assist express test your
skills in our private lab network and
bid for the title of supreme leet hacks
or Windows will be featured on a future
episode of hack 5 our next event will be
Sunday April 24th marking on your
calendars at 3 p.m. Pacific time visit
hack 5 dot org slash challenge for all
of the details will be live streaming at
hack 5 org slash live throughout the day
so I'll see you there and now we'd like
to thank go to assist Express for making
this challenge possible as you guys know
there are a variety of tools on the
market that let you remotely work on
another person's computer but the one
that I trust and rely on every day is go
to assist Express brought to you by
citrix pretty much because it's got
exceptional performance it's so easy to
use and just a click you get a code you
summon someone over to fast support calm
that entered in there's nothing more to
it you're on their screen and they got
some of the best security in the biz to
end you don't need to worry about
anybody sniffing up in the Middle's
there's no IT maintenance no updates
nothing to download it's so great and
it's so fast you'll be viewing your
clients computer and troubleshooting in
no time at all so you can move on to
something more exciting than tech
support right and the clients computers
even you can even connect to someone's
computer even if they're not at their
computer you'd be like eh it's cool I
set up remote administration on there
you just go ahead and take lunch when
you get back your computer will be you
know fresh and new so you don't have to
deal with the client right yeah let's
try go to assist Express free for 30
days for this special offer visit go to
assist comm slashed hak5 again let's go
to assist comm slash hack
five for a three to thirty day free
trial
now recently we've been having a lot of
fun with men in the middle attacks
Shannon said you had to perform an
arbitrage poisoning attack on Windows
using Cain and Abel and then I showed
you how to detect that using X ARP which
is really spiffy crop Windows Linux
goodness right now she even then showed
us how to side Jack using fire sheep and
honestly eavesdropping is just plain fun
so this week I thought we'd do a little
demo and show you how to do it with a
couple of tools for Linux now again the
premise is the same we're gonna be doing
some command line stuff here is some
tools that will basically be telling our
victim that were the router and vice
versa
now the tools we're going to be using
are driftnet which is a suite for you
know all sorts of men in the middle
attacks are poisoning all of that stuff
and driftnet now a lot of people have
been asking about driftnet and basically
what it is
are these nets that go in the ocean with
these buoys and they fish and there's
it's really a big controversy they're no
good you kind of I'm not really for them
because you know if there's like a big
storm and then the ships come back and
the nets are gone and then those nets go
fishing on forever but there's no one to
collect them and then the fish just get
tangled in it and they're considered
ghost nets and it's just no good the
other drift net is actually a program
for your computer and you can get it if
you're using Linux and if you're on
Ubuntu like I am it's really easy type
sudo apt-get install drift in that space
decent if not a bit too both packages
and I figured before we go ahead and get
started we're going to actually need to
enable what's called packet forwarding
and this basically means that we're
going let the traffic that we're doing
as our men in the middle attack flow
through our machine and I know that
we've talked about this maybe two years
ago but I think it was a good refresher
and we haven't played with driftnet so
let's let's have some fun so I'm in here
in my my boon to machine and what I'm
gonna do is take a look at this file
here it's it's /proc sis net ipv4 and
forward IP underscore forward right and
I can see that it that the file is just
zero right well if I go ahead and say
echo one Wacka /proc sis net ipv4 I
P forward well I'm gonna have to sue to
a bang-bang that let's try that again
there we go so if I cut that file again
we've set it to one so we are already
good to go as far as letting our traffic
flow us are concerned so let's go ahead
and set up some screens and do a little
bit of our cache poisoning in Linux so
I'm going to go ahead and use this to
our cache poison my own machine you can
see here I'm in a boon to virtual
machine but I'm also over here and
Windows as my host you know check out
what my IP address is and as it has been
for the last few episodes I'm 10 1337
124 as seen right here ok so in this
case what I want to do is run the
command ARP spoof it's part of the D
sniff suite so will you do our spoof
taxi for our target and in this case
we're targeting the router and then my
machine so 10 1337 1 which we know to be
the router and 10 1337 124 which is me
and we're going to go ahead and just
actually think of my need some route
action on that there we go now I'm gonna
go ahead and create a split here in my
screen and a new one and we're going to
do the same thing here except this time
with with basically the reverse of it so
ARP spoof and then tack T and in this
case it's going to be 10 1337 124 first
and then 10 1337 and one after that
again I keep forgetting to sudo that
alright so we've got both of those
running now it's time to have some fun
because essentially we are the man in
the middle here now there's a couple of
things that we can do that are built
into the D sniff tool that I really like
so if I
you know say open a inter created a new
screen session here and say let's we
could run message snarf
so MSG SN a RF and then we're gonna have
to do Takei for interface and in this
case it's eth0 is our interface that's
going to go ahead and listen on that
interface which is part of where all of
our traffic is being sniped and say I
were to get on like yahoo messenger
gmail any of those regular instant
messengers as well as IRC it would
actually go ahead and see all of that
traffic and I could potentially you know
watch somebody's chatting session let's
see if I have any any actual IRC clients
going on here yes I do
let's flush server to IRC to hack five
org all right and I'm talking to the
guys up in IRC there we go and I can see
that all of that is happening in my boon
to session and I can go ahead and talk a
local host and really wrong and DJ Jeff
and all the fun happy people up in IRC
dot hack five org so let's that's a lot
of fun snarfing there let's stop some
more stuff there's there's other good
stuff to be had here another fun tool is
your else now and it works the same way
just issue attack I and the Ethernet
interface here in this case and what
this is going to do is we'll come over
here and go to I don't know
zomb Oh calm right then that's best web
site in the world
yes there it is there are also a whole
lot of other tools for snarfing like
mail snarf which you could imagine well
does is sniff emails what have you are
interested in passwords is another
really good one for that I'm going to
switch over to another tab here and
we're going to issue these sniff tack
if0 now D sniff is going to be listening
for passwords all sorts of different
types of passwords if it's just a
plaintext HTTP login a telnet session
FTP whatever so if I pull up my machine
over here for example and this shoe I
don't know
FTP to
this website here now I'm not actually
entering my right password in here
because I don't want to do that but if I
see that over here boom it shows up
right there I can see my username and
whatever password it was issued I mean
pretty easy stuff because it is a plain
text protocol and that's why we want to
use things like SSH stay tuned for a
very future segment on the bat because
we can do some fun men and middles stuff
there and now we should just go ahead
and move over to direct Annette because
I think that's one of the more fun ones
here so I'm going to go ahead and kill
Dee sniff actually I did not put it in
the background I'll kill it later and
run drift net and then with the
interface f0 and what we get here is a
little pop-up and right now it's not
going to do anything but if I are to say
come over to I don't know my Facebook
and let's refresh my Facebook see
anything going on there Paul has an
album
all of a sudden you get tons of info
over here as you can see it's just going
to fill up like crazy yeah it's a real
fun tool to just throw up as a
visualizer especially I'm like a
wireless network and just see what
everyone's up to especially if you can
just go ahead and set your wireless card
to promiscuous mode because then you end
up with with tons of fun stuff just sit
back relax and enjoy the show we can
actually go ahead and kill all of this
fun stuff now by issuing kill-all ARP
spoof and there we go I hope that was
educational I hope you guys have some
questions you guys know that you can
send him over to feedback at hack 5.0
what you guys like if it's a Turk app or
whatever and then you know we'll be
having a lot more fun with some more
sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks
here very shortly alright and I think at
this point we are gonna go ahead and
head over to Shannon and find out about
this week's trivia last week's trivia
question was what is the prototype that
was built in 1998 that encrypts
telephone calls using the symmetric
encryption algorithm idea the answer was
crypt upon this week's question is what
is the name of this prominent computer
club that was founded in Berlin in 1981
answer over at hack 5 org slash trivia
for your chance to win some sweet swag
and now Darin with a word from our
sponsor so let me tell you about fresh
books it's an easy-to-use online
invoicing service that's not only going
to make you look more professional it's
gonna get you paid faster and here's an
extra promise you might actually enjoy
invoicing I know I do a lot more than
the spreadsheet I was using before and
check this out it's completely free just
head over to FreshBooks com get yourself
a free account you can use it to invoice
up to three clients before you have to
even pay for anything so if your small
business startup you just do some
consulting work this is the ticket and
this is really cool too something that
they're doing just for hak5 viewers
they're actually going to be giving away
a birthday cake once a week to somebody
who signs up from our show so basically
when you sign up with fresh books go
ahead and under the thing where they say
where'd you hear about us just go ahead
and put in hack 5 and no it doesn't have
to be your birthday cake to win a cake
who does a little birthday cake go ahead
and give fresh books to try it fresh
books calm lemonade we'd sent you
on a recent episode I walked you through
how to use fire sheep to hijack another
computer session on your wireless
network I was able to see Darrin log on
the Twitter and I clicked on his
username and I wrote on his Twitter
account as at hack five Darrin not as at
snubs yeah I just hacked his Twitter
right I know awesome wasn't that
hilarious Darrin yes
well today I'd like to show you black
sheep which does the exact opposite if
fire ship sheep is being used by someone
on your network you can be warned and
block against it black sheep is a
Firefox add-on just like fire sheep and
it was based right off of the same
source code so it reuses the same
network listening back-end and that same
list of sites and corresponding cookies
etc etc by doing this and ensures that
the fake traffic generated by black
sheep is what fire sheep is expecting to
see black sheep will even show you the
IP address of the person's computer
trying to attack your account so now to
get it working first of all all you have
to do is download the Black Sheep add-on
over at this descaler website right down
there
disable fire sheep if you have it on as
well so that black sheep doesn't detect
it and then up in your options menu you
choose the interval you want black sheep
to create the fake traffic it's default
is on five minutes but I mean that can
work just fine I changed mine to one
minute just because I like one-minute
intervals instead and then you click OK
and you're done configuring and here I
can disable fire fire sheep so that it
doesn't notice now if fire sheep is
detected on your network you'll see this
little pop-up that pops up on your
screen so I'm capturing there we go
somebody is using fire sheep on this
network and it shows me my own personal
ID since I'm using fire sheep on this
machine right now ten dot 1337 dot one
or two that's so cute black sheep is
available for Mac Windows and Linux
you still need WinPcap if you're on
Windows and it only works with the
Firefox in only 32-bit although black
sheep does help with fire sheep you
still you should still be using HTTP for
all of your surfing needs anyway go over
to the Z scaler comm website to check
out black sheep for yourself and if you
have any other subs reports that you
want me to check out now head over to
feedback at hack 5 org and send those
over to me we'll be right back after a
quick hat tip from Darren that's right
once again it is time for that hack tip
and this time is a quick and dirty way
to ID a web server that is to say what
version of the HTTP daemon that the
server is running and this has gone
ahead and sent over from our pal away no
over a peek he'll attack 9 and you know
already everyone in IRC is mentioning
yeah you and tac SS Tech sv your target
intact P 80 and yes that's a great way
to do it Thank You DJ Jeff and everyone
in IRC that's kind of one of the fun way
things that we do here with the shoot
and show live and streaming and all that
good stuff over at hack 5 that a lot
live breathing it's good so but here are
a couple of ways to pull this off if you
don't have an map installed and the
first one is to do it with curl so if
you just issue curl tack a capital I and
then your target in this case pack 5 org
we're gonna go ahead and see here that
we see that the server is running Apache
2.2 point 15 and we got all this good
stuff going and that's all fine and
dandy but dude what did you think it's
been a pearl actually this is stock
Debian and I didn't have curl I had to
app get install that sucker with that
right well there's another way that you
can do it and it's real simple all you
have to do is fire up telnet yes telnet
so we do telnet space ww hack 5 org and
then 80 what we get is that it's gone
ahead and connected and thankfully I do
have a local echo back so you'll be able
to see this it's pretty simple but you
want to go ahead and hit caps lock
because we're going to need to issue
head space slash space HTTP slash 1.0
and then we enter twice and boom there
we go we got the same thing closes the
connection but we got all the server
information here and I see that we are
running Apache 2.2 point 15 which if I
come over here I can see there are
really some awesome vulnerabilities for
so we will have that patch before this
airs but hey how about that great way to
find out do a little bit of
reconnaissance if you don't have an map
installed you know what is tickling your
guys is Technol us go ahead and send it
our way
it's real simple all you have to do hold
down the start key hit run type in male
2 : tips at hack 5 org and then let us
know what you think we're if you're the
of the other Asian the news pine or is
that Elmo it's one of those and we'll be
back in just a bit after a quick word
from one of our sponsors do you need a
website how about a website for 875 a
month that's right you can get that over
at domain.com they've got wonderful
hosting plans starting from 875 all the
way to their Ultra plan for $15.99 it's
great service they've been hosting hak5
org for over a year now we couldn't be
happier I got domain names for under 10
bucks a year and you can even get
private registration so nobody can see
who you are in the Whois database I
recommend that if you need domain
registration if you need a web post go
ahead and check them out they've got
blistering fast DNS infrastructure I got
some of the lowest prices on the web and
honestly they've been so good to us and
our hak5 fans because you just tweet at
domain.com they get right back to you
they're good people go ahead and head
over to a domain calm save yourself 15%
at checkout when you use coupon code 8 a
k5 your next big idea starts at
domain.com
all right before we get going you guys
know we have some excellent emails as
well as your text book right Shannon
century the Technos photo the century oh
my a GE omen jeez really yes really yes
okay there's like I didn't know about
this we have emails a very first email
comes from Steve Steve says thank you so
much for the info you have been giving
out on screen and multiplexing screens I
just wanted to make you aware if you
weren't already of putti connection
manager download leak the most reported
feature is the tabbed interface for
putty but for me the best feature is the
screen splitting I can have one window
with all of my putty sessions open and
arranged however I want also you can
send commands to all viewable putty
sessions so I can run one command on
each of my servers at the same time
that's pretty cool I checked it out
unfortunately and I can screenshot of it
here up it looks really cool check that
out right so you can have like
boom-boom-boom but the thing that I
wasn't so fantastic about is the I guess
wherever the site originally came from
at least right now is down so I'm not
able to see if the source code is
available putty of course being yeah
they've got a database error and they
can't connect to my sequel or whatever
so that's kind of a bummer because well
I think that's great it is a binary
putty is something that I use because I
know it's open-source and I know that
it's been peer reviewed and I kind of I
get a little hesitant sometimes with the
binaries no I don't know I'm a lot more
paranoid since earning the show oh it's
okay go figure
yeah Nick writes thanks for sending that
in thank you Nick writes G predict is a
real-time satellite tracking an orbit
prediction application and it actually
runs better on his XP machine than it
does on his BUN to machine that's ten
point 4.10 dead end and that trap for
release to write laptops it's really
cool I happen to be a telecommunications
satellite comm guy and this software is
really neat because it has all the
satellite orbit locations pre-loaded and
after you put in your geo coordinates
it'll tell you when the Sal
we'll be visible awesome and at what has
a mess and elevation this month sure
we'll go with an elevation that you
should be using to see the beacon via
the spectrum analyzer and if you have no
idea what I'm saying which I don't you
can select all of the military
satellites from a drop-down list and
watch them move over the globe neat so I
actually went ahead and got this I'm
playing with it right here you can see I
only have like five satellites available
but I can totally see where they're
looping around so what's neat about this
is you see this yellow line I'm
imagining okay so that's yellow and
that's the dot is where the satellite is
and dude you're gonna have two emails
back and show us how to do this because
we need to do a segment on like stellar
photography show you guys how to create
your own time lapse meter thingy with a
couple of switches on your little cool
camera so you can take pictures of the
stars and I want to catch one of these I
love stargazing and whenever you see
like ISS go by and stuff that's just so
cool so I got to figure out how to use
oh look it's about yes that's ISS there
you go how neat is that select satellite
see if we can get that going ISS yeah
there we go
but it's like above South America right
now and that doesn't really do me any

1989 that he just up and found somewhere
it's this Tandy 5000 MC professional
system for $8,500 8,500
comic 1996 we're all talking about hey
check this out 1996 $3,000 would get you
100 mega depending him and all this
stuff and they're like oh three dollars
went on your head or whatever they like
and 110 dollars would get you a bulky TI
graphing calculator with around 100 or
ten megahertz CPU 24k of ram and a six
96 by 64 pixel black hair way I'm sure
uh what the hell TI and then goes on to
basically dis TI because come on why is
it still the same price for the same
crack crappy calculators seriously
right hate this it really sucks because
I can't like a lot of universities gift
programs and other programs like that
you can't just use like a PDA or Pocket
PC or yeah okay yeah I know right like
like oh no no here you must buy one of
those hundred something odd dollar
calculator I had that one I rinse that
problem taking the SATs no thank you for
that picture that's hilarious
like did people really spend that much
money in 1989 for a computer holy jesus
Batman actually I got mine on the
newspaper IBM pc/xt oh that's point
seven seven megahertz I got mine from my
dad I don't know what it was the first
one there's a family one but if you have
