by domain.com I've always really liked
programs that give me simplicity and
added value to my netbook making my
daily work and play much easier one of
these such programs is a tool called
rainmeter it's an application that lets
you place skins on your desktop that can
measure and display tons and tons of
different kinds of information some of
the things you can tinker with and enjoy
are things such as the system info
launchers and docks music players
there's an RSS feed that you can add in
a Facebook feed gmail inbox which is
very very nice for me a weather app and
times others the skins are fully
customizable and they're mainly just a
dot ini text file that you can change or
alter to meet all of your specifications
rainmeter is open source and it was made
for geeks by geeks it runs on all
versions of Windows including 64-bit and
it also has a portable version which I
love is near and dear to my heart which
is also available for download my
favorite part about rainmeter though is
the ability to customize all of the
different skins if you don't read
lifehacker you don't have to keep it in
the RSS feed the in the illest row app
you can choose to edit it or delete it
so for example in mine I went into edit
skin eyebrows down to where the link to
lifehacker was and then I changed it to
the heck five feed with hat five org
slash feat and I'll show you how to do
that real quick you just have to right
click Edit skin and then all of this
information in this text the feeds ini
txt file is completely customizable you
can do whatever you want with it so I
just need to go down here and find the
website URL there we go it's feed URL
equals now this used to be lifehacker
but I just filled it in with hak5 org
slash feed closed it and then I chose
refresh skin and it shows up with all of
the hak5 technol st goodness delicious
so now I'll immediately see every time
we have a new episode that comes out I
was also able to change the clock I and
I
skin so that the date and time is
formatted to all of my specs and I
messed around with the color a little
bit as you can see with the hak5 skin
you can also download other recommended
theme packs at the rainmeter website for
example I downloaded this really cool
one called no meter which I actually
like a little bit more it comes with a
lot of handy tools already built in like
the g Cal and the gmail inbox so let me
pull that one up real quick so I can
show you guys go into
and you just have to go down the themes
wherever you download it to and click on
the one that you like the most okay so I
pulled up no manure and there's a whole
bunch of different kind of skins that
are already developed into this theme
there's the system preferences the clock
and some of my favorites the feed for
facebook which I can just click on and
it automatically takes me to my facebook
the G calendar and the feeds for news
such as top stories and gizmodo very
handy and life hackers right there as
well so once you get the feel of diet
ini files and how to edit them you can
start creating your own which is the
best part now I haven't started creating
my own personal skin I've just been
customizing some of the available themes
but have you tried it are you interested
in seeing a skin that doesn't exist yet
make sure to email me at feedback at
hak5 org to check it out and coming up
next we will be answering some of your
questions but first let's take a break
and then check in with Darren for the
nibble we were asked what would hack
five be like if it were a paranormal
investigation show so we went to domain
calm and register dot TV to find out
these are the hack files there's an
kitchen when you said a thousand
decapitated rubber duckies washed up on
shore you weren't kidding were you know
I can only imagine this is the result of
a crashed alien spacecraft and their
deranged experiments
and what makes you say that
the wreckage
that's a soda can
look there one of the alien creatures I
mean I mean back over here
pray here in a kitchen have you been
drinking again let's stop cephalopod who
would plant a stuff cephalopod at the
scene of a crime Paul Tobias
if you're building a video site or your
website has a play button a dot TV
domain is the way to go TV websites let
you showcase your original content and
create a unique site not just another
YouTube channel go to domain.com and
search for the perfect TV domain for
your new idea then use the coupon code
hak5 at checkout to save an extra
fifteen percent looking for hosting save
fifteen percent on that too at
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
alright this nimble was sent in from
like everyone on Google+ and Twitter and
Facebook and emails and everything and
it's a really simple one that harkens
back to my old edit calm days and now
I'm not talking about a website it's
instead of control C control being
control x it's copy with control insert
and cut with shift delete and paste with
shift in sir it's great because it works
across the board in just about every OS
I've ever touched and any program that's
not going to by default be looking for
those key combos which is great in case
like your terminal doesn't like it
anyway great tip thank you guys so much
of course you guys know you can send in
your for bitsat hak5 org slash nibble
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
