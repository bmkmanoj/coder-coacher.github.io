continued pimp your WordPress blog with
awesome free plugins build a targeted
dictionary for your brute-force attacks
and mysteries of netcat revealed all
that in tons more on this episode of
hack 5
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by Squarespace
GoDaddy Gamefly and viewers like you
hey guys welcome to this episode of hack
5 I'm Shannon Morse
I'm Darrin kitchen I met LA stock and
this is your weekly dose of Technol s
guys what's going on this week having
lots of fun I'm looking forward to
tomorrow
michio airshow baby yes I love you're
gonna bring my 70 to 300 my Sigma I just
wish it was like f 2.8 but it's gonna be
a bright and sunny day so whatever you
know so are you actually happy with the
lens
I am yeah I played around with it's a
lot more and you know the conditions
that I was first playing with it in like
inside of a circus and on a boat weren't
necessarily the most steady conditions
no sir and this is gonna be really sunny
I'll just crank up the shutters who
happens I mean we'll see I really like
cotton candy
I like peanuts I like Matt's password
come up with it yeah you guys want to
play with the common user password
profilers take a look at this i'm i'm
playing back in backtrack four and i can
ya back and backtrack baby and there's
this really cool new utility over at
remote exploit and it's the i'm just
gonna call it cuppy because it's a
Python program and it's called Copp for
a common user password profile so I mean
that's like dot slash copy like what
your sister drinks out of okay so if you
go ahead and run that you get this cute
little ASCII animation here of a cow I
believe and we're gonna run this in
interactive mode what this is is this
helps you generate passwords for a
brute-force attack so if I was trying to
log into Matt's machine I may have a
huge dictionary file with like all the
stuff and it may even have those cool
likely options where I'll do like you
know replacing numbers for letters and
stuff like that but that's not really
specifically targeted towards Matt it
doesn't know his personality so this
helps you generate a a password
dictionary list that would be geared
towards you and I can even couple it
with a dictionary list that I already
have created so I'm gonna go through
let's see how well this bad boy
works alright so we're gonna call it
that let's see surname is less doc and
his nickname is Chu and his birthday is
let's see 18 no 21 11 1982 right yeah
okay and his wife's name we're gonna
just say Shannon she's nobs
wife's birthday where that would be
18 this is my husband nubbin 19 we could
rent him live child's name we're gonna
go ahead and say Paul nicknamed camera
camera guy camera guy
the in love with me girl I don't even
know Paul what T birthday dude 11:10 oh
yeah that's named Kirby all right
company name hak5 doin add some special
stuff yes we're gonna do radio with some
bullshit language the Browns yeah
because he likes that baseball to her
the football basketball football
football yeah feel free to email Darren
that he should follow and on sports and
actually learn what we're the base full
of people that we were watching shooting
hoops yeah yeah all right and then
finally something that Smurfs all of
yours I can go at yourself I will add
the Smurfs just get the characters yeah
we're not going to do special characters
and let's do random numbers at the end
okay and let's do leap mode and then
check this out so it creates this
dictionary file here and I'm gonna go
ahead and just open it up in nano Matt
did it creator or not yeah Matt tío
capital m and there we go you know is
your password camera guy less talky 9:23
no is it Smurfs 1982 season the dumbest
thing ever
well no seriously okay because if you
know all of this you've probably tried
every single one of those already
no now I have 90 mm of
these two try and I can just automate if
you're dumb enough if the user that
you're trying to break into is dumb
enough mm-hm
they're not gonna have 90 mm variation
because in their brain and tell you a
quick story on the systems administrator
like you you know the deal right you go
to help the person on their computer and
you're like I just need you to log in
right and I even say I don't want your
password just go ahead and log in I even
look away because I don't want to see
them type it because I'll remember that
crap right still say it out loud and
she's like oh it's Jordan 1993 why was
it Jordan 1993 that was her son's name
and the year he was born right okay but
you are the one entering this if you
already know it well no I already know
yeah I know I'm in a minute enough
you're an attacker yeah okay and you
already know so you already know all
that stuff about me I pulled it off my
days in Jordan 1993 the first thing
you're gonna try yes ah well it could
read your dumb users aren't that smart
it could be 99 no Jordan no this like
the workout it I'm just saying you know
just peruse the myspace get the infos
throw it in there put your BA at it have
a good time Touche yeah but don't do
anything illegal yeah yeah what else we
have well I'll let you guys know that we
are on a plethora of different you know
there's a crazy amount of ways to get us
yes we are on revision3.com and hack
five org oh no there's other places I've
heard yeah somebody asked me if we were
on iTunes and yeah I think we are
we've been on iTunes since before the
iPod head video if you have not realized
and you're not watching this in HD and
have the capability of downloading HD we
are in HD so you might want to go ahead
and subscribe to the HD RSS feed or the
HD iTunes eat yeah and you can also find
us on YouTube and TiVo and Miro and all
of those are at the top of hak5 org so
you know plan all your links there oh
it's for you to get us as far as TiVo
you have to have a TiVo connected box
but I'm sure you guys already knew that
so tell your friends you spread the
techno list yeah we're gonna have
contests yeah yeah does it involve
technology
yes what
a rash no good that's good I have to
think about the contest all right will
you do that because we're doing in
Easter day we'll do a little talk about
that later anyway so coming up later on
the show Matt's following up with
virtualization I know you're talking
about WordPress stuff I'm gonna take you
guys into the kitchen and we're gonna go
find out a little bit about kitties and
the Internet actually I've got a net cat
it's about hacking anyway let's come on
over here so today I want to talk about
net cat which is kind of like a TCP IP
UDP read/write tool it's an open source
tool it's cross-platform
and this is one of these things where I
just want to get through this stuff
because it's a real fundamental thing
that we're going to be expanding on a
little bit later when we start doing
exploits and then stuff like that it's
what what can be considered a Swiss Army
knife of tcp/ip or at least that's what
the developers kind of call it and we
are going to just learn by example here
I want to show you some of the nifty
things that you can do when you're you
know sending TCP or UDP or listening to
TCP or UDP and just reading and writing
those packets over the wire having fun
with it so let's take a look at these
quick examples and I think you're really
gonna grok how powerful this tool is so
first of all if we can go ahead and and
read and write TCP let's go ahead and
connect to an HTTP server just like we
would but like telnet or a web browser
or something like that I'm gonna fire up
netcat here I'm in backtrack for grab
that a remote exploit all some stuff and
it's just NC is the command V for
verbose and I'm going to go to 1010 no
31 which is my webserver up there on
port 80 and you'll see that I have
indeed connected and it knows it's a
webserver WW and I'm gonna write in here
head slash HTTP slash 1.1 right and when
I do that I get a bad request but what's
important here is that I actually get
the header from you know the banner of
this of this HTTP server and I can tell
that it's an Apache to point to point 11
server Eclipse known as like banner
grabbing so you can use this tool to say
like you're using an
or something and you found a you know
something interesting you could go and
use this to kind of query the service
whether it's like an HTTP server an FTP
server ESIC whatever right and in many
cases you can get version numbers which
are important for when you want to maybe
look up if there's an exploit for that
or something we can also use this as a
rudimentary chat so what I'm going to do
here since it's a read and write tool
kind of envisioned as a client and
server tool I'm going to be showing you
a couple of examples here with my
machine and backtrack three I'm sorry
backtrack four and also my Vista machine
upstairs so like I said netcat is
cross-platform so I have it here in
Windows and what we're going to do is
demonstrate how we can use it to do a
rudimentary chat so I'm going to issue
netcat Tech v for verbose and tech lp4
listen on port and we're going to use
one two three four so now the Windows
machine is just listening on TCP port
one two three four four whatever right
it's it's real raw TCP it's beautiful so
we're going to come over back to the
Linux side and I'm going to issue netcat
tech V and I'm going to give the IP 10
10 o 31 and port 1 2 3 4 and we've
connected but there's nothing really
going on we'd come back here and look at
the if I just scroll this over take a
look at our our windows side and we
don't really have anything interesting
until I type hello there we go right so
you know we can have a very rudimentary
chat if if you've ever used something
like TTY on unix it might be a little
reminiscent but there's a basic idea of
how those work and we're just sending
it's like a raw serial connection but
it's over TCP or UDP so let me close
that and give you an idea of alright so
we can send data well with some
interesting pipes we can actually send
some files so let's go ahead and create
a file here and send it to our friend
the Windows machine and this is
something that you could use if you
wanted to for instance send some log
files over it's just a real quick easy
way if you didn't have SSH set up to
like SCP a file over or FTP or T FTP or
email or whatever you could just you
know get a file across the network real
simple like this so for that what we're
going to go
ahead and do is listen on our cert will
consider our server-side so on the
windows side I'm going to do net cat
tech VN and listen on port one two three
four again and this time you can see I
am going to give it a little Walker
there and we'll come back to that in a
moment now we're going to need a file to
send it so I'm gonna go ahead and touch
Tina Fey here and I'm going to echo is
smoke in to Tina Fey alright and now we
have a living just cat that make sure
it's there
great it's there so I'm going to send
that file over to the Windows machine
using that cat now I just netcat tak VM
and I'm going to give it the port I'm
sorry
VM and then the port which is 10 10 oh
31 on port 1 2 3 4 and now I'm gonna
give it to Walker the other direction
I'm saying send this file into and that
file of course is Tina Fey press ENTER
connection refused beautiful because we
are not listening okay so let's come
back over here and say Tina Fey enter ok
now we're listening and we're expecting
whatever data that we get through there
to be pumped to the file Tina Fey on the
windows side we run this again on the
Linux side they are the only problem
here is we don't get like not like you
know W get has a beautiful little status
indicator when you're like your file is
transferred we get no information like
that since it's small I know it's done
I'm just gonna you know break out of it
and make sure it's there so I'm going to
dir Tina there it is and I'm going to
type Tina and it smoking there we go so
I mean it's easy as that now there are
two other interesting examples that I
want to show you kind of how powerful
netcat can really get and then later on
we'll talk about some other amazing
stuff that you can do the first thing I
want to do is show you guys how you can
set up what's called a command
redirection we're going to bind a shell
or a program or anything like that
to netcat just as we did with this file
so in this instance what I'm going to do
on
windows side is I'm going to set up
netcat to listen but we're also going to
have it bind to CMD dot exe or the
command prompt so on the window side
here it's NC tack L VP for listen
verbose on port 1 2 3 4 and tak e
cmd.exe okay so that's listening for a
connection to port 1 2 3 4 and when it
does it's going to bind that to the
command prompt so back over here and
Linux NC from netcat tak VN I'm going to
say 1010 231 and again 1 2 3 4 it's open
and just a moment here there we go you
can see I have the sequel and back such
tools I can say you know type Tina Fey
and there we go
so this is a great way to you know
quickly set up a shell if you don't have
as a sage or some other nefarious fun
stuff that we're going to be getting
into later now the thing about this is
is say like one of these machines was
like behind a firewall or something like
that maybe it was a machine on the
inside of a corporate network right and
we can't just pour forward nilly willy
we're not public facing and we would
like to get back to that machine later
from you know the the the convenience of
the hack house for instance well we
can't easily just listen on any port but
what we can do is do the reverse of that
we can send the shell to a listener so
in that instance what we're going to do
is set up the windows server here to be
the listener and for that and see - LVP
1 2 3 4 so we're listening for boson
port 1 2 3 4 and let's pretend let's go
back to over to the Linux side here and
let's pretend that this machine is the
machine that's behind the firewall and
we want to send it our our shell so in
that instance just like we were doing
before with the tacky of CMD we're going
to send it bin bash so that
and sea-tac VN and then 1010 231 because
that is public-facing or in this
instance in this example and then tacky
slash bin slash bash which is the
equivalent for CMD and Linux and there
we go we come over here and you don't
really see a whole lot it just lets us
know that we're connected but if we
issue LS here there we go we actually
have a directory listing and you know we
can run top we can you know run whatever
and we are on that machine now there's a
lot of other interesting things that you
can do with netcat and I'm interested in
what kind of crazy stuff you do with it
so definitely hit me up feedback at hak5
org for that and I actually have a
couple of of user submitted ones here
some some crazy ideas that you guys do
Kevin Sean writes to tell me that he
actually uses this to tail log files
makes a lot of sense who run in a
process on one server you need to go to
another computer so you monitor it
without having to do like a VNC session
precious roy mentions that you can
actually use this to DD or to do a disk
image of a hard drive from one computer
to another computer over the internet
and i'll have links to an article on how
to do that in the show notes Joey Adams
says that this is a great way to do port
redirection which we're going to be
talking about next week and then twitch
tastic or his email actually came from
domain administrator so I wonder what he
does for a living anyway he mentions
that you can use this the same like we
showed you with port 80 connecting to to
a web server well he likes to send user
agent Internet Explorer 22 just to
really screw with people that check
through their you know
server logs and then send the refer from
like lemonparty or something like that
which is quite mean anyway netcat
awesome tool open source highly
recommended check it out Windows Mac
Linux whatever have links in the show
notes fun ways to do this and I want to
let you know that we are going to be
doing some stuff that involves litter on
but right now I'm going to go
ahead and let you know that we have
virtualization coming up with that and
before then let's find out what's going
on with this week's LAN party all right
guys get ready I know you've been
waiting for it this month we are playing
Goldeneye source yeah that's right
we're gonna be playing over at GES hak5
org on Saturday May 30th so the end of
this month get prepared and if you want
to check out any cool games any cool
land parties that you're excited about
you can go over to hak5 land
squarespace.com and sign up and vote for
your favorite game
I think Darren has a little bit of
information for us about Squarespace
that's right willing to thank
Squarespace for sponsoring the land
party and I'm here on our land party
page and I want to show you a nifty
feature it looks like I'm just on the
page but I get this extra button here to
post a new entry and I can do just that
fill in my details here and what's nice
is I get a rich text editor and it's
kind of like a WYSIWYG I can click these
easy buttons here to add rich media like
I'm gonna add an image here from a
direct URL and what's nice is right
there within my copy I can go ahead and
grab these little selection boxes and
resize my image right from within my
document realign it and if I want to I
can get nitty gritty and take a look at
the code Squarespace is just that
powerful you can get your Squarespace

your service thank you Darren and up
next we have some awesome information
from Matt about virtualization over at
his office let's go join them
alright guys so we are here back in my
lovely office in Williamsburg Virginia
for part two of our virtualization
segment or intro or series if you want
to call it I've got a lot of good
feedback about the first episode that we
did which was basically just a intro
into the cost savings associated with
virtualization today what we're gonna do
is we're going to take that's one more
step further and instead of going into
the cost benefits we're going into the
disaster recovery or high availability
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to show
you some best practices for implementing
a multi host with Sam connected storage
for like a cluster or so on and so forth
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
whiteboard here we're gonna do is we're
gonna drive the best practices for
networking and storage so let's start
with our two hosts we say we've got a
two host virtual machine like the our
900 that I mentioned yesterday I know I
only said that I have one but we don't
have the money for a second one so we'll
go ahead and start with host number one
and host number two okay
these are both running VMware ESX 3.5 so
by themselves they would be you know
great standalone virtual machine hosts
however what we want to do is we want to
actually utilize a third box this is
going to be our master controller or
virtual Center server virtual Center is
going to connect to these two boxes and
it's going to say hey I now see two
hosts in this landscape if you will and
from there we can actually manage all of
the virtual machines from virtual Center
server instead of logging in to box one
to manage a certain set of virtual
machines or box two to manage a you know
another set of virtual machines so we've
got virtual Center all hooked up now we
need to hook up networking so how do we
do that well best practice is state that
you should have fully redundant you know
paths to each of your hosts so now we've
got
to network switches okay what we do is
you've got you know your your
interconnectivity you know coming
through so one two here one two there
one two here one two there so now if one
of these switches goes down switch two
kicks back in and does its thing now
networking is a lot easier in the new
version of VMware infrastructure which
is not called vSphere horrible name
great product which makes setting up a
data center network a lot easier I don't
have access to the beta but rest assured
as soon as we do get access to it I'll
go ahead and let you guys know how to
exactly set up networking the other
thing that you want to do is you want to
have another set of switches and these
will be your I scuzzy switches well I
just broke that don't think we're using
blue anymore so let's use black so now
we've got two more switches here okay
and we've got our our San here
now obviously replicating San is a
little costly and you need to get into
the EMC you know high-end equal logics
to actually replicates in storage so
what we're going to do is we're actually
going to go ahead and do just like we
did with yes so this comes down here and
then this one comes down here and this
one goes here and this one goes here so
you see we're trying to to implement you
know this is gets a little crazy however
when you think about it in terms of okay
I have one point of failure now I've got
another point of failure yeah one point
of failure at another point at one point
so this really becomes then your single
point of failure for you know hardware
wise now we can try and you know
alleviate that by going to
a properly architected raid 50 which is
basically spindle one is a group of
we'll say three in my case three drives
in one spindle three drives in another
spindle okay so these would each be raid
fives okay and then once we have all
these raid fives created we go ahead
actually that's wrong we actually
connect these up to a raid zero okay so
one of these each one of these is a raid
5 array which makes rebuilding should
one of these drives fail quicker because
you don't have to rebuild say a 12
terabyte array and also you get the
speed of striping across raid 5 arrays
so you've you've kind of mitigated the
problem of having a centralized storage
solution okay now the nice thing about
VMware ESX are actually should say
virtual center is the bolt on
applications that they have you can have
the RS which is I believe dynamic
resource sharing where it'll monitor if
box one is at 80% and box two is at 20%
you can set a threshold of I only want
these boxes to be you know peak
utilization at 60% so what the VMware
virtual center will do is it will live
migrate using a storage what they call V
motion and all these products have been
renamed so bear with me
it'll migrate a certain number of VMS
over to here to balance out to your
according to your specifications now the
other nice thing is like I said with
you've got V motion
and you can go ahead and live migrate
with no downtime from this box say you
have a hardware failure one of your RAM
sticks is dead or you know you've got
upgrades that you need to do to the BIOS
to resolve some funky thing you can
actually push everything over with like
minimal interruption in service we're
talking less than five seconds where you
could push all the virtual machines and
then you could safely you know bring
this machine down or you know upgrade it
and then from here push everything over
do the same to this one so here is the
ideal setup for your VMware
implementation SAN redundant switches
redundant switches for your network
redundant controllers and if you wanted
to you can even have multiple virtual
Center controllers now like I said I got
a lot of good comments about my setup my
setup is like I told you in the
beginning of last week not ideal
single point of failure on the server
you know sand space is an issue we know
I only got one network this is a very
costly set up not only due to you know
licensing fees but actually all the
hardware that you're going to need to
purchase however this is probably the
easiest way to do high availability
which is exactly what we've got set up
here dynamic resource sharing vMotion
capabilities with minimal down times and
service so on and so forth
think about you know that when you're
implementing a solution for a piece of
software which is millions of dollars in
which my company's case is s ap so you
know for you know however much it is a
hundred and twenty five hundred and
fifty thousand dollars in an
implementation like this you can
actually get away with I know your capex
budgets are tight but I really think if
you haven't already go ahead shoot me an
email with your questions mad at hacksaw
or post them on the forums but if you
have any questions about you know how to
architect virtualization I'm probably
I'm sure I'm probably missing something
here but go ahead email me I'll be sure
to answer it on an upcoming
so when we actually show you how to set
these things up so for more on this head
on over to Matt less calm or hak5 org
alright guys once again it's time to
tell you guys about trivia or so the
block is called now first of all we have
to talk about the monkey contest the
winner is announced right now and it is
spike Seavey listen we went through a
lot of these awesome submissions
everybody did a great job I if I could
give you a little league trophy Ollie I
would but we are actually giving spike
CV an epic sock monkey kit of his own so
he can make his very own crazy sock
monkey and hopefully send his pictures
from you know hak5 that's sock monkey
dotnet Thank You Tamara for all that and
I still want to let you know that there
is our coding challenge going on you can
get all the details at hak5 org slash
code challenge we're doing a little PHP
doing a gmail badge and having a lot of
fun with it so already seeing some great
submissions there's still companies to
get in on it so make sure you check that
out
the winner of such contests will be
announced next week on episode 512 will
win the awesome PHP reference book by
Mario urug and I think you guys might
really enjoy that and before we get to

egg hunt

so anyway hope you guys get in on that
and right now I'm gonna kick it back
over to Shannon to find out about
WordPress plugins to pimp your blog so
this past week I have been traveling all
over the WordPress site looking for my
favorite plugins so I went through
hundreds of them and I found I guess
what you would call them my top ten the
first one I want to talk about is twit
me it basically takes your blog post and
transfers it straight over to Twitter
and I have up a example right here I
just called it this as a test it
automatic matically types in whatever
you want it to and it gives a link over
to your blog the second one I want to
talk about is called socialite that one
does pretty much the exact same thing
except it works for Facebook MySpace and
Twitter I personally liked Whitney more
for Twitter so I just used social light
for Facebook and MySpace so I can get
all of my blog post transfer it over to
all sorts of different social networks
at the same exact time sociable is
pretty cool this one actually gives you
a whole bunch of share this icons and
you have 99 different ones to choose
from you can choose your favorite ones
to link to and there you go that's all
you need to know the next one I found
out about was called mobile press this
one I can actually show you on my phone
it actually made my blog into a mobile
blog so it shows up perfectly clean and
clear for anybody who wants to go to my
blog on their on their cell phones
except for some reason it doesn't work
on blackberry it just works on iPhones
and palms from what I know my fifth
favorite one is called resize at upload
plus this one basically takes your
images that you upload to your blog to
any of your new entries and
automatically turns them into your
defined width and height and nothing
over the maximum that you choose so on
my site I made all of mine turn turn out
to be less than 500 no more than 500 or
else it'll cut off everything on the
side so right here you can see this
picture actually is about I don't know
1024 by 768 or something and I made it a
whole 500 pixels wide the next plug-in
that I found is called WP security scan
it scans your WordPress installation for
security vulnerabilities and it suggests
corrective actions so on mine you can
see I have a certain version I have the
latest stable version I don't have any I
have a table prefix that is not WP and
at the at the bottom it says that I have
admin an admin user that still exists
I should probably fix that and it gives
me some ideas on how to fix it if I
click the button it says how to change
WordPress admin username so it gives me
ideas on how to fix that okay WordPress
backup that's a really good tool for
pretty much everybody to have it backs
up pretty much your entire database of
your blog and automatically emails it to
whatever email address that you want it
to I decided to make mine email me once
a week with all of my database files in
one zip file it's a great program for
anybody who's worried about losing their
information on their website WP ban is
one of my favorites
I've used it since I first started off
with my blog and it's very very helpful
if you have anybody going to your site
that spans a lot or says anything mean
to you whatever
it bans IP zip bands IP ranges host
names and refer URLs that try to visit
your blog you can even redirect it to go
to other websites so I have one of mine
going to I think it's this I own you
image it works really well so I
definitely want you guys to give it a
try the very last one that I want to
tell you about is called pixel stats
pixel stacks is basically basically a
very minimal Google Analytics for your
website if you're not really into the
whole thing and you know you're
interested on how many views you have
you're interested in a couple of those
things but you don't really care about
all the analytics and keywords that
people actually type into good go to
your blog you can try this pixel stats
just gives you total views unique views
unique visitors just
a couple of things if you're a little
interested but not that much if you guys
have any interesting plugins or even
widgets for your blog's that you want me
to check out definitely hit me up at
feedback at hack five dark and tell me
what you think I think we're going to
end the show now so I'm gonna go grab
the guys alright guys that about wraps
up this episode of hack 5 I think you'd
have a little bit of ubuntu remix
hanging up on dude I'm rockin the new
bun 29.0 formats a huge fan of it as he
is most Knicks distros and BST deal we
got a little bit of information for
these people before we talk about that
all right is it tore it up good all that
stuff Matt I want to let everybody know
that Gamefly is an amazing service they
are the largest online video game rental
service and offer a choice of over 6000
new and classic titles across all
consoles and handhelds with plans
starting at fifteen ninety-five a month
Gamefly members can rent one to four
games at a time and keep them for as
long as they like you can also purchase
a game if you fall in love with it
they'll send you the box and the manual
for nominal fee head on over to
gamefly.com slash hack 5 to get 2 week
free trial membership gamefly.com slash
hack 5 and I have to say it's totally
worth it
yeah we're just finishing her and that's
great because that was that was a rent
you know I know that they got
downloadable content for the Hawks but
it's a short game but take it up feed it
send it back as a short you were playing
that four days an hour you only played
three missions a night for a week it's
not like half-life
oh yeah I have to tell you guys about
degree oh we just watched the newest
episode of dig real last week it was
episode number 67 Andrew talked to you
Mythbusters yeah that's right
Mythbusters video from the the one with
the rock

not really yes I'm checking out Ubuntu
9.04
just came out and this is actually the
netbook remix it's actually made
specifically for these Tonka toys that
you also love Matt and it's Linux oh
it's both of your things you love in one
the interface is kind of interesting
here we can just like drill down here
and it's like all of these little menus
and what's what's kind of funky about it
is when you open these programs it just
kind of chill up here in the top left
and everything's like pretty much full
screen so you know makes it well for
doing one thing at a time but you don't
have a lot of resolution on these little
tiny bastards so you know it looks very
user friendly
it's kind of new not so much for
somebody who runs a ton of different
programs all at the same time like we do
on our dual monitors but yeah I'm
sticking to well I mean for your netbook
that that's what it's for
although it seriously on my acer aspire
one which i just brecht
thanks Acer for that awesome firmware
and your BIOS whatever um yeah I'm just
sticking to backtrack for and because
it's KD or its Debian divine whatever
one of those Debian yeah Debian is good
stuff oh and somebody yeah somebody
asked about if we could talk about
getting a career 19 do you get that
question Matt like how'd you get your
job and you know as a CTO listen fucking
ass off yeah it's a simple no actually
