by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon it's
your weekly dose of Technol us and I'm
very excited to get into another awesome
episode all about drones that's right
we're gonna talk about nothing but
drones for the next awesome is nothing
the entire like just hours two hours of
no we're gonna to I'm not no actually
we're gonna draw it on later you're not
gonna join on today's how's your drone
gotten bigger in fact I'm really hungry
you why don't we talk P o TF DWS to pad
it - are you encrypting things a
one-time pad Oh what's a one-time pad
I'm familiar with those you know why why
cuz that's what I'm doing for my segment
today wunderbar I know what are the
chances of that bars of wonder by the
way this is hack v I'm dari kitchen
that's Shannon Morse we do a show about
hacking and techno west take it very
seriously yes
I'm seriously going to transfer some
packets of awesome encrypted goodness
yes we are I love one-time pads so
apparently I do too
cuz it actually works and it's very very
much encrypted like it's the strongest
encryption you could ever get ever yes
it has some caveats has some pitfalls
but used correctly it is very very
secure I mean it it's caveats are just
different than the caveats that you
would find with something like PGP clean
so so the caveats of this is you have to
use it correctly yes which is the
caveats of most encryption but but more
so in that key distribution is kind of a
pain whereas with things like open PGP
it's not so much yeah you lose things in
terms of authentication and you know so
it's not I wouldn't say a perfect
replacement but I like taking all of
these concepts and kind of marrying them
together exactly so so the program that
we're checking out today is called one
time its encryption for this thing
called one-time pads which has been used
for generations upon generations to
create encryption or a type of I don't
know cipher text between two different
people and back in the day they actually
used pads of paper to create these
one-time pads because it was so easy to
just tear off the pad and then burn it
or throw it away or get rid of it in
some way
of course you know there's great stories
with the KGB and you know there's the
Cold War and stuff like this is very
spike ripped of good stuff the idea here
is that as opposed to public key
encryption which we've talked ad nauseam
about in the past this is actually using
a well essentially a symmetric key so if
you've got the pad and I've got a
duplicate version of the pad then we can
both of us can encrypt on the same pad
and anyone eavesdropping on that that
would otherwise to see that information
would have really no basis to go on as
far as like attacking the you know doing
any crypt analysis on it because you
know it could be anything right yeah
that's true it could be numbers letters
it could be files yes there's actually a
one-time pad on this coin I love so wait
all right so hold on you put a one-time
pad on a coin that's been distributed
among several people and you can't
really change it or anything so not
really one time well it's one time
amongst a group of all of the hackers
that I have run into on the hack across
America course so in that sense also the
the ciphertext is on the same coin as
the pad so it's it's not really okay
fine well whatever a lot of the crypto
challenged and it's cool
right cuz you take all of these random
letters using these numbers into
something awesome using mod 25 which is
a really simple thing we turn zeros into
A's out loud ones and two B's but this
program does it all for us so we don't
think about that
Hey tokens horse emergency so I think
it's Python what I think that's correct
but anyway why don't we get into it so
the program that we're using called one
time it
can be found over at red bean comm / one
time they also give a whole bunch of
handy information on here as well as a
little help intro and how-to on how to
actually execute the commands so the
thing you want to remember about this is
don't share your one-time pad with tons
and tons of people well that means that
that would defeat the whole purpose
right but then it's the symmetric key it
is what will turn the secret text you
know the the cipher text into the
plaintext so how do we exchange this is
the in fact that is the exchanging can't
be exchanging the secret key the shared
key and X and keeping the shared key
secure are the two biggest problems with
this so method you don't want to do it
through some kind of online method
because that could be traced what you
don't want to just like paste it to me
in IRC why I don't know man I mean I
mean I know heavy and like dd3 and
everybody they're pretty cool but but
yeah they don't need it they don't I
don't think they mean my one-time pad so
thank you Tim yeah I don't want to share
it with them I don't want to pass it to
you in Gmail because we all know Gmail
reads your email right right
well okay so I think doing it in person
is really the best way to go when comes
this and I think that as far as securing
it you should use every method available
so you've talked about Inc FS in the in
the past all of those different fuse
systems that allow you to do encrypted
volumes and whatnot so that would be
another great technology to couple with
this so one thing we could do and I did
this I think it was last week we put Lux
encryption on a thumb drive yes you
could always like stick it on your Lux
encrypted thumb drive which has a
password on it and then tell your friend
or whoever the password to thumb drive
and give them the encrypted one-time pad
on that thumb drive physically in person
I love this idea now there is a caveat
with this type of encryption in that the
one-time pad has to be like the message
can't be any longer than the pad so safe
yeah that is a hundred characters well
the most you can ever encrypt is a
hundred characters right I think it
think it's like 140 characters that's on
the coin so you can actually tweet with
it but the other problem with this thing
in addition to the fact that the message
can't be any
anger than the pad is that you can't
reuse that so if you tweet with these
140 characters
well don't tweet again because then
cryptanalysis can figure out all sorts
of folks talk about what those what that
pad may be in fact and so that's the one
time part of it and actually some of the
interesting historic things of one-time
pads being cracked are because of this
because of reuse oh yes man lazy people
that's what happens okay so first off
you want to make a directory for all
this stuff so you just use mkdir make
directory tack P and then one-time dots
or slash dot one-time in your home
directory so now we have a one-time
folder for all of our awesome goodness
where we're gonna actually put our
one-time pad yeah maybe you should just
keep it on a thumb drive somewhere
really secure that's not a that
connected to your computer okay maybe
you do this on a computer than I'm not
connected to the internet with an air
gap we've talked about that before but
still regardless purposes the purposes
of this illustrations we're just gonna
put the file somewhere exactly what is
this file what is my one time tag can't
can I just use mary had a little lamb
oh no well I guess you could you would
probably want to use something random
probably just so we're using slash dev
slash random for our example now I know
that there's a few males yes I know that
there's a few people out there that'll
say like oh that takes a really long
time to copy and yes it does it takes
for freaking ever and you could also use
this is hard if you wanted to you could
use you random but there's a whole bunch
of controversy there about how random
you random actually is it faster but
it's not as random as random exactly so
you and something random random you want
something random random no you couldn't
do it but we could sit here
heads or tails heads we're doing it I
missed it
as Jeff's dasi you can see here doing
this all day long and it makes a cool
clicky sound but it would take a long
time to generate all of the necessary
information to create this especially
this being binary what would it be like
every 7 flips you'd have a bite No
thank you so what can asking so we're
we're creating this the way that we do
it in my terminal is using DD so we use
DD space if equals slash dev slash
random and then you're going to use of
equals tilde for home slash dot one time
slash and then I already created this
but it's called two food pad you can
name this anything that you wanted to if
you just choose to do so
BS is the bite size I believe and then
one thousand and then we put in count
equals ten thousand so what this is
doing is your input file since
everything in Linux is a file is dev
random yes and it is going to get all
sorts of fun random characters from that
the output file or o.f is going to be
where you want that pad to be kept again
highly recommend keeping it on a thumb
drive offline the bite size and then the
count is how many counts of that so it's
ten thousand iterations of a thousand
bytes yeah aka ten megabytes so once
that has completed and you've created it
and I actually changed my new random
just for purposes of this demonstration
so it doesn't take for freaking ever but
you shouldn't do that you should come up
with something random yes exactly
once that is completed you can move on
to the next step so now I'm going to
create some kind of message so I'm going
to Nano we'll call it so I'm gonna call
it mmm
daran dot txt so alright so turn your
head down I have no idea what she's
typing almost done okay I'm done so ctrl
X yes I want to save and great so now if
you can't that file you've got your
plain text but when I turn it into
ciphertext so how do you do that yes so
now we're going to actually use one time
to encrypt this message so one time
attack e for encrypt Tech P for pad and
then whatever your pad is so mine is the
slash dot one time / - food and then you
put in whatever your message is called
so mine is Darren dot txt and then hit
enter and you don't see anything happen
but it creates the actual
the actual encrypted message okay so if
I open it up with cat cat daran and cat
Darren txt dot one time when we see a
bunch of gobbledygook yeah you got
really good so now you can easily send
this over the wire to me no big deal
it's all good all right so I have the
encrypted file I'm just gonna send it to
you over net cat yeah perfect little
tight well then let me set up a listener
and I'm listening on port 1 through 3 7
4 1 337 yep and my IP is 196 196 I knew
that cuz I was hacking you what was this
from the and map segment earlier Oh
watch her watch her uh she's got an
awesome series going on on hack tip
right now that nmap it's awesome okay so
did you get the cottage I just sent it
over to you guys chat okay cool yeah
it's gonna pipe that into a fire lookit
okay just mix that into a file okay
Darren dot txt dot one-time and so now
form a to decrypt this I'm going to need
of course your one-time pad so how are
you going to securely send it to me
probably not the same way you just sent
me the encrypted message overnight go
ahead we could but how do we know that
we're not connected to a pineapple and
also net cats totally somebody would
have my pad and they could use that to
decrypt it if they had one one-time pad
yeah not good so how do we do it I have
an idea
USB I love USB this would be great if
you're going to a convention and you
have some important info to send over to
your buddies here we go so we plug this
narration in I love you SB SB okay so
this is called b61 one okay so what i
can do is i can copy with this with CP
and then it'll be tilde a slash dot one
time / - food that's the name on my pad
and then i'm gonna send this over to
media /b there it is hit enter and it's
copying the little light is blinky
blinky finish copying yeah okay it's
finished thank you there you go so this
should work
alright let me copy that file over so
you're gonna copy my
had over to your computer and once
that's completed you'll be able to
decrypt the file I just sent the netcat
you'll be able to do that with one time
tack D tack P there's spaces in between
those two and then you'll type in the
name of the pad and wherever its
position debt to Fuu dot pad and then
you want to put in the actual message
name so this message was from Darren txt
dot one time great and then hit enter
oh no what
this is absolutely incorrect information
I don't know where you're getting this
information but it is wrong except yes
Darren's cat's name is Kirby Darren's
cat name is Kurt I didn't I don't know
what you talked about I didn't write
that can we get Paul can we get some
photos of Kirby okay now okay we get
some photos of Starbuck all right you be
the judge
feedback live more about fixing yeah see
you see any photos so that is how you
use one time this is brilliant
to send messages okay but we can only
send you Klingon LS tak lah only up to
10 Meg's I think is the size of my file
I know but you can make it as big as you
want if you wanted it to be like 10 gigs
you can make it 10 gigs but that would
take forever to make an actual real of
what I have a 64 gig micro SD card on my
phone dude how many emails could we
exchange with 64 gigs that's plenty
don't feel not often do I see you well
about once a year at hacker conferences
right so now we never seen it work now
the only only a hacker can just ask me -
yeah this is all jewel yeah it's for a
TV magic in fact right with our podcast
budget totally so um you know what
that's is fantastic though because get
this I'm gonna see mu bik's I'm gonna
see it like this and I'm gonna see
you know seven Robin and everybody and
I'm gonna be like you give them all
those pictures of your dog by just
exchanging messages over thumbdrives
there we go that's how you do that in
fact we could take a JPEG and turn that
into a one-time pad it could be any
smile who knows as long as it's random I
like it and I want to hear what
everybody comes up with in fact I can't
find my bookmark to it anymore however I
do remember some recollection of an IRC
protocol that used one-time pads am I
crazy
oh no I know just Warnock ran by this
now I can't find it yet do they know
about the and more SDR phonetic IRC
please let me know because that would be
awesome okay if you could just tune your
SDR into static and then get it to make
random numbers and then entropy that's
true there's lots of reasons why this is
bad I'm tired and I'm hungry let's go to
the next thing how about we take a quick
break but when we get back we are going
to read your emails
killer ideas need to be harnessed and
turned into when the energy which can be
conceived as domain names this is the
case this is totally fact it's how it
works
from your mind into the web domain name
website you're up and running if you
want to be up and running real quick
you've got to use domain.com they've got
a quick domain discovery system and an
easy checkout process so you can have
your website up and running in no time
and I can't begin to tell you how
awesome the folks over at domain.com are
because you know what they're reliable
they're affordable they're easy to use
and they're huge fans of hak5
there are huge fans of social media they
make it a fun place to do business
tweet at domain.com and see what I'm
talking about and the guys over
domain.com wanna hook you up so get this
all you have to do is use the coupon
code hak5 at checkout for an extra 15%
off so when you think domain names think
domain.com we're back and it's now time
for the technology Auto of the week and
this one comes from our very own
archiver he's sent a picture of his
beautiful daughter Alexis and he said
that his daughter Alexis wanted her
laptop to be just like daddy's so he put
a little hak5 sticker on it and it's so
adorable and I love her little shoes
because they're so cute I'm gonna meet
her one day hi Alexis you can send your
photos over to feedback at hak5 org if
you have some awesome pictures to share
and who knows we'll show them in a
future episode look forward to it bye
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of hackpad but before we have
some announcements to make
oh no we have Def Con in July
I mean August and it's from the 7th
through 7th through the 10th of August
and you guys should all go if you're not
planning on going quite yet you should
definitely go to Vegas because it's
super fun and there's amazing slushies
at the Rio that you can get and then you
can sneak them into certain parts of the
convention well I would actually like to
remind you on a more serious note that
if you are a hacker and you like camping
or you like camping you and you'd like
to be around hackers and learn about
hacking things you what you really want
to do is go over to torque camp org
because it is going to be amazing
July 9th through the 13th I can't speak
more warm and fuzzy about it because it
is just one of the fuzzy experience with
hackers and camping he has hippy moments
whenever he goes to tour camp I can't
wait I'll be there and it is going to be
amazing so I think employment about
Washington that's very tippy top left
most corner of the United States for its
past course good for your sparkly
vampires ding forks Darren Bonamassa
priests we're not doing our brunch in
July because we do have all those
conventions to get prepared for so don't
come to the Bay Area but when we come
back when we come back okay so two
things first of all Def Con is gonna be
our nine-year anniversary yeah that's
amazing
and then maybe we'll become more serious
in the tenth year I'm not really sure
and then after that we're gonna have an
awesome Dariya brunch because we were
going see some Nikes and I'm not talking
about shoes no nope he's not talking
about missiles not shoes not sandals
whatever so I got nice cute missile
complex awesome hacker fun time and
whatever's after July August I'm so
excited
the next alright you have an email for
us yes it's actually my favorite email
of the week I'm going to read this here
Bob sent a and Bob see
thank you Bob see he says a funny story
to start your day I have a DSL line
installed the other day we plan to use
it in the office as an isolated Wi-Fi
network for the visitors now the Verizon
tech told me that the username
in the modem is admin and the password
is password one he emphasized the
uppercase P as if it had some sort of
special significance I told him that I
had set a better password on the modem
and his response was quote Verizon
doesn't like you to change the password
on the motor this way all the text can
log into it if necessary so he's all
like you mean every Verizon DSL modem
uses the same crappy login he's like yes
oh I was like on behalf of every hacker
on the planet thank you Oh does he went
and changed it to password - I love
password one I can't tell you how many
times there was a default in every line
of business boring app thing as a system
in very good stuff also my new favorite
SSID is Xfinity Wi-Fi but we can talk
about that on another show that's
hilarious
yes uh we also have them thank you
we also have the hack shop which you
should definitely check out if you're
planning on supporting us which thank
you so so much for supporting us
throughout the years seriously no we
couldn't do this without you guys so
every little bit counts thank you and
that's all our shareholders or with you
are you are just being silly yeah we
should probably we take you guys
seriously we do take that seriously
JK shop.com you would think we had
already started drinking but we have it
she has so with all of that I would like
to invite you all to follow us hack v
dot org slash follow and that's where
you can you know see all the social
media social stuff and until next time
that further adieu send your feedback to
feedback at hak5 org because we love you
and don't forget that as always trust
your Tecna list I'm Shannon this Darren
trust you're talking a lot it's like an
EO f kind of thing
it took a plus plus plus name carrier
gonna return the snubs i'm returning
snubz please send shipping details
immediately he'll fail well their
cameras like right there sanded I can't
resort in front of you what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
