over the papers teenager arrested in
computer crime scandal hacker arrested
after bank tampering damn kids
they're all alike but did you in your
three-piece psychology in 1950s techno
brain ever take a look behind the eyes
of a hacker did you ever wonder what
made him tick what forces shaped him
what may have molded him I am a hacker
enter my world mine is a world that
begins in school I'm smarter than most
of the other kids this crap they teach
us bores me damned underachiever they're
all alike I'm in junior high high school
I've listened to teachers explained for
the 15th time how to reduce a fraction I
understand it no miss Smith I didn't
show my work I did in my head damn kid
probably copied it they're all alike I
made a discovery today I found a
computer wait a second this is cool it
does what I want it to if it makes a
mistake it's because I screwed it up not
because it doesn't like me or feels
threatened by me or thinks I'm a
smartass or doesn't like teaching and
shouldn't be here damn kid all he does
is play games they're all alike and then
it happened a door open to a world
rushing through the phone lines like
heroine through an addicts veins and
electronic pulses sent out a refuge from
the day-to-day incompetency as a sought
aboard is found this is it this is where
I belong I know everyone here even if
I've never met them never talked to them
may never hear from them again I know
you all damn kid tying up the phone line
again they're all alike you bet your ass
we're all alike we've been spoon-fed
baby food at school when we hungered for
steak the bits of meat that you did let
slip through were pre-chewed and
tasteless
we've been dominated by the sadists or
ignored by the apathetic the few that
had something to teach us found us
willing pupils but those few are like
drops of water in the desert
this is our world now the world of the
electron and the switch the beauty of
the BOD we make use of a service already
existing without paying for what could
be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by
profiteering gluttons and you call us
criminals we explore and you call us
criminals we seek after knowledge and
you call us criminals we exist without
skin colour without nationality without
just bias and you call us criminals you
build atomic bombs you wage wars you
murder cheat and lie to us and try to
make us believe it's for our own good
and yet were the criminals yes I am a
criminal my crime is that of curiosity
my crime is that of judging people by
what they say and think not what they
look like my crime is that of
outsmarting you something you'll never
forgive me for I am a hacker and this is
my manifesto you may stop this
individual he can't stop us all after
all we're all alike
yeah me too
that was the conscious of a hacker
otherwise known as the hackers manifesto
and it was written on January 8th 1986
by the mentor aka Lloyd Blankenship it
was published in the easy in frac which
was a hacker publication that's been
running on and off since 1985 the essay
debuted on frac volume 1 issue 7
beginning with a statement the following
was written shortly after my arrest you
see at the time the mentor was a member
of the Legion of Doom which was a hacker
group rivaling with other hacker groups
like the Masters of Deception now
throughout the mid 1980s and into the
early 90s many members would enter the
scene and either leave by retiring or
getting busted by the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act or other such phone fraud
things this was a time before the
internet before the free Kevin movement
or the September that never ended this
was a time of telnet of bulletin board
systems like black ice and well when
blue boxes worked this was in a post-war
Games era where the mainstream portrayal
of a hacker was one who could start
nuclear war with their computers but two
aspiring hackers into phone phreaks
alike at that time the hackers manifesto
may have been gospel I mean in various
forms the text has found its way into
popular culture with excerpts reading
from the 1995 film hackers to the poster
on the wall of Mark Zuckerberg dorm room
in the 2010 movie of the social network
now
well it's dated with its cold war-era
references to dial up the text remains a
staple of hacker culture now a lot has
changed in the last
thirty years but have the feelings of a
pathetic high schoolers or the draw of
two computers by a certain mindset I
mean computers still do what you want
them to and they make mistakes when you
screw up not when they feel threatened
analog drunks may have been replaced
with IP switches bulletin boards with
social networks and apps mainframes with
the Internet of Things and an entire
scene of underground phone phreaks and
hacker groups have pretty much been
supplanted by an entire private sector
of security researchers and penetration
testers so I wonder in a mainstream
hacking era where Python is taught to
middle schoolers where whistleblowers
like Edward Snowden drive an entire
industry to adopt stronger crypto well
the hacker manifesto continued its
distribution from its original text file
form and on to new generation let us
know in the comments until next week
from my inner teenager who was
originally inspired inspired by this
exact text trust your technolo
