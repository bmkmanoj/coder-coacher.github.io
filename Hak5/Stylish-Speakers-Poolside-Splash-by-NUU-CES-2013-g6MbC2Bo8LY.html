go further with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES 2013 and I'm here
with mr. Danny sick with noetic and he
has the brand new splash by noon now
this it looks like a speaker but
apparently it's waterproof yes it's a
suite of waterproof wireless speakers
and actually it's also a speakerphone so
you can use it as a speakerphone while
you're in the shower that's perfect that
sounds great for every time that I
listen to my podcast when I'm in the
shower don't tell anybody that I do that
so can you give me the specs about this
is it really well does the I'm assuming
it has a battery in there yeah it's a 3
watt speakers so it's pretty loud and
then it has a dude in lithium-ion
battery that place up to eight to 10
hours and it's actually
aluminum casing so it's a it comes with
three different colors as well now what
are those colors they're super the one
that I have in my hand and then we have
also black and red oh nice now are you
going to come up with any other colors
that I should know about we are going to
come up with two more colors in Marsh of
oneness blue and oneness our green oh
pretty I might have to get the green one
one of my favorite colors now when did
this one specifically come out those
silver and the white ones out there at
the cs design so we're just launching it
and be two other colors I like I said
it's going to launch it March yeah
that's excellent now how much is it
going to cost me it's going to cost you
ninety nine dollars on amazon that's not
a bad price at all now you said that
this is waterproof does it have any
other kind of proofing in it it has a
rating of ip55 what's that mean I it
means if you use this really strong Jets
on to it that it's going to be it's
going to be fine even if you drop it
into water if you take it out as soon as
it drops in so you'll be fine as well
very cool I kind of did that to my phone
once and it kind of died on me pretty
quick now other than having the
waterproof does can it protect me like
if I'm going to the desert and I want to
listen to this I live in California so
yeah actually it's at best proof as well
so ip55 meeting it's a dust proof with
to the IP level 5 which it's pretty good
for normal usage dust in waterproof I'm
kind of liking this now how long does it
take to charge up this battery
about around two hours to charge it then
you can play for eight hours that's not
bad at all and you also said that this
has some kind of call specific
specifications in it speaker phone
speaker phone yeah it has as it has some
Mike here and actually we have a
gore-tex layer underneath it so it's
capable it's still waterproof so you can
use it anywhere you want that's perfect
now I don't have to have bluetooth to
use it with us actually it comes up it
has also a audio in and on the back so
but then once you open it it's not
waterproof but you can still use it with
any phone that or any device that has no
wireless connectivity cool so don't
unplug this little rubber casing if I
want to put it out in the rain all right
I got it now you also have a larger
version over here if can i grab this one
this looks a little bit heavier it looks
a little sturdier yeah oh yeah that's
like a that's a weight that's a wait
right here it's kind of cool free
conversion and we have a lot more
protections around it this time so
actually the braiding is ip57 so it's
actually submersible not that you want
to listen music and the water but it's
going to well maybe when I go out into
the ocean I can let little sharks listen
to my music with me yes and it also
comes in three colors one is the one
here is green and then we also have a
black one and a red one that's what and
when is this one available how much is
the pricing to pricing that's 149 and it
will be out in March excellent and where
can I find all of these because these
are very cool you can find these on
amazon right now amazon com and will
retailers and we'll post it up on that
website awesome i'm looking forward to
thank you so much Danny it was excellent

CES you can find us over at revision
3.com sync is about helping keep you
connected while on the go one of the
most useful features of sync is its
ability to control what you listen to
and sync applink gives you the power to
control apps like pandora and slacker
radio with your voice sometimes then
I'll listen to your own tunes well sink
makes it so easy it gives you hands-free
control of your music files for your
digital music player USB Drive or other
compatible devices and even better if
you ask it to play similar music sync
even uses your own tunes to make a
playlist thanks again to Ford for
powering this hack five CES special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
