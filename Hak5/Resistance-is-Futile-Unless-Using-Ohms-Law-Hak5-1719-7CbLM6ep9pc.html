by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is jarrion kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse ditch a weekly dose of techno lust
Merry Christmas that's right today is
Christmas isn't it webzine Christmas Eve
yeah it is if you're watching this on
the 24th in which case merry Christmas
to you if that's what you celebrate
otherwise um switch case or break or
continue depends on your choice uh-huh
otherwise if you're watching this in the
future good for you how's the future
doing hey cheers to you on an awesome
and crazy entire 2014 it has been a wild
ride and I'm very excited about lots of
new projects that we have an teared up
for 2015 i don'ti very OHS I didn't know
about the the oh you're gonna love my
robot platform oh yeah there's it
there's the thing on this way and um did
you notice the giant box over there what
now the huge 3d printer over there oh
yes deeper 3d printer David nothing I've
been conspiring and I feel like so
started will come of this oh my gosh yes
fine because currently you are in the
midst of a microcontroller series uh
should I did there so resistance is
futile unless you purchase the correct
resistor yeah actually uh Aaron pen as
well as many others on YouTube pointed
out I think you should use series of
resistors on that led that was from your
segment from two weeks ago ah but
actually I was following a tutorial
written by massimo banzi himself the one
of the creators of arduino and he did
not use a resistor in his tutorial the
thing is like the LED is rated at
between what was it like three point six
five volts I'm like ads well within the
limits that's why those limits are there
but you know I don't wanna that this is
what you're doing that not make is it
I'll just really do that you're using
because LEDs are at different voltages
depending on which ones you buy I have
popped a fair share of LEDs in my day I
love it when they just think it this
like really bright for just a moment and
then the magic smoke is gone well the
one I was using was the correct
voltage Oh cats good well we have a very
exciting show for you guys I have been
fighting with the server behind me right
now so I'm actually looking forward to
recommendations on new servers because
it's time to build did you realize this
is an i5 oh really yeah wee bit old yeah
and I'm thinking so is my home computer
I i think i should do a build on the
show of my new gaming rig would like to
see a gaming rig build i would also like
to do a new virtualization server build
because this is just going to be one
node of many in the cluster of hopefully
many clusters in the data center and
we're going to get into those different
resource pools and things of that nature
here soon because i have been geeking
out with overt while at the same time
fighting with centos and this piece of
hardware here so this bare metal
notwithstanding stay tuned for good
stuff on that front in a bit and with
that we should probably get right into
let's not resist jumping into this
segment and with that I'm next doryx oh
oh I'll be back I'll see you in a bit
alright cool bath so this week I am
checking out Ohm's law and calculating
resistors and trying to figure out what
the best resistor is for my breadboard
and for all the different circuitry that
I decide to create so first off I should
probably explain this thing called Ohm's
law home it comes from George ohm who is
a scientist who defined resistance by
calculating voltage and amps so this is
calculated this is the fun math part v
equals I times R where V is the voltage
in volts of course I would be the
current in amps and r is the resistance
so r is where the little resistors come
in in ohms so first if one vault was
calculated then that would be one amp x
1 ohm so there's a lot of different kind
of imagery for Ohm's law for example a
lot of people use the water tank imagery
but this is basically how I understand
it and hopefully I explain it in a
pretty good way so the voltage is the
amount of electric current that's being
held inside of a circuit no matter what
that thing is that
that piece of circuitry ohm is the
resistance which is the narrowness of a
channel where the electricity is going
to be flowing through so for example it
could be like a bunch of traffic cones
that are cutting off a lane of traffic
it's going to create some traffic backup
behind it because it's it's narrowing
that area where the traffic can go
through so the electricity can actually
go through the flow or the speed or the
current or however you want to say that
of the electricity ends up being the amp
so if the resistance goes up in size as
in more lanes end up being cut off then
the amp speed goes down because it
becomes slower it's just like traffic so
now we can use this math to create
future currents so for example if you
have a 12 volt battery like just a
random little battery that you buy at
target or something and then you have an
LED with like a 22 milliamp current then
you would do this math you would divide
12 volts divided by zero point zero 22
amps so that would be 22 milliamp 0.022
equals how many ohms well that would end
up being and I could just calculate it
out on my little calculator right here
so let's say 12 / 0.02 two amps so it'd
be 545 ohms so at that point I would
know that I would need to have a
resistor with 545 ohms or higher of
resistance now 545 is not necessarily a
usual amount that you would find in a
resistor so I would probably have to go
up a little bit higher than that like to
the 560 or whatever that next ohm size
would be now you can find a whole bunch
of different packs of resistors I was
shopping on Amazon and I'll show you
what I found I just looked forward
resistors and I found tons and tons of
packs and these come with like hundreds
this spark 11 is a good example if I
click on this so it's only 12 bucks on
Prime if I scroll down a little bit it
shows you all the different common ones
that it comes with so these huge packs
are super super cheap they usually have
several different values in a pack
common ones that you can usually find
you might find one that's zero ohms 1.5
4.7 1022 owns all the way up to 100 334
7680 so 680 would probably be the one
that I would need for that calculation
but that's kind of high so I could also
just add up two of them one kilo ohm you
can also get like 47 kilo ohms 100 kilo
ohms 220 330 470 and one mega ohm
because there are things called mega
ohms now if you need a specific
resistance you can either just buy one
that is available to you but if it's not
available you can also stack them up
together in a series so say I needed one
that was 220 ohms and then another one
that was only 10 so it would add up to
be 230 owns all together in that series
pretty cool right I know yay some math
because who would have thought I'd be
doing math after college now resistance
is measured in ohms this is a unit from
the International System of Units homes
are usually spelled out in thousands
such as 1000 ohms that would be one kill
ohm or three million ohms that would be
three mega ohms so that's how you can
kind of remember it now resistors have
an ever-changing electrical resistance
so if you buy one that's one kilo ohm
it's always going to be Killa home one
kilo ohm the resistors resistance limits
the flow of electrons through a current
they're only going to consume power they
can't actually create it so they're
called passive components for any kind
of circuitry that you build resistors
are usually added to any kind of circuit
where they're going to end up
complementing active components and
these could be like microcontrollers or
ICS or op amps or whatever you might
have and commonly used resistors are
going to be used to limit the current
they can divide voltages and they can
also pull up I of lines and more on that
later once we get into those kind of
things resistors are also shown as
little squigglies or little rectangles
whenever you see them on a schematic I'm
sure you've probably ran across some
schematics I just googled it real quick
to show you some examples of what it
looks like and we have tons and tons of
examples on here so a resistor is going
to show up like a little squiggly up and
down like this or you might see it like
a little rectangle like this with a
couple of two
little lines coming out of it so that's
pretty easy to understand yay and
they'll usually be called something like
our and then a number next to it and
that's going to be the name of it and
then under that you'll see the value in
ohms like one kilo ohm for example now
choosing a resistor is so so important
there are several several different
types the varying value they vary in
size and look the first ones that we
have our through-hole resistors now
these are the like the ones that I have
which look like this they're little long
pieces of cord or blong pieces of wire
with a little strange little bullet
thing in the middle of it it's kind of
weird-looking but that's basically what
it looks like they have very very long
leads that you could cut shorter if you
need to you can solder them to four
different places or you can just stick
them in a breadboard and you can bend
them around two so I could just bend
these if I wanted to and they create a
nice little angle if I need it to look
like that for whatever i'm creating the
axial package that's this little plastic
piece on the middle that's the plastic
part the bigger ones like this are going
to be one half of a watt and then
smaller ones you'll find some that are a
little bit smaller than those two there
one fourth of a watch now that wattage
is called a power rating and a power
rating tells you what rate the electric
current is actually turned into
something else so a really good example
of this is a light bulb say it's like a
75 watt light bulb so it's turning
electricity into light at 75 watts with
resistors the electricity is turned into
heat so if you have too much heat going
to a component you end up getting fire
and that's not good so we don't want
fire we want to make sure that we're
resisting the calculated perfect amount
that we need for whatever we're building
so you need to calculate the power
rating it's not necessarily obvious from
the size all the time but if you can't
find it listed or if you can't figure it
out from the actual size you can take P
which is the power equals I which is the
amps or the current times the resistance
and you already know the resistance
because if you buy these they're going
to be labeled at least I sure hope
they're going to be labeled now there is
another kite
kind of resistor as well this one's
called surface mount that's the other
kind they're just basically little tiny
black rectangles that have a little bit
of silver soldered points at their edges
they're more commonly used in mass
production where Robarts going to do all
the work because they're so tiny I don't
think necessarily we would have want to
do all that work because they're 8080
itty bitty now resistors are also made
up of carbon metal or metal oxide film
if we stripped off the outside of a
resistor you would see that the carbon
film is wrapped around an insulator so
it's wrapped around again and again and
again all through the inside of this
little teeny tiny piece of circuitry the
more wraps that you get the more
resistance it has huh so very easy way
to see how much resistance is going on
in there now color coding this is the
last thing I wanted to talk about this
is a color coding graph if I hold it the
right way it's very hard to see on the
camera I know but I'll take a picture of
it so you can see everything that's
going on on here but this basically
matches the resistance and the tolerance
of the resistor if you put one of these
next to one of your resistors like my
big pack of resistors here you'll notice
that there's little lines little
markings on the resistor a good resistor
pack is going to come with some kind of
color code graph for all those different
bands of colors that you see on your
resistor like mine has up to five bands
on a blue resistor and then it also came
with some of these little yellow ones as
well and those come with I believe four
bands yeah four bands on them so I had
to separate kinds that came in the pack
that I purchased on amazon com now the
first three in mine are going to be the
first three value so if it's a 330 ohm
resistor than the first three value
should mats up match up to the correct
color codes for these so it would be
orange for three orange for three and
then black 40 yeah 330 orange orange
zero so those would be my first three
bands and then the fourth would be the
multiplier and lastly would be the
tolerance so tolerance is either plus or
minus a percentage and it's usually like
1% 2% five ten percent something like
that because no resistor is going to be
made
absolutely perfectly they might be off
by a little bit of a gnome so keep that
in mind whenever you're building your
different parts so after the tolerance
you then want to multiply them by your
multiplier so this is the fourth band
that we discussed so you want to match
the first three bands and then multiply
by whatever the multiplier ends up being
depending on the color of that fourth
band so for example if I had one that
was brown according to my graph Brown
would be a power of two so it would have
two extra zeros so as a reminder if you
have ten to a power of 2 that means you
add two zeros so it would be 330 extra
zero extra zero and if you have
something like 10 to the power of seven
on your graph then that would mean you
add seven zeros tdn so a nice easy way
to memorize that little bit of math yay
powers now surface mount resistors they
use a different kind of code so there's
tons of information about that online
but since we're not going to be using a
lot of surface mount resistors I decided
not to go into that and we'll also
discuss a lot about parallel resistors
and resistor networks later on as we
build more complicated like robots and
things like that as well so I hope that
this explanation helps you understand
resistors it definitely taught me a ton
about these I also got a couple of
questions from people about which kits I
decided to buy when I started building
all my different things so I'll show you
what those look like I got two they're
not from Arduino but they're made by
this company called Sun founder there's
a smaller one and a larger one I got
both of these on Amazon I'll point them
out to you they were only about like 30
and 50 bucks or something like that but
they come with all the different
components that you would need to start
building your own little kits it also
came with a nice little project book so
it's very easy to understand what is
going on with each thing so the bottom
one the smaller one was this one that
came with a bunch of LEDs and teeny tiny
breadboard us i got this large one this
bigger kids and that one came up with a
very big breadboard extra USB cord a
nice little LCD monitor yeah i'm super
excited to use that even a fan
I don't know maybe I guess I'll build a
fan but you can find a ton of other
Arduino kits as well in amazon i'll link
to those in the show notes as well with
my little amazon associates code thank
you for the support and hopefully you
can find a kit that will help you with
all the different things that we're
going to be building on the show so
email me feedback at hak5 org again let
me know what you want to see me build on
the show as I'm learning more about all
the different components that go into
building prototypes because this is
really really fun and I can't wait to
share it all with you coming up we'll
have more fun times with Darren but
first let's take a quick break doesn't
matter whether you're into huh or uh you
got that killer idea you need to grab
yourself some domain name hosting
website stuff fast you can do that over

last week's trivia question was what
widely used an influential programming
language was developed by dennis ritchie
in ken thompson at eighteen t bell labs
in early 70s and the answer is C that's
it just the letter C this week's trivia
question is what multi-purpose compiled
language designed in 1983 was super
super popular in the 90s and has
influenced several other languages you
can answer that over at hak5 org slash
trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack five kids good luck that
just about wraps up this week's episode
of hak5 but before we get going we've
got some special announcements in fact
if you are in the San Francisco Bay Area
and like getting your land party gaming
on we're having a very special laying
party here at the warehouse and you guys
are invited to bring in 2015 with a bang
bang from Redeemers and flat cannons
it's gonna be great because the theme
this land party is that well nothing
before 2005 uh they're all gonna be like
10 year old plus game just gonna be
exciting so break out your counter
strike source and get your unreal
tournament on and maybe a little quake 3
action yeah Serious Sam that's on the
list little starcraft it's gonna be
awesome it's like I'm an inanimate
person yeah I was really really good
with the crossbow crossbow yeah there's
a crossbow in ut yes well in deathmatch
a new teen 99 aina oh maybe not 2004 I
think it is I see I never played ut2004
I think I preferred UT 2003 but that's
only because i love the maps and i used
to run them and I would know like
exactly what the hell 3 yeah there was
two of them it was because of a
licensing dispute that they ended up
being like one right after another in
the years hey did you know that um that
that that game is made by epic you know
what else epic yes it was 2004 that's
time sweeney actually the other way
around tim sweeney made epic and not the
other way around other one could argue
anyway check out ZZT i'll leave it is
more with that later yep so we're gonna
play some awesome super fun times at the
land party
a card / LAN party to reserve yourself a
seat if they are all taken my apologies
sign up sooner next time hey chur movie
too ok we need to one by a bigger switch
to get more tables chairs yeah that's uh
well let's see how this first one goes
email us feedback at hak5 org with your
thoughts your comments and what you want
to see this next year yes as well as if
you have certain recommendations I am
looking for doing this on the cheap AKA
bringing back the ultimate
thousand-dollar virtualization note of
doom cool yes should be good and support
us on hack shop that's where you can
make this happen directly thank you to
everybody who decided to purchase from
us through the holidays is busy and we
were really yes yeah it was awesome
awesome deals I'd really appreciate it
yeah I know in fact I just got off the
phone with Lin talking about her son
John and her son was so excited she get
it's Christmas Eve oh you're right John
I'm sorry I guess you know what's under
the tree now past that one up oh really
did I really did L gave there's anyway
whatever so um we should end this out
wearily she ended the year nobody
watches show anyway they can to pick you
for watching in December with all of
that hot kitchen I'm Shea Moisture esta
técnica lost my rear Christmas sorry
Charlie ha
that just about wrapped up thick so you
can throw a pop-up book yes all the
resistors all the voltages all the watts
well well there you go I haven't been
able to speak today so I'm just gonna do
it in simlish look I'm real like sorry
kid by the way Santa Claus Shalu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
