stolen apple watches pair with any
iPhone Google's blocking third-party
Chrome extensions NM spy gets owned all
that more right now on threat wire I'm
Darren kitchen and this is threat wire
from a 15 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom and it is so great to
be doing threat wire again on act 5 so a
huge thanks to everyone that is
supported to relaunch on our patreon and
with that let's get started because oh
yes venom you see virtual machines are
awesome there's a just something really
beautiful about running computers and
software where they can be you know you
can have like a machine set up with tons
of little servers similar to have you
have like an iPhone with tons of little
apps on them and so gone are the days of
having a different physical box in the
rack for every task from serving up web
pages to managing email it's great
they're cheap they're simple and
ultimately it's better for the
environment because you don't have a
bunch of machines hogging up power and
running idle all day and they're pretty
secure given that a virtual computer is
in a little jail cell where it can't
talk to the physical machine that's
running on that is until now the
vulnerability is going by the name of
venom which stands for a virtualized
environment neglected operations
manipulation ok that's a backronym but
anyway what venom does is it takes
advantage of a floppy disk controller
yes I said a floppy disk that if
exploited would let an attacker crash
the entire hypervisor or the virtual
machine running all of the machines and
even access other virtual machines
hosted by the same hypervisor basically
it's like a virtual machine jailbreak
and it's kind of a big deal because much
of the web and corporate infrastructure
today are running on virtualization the
bug dates back to code in qemu from 2004
and impacts a lot of virtualization
platforms like zen kvm and virtualbox
all of which by the way are my personal
favorites because they're open source
you see the proprietary VMware and say
Microsoft hyper-v platforms those aren't
affected patches have been issued
advisories are out there and so
everybody is urged
to update got yourself an Apple watch
well keep it on your wrist because I
download blog is reporting on a security
concern for the new nerd bling okay
let's take a moment to talk about
activation lock it's a feature that
debuted in iOS 7 which prevents iOS
devices from being activated after being
factory reset without first disabling
the Find My iPhone feature this came at
the time when I phones were getting
stolen a lot and it's really great
because it makes a stolen iPhone
basically a really expensive brick
unfortunately the feature is sorely
lacking and watch 0 s 1 point 0 and
there's no equivalent to find my iphone
for the Apple watch so if yours gets
stolen then it can easily be reset and
paired with another iphone the good news
however is that the data on the device
is secure if you have in fact it enabled
a passcode lock which you should do
similar to third-party apps on Android
chrome has the ability to install
third-party extensions not found in
their official Chrome Web Store and that
said there has been a lot of difficulty
getting them installed you see last year
Google disabled the feature in the
stable branch of Chrome for Windows and
unfortunately people have still been
getting tricked into installing
malicious extensions by being forced to
download a developer version of Chrome
that's right now a year later Google is
disabling the feature in all versions of
Chrome or Windows and Mac so you can
still install third-party extensions
it's just not as convenient you got to
click tools extensions check developer
mode and import a CRX file seriously
this is kind of crazy because it used to
be that to do a driveby attack you just
required somebody to click yes to an
activex plugin who are these people that
are going as far as to download a
developer version of Chrome just so that
they could load a malicious extension
and get owned it truly boggles the mind
mspy is a software as a service that
lets users track iPhones and Apple
devices and Windows and Mac computers
don't think find my iphone if it gets
stolen think more like I'm concerned
that my spouse is cheating or I'm an
overprotective parent who doesn't trust
my teenager well the software not only
does it do gps tracking but it will
intercept messages from snapchat skype
whatsapp SMS and all around keylogging
it's it's spyware and it boasts over a
million customers world
wyd well now it can also boast a million
owned customers that's right a dump of
the mSpy database has found its way onto
a tour site containing info on more than
400,000 users including their Apple IDs
passwords tracking data payment details
photos emails you know all this stuff
you don't want leaked all over the web
it's kind of ironic that the software
used by overprotective parents is the
same undoing of their kids who have now
been all but Doc's tits there's a great
write-up go check it out on Krebs on
security will have links in the
description our featured comment comes
from zacks who pointed out that among
the NSA bashing last week we were
ignoring the fact that the googles and
Microsoft's of the world have way more
information on us than mere metadata and
that we're supposed to just take their
word for that their net using for any
ill intent and this is the sort of
intelligent conversation that I love
about our YouTube comments that's right
I said intelligent and youtube comments
this anomaly I love this and yes I think
there's a really interesting parallel
between the concept of say government
and their citizens bound by their laws
versus a corporation and their end-users
bound by their end user license
agreement and I guess the hope is that
between the two they balance each other
out but ultimately I feel like it's only
up to ourselves to protect us from both
parties really well anyway thank you so
much for the comment zacks do you guys
have any thoughts on the stories today
go ahead and leave them below and before
i go i do want to give a huge thanks to

from this show you want to give some
value back it is just epic to see that
and it allows us to even feature
potentially your furbaby like these cute
guys so cute keep sending in those fur
babies we are hoping to reach our three
times a week milestone goal with a
rotation of Patrick Norton and Shannon
Morse myself and so throughout the month
of May we're giving you a taste of just
that so I hope you will continue to
contribute and help us keep this coming
completely independent and AB free and
if you can't that's totally cool you
know even just to share a like up

too so you can find all of the other
episodes
links to our social networks and all the
other ways to contribute over at threat
wire net and with that i'm darren
kitchen i'll see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
