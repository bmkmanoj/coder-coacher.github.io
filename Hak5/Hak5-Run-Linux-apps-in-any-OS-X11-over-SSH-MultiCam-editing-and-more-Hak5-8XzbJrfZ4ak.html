this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain.com GoToMeeting and
netflix go to WWF flexkom slash hack 5
for your free trial membership hello
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen this is your weekly dose of
Technol us and we've got a great show
for you guys this week how was your week
I mean months been going pretty good I
guess I mean I had a nice weekend Lilly
do anything cool I mean I just figured
we don't really chitchat that much and
well I don't know you could email me
recall you never call anymore anyway
back to the show what they're talking
about again we've got a great show for
you guys this week Shannon's gonna be
joining us a little later on a little
roundtable we're talking about some fun
inside hack 5 stuff we're talking about
some editing we're talking about a tip
that might save you on your next awkward
situation wouldn't know anything about
those cuz shooting a blocks by myself is
totally not awkward right so uh why
don't we go ahead and get right into it
I've got a great segment in the works
and unfortunately though it was slated
for 8:07 has got to push back to next
week but doing a lot of fun stuff with
DNS so stay tuned next week for that may
be a little brute-forcing action but in
the meantime I figured since I recently
made the plunge and switch to Linux on
the desktop we talked about some fun
things that we can do with SSH and as
you guys know we've talked about SSH in
the past there's plenty of awesome
servers on Windows on on Linux whatever
have you of course my favorite being
open SSH and we've also talked about how
we can use it to do secure tunneling of
your web traffic whether that be like a
socks5 proxy or even setting up like key
encryption for an alternative
authentication but today I've figured
why don't we paint a picture where
whether it be me at I don't know
revision3 working on a Mac or my editing
PC on Windows or whatever have you and
there's an application that I want to
use in Linux
well sure SSH is perfect for that use
all the time to go ahead and
into a machine and get an interactive
prompt on there so I can use whatever
this tools be with whether it be you
know an map or whatever right but
sometimes there's graphical applications
that I want to use and doing something
like a full VNC session or an RDP
session or whatever have you for your
favorite method of remote access is a
bit overkill for just the entire desktop
not to mention if you already have SSH
set up it's a great way to go ahead and
run those applications that you want
securely because SSH is inherently
secure VNC however not so much so since
we've got a wall mounted VM server
they're running all our good stuff that
we're SSH
over the Internet to get to anyway might
as well go ahead and run those
applications using x11 forwarding over
SSH so I figured why don't we go ahead
now talk about how to set this up in
Linux and then a little bit later we're
gonna do the same thing in Windows oh
yes that means we're gonna be variable
to run on Linux programs in Windows and
they'll actually be using the CPU cycles
on another machine and yes
anyway fun happy good stuff but let's go
ahead and get it set up now I'm gonna
use one of our testing boom 2 machines
it's running on the VM server back here
as our server and then our client is
going to be well in this case another
Linux machine so I've already got those
pulled up here and let's see login to
our test machine and I just need to pull
up a shell and if you don't already have
an SSH server running I just like to go
ahead and setup OpenSSH it's real simple
on debian sudo apt-get install open is H
- server now I'm not going to get into
the nitty-gritty of the configuration
since we've already done that in
previous episodes but reference those of
you are interested for the meantime
let's just go ahead and make sure that
the service is running by eschewing ssh
localhost and we'll say yes because we
know that's our key and there we go we
can actually go ahead and login now
doesn't make a lot of sense to us as
aged back into ourselves so what we want
to do now
is start an application using SSH over
from another machine so this being a
remote desktop application here right
that's another machine so back to our
host here I already have a a terminal
going like an SSH - what's the IP over
here to 10:00 10:30 10:13 37 123 so test
is the user at 10.13 dot 37 123 and
that's the key so we're gonna go ahead
and add that and login is in and there
we go right we're on this and and boom
if I wanted to I see I don't know I've
got a well I know I've got a bash RC
file so cat bash RC right so I can cat
that or if I wanted to I could use bi or
vim vim bash RC right so I can edit this
right there whoops I don't have them
let's see VY dot bash RC okay there we
go so now I'm in VY and I can make my
edits just like I would but what if I
wanted to use a graphical editor to do
this so let me quit out of this and say
G edit dot bash RC well that's not going
to work it's actually going to throw an
error that says cannot open display now
the display all of this whether it's
gnome which is actually using right here
in Ubuntu or KDE or fluxbox or whatever
have you it's using x11 as the interface
there to do all of that fun windowing
goodness and we can use that to actually
pass the application over to our client
machine now since our client machine is
Linux it already has an X 11 server
built in so there's really not a whole
lot configuration here as long as we
already have an ssh connection between
these two machines it's really just a
matter of passing a variable or a I'm
sorry a parameter when we connect
that'll allow us to do local x11
forwarding so let me show you here we're
gonna have to actually quit out of the
session
so I'm going to exit and here forgot
about this I should have probably done
this in the past zoom in there I hope
that guys helps you guys see a little
bit better so close that connection and
now what I want to do is actually do SSH
and I'm gonna do tack the fur verbose
tack capital X 4x 1114 and again we're
gonna log in to test at 10 1337 123
we're going to give it a password and
there we are and just as before we're
already in there we can buy our dot bash
RC just as before but now if I wanted to
open up a graphical interface I can type
in let's say G edit dot bash RC
ampersand the zoom out here boom now
this G edit here isn't the G edit that's
running locally on my machine it's it's
the one running over there but I get a
nice GUI now so let's run something more
complex come back over here and I don't
know if I have it installed maybe I'll
just grab it real quick right so there
we go we have Wireshark installed on our
test server over here and if I were to
issue GK pseudo Wireshark there we go
Wireshark starts up and I could use it
just like I could on my on my machine
here but it's not running on my machine
here it's running over there which is
the really nifty part about it so for
example if I wanted to do some network
sniffing on the network here while I was
outside the network I could totally do
that with this and I hope that this oh I
hope it all makes sense send an email to
feedback at hak5 org if you want further
explanation or I want to see some other
demos with this and and but that I
should probably mention that this isn't
a replacement for like a VNC
or RDP while it is secure it's not a
fully interactive desktop and while you
could do that it's really easy to just
go ahead and start up the applications
that you need and not have to mess with
the whole interface that is like this
already P session over here where it's
like alright great I don't really need
all this all I want is Firefox so rather
than popping this open to we're in
Firefox I just come down here and run
Firefox and boom you know makes it
simple I like it so in just a bit we're
gonna learn how to do the same thing in
Windows taking limits delete level and I
figured right now let's just go ahead
and secondly Shannon find out about last
weekend this week's trivia last week's
trivia question was what software is
used to hack into incomes computer
system and the answer what CLU or clue
if you want to win some hack buy swag
this week go over to hack $5 word slash
trivia and answer this question
gatekeeper is the computer security
software and what kind of cliche hacker
machine we'll be right back after it
after after if you've got a creative
idea or want to start a new business I
recommend getting a domain name and web
hosting from domain.com
domain.com has the domain you want fast
easy and inexpensive with free domain
tools including URL and email forwarding
DNS management and transfer log there
Linux powered hosting plans are
dependable flexible and affordable -
with free setup and no commitment
required the deluxe hosting offers
unlimited bandwidth and site builder
pages at a mere 875 a month they even
make it dead simple to get started with
plenty of free software like wordpress
joomla drupal and more all installed in
just a few clicks and as a hak5 viewer
you get an extra 15% off your order when
you check out with coupon code hak5 got
a great idea it all starts with a great
domain
domain.com alright so at the top of the
show we talked about how to use x11
forwarding over SSH from one Linux
machine to another but what if you've
got an awesome Linux machine at home and
you're stuck on Windows at work or
whatever have you and you want to use
those interactive GUI based Linux
applications in Windows without having
to fire up RDP
or or VNC to do a fully you know remote
desktop interactive environment you just
want that application on your one at
secure if you've already got SSH set up
and running let's go ahead and learn how
we can do this in Linux now sorry did I
say Linux I meant Windows see it's
already like sinking into my add in fact
I even have to pull up a Windows virtual
machine because I don't have windows on
my laptop anymore
sweet huh all right so I got my Linux uh
doing it again I've got my Windows VM
popped up here and yeah I know I'm just
rockin XP but whatever and what I wanted
to point out here is xming it's an ex
server for Windows so X the server that
runs all of our happy gooey stuff
whether it be fluxbox or gnome KDE
what-have-you
we can actually install that since it's
open-source there's a port for Windows
one of the best ones is X Ming and if we
run that on our Windows server then when
we SSH over to our Linux machine and try
to run a graphical application it's
going to go ahead and come across and
run on our local X server so let's go
ahead and show you how to set it up I've
already downloaded it here and pretty
simple next next finish if you've done
one install on Windows you've done them
all and it's gonna lot launch X Ming and
we can actually see it down here we can
view the log I'll leave that open and
let's go ahead I fire up putty
now blink is another great SSH client
for Windows same place you can get it as
putty in fact X being even comes with a
portable version of plank that doesn't
save any of the configuration into the
Windows registry so if you're looking
for a portable solution that might be
the answer for you as well but right now
just with in putty let's learn how to go
ahead and enable that SSA error that x11
so that we can run those interactive
applications so from within here I'm
gonna go ahead and give my host just
like normal 1337 123 here we go zoom in
there alright and what we want to do is
come down under connections and SSH and
go to x11 when we want to check that x11
forwarding is enabled and we want to say
localhost
: zero alright so with that set up I'm
gonna go ahead and say open and we're
gonna save that and we're gonna log in
as test and there we go so just like
before I can bind my bash RC or if I
want to I can open up G yet it whips
alright fix that later and G edit dot
bash RC and in just a moment here there
we go check that out right I'm in
Windows but I've got a Linux app running
and it's super freaking sweet because
it's running over the network
so I okay I guess I should mention that
a network throughput might be a
limitation they're running like a
gigantic honking application over like a
DSL or something but but yeah this is
freaking sweet
so I go ahead and quit that and and
there you go that's really all there is
to if you're using putty it's just a
simple checkbox if you're using plink
just like before in in Linux its tack
capital X 4 X 11 forwarding hope that
guys that helps you guys for those of
you that are stuck on a Windows box that
want to run some nifty gooey stuff of
course if you have any feedback to this
or some questions hit up the show notes
at hack 5 org or email us feedback at
hack 5 org would love to hear what you
guys think
of course next week we're gonna be doing
some fun DNS stuff and in just a bit
Shannon's gonna joining us for well tip
that's gonna save you from an awkward
situation

computer internet and goto meeting I'm
joined by my fabulous co-host my
favorite snubs shannon moore hey how's
it going man doing well I have a special
guest today uh-oh who's joining you deep
do you recognize this little one oh I
miss kirby so much when can I see her
again um probably February or March or
March now come on February February
sounds good okay depending off if
there's ice on the road
well I'm so stoked that that you're
coming out here that's gonna be great
but still rockin Missouri so we've got
this wonderful thing where we can
collaborate and I figured why don't just
do a little show-and-tell and see like
what we phat what's been tickling our
techno list if you will this week okay
so what do you have for me all right so
you know how we've been doing multicam
shoots on hak5 since day one like even
back to the first season we used to
record on each camera individually on
these like micro DV tapes and then we
would have digitize them and there'd be
like a stack of them it would take hours
and hours to digitize all these and and
then we yeah then we had this period
where we switched over to back at the
hack house Paul ran this awesome sweet
sweet board that that took all of our
cameras in over HDMI he did the
real-time switching and it was great
because we were able to shoot live to
tape which meant we were able to produce
a lot faster in studio and all that
stuff I can't wait to get back yeah I
can't wait to get back to that and here
in season 8 is is kind of transitional
with like you and and Jason and mu
because everybody flying out here and us
doing a little bit of multicam shooting
again they're using a new technique that
I it's an adapted technique of something
I've done before and this really doesn't
have any practical application for most
of our audience except like the ten
people that are video editors or
whatever but that's true but people ask
all the time how we do this and I
thought I'd share because I think it's
really interesting especially this new
stuff in the premiere so I've got it
pulled up with screen sharing and I
figured I'd show you here this is
actually a sheep from from last week and
we were talking about Hana and you see
here in the timeline I've got these
these three clips here and it's actually
I've named them the wide camera the
snubs cam in the darren cam and it can
mute these panels here and you see
there's both of us
and then there's one of just you and
there's one of just me and it's making
this amazing face but you see what about
here on the left side when like I choose
this clip here is that I come back and
forth and and if you've seen outtakes
you notice that we're all the time
clapping and typically this is done with
like a professional like clap board and
you know these expensive whatever you
don't need this expensive clap the
Hollywood clap board thing just clap you
know and all I do is is I sink up when
my hands meet or when the sound when I
hear the the clap on all of the audio
tracks and it's like zoom in here I can
actually see that right there it's like
really apparent yeah and what I used to
do is I had come in here and they're
like okay I want I want Darrin on that
clip so I'd do a slice and then I want
Shannon there and I'd do another slice
and then see how these are stacked so
it's Darrin snubs one well I would leave
Darrin there and then if I wanted to cut
over to snubz here I would delete Darrin
so now it goes over to you and then like
if I wanted wide I'd do another slice
and had I delete the Darrin been deleted
and I'd end up with like these stairs
going up and down all the time like of
us going between the cameras and it's
kind of painful I mean it takes a while
you know because you're constantly like
as you're doing your editing you're
constantly like stopping slicing the
leading stop move around it's a pain yes
so I found this new feature and I want
to show you too now because it's so cool
in premiere if you stack all your Clips
up once they're all synchronized with
your clap or whatever you want to use
and then you drag that sequence into
another sequence I can actually do all
of the cutting in real time just like
Paul used to do on the mixing board by
going to cool yeah all I have to do is
right-click on it
and say multi-camera and enable and then
when I pull up my multi camera monitor
this is so sick so I've got these four
windows here the fourth would probably
be like the video capturing the video
from your laptop in real time as well
which yeah so now I can just like the
thing that we used to have in a huge box
that we would carry around that's
exactly what it is yeah so I can like I
can actually just play back the clip and
choose whatever you know like here you
are talking about something so I can
reach you or cut over to me and I don't
know I I just love it because I think
that adds a lot to the production of the
show and oh yeah makes it so much easier
for me to just like you know set up all
three cams hit record on all of them
clap and and get it all done wow that's
really cool it saves a lot of time it's
efficient and it makes it look much more
it gives us a lot more quality to our
show so yeah I like it I'm looking
forward to getting back into the groove
with season 9 with you getting out here
and shooting three camp-style again
maybe even building a proper studio
again like we had before and yes I would
have built a studio get my hands dirty
take some paint whoo sounds like fun so
often what's been tickling your
technically well I got out to like a lot
of bars and stuff and I really don't
like being mean to people and just being
like hey I have a boyfriend and it's
like throw him away but I like to make
friends so if I start talking to
somebody and they don't really you know
they start hitting on me or something I
just want to get away from there
so I found this thing it's called rescue
me and it's over at our esc you dot me
and I can show you it real quick if you
want to jump over here there you go yeah
I've got to pulled up basically it'll
give you an excuse to get out of like an
annoying date or any kind of
conversation that you're having that you
just don't want to be there for and you
don't want to be rude and just be like I
got to go bye so what you can do is send
an SMS or send a text message over to
this phone number 206 8
six five nine two four and then you can
put in the body of the message SMS five
is their example and it'll send you an
SMS message in five minutes and then you
can just be like oh my God my my
stepmother is dying or something and you
run away that's horrible that's why no
it saves you a lot of you know time and
energy trying to come up with an excuse
you can just have it send you an SMS and
it can even call you too if you send the
number over there and you you dial in
something like let's see
you can send call fifteen and then to
the phone number and it'll call you in
15 minutes they'll call your cell phone
or whatever number that you'd send that
text to yeah it's it's hilarious I tried
it out and it does work and it's just
it's really cute and a painfully funny
thanks I'm sure that that that's that's
something you can actually use yeah yeah
it's something you can use if you're
like you know I'll play in the field or
something right and it's built on Ruby
on Rails so you know I I like the idea
of specifying the message like you could
add you know the email servers are down
get to the office immediately Oliver and
and I guess if you wanted to you could
actually go as far as to save that phone
number in your phone as like a contact
even give it like a profile picture yeah
you can give it a profile picture so
that it looks like one of your real
people are calling you right right
because it's a real phone number yeah
that's cool you you're gonna turn into a
pumpkin
alright Cinderella yeah that's true all
right well thanks so much and it was fun
it's good to get on and you know between
Skype and go to meeting chair desktop
and falling asleep Mouse I can't wait to
have her back in my life here and in you
know you gettin out here it's cool too I
guess
all right cool well I will see you next
week thanks for coming on they care and
I also want to thank our excellent
sponsor for making segments like these
possible its go-to meeting you have to
meet with clients and colleagues but
with the average business travel costing
$1,000 that's why I recommend traveling
less and doing more with GoToMeeting
just click post a sales presentation a
training session product demos or just
collaborate right from your desk plus
voice over IP and telephone conferencing
is included it's so easy you'll have
your first meeting up and running in
seconds to try GoToMeeting free for 30
days must visit goto meeting.com click
the try it free button and use the promo
code hak5 that just about wraps up this
episode of hack 5 but before we get
going let's check out your technical
score of the week
but first Shannon we got some feedback
this week didn't we yes we always get
all sorts of nice feedback over at
feedback at hack 5 org and we selected a
couple for this week so our first one
was from Rodrigo he said Darren during
your GoToMeeting segments what kind of
glasses do you use and yeah what are
those okay so these are from Gunnar
optics I forget the particular name of
these but I'm probably splashing to them
anyway and they are computer glasses
they're gamer glasses really it was
everything yeah Evan Oberman from the
vessel turned me on to these while ago
and I think it was like last III or
maybe CES and I was like you know
they're expensive they're not gonna like
they're like it's gonna increase your
gaming performance and stuff like that
and on a whim I saw him at Def Con and
thought I'd you know pick up a pair and
see if there what's up and I don't know
I guess it helps like you know you can
do probably a lot more to help your your
eye strain than getting some fancy
glasses I think you know doing the whole
like bounce the light off the ceiling
and not having like you know bright
fluorescents and turning down your
monitor stuff like that helps as well as
like every couple of minutes just look
at something else you know you get in
the zone I know you're in the code but
try to focus your eye on different
anyway so um playing an FPS and you
forget to blink yeah yeah but I've been
playing with and I've been using them
for a while at my computer just to see
and I don't
notice I just noticed that they they do
make the colors look a little bit better
and they kind of magnified just a bit I
like them they were cheap sorry let me
try the design yeah make me look so
smart - all right so yeah oh okay yeah I
can see a color difference I don't know
if this would help with eyestrain that's
what they claimed hmm to wear him for
like a whole day to actually figure that
out anyway check it out again I'll see
ya snows when do you not look I'm total
beat a what alright next question is
save ourselves
next one's from Kevin he just wanted to
know have you found any app to get an
auto SSH connection from your droid back
to your own servers I've been looking
for one but I cannot find one dude okay
we talked about this a couple of I think
it was like a season ago we talked about
doing SSH with with shared keys and
while there is a really cool terminal
app for Android called connect bot
highly recommend I think it's actually
free there is a terminal and actually
there's a couple of remotes but the one
that I like is better terminal for
Android because your Android phone is
basically a Linux box so better terminal
allows you to just go ahead and get you
know a prompt here it doesn't you don't
even need to have root it actually
installs as part of battery terminal a
lot of other tools that you use on a
regular basis like said and awk and all
those other Linux tools so one of the
things that you can do is create that
key pair that you just like you would
from one Linux box to another and then
you can set up a shell script to
automatically connect to you know
different on your droid than it would be
for any other computer to computer
highly recommend the better terminal I
wonder if there's something like that
for the iPhone oh definitely there's a
bunch of jailbroken oh yeah jailbroken
so I know I can do stuff like VNC and
yeah FaceTime on I hear a round upcoming
maybe alright our last question is I
have used Boxey for some time now on I
love that you guys have started some
boxy tutorials very helpful
