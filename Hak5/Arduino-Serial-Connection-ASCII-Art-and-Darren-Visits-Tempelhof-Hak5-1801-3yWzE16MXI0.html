you by domain.com hello and welcome in
elf at five at casa darren kitchen
it's your weekly dose of Technol s and I
am here in Berlin at Tempelhof field
this is so exciting we are at a kind of
epic Airport right now and this is
actually well this is one of the oldest
international airports up until 2008
when it was closed and turned into a
park it's also very pivotal in the in
the Berlin Blockade as part of the you
know Berlin Airlift so as far as like
aviation history is concerned kind of
pivotal kind of epic and I will leave
links in the show notes to some
interesting reading on that front
because it's really cool cold war-era
good stuff but I am actually here to fly
I've got my flight bag ready and I've
talked about some of the upgrades and
some of the follow-ups since the other
week so most notably I got a bunch of
comments on this and let me just
couldn't break out some of this gear
most notably yes so you should be
mindful of all of the different
regulations when you go to fly in
different countries and so that's kind
of one of the things we'll be talking
about first of all Artie T and E has
kind of a pretty strict regulations when
it comes to 5.8 gigahertz transmitters
so that's why I'm actually using a 25
mil align here in Europe whereas
normally I can use something like a 600
milliwatts and that's always good stuff
but you know be respectful understand
that and honestly in an open field like
this I think 25 milliwatts is going to
be just fine and I've also made some
pretty significant improvements here to
the i1 extreme so as we talked about the
other week this is the carbon-fiber
folding mod on the I want extreme using
the Phoenix flight gear good stuff here
and the biggest change is actually this
ppm receiver there's one of the really
cool things in the RC world is there's
so much community development this is
actually one of those where some guys
have come you know put together
a receiver because they just weren't
happy with what was on the market and
under this heat shrink here is a really
awesome board that does receiving under
one servo cable so typically what you'll
have is they'll have a different
receiver you'll have a different servo
cable for all of the different avionics
so you're iran's your thrust your your
throttle your elevators your rudder all
of those will have a different cable or
at least that is typically the standard
with some of the spectrum gear that I'm
used to at least what's really cool
about this ppm and kind of goes in with
what we were talking about the other
week with PWM is that it multiplex is
all of those channels on to this one
chip and it's so cool that the guys that
built the i1 Xtreme had that foresight
because what it means is when I plug
this in this speaks the spectrum
protocol and that means that I can bind
it with a different remote you'll
remember the biggest complaint that I've
been having thus far with this is really
just the range and part of that is due
to the mod C carbon fiber has this
tendency to soak up radio frequencies
and as this board here with the receiver
built in for the little PlayStation like
remote that I showed you it tends to
block that and I was getting something
like anywhere between maybe 300 and 500
feet range which really isn't great and
also that's a huge wiggle room I mean
we're talking to most 50% like
difference there and so it was very
unnerving to fly because you never know
when you were going to lose signal and
when you do what would happen is it
would just fall out of sky which is just
not cool so this solves that by speaking
spectrum and allowing me to bind it with
a real transmitter you know real and
that's get to that in just second but
I'm very happy with this because it
moves the ppm receiver off of you know
the main PC board here and also this
unit right here is actually this is a
very shortened cable but essentially on
the back here velcroed is a satellite
receiver so what I end up with is
actually you know I've got this antenna
here plus two more and the satellite
receiver basically it's going to choose
the better of the cig
between all of these and that's really
nice because I can also point them in
different directions so we've talked
about with radios and polarization
before if my antenna transmitter is
vertically polarized right and then I've
got a vertically polarized antenna on
the craft well that's great until I go
into a turn like this and now suddenly
there's horizontally polarized so by
having you know a 90 degree difference
between these two antennas I'll always
have a good signal that's really nice
now in order to speak with this over you
know over that transmitter over the ppm
I've gone ahead and changed out to for a
slightly larger transmitter but I must
say this is just about the coolest thing
so this is a modded dimension Devo 7e
transmitter and what's really cool about
the 70 and actually most of the Divo
controllers here is well first of all
it's pretty small considering this is a
full-featured six channel transmitter
but mostly it's very model and there's
open source firmware available which is
just rad so this is running the
daeviation firmware and it's so cool
it's so easy to program essentially
you've got a USB port here and when you
plug this into your computer while
holding down the ENT button it'll
actually mount as a fat32 filesystem
it's only 2 Meg's but most of the
configuration is just done with text
files anyway after you give mad props
over to massive RC we're going ahead and
actually creating a configuration
already for the i1 extreme so really
aside from just binding this to the
lemon Rx over the PPM there wasn't
really much to do or I'm sorry over the
spectrum so that's really cool I mean it
increased my all all up wait just a
little bit but otherwise you know it's
worth it because what I've done here is
I'm getting something like you know 10
times the range that I was receiving
before and I've done a little bit to
kind of keep it compact like I've
removed the antenna mast and just folded
the antenna over to the inside shouldn't
impact it too much and yeah overall very
happy with this
you know you get a nice
play there and you can actually go into
the menus and change all of your
different values to just the way you
like it so I'm going to go ahead and
leave that there and then the other
piece of equipment that that I've
thought I'll be rocking on the trip and
this is one of these hang on is a
first-world problem here I can't wear
the Google glass and the Fatshark
goggles at the same time the fat sharks
are kind of your I guess you would say
industry standard within fpv or first
person view flying and they're pretty
good I just got the the newer ones from
these these are the the fat shark
Dominator v2 s the Dominator HDS just
came out and I just got them and they're
really cool they've got a wider field of
view and though they have displays of
800 by 600 instead of 640 by 480 which I
wouldn't consider HD but it is a nice
bump up in quality however it does
require a lot more power and for that
reason I'm just sticking with this one
for the time being I really like the
fact that it's got the DVR built-in
which means I'll be able to actually
record onto the SD card on the goggles
now as you'll know the whole reason for
this setup is because of the battery the
whole system is built around the battery
and not just the battery but because of
the chargers because of the chargers are
USB I don't need to bring giant lipo
battery chargers with me wherever I go
and and that's kind of awesome because
nobody wants to I mean I'm just trying
to stay super nimble and it all fits in
this this tiny tactical bag here so with
that I will note and you know Thomas s
as well as a few others commented
letting me know that that while this
system is based on this this quasi 2's
battery whether it's a 1s a 2's a 3s or
4s whatever what that means are the
different cells right normally cells are
about 3.7 volts so a 3s battery would be
12 point 6 volts and you can kind of do
the math from there but each of those
cells are individually charged and what
and that's what allows me to use the USB
charger because USB is 5 volts and I'm
trying to charge something that's 3.7 so
I've got plenty of wiggle room but to
charge the whole lot of 12.6 can't do
that under 5 um a note about traveling
with batteries I should say is that when
flying domestically or internationally
what you'll want to do is go ahead and
put electric tape on the battery
terminals the TSA doesn't like it
otherwise and also you should probably
keep in mind what they call your
equivalent lithium content and actually
put this in my bag to show to show the
TSA agents they kind of got a chuckle
out of this they are classified as spare
batteries whenever you bring these loose
batteries there's not a limit on how
many you can bring however there's a
limit on how much ELC or equivalent
lithium content you can bring and to do
the math essentially what you're looking
for is to find out in grams what this LC
is what you do is you take the milliamp
hours in this case it's 1150 milliamp
hour per cell you divide that by a
thousand right so and then you multiply
it by the voltage so the cells are 3.7
volts so what I end up is with is 4.2
watt hours which is really small 4.2 to
put that in perspective a 8 gram which
is the the limit for a smaller battery 8
gram spare battery of PLC that's a
hundred watt hours right so then you can
take that 4.2 and divide it by 12.5 and
you'll get your ELC which in this case
is 0.34 grams well under 8 so all links
in the show notes if you do travel with
RC on on how to do that now going back
to the fat sharks real quick I was
saying that the batteries are really
important in this system just because
they are so small and one of the things
that it didn't want to have to do is
bring a regular lipo charger the fat
sharks do require a 2 s or higher
battery which means it's expecting
somewhere around 8.4 volts you can run
it off a 3 s that's fine as well now to
get around the limitation of having to
bring a 2s lipo battery and a regular
charger what I've gone ahead and done
here is
I am using our new pineapple juice 1500
USB battery packs any battery pack would
work in the assistance I just like our
own because I've you know had them
manufactured to our specification one of
the cool things about these is you can
actually take two of them in parallel
and actually have one be charging the
other so they kind of bond and what that
means is it will actually allow it to
charge while discharging at the same
time which is pretty cool
so the reason for all of this though is
I can take a USB cable and pop that into
here and I've modded this USB cable on
the end here is a regular five point
five millimeter outer diameter 2.1
millimetre inner diameter DC barrel plug
Center positive this is the same cable
that you would find on say a Wi-Fi
pineapple or most gear that's you know
likes things like 12 volts and what
you'll find underneath this electric
tape here and under the heat shrink is
actually a voltage booster if you will
that basically takes the five volts
that's coming out of here trading off
some of that amperage to create a 12
volt signal so if you pop a multimeter
on this end you're not gonna get 5 volts
like you would on a normal USB you'll
actually get 12 volts which is great
because now I can plug these into the
goggles and there's anybody on my
frequency nope
and there we go and I can actually use
this to fly without having to bring
additional equipment and then I could
just toss this in my back pocket and and
away I go and then the last thing I
wanted to mention as far as upgrades to
this guy is that I have placed two
simple LEDs on it right I've got a red
in the rear and this green LED in the
front here the way that it's positioned
the reason it's there in that location
is because my fpv camera pod just simply
velcro's on to the top here and what
that means is it's pointed down in it
sees this LED a little bit and why
that's important is because typically
what you want to do is you want to fly
with confidence to in a fly with
information and and normally what you'll
use is what's called an on-screen
display and what an OSD or an on-screen
display will do is it'll take the video
feed from your camera and through
better and in between there it will tie
in with the flight controller to grab
interesting information like your flight
speed and your altitude and your bearing
if you have GPS and all of those other
things and then display them on on to
the the video signals so that when you
put your goggles on you kind of see what
looks like a fighter cockpit right
sometimes you get the artificial horizon
and stuff like that and it's really cool
but those cost a lot of weight and you
know the more weight you add the less
battery times going to be and we need to
keep our thrust to weight ratio high so
that we can you know so that we're quite
agile and so the most pivotal thing for
me as a pilot is that I need to know my
battery voltage because if you you run
your battery dead while you're in the
sky
you can't fall out of the sky and that's
never good so and the nice thing about
the Iowan extreme is it has a lvc or low
voltage cutoff where before the battery
gets too low it will start flashing the
LEDs so quite simply just by putting the
LED within the field of view of the
camera I can now tell when it changes
from just the regular strobing to the
flashing real quick that hey I've only
got a minute of flight time left it's
time to land anyway that is all of hat
and with that it's time to fly
it doesn't matter whether you are a
triceratops or a velociraptor when that

we're back with super fun times with
Arduinos and today we are playing with
something called a serial connection
with the Arduino we already know that we
can feed the Arduino some really yummy
super fancy code from the IDE to make it
do a thing but we can also use the same
USB port to feed our computer data from
the Arduino itself so this is something
called a serial data transfer this means
that we will feed the computer data one
bit at a time so one after another in
each bit is read by the computer as one
or a zero so this is just like any other
code that you're going to use eight bits
of course equals one byte 1024 bytes
equals one kilobyte so on and so forth
until you get all the way up to you
they're really really big things of
bytes so when you use a serial monitor
and you want to watch something get
typed out onto your screen you'll also
notice that there's two little LEDs on
your Arduino when you have it plugged in
they're called
Rx and TX and they're just found right
on the board they're the teeny teeny
tiny LEDs they're film right there you
can't see them very good in the in the
camera itself but you'll see them
flashing when I actually use some code
you'll also want to know about this
little button right here so this is
basically like a reset button any time
you use the code now I wanted to show
you four different examples of some code
on my computer starting with this first
example which is just a very very simple
hello world so you want to print hello
world onto this thing called a serial
monitor so when I go ahead and validate
and upload this on to my art
no it'll just take a few seconds and
once it is done I'll go ahead and show
you what this code means so of course
we're gonna do the void set up at the
beginning you do that set up every
single time down here on the second line
you have cereal begin 9600 so this is
setting up something called a cereal
library which is found in the libraries
of the Arduino IDE at 9600 bps bits per
second now you have cereal print line
which is going to be the second line
down here that says hello world so this
basically means that I want it to print
out hello world with line break at the
end after that we have a very empty void
loop so thing that you need to remember
about Arduino code is you need a void
set up with something in it and then a
void loop with something in it or it can
be empty if you want but you always have
to have that void loop written at the
top or else it'll think that you forgot
it and it'll give you an error so if you
don't want it to loop just put a void
loop and then don't write anything
underneath that so once I have that set
up I can hit this little button up at
the top in my IDE and it's called serial
monitor when I click on that it's gonna
print out hello world and that's the IDE
the code that's coming from my Arduino
now if I press the little button on my
Arduino which is right here I can press
it it refreshes the code and then it
prints it again so I could do that over
and over if I want but that's kind of
boring right so we're gonna take it a
step further now if I open up my next
code this is called serial - this is
pretty much the same thing but this time
we put it into a loop so we have hello
world and then I decided to make it
delay for a thousand milliseconds or one
second so I'm gonna go ahead and upload
that to my Arduino so now if you look at
my code down here I basically just cut
and paste Arial print line hello world
into my loop segment and then under that
I put delay of 1000 so very very simple
code very easy to understand if I hit
serial monitor this time it'll print out
hello world every one second so it keeps
on doing that over and over because it's
a loop so another very easy one now what
if we may want to make it a little bit
more complicated say you're either
picking up something from a some kind of
input device that you have on
red board that's connected to your
Arduino or you just want it to include
some math or something a little more
complicated in that case you wouldn't
even want to actually set up some kind
of variables so this time we're setting
up the variables up up at the top we
have three intz
each of those are some kind of numbers
we have five ten and twenty and then we
do the same thing we set up with 9,600
bits per second and then we print out a
whole bunch of different lines now
you'll know you'll notice here if I have
print line and then I have print that's
going to tell you whether it's going to
have a break or it's going to complete
the thing on the same line so in this
case it's going to print a equals and
then whatever a equals so in this case
it would be five that'll all be on the
same line after it prints out a will
have a line break so we have that print
line and so on and so forth so it's very
very easy to understand I'll go ahead
and upload this okay and if we hit my
serial monitor we get our math printed
out now if I hold down on the little
button I did want to mention this as
well this is when you would actually
notice that your LEDs are blinking
whenever you click on it and you refresh
your code so you'll notice that Rx and
TX light up just a little bit in this
case it's just TX and then it puts out
your code onto your serial monitor so
very easy again I'll go ahead and close
this one now let's have a little bit
more fun so before we get into some fun
with this I wanted to do something up at
the top of that last code so I had all
those intz up at the top we have five
ten and twenty those are pretty small
numbers right so let's type in something
crazy high for B we'll make B be 150
5678 that sounds good right
all right that's high enough so if we
have something super-high like that
you'll notice that the calculation is
going to be incorrect whenever you
actually store this on your Arduino and
get it to output into your serial
monitor now if I run this and I open up
my serial monitor so you'll notice that
B equals six zero six that's incorrect
so the reason why this happens is
because an int
allows you to store two bytes of data or
sixteen bits we need to change the
values from intz to Long's which is a
completely different variable in regards
to Arduino code or C code so a long type
can store 32 bits of data as opposed to
just 16 the Arduino has a lot less
memory than your computer does so it's
really important to change your types
whenever they need to to be order to to
allow you to conserve as much memory as
possible when you're ever you're
actually outputting this information
from your Arduino or alts your entire
code is going to get screwed up
so in this case I want to go over here
and change int to long and you'll notice
long automatically changes into that
orange color so I'm going to upload this
and if I go over to my serial monitor
now it'll print out the correct amount
of bits or the actual data that B is
supposed to be now if I pull up a
website on here it's over at the Arduino
website I'll put this in the show notes
too this explains all the different
variables that you can use and how many
bits you're going to have available for
each kind
now that up at the top I actually wanted
to quote this because it explains it in
a very easy way a variable is a way of
naming and storing a value for later use
by the program such as data from a
sensor or an intermediate value used in
a calculation which is exactly what we
just did so the reason why you want to
make sure that you're using the correct
type of variable for whatever kind of
math or whatever kind of you know the
sensor that you're using is because it's
going to be storing that data for later
on in the code if your code is crazy
crazy long it could completely screw up
the information that you're trying to
output and give you incorrect data
values so if I scroll down a bit there's
this website down here it says some
variable types and they have Long's here
they have unsigned Long's as well floats
doubles a lot of this is going to look
familiar if you use C code before if you
haven't definitely check out the site
and read up on it because it'll explain
everything that you need to know about
different variables okay
so now that we got all that super geeky
hard stuff out of the way let's go have
some fun okay so I decided that since
we're messing with you know serial
monitors and one night I wanted to make
some ask yarr because why not so I just
created this
ask-ask yard that says well it's
supposed to say hack five for the win
isn't it cute with whole bunch of print
lines and then I don't want it to run
over and over again so I didn't include
the print the void loop so when I upload
this it should just print out once it's
it should look really nice and tidy on
my serial monitor and hopefully it works
serial monitor yeah yay it worked now if
I put the bunt it hit the button again
there we go that's cool okay so that's
fun times I like that so knowing how to
actually use a serial connection for
your projects can really help debug them
in the future example if you are trying
to calculate the maybe the temperature
in a room and you need to understand
exactly what's going on on the Arduino
on the sensor and read it out into some
kind of I don't know maybe you're doing
a project for your boss or something
like that and you need them to know what
the differences are in the temperature
or something then you would want to be
able to calculate that information into
your serial monitor so you can output it
in a way that you know humans understand
as opposed to just the Arduino so it's
very fun it's very easy to debug things
and it's very easy to use this in the
actual Arduino IDE so they just kind of
included it for you yeah I liked it it
was super fun stay tuned of course
because we have a lot more fun times
going on over here I hope you guys
