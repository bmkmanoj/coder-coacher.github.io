this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by go to assist Express dim dim easy
free web conferencing and halo 3 ODST
for xbox 360 prepared to drop hello
welcome to hack by my name is Darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse and I met less
talk and we are here not in the studio
we decided to get out because it's way
too nice to stay inside so we're here at
the green leaf in williamsburg virginia
in newtown one of the only bars that is
open after 8pm it was higher countries
in williamsburg area this place was
happening 300 years ago yeah and not
much sense really it's a shame hmm I
don't you figure the founders of the new
world would be you know living it up at
a bar yeah hard but we do have the perks
that we can you know go to the grocery
store and there's Thomas Jefferson
walking around on his cell phone there's
a bunch of bitchy tourists which are
leaving I'm excited about that I heard
thanksgiving really yeah maybe it's a
slow drop off I gotta go be a tourist
this weekend that's right you're going
on a very exciting adventure I know I
know it's got to be the lamest adventure
ever i'm only going 500 miles in three
days I swear the map i set out like
camping one night DC with Harrison
sadder a Saturday night right I'm
there's no way I'm going to be adding so
many detours yeah oh ok ting you'll have
a good day ok can I get to be at the
house often you're going spelunking I am
going spelunking is going slowking
they've always wanted to use that in a
sense now it captain well it's because
it's on his TV host bingo I don't know
if you guys know this but we have cards
and am yeah sorry well okay um yeah I'm
gonna go to Luray Caverns maybe or
whatever so whatever enough about that
that's what's going on we've got awesome
content this episode I've got a lot of
feedback and last one but let's not stay
wind it in the a block and kick it off
right we've got a awesome interview with
our boy atlas rider who's another
motorcyclist to tell us about how to
mashed up GPA
and google maps and youtube I wasn't
there for that interview I really need
to see what this makes it yeah yeah it's
pretty tight let's go take a look today
we have the pleasure of being joined by
a motorcyclist world traveler and video
blogger atlas rider bill thanks so much
for joining us today thanks for having
me dinner I wanted to get your
perspective on this and and dive into
what exactly is moto vlogging and what
kind of inspired you to pop a camera on
your helmet well I the first person that
I saw do this was a guy called more de
13 and there's kind of a take on video
blogging where no usually people would
make vlogs and just sit in front of the
camera and it in the narrative you know
maybe interesting but the background was
very boring so kind of the birth of me
logging or moto V logging was trying to
you know provide you know an interesting
narrative but also have a background or
foreground rather that was interesting
like the vista road that you're riding
on and from there this kind of sub
culture has really grown over the past
couple of years it's been pretty
interesting so tell me about the
subculture a little bit i'm kind of new
to this i've seen more 213 and 88 hawaii
and you but how did that really grow
because i know that you've been doing
this for quite a bit yeah i've been
doing it for about two years now and i
think it started maybe about only three
years ago and it's I know it's a fairly
tightly knit community that you know
chats with keeps ties with with each
other and there's some well there's some
some meetup that happened where you know
right there's multiple riders that are
going out on a road and and recording a
particular ride and so you've got like
kind of four or five different
perspectives on the same on the same
ride which with which is kind of neat
them so I'd say there's probably about
there's at least a hundred out there
that are V logging on a regular basis
and then there's a there's a lot of
people out there and make them a video
here and there and one full posted up
vela the motorcycle be logging really i
think started on live video calm and its
and then an eventually move to you too
ok i got asked because I read the
youtube comments for a lot of these
videos and it's something that you see
over and over again with lots of
different moto bloggers is you know that
that question what's your setup what is
what's your camera with your gear and so
I've got to ask you what do you find
essential and particularly as a sport
tourer yourself what do you find
essential when you're going on a
cross-country trip thousands of miles
what do you bring with you and what
stays at home well there's there's
plenty of little gadgets that I have the
main thing is a tip that I think they do
with is the sony TFC of t5 deep inside a
sony DSC t500 camera that takes our HD
video in 1280 by 720 resolution which is
really really works well with the new HD
videos for youtube so this is
indispensable SD cards extra batteries a
way to charge all of my gadgets from my
bike because i'm up oftentimes wheedle
nowhere and you can't really can't
really plug-in i do camping and and then
my for my navigation would be my garmin
gf's sorry garmin gpsmap 60csx which is
an integral part in the in the mash-up
between maps and videos but the way most
people wonder like how the cameras
actually mounted and it's very very
simple actually and it seems very
dangerous to most but what kind of
demonstrate their really picture so so i
got my helmet there and literally all i
do is just rough the camera on the chin
bar and and have it sit right here and
because my head tilt it down
by my vision has been peed it at all and
it looks really weird but sometimes
simple simplicity is the best I've tried
working with bullet cams it takes 10
minutes to set up it's a mess I like
just popping a camera in getting record
and going so besides that other gear
that I take on a cross-country trip is I
how to do a lot of camping so anything
that a backpacker would take for like a
week long trek into the mountains is
very very similar to what motor stuff
motorcyclist would would use it has to
be very compact low ways and able to
only have so much room on the bike so
that's not what I protect that's what I
used to prepare for from my trip now
what if I'm really fascinating about
your videos in particular that that I
don't think I've seen anywhere else in
mode of logging is the way that you
synchronize your YouTube videos with the
the road that you've traveled and a
real-time update on google maps of your
location I'm assuming by GPS but maybe
you could tell us a little bit about how
that gets put together sure I kind of
coined the term Atlas videos you know
because you've got this get this map on
one side and you've got a video and it
provides kind of a real time perspective
aware that person is asked you know
while they're all their writing and
there's there's three main components to
that make this work once YouTube allow
created an API so it manipulates the
player that allowed me that API was
absolutely necessary second piece is
keeping a data law DPS log of all your
coordinates when I'm out writing all my
garmin here will will record about every
five seconds and then kind of overkill
but there's there's plenty of space and
then just some JavaScript that ties the
first two things together and and
basically as the video is progress is
playing it's looking at this GPS data
log in
finding out okay what GPS coordinates in
this file correspondent to his position
to the position and they overlay that
with a KML file that that has the path
that I'm going to in the video and and
you can actually kind of jump ahead on
the road and which will in turn jump
ahead in the video and basically how it
works can you show us here like what's
the actual code what's you know that
you're saying javascript is is that the
engine can you show us what actually
puts those two pieces together sure yeah
it's not the most glamorous code right
right now but it's it's late now hot on
the screen I'll show you basically all
the inner workings of it and and I can I
can make this public for your readers if
you want to monkey around with it
yourself so I this one variable that has
all the GPS data in it just a huge array
and that's really crucial for that the
plotting of my progress along along the
map besides that and there's lots of
google provides a lot of a lot of
examples on how to use their api for
google maps and and which or you could
find you know always out there do that
but but i'm napping on the i'm adding
the the path that I'm taking at this
point right here which is pretty simply
just give it a URL and what KML file and
that that you want to that you want to
use and mad KML files been generated
based on the GPS data that I had been
logging on my my garmin here so once
that's done what what you have to do is
basically set up a listener that then
that basically fires off it's a timer
actually it fires off every I think five
seconds or so and it checks okay what at
what point are you in the video and
let's sync that up to what what you
should be from the the GPS data what
that makes sense and there's a little
probably the most complicated part of it
is just making that calculation from
time in the video to mapping that up to
the time that it's set up that in the
gps lock in the GPS data so it isn't
this array that I meant that's right go
ahead no no good you're saying timing it
with your ray so in disarray up here
there's longitude here latitude and I'm
zero which is the start of me which
which is time and then this appears 5x5
so that just increments for every
latitude longitude that you have there
so do have to write the code do you have
to to rewrite this for every video that
you publish that would be at Atlas video
you have to puff I had to write the code
for all this brief video yes okay yeah I
made a little utility then makes this a
little here from when I'm doing video
after video and so it kind of sets up
everything for me all I have to do is is
find the point with the segment of the
my GPS logs and sink that up with the
video because I'm taking GPS logs for
hours at one time and I'm only taking
video for maybe five minutes so finding
that point and sticking that up so the
spread is is basically the most annoying
part of doing this have you published
any of these programs no I haven't
published it I've been not thought about
kind of polishing stuff so that other
people can use it but I I haven't I
haven't done that yet but it's it's all
client side JavaScript so theoretically
just go to my go to my website and take
a peek and if you're if you're savvy
enough you can figure
but but I have thought about kind of
making a a plug-in that people can use
to have to do this on their own that's
really a wordpress plugin yeah and then
that is a just a really just a nifty add
on to the whole experience of watching a
motovlog and and with the map that I get
asked you you've done what hundreds of
videos now what's the biggest challenge
in uh in modal blogging well number one
challenge is just staying on the road
and making sure that you're you're not
you're not focusing on what you're
saying and what you're talking about too
much and now you realize that you should
be first priority is riding the bike but
aside from that it's all really just
kind of finding out so trying trying to
keep a a narrative and staying on topic
at some point because sometimes you'll
be writing by something alongside the
road and okay that's me and you start
talking about that and you feel what
you're talking about in the first place
so it makes it makes videos a little
disjointed sometimes but sometimes
that's the good thing the spontaneity of
being out there just talking about
whatever and it doesn't always have to
be scripted but sometimes it's sometimes
it's better if you want to talk about
something filler so staying on point and
I'm just keeping your batteries charged
it probably might be my my biggest
challenges so what's coming up for that
was writer next thing I want to do is
have to Alaska all the way up to do to
up to the Arctic Circle and Prudhoe Bay
and that is going to be a lengthy trip
probably like four to five week trip and
I'm going to try and try and do that
next summer see if that happens but I'm
really looking forward to doing a lot of
research on it I just bought a used Kor
which is no more off-road bike since
i'll be hitting a lot rocky or
me up there and I'd like to do more
off-roading but that yeah Alaska has
been a long sought after goal for me for
a while and hopefully I can make it
happen next summer and and share the
journey through video photos and writing
your my blog well bill thank you so much
for coming on and sharing with us some
of the background of you know what makes
a moto vlog so where can our audience
find more of your stuff you can go to
Atlas rider calm and that's where I
publish all my videos stories photos of
my of my journeys and from there you can
you can find where i wear my twitter
account is on facebook as well i often
to do i'm on the road because it's very
simple as long as i have cell phone
coverage but atlas rider gown is my main
source if you want to find out more
thanks so much bill well we're going to
take a break and when we get back we'll
find out what's going on with this

details yeah thanks / pretty much
killing my kindle sex segment just be
glad I Briffa kindle god I'm so huh you
go from you go from being cracked out to
breaking yeah okay so look at those
he decided to go ahead and solder the
wires onto my kindle yeah onto the flat
cable with the 20 pins on it and and
then he decided to unplug the flat cable
in somehow or another the three wires
connecting it to the TTL yeah they
snapped the part because the the 20 pins
they're so light that they just think
they have snapped so you're talking
about a half millimeter a pin that's why
you're agile with that I saw her perfect
legally leads I had were two millimeter
in oh you know what I actually had
connection wire that was half millimeter
okay okay I had blue and red this is why
you don't trust Darren awkward they were
really good sorrowful get ready to do
the show and I'm like yeah go ahead and
solder if you want I think I found your
answer though yeah I found the connector
that will plug ribbon to ribbon or will
plug better handle and then into the
header and then you can solder points on
that
the header please I think I found it and
there's no risk of Darren foo barring
another we should've bought more than
one flat cable I'm just stoked abhi cuz
it sounds like from the what is it
there's a like a flash update file but
that guy's got that basically allows you
to overwrite the aetc password shadow
file so that you essentially reset root
password it's like a convo for free
clinic well exactly that's very much
what you're doing yeah so once we're in
and I mean it's just an arm-based linux
and it's got a modem like I don't know
how it uses if you use like PPP or what
to get on the whispernet but i would
love to poke around with them that's
that's the that's the thingy right at
you broke that I brought well but the
kindle still works yeah at least he's
not cracked out yeah yeah I was
surprised like people like monotone
boring daring it's not that you were
monotone boring is that you were looking
under spawn Singh off the freaking walls
and being like if you give you like like
a pinball in the studio okay seacoast an
because you can imagine you're just like
you kind of like Oh ceiling shiny object
birdie kitty that's you yeah like your
brain can't process everything that's
going on at the same time so you just
brush through it and then that way you
can get on to pay attention other right
well okay we're gonna give it a try and
see how it goes because you know some
people like the long form something you
know that's the thing though is you ask
the YouTube audience and they seem to
like cracked-out gay and they seem to
like you know getting in 10 minutes or
last seven because you're too audience
has a 30-second attention I married what
locat I rest my case all right well I do
have some fun VPN stuff coming up I've
been getting tons of feedback I don't
need to get any more emails about dd-wrt
i dunno and you're SSO Explorer has been
discontinued because it was bombed with
barracuda networks yeah so I read in the
thingy September 2008 and I tried it
once and it's a pain in the
and really to get working really
correctly oh my god dude I read the
description I was so exciting wet I mean
dude it looks and a lot of the stuff
that I that you would want to do like
routing and stuff like that uh-huh next
such as why Barracuda bought it right
yeah that's sad when that kind of
happens to open source projects I've
seen that happened before with like
screen reporting well that happened to
I'm sorry that happened to a cam studio
did you know that there is a cam studio
there's a camp studio project on
sourceforge yeah and it's pretty much
deprecated I mean the thing is like you
know ancient it does a fine job for what
it did at the time but it doesn't have
all the features of the commercial
camstudio and that's another example of
one of those and that was a great thing
for recording screen captures when you
may take it the difference between
camtasia and came studio that might be
what I'm thinking don't notice were not
still I was trying to segue as to I
wanted as nothing to do with the other
anyway what's you while I was trying to
talk about that other email like the
dd-wrt and then the other thing about
UGA all the bj's would say can't that
was the whole camstudio thing right
there gotcha yeah II tried with the
segment I did I'm not as good at Tom
Merritt by a scalar bj's care we've got
one it accepts hdmi vga component as we
it's like what it's everything analog n
and DVR I'm sorry everything analog in
and hdmi out including hdmi in we should
probably preface this with what the hell
we're talking about we've been getting a
lot of emails recently all the sudden
for some reason about this question how
do you record your screen captures when
you're doing the show and everybody
seems to be thinking that we're using
software and that yes we did do that in
the very first season when we were poor
and not to say that we're rich or
anything but it's the reason we don't
use the software is because it's
infeasible when you're trying to do
something super intensive it is just so
resource hog to be recording your screen
and trying to do something else you got
to transfer it over and make sure that
it gets into the timeline you got to
synchronize it not yes it's a pain so
like that I think there is a big
misconception about the show is it's
actually suffer nights like these when
we you know get out of the studio
because it's you know
Hampton it's way too nice we want beer
is that sorry yeah but the point being
um the whole show is recorded live to
take you know you mentioned something
BAM but the whole thing is recorded live
to tape and and the way that it works is
that all the cameras over HDMI go to a
video switcher and vga gives the video
switcher as well and that's what the
scale is or to take the VJ and
conversion it's how much it's 400 bucks
so I'm not saying it's cheap but right
yeah anyway so all right you've got a
cool thing about vlans coming up right
yeah I my intro two vlans you know how I
implemented them and I know a lot of you
are gonna you know watch the segment and
I'm gonna get blamed bait like no
tomorrow you doing it wrong I think I
got that in my purse VPN segment about
my my chicken scratch network you know
hey whatever so if you like it great if
you had questions STFU I mean email matt
your question shuttle let's take a look
hey guys today i am back in the studio
to talk to you about vlans now what
exactly is a VLAN well VLAN stands for
virtual local area network and the
purpose of a VLAN is to kind of limit
well there's a couple purposes limit
broadcasts first if you have you know a
thousand users on you know your 30
second level of your office complex you
know you're you're going to have a lot
of broadcast traffic things pointing out
and saying hey what's going on over here
and you know things like that the
purpose of a VLAN is for segmentation
segmentation of saying you know hey
here's the sales department hey here's
the accounting department you two really
don't ever need to talk to each other so
I'm going to segment you guys out and
then you've got your servers down here
and you can go as crazy or as simplistic
as you want deploying a VLAN is pretty
simple so long as you know some basic
rules vlans that are going to you know
have to have security you know or if
your switch isn't a layer three switch
or you know that let's let's face
this is not an easy subject to just kind
of you know talk about here on the show
you really need to do your homework if
you're going to be deploying a VLAN but
for you know the sake of infrastructure
planning and infrastructure deployment
I'm going to talk to you about how i use
the VLAN so i had a need for vlans to
make sure that i could secure different
parts of IP subnets there's a couple
people that we host that don't need to
talk to others and therefore it was
important that we were able to
accurately secure them out from
everybody else so I showed you guys my
dell powerconnect 6248 switches that i
had briefly and switches a switch pretty
much so what we're going to do now is
we're actually going to log into the
switch to you know take a look at my
currently configured v-lin and you know
give you an iOS esque you know
demonstration of how you're going to set
up a VLAN in this switch so what we're
going to do here is we're going to open
up putty and I've got my dell switch
pre-configured and we're going to open
it and the user is going to be admin and
a password is my password I think I
typed that right now let's try that
again there we go so here in the console
and what we need to do first is figure
out what we can do well we can enter
into privileged mode first that's the
that's the key gotta enable the
privileged mode so let's figure out what
we can do now our boot clear configure
coffee blah blah blah blah blah what I
want to see is I want to see my
currently configured b-lands so we're
going to show VLAN and this is my VLAN
table so you can see here I've got VLAN
1 which is usually your default or your
management VLAN is set up on most of my
ports 2 is a security another VLAN for a
secondary office that we have that share
some office space with us different
company no need to see anything that
goes on
they're only there and connected to
share some internet Shh number three is
some internet IPS that I've got 100 is a
test VLAN that i was using here the two
key points 101 and 1000 now 101 starts
our internal variation of vlans and
networks and different IPS and stuff
like that I did it so that I can run
multiple active directory machines off
the same switches separate networks kind
of thing and then there's 1000 1000
starts our client hosted customers where
we host IT solutions for them so 1000 is
our first customer and to be to set up
security rules and policies and things
like that I needed to make sure that i
had a VLAN in working order so that I
could you know except traffic from my
ESX server take it through the switch
and then pass it out to my juniper
device which is an SSG 140 so here we
have the table but now how do we
actually go about adding a VLAN I'm
gonna give you a hint and take this with
a lot of heart don't use your web gooeys
to configure switches switches
especially because they're very finicky
and a lot of times the web interface
isn't going to give you all the access
or you know options that you're going to
need I had to set up a trunk port which
allows untagged traffic which is VLAN 1
management traffic to flow through but
it also allows VLAN 101 and VLAN 1000 to
take poor traffic for my ESX server on a
specific port which i believe is port 7
so it's 2 / g7 here in the in a VLAN
table but it needs to take that traffic
and pass it along the uplink port which
goes into our juniper now on the juniper
instead of adding another interface or
you know things like that what we
decided to do was add
interface this is kind of getting into
routing and things like that we're going
to take you over here and we can
actually add on top of my you know
ethernet 0 / 8 is a gigabit uplink it's
10 10 11 / 22 so I got tend not to net 1
to 10 10 to 10 I believe I don't
remember sorry what we're going to do is
you can see here that we've got Ethernet
0 / 81 now that is defined as a sub
interface now here the VLAN ID is 1000
and we've given this address or this
VLAN a different IP and subnet and we've
also assigned it to a security policy
zone here you can see that there's layer
3 switching going out in going on and
that the status is up because it's
piggybacking on Ethernet 0 / 8 and then
as well 82 is 101 and that's our
middleware as a service application so
here we can go in and we can edit this
so HR HD you got your IP address your
your netmask your management IP and the
VLAN tag so we've defined the VLAN tag
in the router and now we need to go to
the switch and enable traffic on the
switch so what we're going to do is
first we need to enter the config mode
of the switch so we're to type in config
now we're in the config mode and we've
got even more options that we can access
SNMP service router blah blah blah blah
first we need to go over and enter the
mode of the the ethernet port that we
need to configure for trunk mode or
general access because by default your
ports are passing untag traffic and they
will untag traffic unless you explicitly
define or it won't even know where to go
so we're going to enter in the interface
ethernet and we're going to say port or
i have a stacked configuration so I've
got module a unit 1 in unit 2 so we're
going to say to slash g8 and we're in
now the config
of interface unit to port 8 and then
we're going to say this port needs to be
on switch switchport mode general okay
and what this is going to do is this
going to allow us to configure basically
/ VLAN permissions that we want to allow
this port to accept or pass traffic
through otherwise it gets kind of stuck
and it says eh I don't know what do with
this VLAN so go away so we're going to
come back in here and we're going to say
switch port general all are allowed VLAN
ad and we're going to add that dummy
VLAN that I had dxs we're going to set
that up on this port so that port eight
on our second switch is allowed to pass
VLAN traffic add 100 we're gonna say
tagged because the ESX server and the
juniper are looking for that tag that
100 tag on the packets and saying okay
this is 100 and you just go this way and
you know you're allowed to go this way
but you know this or that it all depends
on how your routing and configuration is
actually set up and that's not something
that we really want to get into but for
sake of this that's how I set it up so
we're gonna say 100 is allowed to be
tagged and allowed to be passed through
this port to wherever it needs to go so
we're going to hit enter and warning
large number of vlans yeah we know
switchport general allowed feel an ad
now this is depending on your switch
important it's not important you always
want to allow management traffic through
it well normally you want to allow
management traffic through the ports I
just the way that I did my switch people
network gurus Paul I guarantee you I'm
gonna have some network people email me
be like you are effing wrong you need to
quit the show there you go crawl under a
rock and because you bring you know
nothing to the table and I'm going to
cry
it's fat sorry we're going to come back
here we're going to add it as untagged
because our management traffic our
standard Ethernet you know pass through
is not tagged with a VLAN so we're going
to hit enter and we're pretty much done
we're going to say end and now we're
going to just verify that we actually
have the the port configured correctly
show VLAN so now here if you see we've
got port 100 DX s 2 / 8 and now unit 2
port eight should accept VLAN traffic
now the key is you have to set up
where's it going to go well if it's the
only port on there you can't really go
anywhere can it now because this is an
in production you know switch and I
really don't want to jack too much with
it you need to set the flow point and in
this case my switch as port 48 as the
gigabit uplink to my juniper device and
that's where the juniper comes in coming
back I don't have a security zone or
anything like that but I can come over
here I can cut I can go to policies you
know I can set up different policies and
things like that and you know you could
set your policies you could set your
policy elements and things like that and
this is the reason that I needed vlans
now I could go through and I can you
know VLAN out untag I can segment and
things like that but that is a waste of
space on my juniper and you know on the
switch and things like that and it's a
most of the times you don't need that if
you have a device that you're going to
utilize layer 3 routing capabilities for
why not use it the dell switch does
layer 3 routing but it doesn't do
security like I granular security well
actually it does but not to the level
that I want to do it too because I need
to I need to VPN in and have customers
do this and that so I'm utilizing the
functions of them and juniper
you could 90s not say ninety percent of
you could get away with the routing IP
routing functions of the dell switch or
your cisco or brand of choice insert
name here it's just a matter of what you
actually need out of the switch whether
it be IP routing whether it be VLANs
whether it be power over ethernet these
are all things that you have to you know
kind of get a hold on before you
actually make these purchases and start
playing around remember don't use the
