raid0
building a time-lapse photography app
with the Q SDK and expanding your
storage with the Gmail Drive all that
more this time on hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by goto assist express support smarter
with go to assist Express domain.com got
a great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain comm and Nokia and the
calling all innovators contest hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen and this is your weekly dose of
Technol us we've got a great show for
you guys this week Shannon's gonna be
talking about some awesome Windows
software Jason's gonna be doing more
with the Q SDK and I'm having a little
fun with one of our favorite topics here
on the show and that is desktop
virtualization actually this one's more
like server virtualization it's gonna be
good stuff you know a little open sores
little servers some wine actually before
we even get any further we do have to
destroy this box because I'm repurposing
some hardware and as you guys know I've
recently made the switch over to Linux
over to the the good side and man I am
having a lot of fun over there and I've
got this old windows box and I'm like
what better way to to make it breathe
some new life than put some you know
open-source virtualization goodness on
it and I'll so let's first start by
blowing out the windows 7 install and
and that got me thinking we're actually
in the unique opportunity here where I
get to destroy some fun stuff software
wise cuz you know like like Patrick
Norton does it with a sledgehammer and I
figured maybe I just do it with a bsod I
know let me see if I've got this going
on right so you guys gonna check it out
I want you guys see this check this out
all right sweet so this right here is a
really nifty thing that I advise like
everybody go out and get one of these
they're so freakin sweet this is a it's
a three five and a quarter inch bays
that give you four three and a half inch
bays for hard drives and actually if you
look over here in Windows you can see
I've got a couple of hard drives going
on right well if I go ahead and just
like pull make this hard drive right
here because this is all SATA you know
it's hot-swap boom I just pull the hard
drive and it just disappears how awesome
is that so that got me thinking this is
actually in a raid zero configuration I
got to 500 gigabyte drives here that are
running this local disk here you can see
900
31 gigs total cuz yeah a thousand Meg's
is a gig not come on guys anyway so so I
was like dude my favorite command tree
if you haven't run free it is like the
best command in the world especially if
you're like at the office and you're
trying to make it look like you're
working but you're really not and you
need a whole bunch of cool fun stuff go
and buy on the screen just pull up a
prompt 'cd backslash to your route run
free and you have glorious glorious
pretty you know white text on a black
background hacker stuff going on all day
long or just ping google tack t yeah
anyway uh that all said I was like dude
what would happen if you were to like
just go ahead and pull half the raid you
know that's like a disaster scenario
that I've never like voluntarily gone
ahead and done because you know I've set
up raids earliest raid 1 or raid 5
systems in like systems administration
kind of scenarios where I'm like playing
some servers and stuff like that but
sometimes on my local desktop I just
like to run a raid 0 which is spanning
multiple drives for that added
performance to you know just go ahead
and you know get the best I can out of
my hardware and you know I've got a
backup scheme in place for all that but
but if if my entire system is span
between two drives if half the drive or
half the you know volume goes what's
gonna happen and well let's find out
because that's what we do on this show
we can I'm gonna go ahead and actually
buffer the command tree which I'll just
not gonna hit enter yet and I'll pull up
some Explorer action over here on the
right hopefully you guys will actually
be able to see this and yeah let's pull
drive system disk gone ok so half the
drive is gone look in the Windows
Explorer everything looks cool running
tree tree is not recognizable as an
internal external command operation
not happening all right start menu still
works all programs empty okay that's
that's Oh mass is not working anymore
well that's no fun is that it really is
that how it dies like how anticlimactic
climate there's a word for this
it's climactic not even a bsod man I was
like really hoping for more well if you
guys know of a fun awesome way to get a
BSOD on demand go ahead and hit up
feedback at hak5 org we will break out
the virtual sledgehammer if you will and
try it here on the show but I guess you
guys probably tuned in to see some
actual tech content not me just you know
having fun for shits and giggles with
windows box so let's go ahead and kick
it up the Shannon for some trivia and
get into the good stuff last week's
trivia question was certified by the
fair trade foundation this soft drink
shares its name with an African
philosophy an open-source operating
system and the answer is boo boo boo if

comm slash hak5
for a free trial you guys know me I'm
always looking for ways to find more
drive space because
well I'm always running out and I don't
have the money to buy tons of terabytes
there is this one thing that's been
around for quite a while but it's
currently being updated and they keep on
updating it and again and again
month after month so I did want to
mention it on the show this is called
Gmail Drive shell extension and you can
find it over at the Vic Swede DK slash a
gmail website and I wanted to give you a
brief overview and a short demo about
how it works so it's a shell namespace
extension it basically creates a virtual
file system around the gmail account
that you use and you can use it as a
storage medium you can save and retrieve
files that are stored on your gmail
account directly from inside Windows
Explorer so there's no actual need to go
online you can just pop up Windows
Explorer where you have your my computer
and there's tada a brand new gmail hard
drive that shows up on your computer it
adds this new drive under my computer
and you can create new folders you can
copy and drag and drop files just like
pretty much any other hard drive on your
machine you get tons of space in Gmail
and well myself I never use it all and
there's like six thousand and seven
thousand megabytes now and I never fill
it up so it's just kind of sitting there
available to me and well I we might as
well take it right it's free so what you
do you can copy files into Gmail and
then you can retrieve them again over
and over and when you create a new file
you using the Gmail Drive it generates
an email and then posts it into your
inbox with the file as an attachment so
it's kind of like just getting a regular
email the Gmail Drive is going to check
your account using the Gmail search
function to find any new files and then
it rebuilds the directory structures on
that it acts as this as if it's any
other hard drive and then it copies you
can copy files to and from it just like
normal so it's very very simple on the
website the Creator does mention and
makes it really easy if you create a
filter in your Gmail inbox to move all
of your files that start with the Gmail
FS in the subject which is what it's
going to say every time that it sends a
new file into your inbox
that way you won't have to look through
your inbox all the time if you have like
900 different new messages like Darren
does and you'll just have them right
there archived ready to go you know no
looking around or wasting time trying to
find them it's an experimental tool so
you may want to remember that the file
name has to be under 65 characters and
if gmail chooses to block the tool at
any time it may not keep on working any
changes made by G made by Google to
Gmail may also affect the functionality
of this tool so at any time it may quit
working but luckily the creators of this
tool they keep on updating it so they
try to make it keep on working for us
the users so here's my short demo once
you have it downloaded it's very simple
to use you just open up your zip file
and you read the quick little setup
guide it just tells you okay it's been
installed go ahead and open up my
computer and go to your Gmail Drive so I
open up my computer and I log in to you
my gmail under the Gmail Drive ok hack 5
test account so I'm not gonna have like
anything in my inbox ok so I log into
that and it's gonna take a few moments
to log me in alright but once it's
logged in first thing you're gonna see
is just this blank folder just like any
other my computer folder where you don't
have any files in it
so now I can just take this and drag and
drop any files into it so I'm gonna drag
this logo into there and it's copying
and it's still copying it takes a while
ok so once it's done copying and again
it it takes a few seconds so you know
just I don't know go grab some Yingling
or whatever you need to do you can go
into your gmail account on the other end
so I'll open up my gmail account right
here ok and I see this that the file has
been saved into my inbox
so easy okay so there's a few pros and
cons about this program that I've just
demoed so the pros it's free storage I
mean who doesn't like free storage it's
awesome and it's super easy to use and
it works with pretty much any Windows
machine as long as you can get into your
Windows Explorer the cons it takes
forever to copy any files and to log you
in so if you're the only person using
your machine and might as well just make
it auto log-in it'll save you a little
bit of time and it can easily break if
Google does any kind of updates to Gmail
so what are your thoughts on this or do
you have any other free storage spaces I
like those email me over at feedback at
hack 5 org and we'll be right back after
a brief word from our sponsor hey buddy
why the long face my friend Frank from
the Eagle darkness
wait there's an evil dark net I don't
know what we're getting for the holidays
I am realize you celebrated oh who is he
evil Frank hmm Frank evil Frank he's an
exchange live o server for a month Aereo
but dear God that does sound evil well
have you thought about getting him a
domain name like evil Frank calm yeah
yeah I did it for my sister last year
and she loved it you gotta get your name
before it's taken man and dude you are
in luck you can get a dot-com for less
than 10 bucks a year you got a
domain.com and check out with the coupon
code hak5 I do yeah that's the perfect
gift for those who have everything
everything but domain name well yeah I
guess get 15% off two main names Virtual
Private servers and hosting or even a
new dummy domain and enjoy domain coms
blistering fast DNS and hosting
infrastructure simply check out with
coupon code hak5 got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain
domain.com want a chance to win a new
phone how about a quarter-million
dollars naki and 18t have launched the
ten million dollars calling all
innovators in North America contest
challenging app developers and game
developers to create the next level of
apps for consumers in the US and Canada
for the Nokia n8 and ovie store using
the new Nokia cute SD
hey the contest will have two phases and
winners will be selected by a
performance in the August or by a panel
of judges winners will receive naki
devices cash prizes up to a
quarter-million dollars and even
potentially inclusion in a 1.9 million
dollar marketing campaign for their app
so over the next few weeks we're going
to be doing a rundown of how to get
started using the nokia q SDK the ins
and outs if you will with our old friend
Jason Applebaum and this week it's a
little bit more on building our
time-lapse camera application last week
we covered the base elements of how to
get started you know how to create your
first kind of application with minimal
functionality but kind of get started
with the cue creator and this week we're
gonna dive a little bit further with the
time-lapse camera application so let's
get started but the first thing we're
going to do is we're gonna I need to
upgrade our cute mobility SDK because
we're currently running on 1.0 0.2 and
the the stuff we were looking for the
camera API is in the beta version in one
point 1.0 it's a really simple to
upgrade head on over to QT QT nokia comm
slash product slash cutes slash add-on
slash mobility and download the cute
mobility open-source 1.0
zip once that's downloaded I went ahead
and unzipped it to its own folder cute
mobility so once it's once all unpacked
to the Q ability we're looking for a zip
file in the zip file zip file we're
looking for because we're dealing with
the Nokia and eight it's you know right
here it's cute
mobility Symbian open-source one point
one point zero based slash beta slash
epic slash Symbian three okay
that was a mouthful inside of that zip
file is the app hoc 32 folder that is
what we're going to need in order to
upgrade the base nokia sdk if you
installed the cue creator just as a
standard install the SDK is located over
at Nokia cute STK a Symbian SDK
there's that Pok 32 folder we need to
flip for the one in the zip file and the
mobility 1.1 beta pack okay now that
that's done head on to the makes back or
Mk spec and then over into features and
here you're gonna find the template or
the mobility dot PRF the mobility
preferences and we're going to need to
get the mobility preferences from the
pack and pull it into this it's under
here it's other features and then it's
right here
mobility dot PRF dot template go ahead
and drop the dot template replace the
one in the Nakia SDK and you could back
it up switch it to a dot back once
that's done you're good to go let's go
ahead and open up the cue creator and
get started on our project so we're back
in the UI we're gonna need to add a
couple things we're going to need that
if you find her for a camera and a big
old start button to get the sucker
started so I just went ahead and dropped
a button in called the start excellent a
hit point and then I added the
viewfinder z finders in a vertical
layout next to everything because the
way this is gonna work is you're gonna
hit the start button then it's gonna
open the camera view it's just because
it's in beta or it's just because the
mobility kit is in beta I should say so
once you've got that let's go ahead and
jump on over to the header file we need
to go ahead and include some things
camera dot H or Q camera H for our
camera and Q timer you can relate
the timer then what we're going to need
to do is go ahead and create a variable
for the camera cue camera camera and
then cue timer two cameras what's going
to keep your cue timers what's going to
keep track of where we currently are and
how often it's going to take the picture
then we're going to need to add two
slots start camera take picture start
camera F is for the button and take
picture is for when the timer elapses so
let's go ahead into main window dot cpp
in main window dot cpp what we're gonna
need to do is we're going to need to
first define the timer so timer equals
new cue timer this passing the parent
passing the parent object then what
we're going to need to do is we're going
to need to connect the signals and slots
so for the start button connect UI to
grab items off of our UI start button
the signal it's on click and the slot is
start camera then what we're going to
need to do is connect the timer and the
take picture so connect timer signal
it's time to out and then slot take the
picture so let's go ahead and look at
the camera camera equals new cue camera
and then camera device camera device is
just the first device or first camera I
find on the device and I get that by
it's a cube I'd array camera device and
then I am looping through the available
devices on the camera on the phone
itself then once I find the first one
I'm gonna grab that after you initialize
the camera you're gonna go ahead and set
the capture mode to still images once
that's done let's go ahead and take a
look down here at start camera what the
big button does so start camera all it's
going to do is it's going to turn take
the view from the camera and put it on
our view our view on our viewfinder from
the UI then it's going to start the
camera so it's gonna start the whole
process then it's going to start the
timer number of seconds times a thousand
that's important because the number of
seconds is measured in milliseconds here
not actual seconds so the thousand will
get you
milliseconds so let's take a look at the
last little thing here take picture take
pictures really simple all mooing is
calling search lock on the camera that's
the same thing as if you just hold down
the camera half camera button half way
and it just kind of autofocuses the
logic for actually capturing the image
isn't in here but it's pretty simple to
implement and it's over at the Nokia
forums so then once that's done all we
have to do is start the timer in the
process all over again so let's go ahead
and think the the green button and let's
go and take a look at it on the phone so
there you have it it's on the phone go
ahead and hit start and it opens up the
camera that's easy just go ahead and
starts the entire process and takes the
picture and does it over and over and
over again time-lapse camera so if you
have any questions on this segment email
me Jason at hack 5 dot org or if you
have any questions on cute or the cue
creator or anything involving you know
that world head on over to the Nokia
forms forms Nokia com
the Nokia Q SDK brings the popular q
creator IDE from the desktop and
embedded worlds to the mobile developers
so they can build native apps for the
Symbian 3 devices like the Nokia n8 now
developers can submit their apps by
January 20th to be involved and we just
want to thank Nokia for sponsoring
today's show clean water is one of the
scarcest resources in the world
I for one take clean water for granted
every day we needed to survive and yet
nearly a billion people just don't have
access to it we want to get involved so
we're partnering with charity water to
help make a difference charity water is
an organization that donates 100% yes a
hundred percent of the money it raises
to building wells and bringing clean
water to communities in need they're
leveraging technology in really creative
ways to mobilize people around the cause
and we want to get you guys our viewers
involved each show on revision3 is
reaching out to our viewers to raise
money to build wells it takes $5,000 to
build a well that can provide clean
water to an entire village so we need
your help to make a difference go over
to revision3.com / charity water to
learn more and get involved
the cause and I wanted to think of
couple of our most recent donators

it did so absolutely and say dude look
at that that is like the hugest dust
bunny I have ever seen you know me
