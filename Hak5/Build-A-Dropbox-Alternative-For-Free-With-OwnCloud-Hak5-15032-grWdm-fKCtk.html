by goto assist so this week I decided to
check out own cloud so this thing is a
Dropbox alternative that's basically
open source and it's available for
multiple platforms including Linux so I
figured why not I mean I really like
open source cloud platforms especially
on cloud I've heard a lot of great
things about it but I've also run into a
little bit of trouble installing it so I
figured I'm gonna do a whole segment
about how to set it up on your Ubuntu
server 12.04 so today I'm installing on
clouds
setting it up on Linux Ubuntu 1204
server inside a VirtualBox on my Windows
7 machine if that's not confusing enough
well we'll get a little bit further into
it there are steps online but they go
they're a little bit outdated so I
wanted to go ahead and start by going
over to this website called software
open SUSE org now over here you're going
to find directions for downloading own
cloud you just click on the operating
system that you want to use and then you
scroll down to the server version that
you're using as well so for me I'm using
Ubuntu 12.04 server so I just had to
follow these simple directions now I did
find some other directions online these
ended up being completely out of date
they were for the old version of own
cloud they don't work anymore the links
are completely broken so these ones are
definitely the ones that you want to
check out if you want to install this on
your own server now I went ahead and
installed everything and it's very quick
it takes about ten minutes to do the
entire installation and I had this
running on my server so I'm going to go
ahead and login
all right so I got my server running and
after you have this installed you can
also run ifconfig to figure out what
your IP address is now this is the
server IP address is also the IP address
for your own cloud so it'll be for me
it's 10.7 3/3 1.1 20 slash own cloud now
when I first went over here I ran into
this problem where it says PHP module'
GD is not installed now I did check
I made sure that GD was installed PHP GD
so I knew it was there and for some
reason it just wasn't working correctly
so I figured okay well maybe I just need
to reboot it so I'm going to go ahead
and close this down and I will open up
another screenshot that I took so these
actually came in really handy when I was
doing the segment earlier because I was
able to just take a couple of
screenshots in VirtualBox and go back to
them as needed for my segment very easy
and simple so after the installation and
reboot I'm going to go ahead and run
this
have to login again now once I'm already
in my uber new server I can go over here
and I should be able to just refresh and
go back to the same site again and not
have that problem anymore so it turns
out it just needed a quick restart it
wasn't anything complicated at all
now it wants you to create an admin
account if you haven't already so I
already created mine
okay so I'm all logged in and this
should open up the own cloud GUI right
inside of my browser now you're going to
create an admin account if you haven't
already and you should be all set so you
can log into your account download the
desktop or the mobile phone app although
the iPhone one it seems to be about 99
cents or a dollar 99 depending on when
you get it and you can go ahead and
start uploading things and be able to
access them from any of your computers
the nice thing about this is it also
comes with a online desktop version as
well so I downloaded that one as well
so I've already gone ahead and set up
this own cloud directory on my Windows
machine so I can easily access all of my
files through the cloud once you have
that all set up you can go ahead and
close out it there and you should be
able to access some of your files in
here so you have your files you can
access music and actually play straight
through on cloud it does pretty well as
far as streaming goes so it's not too
bad it's kind of like using google music
if you've ever used that you also have
the ability to add contacts which is
something a little bit different it's
kind of an add-on with a VCF file the
calendar is pretty cool so I have
calendars in several different places I
find the the fact that they have a
calendar add-on very nice so I can just
actually sync everything through here I
don't have to worry about what device
I'm using or what synched account I'm
using if it's Google or Apple calendar
what-have-you and then you have pictures
which is going to give you a little
layout of all the different photo files
that you've downloaded this will also
give you a nice little slideshow as well
and you have a couple of extra little
things that you can do little settings
you can go into your admin account you
can install apps if you want to have it
sync with Dropbox for example and you
can add users and change your personal
information as well so far I haven't had
any problems with own cloud I've really
enjoyed it it's very easy to use and
it's fast especially on this machine
with this VM so I haven't minded I
didn't mind it at all I did hear that
there are a couple of little little
problems with it some
bugs that you might run into so if you
do run into those bugs let me know about
them because I would personally like to
check them out myself and see if there's
a way to fix them
also you can always email me feedback at
hak5 org with your own choices for an
open-source cloud platform if there is
any other one out there let me know
again that's feedback at hak5 org and
I'll be right back after a quick break
