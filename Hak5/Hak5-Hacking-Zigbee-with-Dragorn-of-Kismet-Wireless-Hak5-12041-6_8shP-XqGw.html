assist
so white like hizmet like isn't it like
the entire project yeah yeah like I mean
you know it's been going on for forever
and it's like the de facto standard like
what yeah and and it was Nets tumblr
even around there was Nets tumblr there
is nothing for Linux yeah there was air
snort yeah vaguely the precursor to air
snort I think the project name has been
taken over again by me the precursor to
air snort back when the shmoo guys did
it when they first started doing it and
I picked that up and I started looking
at the packet dumps and I got to put the
SSID on the screen and said that's great
and I sent it to them and they said
we're not really maintaining the project
anymore you're like cool now I am no no
it wasn't I
mostly forked off from Air sort and then
I got a Cisco card and the Cisco cards
didn't work the same way as the prism
two because the prism - then Usenet link
right not standard packets yeah back
then everybody was like Orinoco that's
the only way to go yeah I think Orinoco
I don't remember ever having an Orinoco
at that point I think I got one a couple
years later yeah at the point I was like
the equivalence of having like an
atheros or something you know yeah um so
the Cisco worked differently so then I
had to make code that worked with both
of them so I figure well if I'm gonna do
it once I'll do it for modular yeah and
slap the UI on it and then that was that
yeah it was it curses to begin with it
was always curses yeah
and it still is cuz I hate all the GUI
frameworks I know right I'm actually
wondering why there hasn't been like it
has there been a GUI front-end that I
just haven't seen in a bunch and none of
them really took off mmm there's the
there are a bunch where linked off the
links page on kismet now
on the website there were there's a
cutie 1 I think there's none to ggk ones
and I've actually been talking with
someone now about what might be the most
interesting path to take which would be
WebSockets and JavaScript oh just do
everything in the browser
that's hot in fact considering there's
like a client and a server in the whole
architecture of kismet you could like
have one remote and just fact at that
point ooh dude chrome on your on your
Android phone yeah yeah that was pretty
much a major driving factor of that was
being able to do mobile display and then
with the hacking I've been trying to do
to get kismet running native on Android
oh so you're actually doing a native
Android like like host mode USB plug in
the card or is this like just Wi-Fi it
to your laptop or bluetooth it to your
laptop and do everything there this was
so you can if you're slightly crazy get
the kernel drivers running in host mode
in Java on Android and the android
framework without rooting the phone so
is it like most of those Android hacks
where it's like ok so stand this way and
then point your elbow towards the moon
that's why it's not released yet yeah
because right now Galaxy Nexus alpha the
original alpha yeah the real tech oh the
11b so oh I thought the 81 87 was gee
yeah the real tech aid 187 yeah that
one's pretty good huh and so any any
plans for that once it's more stable it
was the first Android program I'd pretty
much written I love this the first
Android program you have a right and
it's kismet you know working in host
mode with an awesome chipset you're your
first PCB you know does wicked man in
the middle attacks like have you ever
sucked at anything if you look at what
I've written on Android for kismet it
sucks oh yes but conceptually what
really happened with it like I'm
wondering if there was like just like a
little drag warn one day that wrote
hello world or was it all like native
assembly
you know bootstrappers first line and
you know first a first program
uh my first computer was a TI 99 plug
into the TV one of those old ones
right after TI stopped making them I was
about to say you don't look that old
no no this was after TI stopped
manufacturing those computers so it was
here's a magazine with basic if you want
to do something this is this is the only
thing that you know I believe in that
truly you know my mom couldn't afford to
get me a 486 so I ended up with a PC XT
you know 512 K of RAM and again like dos
3:3 you want to play a game right in
basic that's the way to do it yeah yeah
so yeah that kind of bootstrap things
that's awesome so just because air snort
or not Eric yeah air start wasn't
maintaining anymore you're just like
okay but why kismet why why the name
kismet I'm sure you've been asked that a
million times but what does that mean
the story is not that good I pretty much
took Stumbler from that summer because I
wanted some correlation because they did
similar things plugged it into like
dictionary calm and just kept hitting
synonyms and after like 15 clicks of
random synonym things it wasn't I don't
even remember what the chain was it hit
kismet and I did a quick look online
there were no other projects named that
and I went okay good enough I love that
in fact now I want to like take
Shakespeare and take every single word
and run it through 15 iterations of
dictionary.com huh okay so there's was a
what was it what massive rewriter just
massive architect who's changed just
recently with kismet tell me something
about that so there's been this is now
the third major architecture change the
first one was was about five six years
ago making everything more modular
making plugins happen making the UI much
friendlier so you don't have to remember
you know magic keys I thought that was
what allowed us to do things like the
uber tooth one plug into kismet because
there was that module system in there
and so now what's the focus now the
focus is to make kismet not 802 11
focused and
it'll be any anything that can generate
consistent packets you can identify well
we'll integrate so give me some possible
scenarios some examples of something
that kismet might be able to decode and
capture and everything so a key a big
push on that was the uber tooth where
with the current framework that's that
that's in the release code a plug-in for
a different Phi a different physical
layer could do like the deck stuff or
the uber tooth or whatnot has to
implement their own GPS handling they
have to blink their own XML files they
have to implement GUI plugins to display
the list of networks independent of the
list of 802 11 network so if you're
running like three different types of
cards you end up with very little screen
real estate left so with the new
architecture you pretty much go
I handle Bluetooth define a physical
layer for it I want it in a pcap file
and that happens automatically and you
fill in the basic information that you
can and that goes in the XML file and
then you can actually do XML namespace
expansion and have basically XML plugins
in the capture file so you have a fully
schema XML definition of arbitrary file
layer captures and so given that what
with different physical layers and what
different like protocols and frequencies
and stuff have you seen actually
implemented now with this well it's
still haven't had a full release of it
yet so but right now uber tooth there's
a plugin for that that works with the
new file layer already I'm working on
the ZigBee plugin now I should hopefully
have time to go back and update the deck
to plug-in to work with it I was looking
at Travis good speeds keyboard detection
code Wow now is that like 25 megahertz
or 900 or what what is that
I forget what oh no I know what it is
it's the one I'm thinking of it's it's
the 2.4 in Nordic RF oh that is so cool
and so since you just you you understand
the particle NIT it's challenging enough
