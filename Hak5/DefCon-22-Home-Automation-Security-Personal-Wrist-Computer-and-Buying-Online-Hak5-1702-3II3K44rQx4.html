by domain.com hello welcome to AK 5 my
name is Jared kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us
welcome to the last episode all about
DEFCON wait a second it's also the first
episode all about season 17 what no way
I know
season 17 in hex wait so we knew 26
episodes per season
oh yeah that's for a TV show nerd don't
ask yeah I know right
yesterday yes last week with the first
episode we just realized yes it was so
welcome to season 17 this week we have
some pretty interesting stuff having to
do with this oh yeah that is possible
you have use the magic powers I didn't
write this on the plane with me
what is it looks kind of like oh no
you're allowed to bring light bows just
hanging freely just just dangle in there
I don't think they would like that but
this is really cool we have a Missy 801
are awesome and they put together some
fantastic geekery that you guys are
going to love and some super cool
automation home automation hacks that
you can apparently do and I also talked
to a guy about buying stuff online
anonymously so Oh fun
yeah let's cut right to it so I'm here
with Chris little Barry from knowledge
consulting group and he's been having a
lot of fun with home automation I love
home automation I've been really getting
into things like the color light bulbs
and the automated
so I really wanted to find out from you
is that are these kind of things
vulnerable and if so is there any way to
defend against them so they are so a lot
of them they a lot of like the newer
light bulbs I don't have they have a
developed lot of security and yet
yeah they promise that with like the
newer farmers and whatnot but still
there's a lot of there's a lot of hacks
out there for the Belkin Wemo does
actually have some really bad ones yeah
so it's it's best to walk all ipv6
getting out from your router and yeah
trying to walk down your network the
best as possible so if I if I have these
colored light bulbs in my household
which I do
and they're you know they're wireless
and Wi-Fi enabled how do I protect
myself from somebody getting in and
getting my things
is it ipv6 the best thing to do is
protect your network first that's you
know first and foremost so you know use
strong courage and use a crazy long
passphrase and
disable WPS now what about with you know
the the white fight locks the ones that
you can put on your front door and your
garage so those are bad there oh you
really want one of these I was actually
had a guy who'd like come and try to
sell me one here the other day like just
door-to-door he's like we're doing your
neighbors and we want to you know let's
put one in for you and I was like let me
tell you why that's a bad idea
so last year at blackhat they had
somebody came and actually did a demo
where they did a replay attack against
it and you don't have to break the
encryption you just do a replay attack
oh my god that's horrible
yeah it's terrible so and and people
were you know doing these all over the
place
it's you know they can show your friends
hey you know check out my phone I can
see you know picture my front door and
watch I can unlock that lock it so bad
okay so don't buy one of those no I'm ok
with the lights but I actually came up
with a system where it's it doesn't
prevent that attack but it'll detect
that attack so it's purely RF base so
they can't bro you jams and so dude I
love RF yeah that's awesome so it it
uses a Doppler system to determine if
something is it's outside you know
outside of the house and then
how long it's being transmitted for in
that sort of thing then everything else
is on the wire so then it can trip the
regular part your support system there
for your security system just happens to
be set up they don't take it from there
oh that's fun stuff now how am I gonna
protect myself physically from anything
in my house so anybody getting in yeah
you can do low-tech stuff like you know
leave the lights on and little different
times of day part of the talk is I came
up with like a smart timer system that
pulls down sunrise and sunset times from
Weather Underground API oh yeah then
blocks off a randomization window around
those and then certain things happen
kind of in certain times in there but
it's different every day and then
there's there's other random things
where like maybe one day this light will
turn on for a while or you know maybe
that's where I think so it's always
changing what tech are you so I'm using
lifx bulbs I'm using fill to you and
then using unfortunately the the window
systems as well because with the Wemo
switches you can actually hook it up so
you can turn on and off your exterior
lights and stuff come on somewhere
around the sunset have them turned off
somewhere
I felt so awesome I can't wait to do
this in my household
now you are slow mentioned in your talk
some information about Raspberry Pi is
about soldering fun times
yes so the whole system I'm doing it
uses three pi so far by three five three
five four the main one I have runs a
difference of front-end so it's just a
flat front end and then a couple
services I wrote for the different light
bulbs and then the way most is own and
then I have another one running a
database server and then another one
doing some voice recognition in my
living room that's kind of a work in
progress but but that's lucky enough my
place has Ethernet everywhere so
everything's hardwired that we're done
yeah it's fantastic no wiring needed
yeah so that's it's been really fun so
how do you make this okay you mentioned
something about like making fireworks
yes so part of the thing is I want to be
able to do some sort of like physical
defense so somebody actually does break
in something to just either scare
somebody off just have it set it apart
other than just you know an alarm going
off and then you know gee we need to
just smash them grabbing so so yeah I
have so like one of the PI's has a 12
volts like a door popper for cars and so
I have one of those set up so that it'll
knock over an air tank upstairs so like
as soon as something goes off like
there'd be a thud upstairs and then I
have another one where I got a good good
buddy of mine that's big into model
rocketry and so they yeah so they have
the way that they ignite those is that
they have like these long you know
partly to go to them and then these
holes strips of wires with like a little
thin piece of wire and then like some
sparkler material on the end of it did
you have to solder all this stuff
together yeah yeah he actually makes him
fight like the dozens like he'll just
make a big batch and so he gave me a
couple
you take one of those and you tape it up
to set of like black cats so just some
fireworks and put them in something
that's hopefully not flammable so you
have your pyre then just pull up in high
on the pie then have that the MOSFETs
connected like you know a little 12 volt
battery somewhere and it'll crank it off
and suddenly you have really loud
fireworks inside your house like home
alone so have you run into any kind of
problems when you were setting up all
this stuff yeah I'm a terrible coder so
yeah yeah hey we're learning any my
friends would see this they're gonna be
sitting at home going he's terrible but
so yeah there's been a bunch of
debugging and it's you know I'm using a
couple different texts just bring you
kind of everything under one roof is a
little challenging but I mean using it
all on the PI's has been fantastic a
Python everywhere for the most part and
kind of a pain in the butt to code
Python like it's I got a buddy mind this
huge in a ruby and and one of the one of
the services that wrote the api's in
Ruby so I had a right one to service
it's brilliant which but everything else
is in Python it is just fantastic and
you know the pies
that have drying power like it's nothing
so the whole system y'all have three
pies and I mean you can really you could
scale it down to just one but I mean
it's it's not drawing any power it stays
up all the time and just it's a very
robust system for next to nothing
well where can i our viewers find out
more about this um so I'm not really
active on Twitter but I guess I should
be my Twitter handle is a lowercase B or
one word be just like the number B so
underscore no nothing just lowercase B
and I've also I'm gonna have mostly code
over it and it's gonna be pushed up
together so this marking system and a
bunch of other stuff talk to be able
source yeah great thank you so much and
I don't fit your memory it doesn't
matter if you're a fan of free candy
door open sky or petrol or logic lang
para tour if the open source encryption
software has been made by the government
the whole time your fob bus gated or a
frame or if a packet hits a pocket on a
socket on a port or free mustaches if
you have a conspiracy theory getting to
snag a domain name and web hosting fast
boom up the rank you need a website a
website needs a domain and you can get
those over at dome dome domain.com
then get this domain outcome they get a
very quick domain discovery system and a
very easy checkout process you know what
that means boom up and ring I don't know
where this is going to do you know the
first female pilots we called aviatrix
whoa the guys over at domain.com
Japan's a hack five and I've told you
time and time again guys domain.com is
awesome because they're affordable
reliable they're easy to use they're
super fun but mainly because they're a
fun place to do business they're active
on social media you can tweet them at
domain.com and see why it's just the fun
guys
boom up the rank there's so much fun to
do business with that these guys are
zany these guys are fun and crazy and
they love hack five and the one to hook
you up so that's why they came out with
very easy to remember coupon code for
hack five viewers like you
it's called hak5 and it spells hack five
and with it with it at domain.com
checkout you get an extra 15% off whoa
when you think domain names think
domain.com that is that right there yeah
see bear agrees it is now time for the
trivia question of the week last week's
trivia question was what object takes
the longest orbital path around the Sun
in our solar system and the answer is
setna which is basically a mini planet
kind of like Pluto so it takes a basic
rotation of about 12050 earth years now
this week's trivia question is which
scientists notebook is still too
radioactive to handle that's crazy you
can answer that question over at hak5
org slash trivia for your chance to win
some awesome hack fudge egg
you kaya's welcome to the free candy van
thank you awesome
DC 801 is doing some ridiculous awesome
stuff here at Def Con leaving what it is
so this is our DC 801 party badge the
badge that gets you into our party or a
guaranteed spot in our party and it's
also to help fund the party okay so what
is what is so people that aren't
familiar with Def Con where this is kind
of a tradition right you need to know it
you you know you guys being a DC group
right hey don't ones out of forget the
NPI where is that it's uh Salt Lake City
Salt Lake City so you guys you want to
have an awesome party in the hotel or
off site and so to make it special
instead of just happen like a challenge
coin or something hooking what is this
like a a pip-boy I've heard I've just to
wear this on my wrist and now I can just
like you know I feel like I don't know
something from one of those new hacking
uh video games but you walk around with
your iPhone stealing money out of
people's ATMs yeah yeah yeah it's funny
that you mentioned the pip-boy because
that was actually part of our
inspiration we're thinking of ideas to
come with it to create this I mean our
first our first official Def Con party
was last year and we we made another
badge that that was just standard kind
of DEFCON style on your badge and we
want to do something different this year
yeah different than anything else that
we've seen and that we've heard done so
we figured something cool retro with a
VFD you know strapped to your wrist that
boy style would actually be I mean no we
haven't seen a wearable and everyone
loves a strap on so you can tell me
about the VFD what you think what is
that that cuz it's a really unique
display mm-hmm so I mean for those I
mean VFDs are basically the next version
of the Nixie tube and and this one is a
I can't remember the model number but
it's a nutty talk a they're Japanese
company and they still make them
it's a sixteen by two character display
okay and I mean it's they're super
popular on all the old VCRs and stuff
they're military military great hardware
so I mean this is just fancy it's like a
vacuum tube really because I've heard
these are slightly fragile yeah you
don't want to drop them NOLA
they can break for fairly easily okay so
the rest of this is like we've got like
leather straps here we've got like a
little lipo pack in a 3d printed case
what's the board on here what's the
processor and stuff here so the case
actually is in 3d printed first it's
just machined HDPE we have a bud that
has a CNC router and so and so we get
some stayed up yeah he stayed up till I
don't know five in the morning machining
those the day before we flew out the
black hat so this is what I love hearing
about these things because it makes me
actually in a weird way feel not so bad
like cramming to get everything done
before Def Con and it's totally the
hacker way yeah when did you guys
assemble these how did you guys assemble
these a couple of us did all the mains
the main large through pin hole
components ah during the day before we
flew out to blackhat the machining for
the the case and the laser-cut things
were also done the day before Def Con
our black hat also we we thought we had
learned from last year same last minute
stuff last year but we didn't so still
last minute this year we like to call it
the curse of the transistor our local
hackerspace
sure we always end up doing everything
last-minute everything from our free
classes just like yeah it's just like oh
no we got to get this done and so the
code on here because this is running a
an ARM processor mm-hmm and and so what
what can I run on here like what are the
capabilities of the hardware
we've got USB here is that yeah it's so
I'm not the most familiar with the
hardware that goes that's our our
homeboy divino the guy that designed it
he doesn't for work and he did us a big
favor and design this for free and then
our other but decaf he's the main guy
that does all the programming for it
they're both not here at Def Con right
now but yeah it's a 32-bit ARM
microprocessor just like you said we
were originally going to go with an STM
based arm microprocessor but last minute
we changed for this one primarily
because it has a hardware bootloader on
it so
it's impossible to brick it without
actually destroying the chip so you just
plug it into your computer you hold down
the middle the middle button and then
reset it and it boots up and shows up on
your computer as a hardware mass storage
device
hopefully just dragons brother the
firmware right there like that and then
if you want to you can just copy the
form or back off that way too so we did
we did that because we figured it'd be
the easiest way to support the hardware
in the long long run to actually we
designed the badge we want it to be
different in the sense that you could
use it after the comm for you know real
life everyday stuff so that we went with
that route for the for the chip just so
that people can flash it easier I love
that and when you're here at the con I
mean that just does make it so much
easier I can I just I love this as a
piece as a you know a keepsake of the
con this is something of beauty and you
should be really proud of it this is
just one of those awesome things that
I'd love to highlight here that makes
Def Con unique so you kaya and also to
decaf and divino and the transistor
hackerspace out of Salt Lake City and DC
801 thank you guys for just keeping Def
Con awesome with this yeah no thank you
it's there all the other people that
support us to make it so that we can
actually do our our crazy
hacker dreams and make it make it a
party for everybody else so so everybody
can check it out at github calm slash
the transistor right yep that's where
all the code is posted and then if you
want to do it yeah if you want to
support the the transistor DC 801 and
then DC 801 labs which is the hacker
space the 801 works out
there's just the transistor calm and
then 801 lab stop I think it's not org
or comm I can't remember but we will be
doing four we're planning on doing
another badge next I can't wait for next
year you get a pull at this one and then
and then we also do t-shirts every year
too so if you don't want to do badge you
can always do a t-shirt well thank you
so much for sharing this with us thank
you
alright Cheers
you know it's really fun what whenever
you order things online and then people
find out that you order things online no
it sure you know no I like things like
tour
I love tour so this is meta cortex and
he is from DC 801 you gave a talk in the
101 track yes love it so all about how
to order things online how to behave
self secure yep how do you use tour and
things of that nature and your big
points yes bitcoins give me give me the
one-on-one
yeah 101 all right so basically we start
with tour itself you've stayed totally
anonymous theoretically totally
anonymous free software download anybody
can get it yep yep you can run it on
Linux OSX windows all of that supported
and it connects you to the Tor network
that bounces you around through a series
of ton of anonymization series of tubes
yes exactly she's got it everybody it
makes you theoretically totally
anonymous
barring any o days but then as soon as I
get on there and I order something from
some like nondescript website with my
credit card they know who I am you don't
order it with your credit card so what
do I do you order it with Bitcoin
we love Bitcoin so what are bitcoins
bitcoins are the internet cryptocurrency
of our generation how do I use you mind
them or you can pay normal money to get
Bitcoin money but they're crazy
expensive crazy expensive well then get
crazy expensive money to buy mining
equipment so it would probably end up
paying you out more if you just mind
your own
depending on the hardware yeah actually
lots and lots of those so many
processing cycles
well can I is Bitcoin my only option or
can I use other cryptocurrencies not a
whole lot people have standardized on
bitcoins where it's across the board
that one's the most readily available
sites to accept exactly
not many people accept those coin or
even def coin okay but it's mainly a
Bitcoin so moving on from tour in
Bitcoin are there any other like totally
anonymized software options that I have
available to me is poor ordering online
um you can use ITP not a whole lot of
people actually use i2 p i2 p is another
i don't want to say it or knockoff but
it's another way to do tor does it work
it works a little differently like tour
where is everybody a part of the network
are actually forwarding notes and so it
just dynamically routes through
everybody a part of the network okay it
causes a lot of issues like as soon as
you close out you need to gracefully
shut it down or else you kick a whole
bunch of people off the network and they
all timeout it's just like use abilities
yeah he's a great trolling attempt
connect multiple times and drop i love
it i love it so i know that you also
gave some information in your talk
that's a little bit less tech advice but
more so just
logistical obvious advice yeah of course
what kind of information that you can
give so if you were to buy something
potentially malicious or questionable
don't send it to your house oh yeah yeah
yeah same goes for y'all out there if
you're doing online shows and you want
to have a wedding and do it to appeal
nuts or a fake address exactly so some
of the things we covered is like if you
were to go and get a peel box you have
to give your real information and your
real stuff so one of the techniques that
we like to use is you do that go on a
tour buy a fake ID burn the box and then
get a new one at a different location
with that fake ID oh wow and then you
can actually send stuff to that new box
under the assumed identity this is a lot
of fun there's a lot of spy craft in
this talk kind of stuff okay is there
anything else that I should know when
I'm ordering strange things on tour some
of the big things is once you get the
package don't just like open up your box
at the PIO box and open it right away oh
you're the plain view of everybody that
can see you
security cameras incriminating evidence
go home and open it you close the
windows another good thing you can do is
if somebody thinks that you're going to
receive something potentially causing
issues walk up to the peal box open it
see if it's there close it and walk away
verify that it is actually there and
present so anybody's staking out the
location do you you're not walking out
with anything
and then after come back a week two
weeks later because no one's gonna sit
around for two weeks and then you're
free and clear that's very sweet
yeah that was only my next question was
okay I'm a person yeah walk into the PA
box please exactly
that's video useful information of
course we are telling anybody to buy
illegal no do not buy illegal things
depending on your government regulation
oh good point some things here are
illegal where they may not be in other
countries that's true so great well
thank you so much for letting me know
they'll be interesting doubles no
problem I love it I can't wait to go
shopping yeah me either
medic or Tex that was great to speak
with you anyway the rest of your DEFCON
and let us know if you need we will do
where can people contact you if they
want more at meta cortex on Twitter on
Twitter excellent awesome thank you that
just about wraps up this week's episode
of hack 5 of course this is where we
will have fancy announcements for when
we are ready to announce them at the end
of the show which is a fun place to put
those but we don't have those quite yet
so stay tuned for when they are
announced but until then we would like
to remind you that like $5 were such
fellows where you can follow the social
media and you can look at a cheeky shop
comm to buy all the cool things yeah and
you can support us directly with that
and we absolutely appreciate all of that
because it makes the thing go and email
us feedback at hak5 org because we we
read those sometimes now we read those
always we just don't reply to every
single one it's like open gmail JJ JJ JJ
JJ by the way gmail shortcuts a question
mark with all of that said i'm darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
trust your technological
Twiggy this way a quick thank you guys
for make - but the thing we're let's try
that again sorry wait wait wait I'm even
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
