by go to assist you're like me the whole
idea of cutting things and printing
things with any sort of CNC just tickles
your techno lost and I got really
excited watching Shannon's segment from
the other week about the Printrbot I
noticed you had a couple of issues so
Shannon help me out here cuz I really
want to get involved this I literally
just plop this on your desk now we're
printing sharks Eve how did we get to
there to here I had to build it I had to
put it together figure out how the
software works and then hopefully get
all the calibration work at working and
make it actually print this like this is
a great real world scenario of somebody
who like going from I know nothing about
3d printers to Hey look I have exactly I
knew absolutely nothing like three weeks
ago and ever since we got this thing
I've just been delving into it and I've
learned so much from just from reading
the forums and you know figuring out the
answers to all these different problems
and because you know printers in general
all the 3d printers that are available
today you have to build them from
scratch and each one has different
calibration issues and you know there
might be a couple of different bolts and
nuts other than what they have included
a normal group you don't get pretty
built ones are just more expensive
rebuilt ones they're more expensive so
you know the fun way to do it is to
build it yourself so you can run into
some problems along the way luckily a
lot of forum members and a lot of
community community members have tried
to help you as much as they can okay so
are these some of the like would you
would say the most common
troubleshooting and fixing kind of
things from my perspective these were
the most common issues that i ran into
and these are the most common ones that
i found whenever I got online and
started looking through a forum post and
trying to figure him out so the first
one that I ran into was the filament so
we are using the abs filament it's this
this nice plastic and it's only about
three millimeters wide my issue with
this was that the first time I tried to
print it wasn't extracting down through
the nozzle down here so that little red
piece right here in the little gold
piece at the bottom it wasn't extracting
whatsoever it had so many issues and I
could try to squeeze it through
physically and you know I still had
problems the gears weren't catching so
there were a couple answers
that I found to this issue first off
being check the gears on the top and
clean out any excess filament that's
inside the gears so there's a extra gear
on the inside down here and that is
where it feeds it through that's where
it catches the abs filament and pulls it
down into the nozzle you want to make
sure that there's no excess filament
stuck in between and focus since it's
going into the extruder the extremely
being the really really hot thing yeah
there's potential for goo penis is that
the technical term yeah like goofiness
and it's kind of the same thing as like
screwing a screw too tight and then
losing all the threads oh yeah that's
basically the same issue that you would
get if you have a whole bunch of plastic
filament stuck inside the teeth of the
gear so you want to clean that out with
like a wire brush or some tweezers or
what-have-you something small where you
can get into the spaces so that was the
first problem that I had and then you
also want to make sure that the gears on
the front of it as well are moving when
it's supposed to be printing so every
time this is moving around you can see
that it's working now you want to make
sure that that works every single time
so next stuff you want to check that
your filament isn't getting caught
somewhere maybe check the sizing and
repeat ear make sure that if it is three
millimeter filament that you actually
have it set as three millimeters in the
software okay so repeat ears the
software that you showed previously and
because there's different you said this
is a BS right yeah these also it's also
PLA and there's different sizes you
could get the 22 millimeter 3 millimeter
and each one like you have to set them
to different sizes in the software of
course or else it will try to squeeze
through too much or too little and it'll
get caught so how big is this so this is
3 millimeter and what do you have the
software set to its 2.75 so just a
little bit smaller this is follow yeah
that it melts to a smaller size and then
gets down through the nozzle okay so it
finally worked for me you also want to
make sure your filament is it caught
anywhere so right now I should probably
put this onto a wheel or a wire or
something so it doesn't get caught
around the printer but for you know
example purposes of this segment I just
have it sitting over here the queer
keeping an eye on it exactly where
you'll run out of stuff Sharkey you'll
be okay
so my little shark takes about an hour
and 15 minutes to print so I just left
it running and I'm gonna be here the
whole time to make sure that it happens
you also want to make sure you do a
press tent or a test print by heating up
the filament to 230 degrees Celsius and
then squeezing some filament out of the
extruder that's going to make sure that
if there's any excess filament on the
outside of the nozzle or any on the
inside you're going to squeeze it
through and it'll end up coming out of
the end and you'll pull out whatever
crap is on the inside of it might be
something you just need to do at the end
of every print yeah exactly so it'll
help clean out your nozzle and it'll
keep you from having any problems with
it actually squeezing out now to clean
it this is where you might have to go
out by something so to clean it you can
remove the extra toronado nozzle on the
bottom the little gold piece you take
off the tape on it after its cooled off
yeah after its cooled off don't try to
touch it with your hands it's really hot
so you take off the red tape take off
the little gold nozzle and then you can
just clean it out with some piano wire
or some very thin wire just stick it
through the hole make sure that there's
nothing caught in there and you can also
use acetone surprise surprise there we
go so that's what will we have here yeah
and so what do you do you just run this
through it you soak it have it work when
i was using this i decided to fill up a
little just a little Tupperware dish of
acetone and then stick the nozzle in
there and it cleaned off any excess gun
it was awesome it's and it kind of
cleaned off my nail polish at the same
time so don't make fun of me for having
bad man in your its weight we can't you
just use if you don't have acetone can't
you just use your sisters nail polish
you probably shouldn't cuz they mix in a
whole bunch of other stuff like food
coloring you know to make give it that
pretty purple color and they mix in a
lot of other stuff too like the healthy
stuff that keeps your nails hard and
whatnot so you want to use just regular
acetone that's the best okay good deal
yes the hardcore printer geeks will get
mad at me if I say used in Polish so
this was the biggest problem I had was
the heat bed it doesn't want to heat to
70 degrees Celsius I had so many
problems with this this was the biggest
case scenario for me whenever I was
trying to print something
it because when I put it into repeat
here if it doesn't heat to 70 degrees
and I hit you know save job or start job
it's not even going to start the job if
I can't hit 70 so it'll hit like 66
degrees or it'll fall a little bit short
and go down to 65 and it goes up and
down and up and then it just wouldn't
hit 70 and it was really ticking me off
so I can I took a you know took a spin
around the forums and yeah basically the
only thing I found in that sense is well
the one thing i found was that people
were saying buy a bigger power supply i
mean what this is this whole thing here
is running off of pc power supply you
know this is what you have in your ATX
case at home it's crazy so i thought
this is a 250 wash lee it's 350 watts it
should be perfectly fine for this kind
of printrbot and you can also do a
couple of other things there's a
thermistor cable on the bottom of it you
want to make sure that that's directly
on your hate bed there's no kind of
separation or obstructions apparently
you can also stick cork board or
something else that has a thermal
resistant underneath the print bed so
you end up having a little bit of
insulation on the bottom oh right
because you're losing heat out of the
bottom right now exactly hmm so we can
put this inside and sort of bubble
enclosure mics yeah and that's why they
sell a whole bunch of you know insulated
boxes in fact that's what Dave Randolph
does for the maker bodies he has these
like you know window thing little window
things good stuff so try a different
power supply make sure the thermistor is
working you can also make sure your
computer is reading the correct
temperature with an external temperature
gun so you can just aim that with a
laser and make sure that it's reading
correctly and those are pretty cheap so
you can buy them pretty you know pretty
inexpensive so is this just because you
were trying to get pretty for the
segment no so that was my third issue
was the ABS the the filament it wasn't
sticking to the print bed so the
filament would just kind of bunch up
around the nozzle at the end it would
just kind of curve into a little circle
that was also kind of ticking me off but
it turned out that had a couple of
reasons to it first off the
heat bed wasn't heating up to the right
temperature it also it wasn't sticking
to the nice flat surface of the glass or
the plastic that you currently have on
your heat bed so you need to make sure
you have something on it that is going
to make it stick surprise surprise
hairspray hairspray points4 sheepish
hair sprays on the market sweet so Aqua
Net extra super hold yeah you had a
lighter you could I went a little bit
hardcore with this so first went through
I took blue painters tape right here I
took blue painters tape I put that down
first on a brand new plastic surface on
there so I just taped it down just fine
and then after that I took the Aqua Net
I sprayed that on there really good went
pretty hardcore with that and then after
that I also made this thing called ABS
juice ABS juice this is this is if you
can see it it is acetone and a little
piece of abs filament in about after 30
minutes or so it dissolves into the ABS
liquid Oh wonderful you can paint this
on to your your painters tape all that
it's cruel creates a nice sticky surface
that will mold your 3d printed model
onto the surface is it it wants to stick
to other ABS stuff and so you're just
kind of lasting it over I'm just kind of
glassing it over there giving it an
easier way to stick so after I got all
of that working we finally were able to
start printing mr. Jol's who was what I
was trying to print about two weeks ago
on the last episode of this is fantastic
yeah so this takes about an hour and 15
minutes to print at the beginning you
can tell on the close-up that the layer
the border lay around here it had some
issues right there we're done print all
the way so it was coming up a little bit
so I just took a pair of very small
pliers and I stuck it down there and I
kind of helped it along in it for in its
first layer so the right let's stick
pretty well and depending on what your
printing you may end up going back and
sanding this stuff anyway because you're
not going to you know that's one of the
biggest things that people say when they
see 3d printed objects is it doesn't
have that kind of smooth finish that you
expect from you know other plastic you
can see your layers
on it and that is an issue with a lot of
3d printers but I believe there's one on
the market that had depends on your
expectation though yeah that's true yeah
I don't really I don't really care if
it's smooth or not I just want to print
things yeah I mean your shark is still
gonna be just as Sharky exactly I mean
it's great for shark week which is
coming up pretty soon Oh kind of excited
about that they need to tell everybody
that I'm saying check check well
hopefully this will be done by the end
of the show I can't wait it's so awesome
so well if you guys have questions on
this stuff war if there's other 3d
printing technologies 3d printers you
want Shannon to take a look at as well
as you know just other tricks of the
trade print me back at hak5 org yeah I
print next guys I know you could print a
hack 5 hack across America challenge
coin but now I need to find out how to
make a 3d model of the hak5 challenge
coin oh well with lasers and a webcam
hahaha yes well with that stay tuned and
we will see you guys after the break you
work an IT I know I worked in IT I know
what it means mean it's constantly
jumping from one problem to the next and
each issue needing to be your results
like right now and every minute counts
you know don't waste your time juggling
different tools and duplicating data
entry this is why i've been using
gotoassist from citrix they are the
leader in remote support and with their
tools you'll have everything you need in
one integrated easy-to-use platform so
you can work faster and more efficiently
to get this go to assist now includes
three essential tools so you can have a
completely custom in a tool set for all
of your needs first of all there's the
service desk which allows you to log
those incidents and track those
resolutions there's go twist this
monitoring which proactively identifies
issues so you can fix them before your
boss calls in bit like a you know the
thing is down you don't want that and
remote support you guys know I love the
remote support it provides live or
unattended to any PC Mac or mobile
devices from anywhere i've been using it

that's go to assist calm promo code hak5
it's just about wraps up this episode of
hak5 but before we get going I want to
tell you guys about across America
obviously with new it for quite a bit
now and there's so much more to get to
because we're done with West Coast we're
heading east to Las Vegas and then we're
going through Montana so look out Helena
we're going through idaho so look out
Boise and then it's like Wyoming
Colorado I think Denver gonna be down in
Austin Texas getting off the west coast
and making your way actually across done
hacking across i5 yet America ok there's
gonna be quite a bit yeah in fact
actually mad props to midnight snake for
being the first one to figure out did
well he's figured out part of the the
coin which is really interesting because
he's actually in Europe yep so how did
he wait what so you go you get a coin
you Brits I don't know no idea but
midnight midnight snake is tweeting me
with using the cipher on the coin so
there is all there's that yeah so this
week we do not have a hack shop special
of the week because we are gearing up
for Def Con and we're going to have
plenty of specials at the convention my
god are we will have daily specials it's
going to be like yeah you know what we
should we should do something for the
people that are at home that aren't able
to come out to DEFCON we should do a web
special same time so that stuff comes
going right cuz you know yeah that's a
good idea now you have to do it and then
also I was thinking you know since we're
gonna have all of the spare stuff left
over from Def Con we should just
randomly ship it to people yeah make it
a pineapple with a whoop you might get a
palm tree with your pineapple it's just
let's just do that it's about to fit is
it there goes palm tree it's about to
finish is it yeah it's super excited
about this well this says 0 seconds left
job finished
it's done that's it yay and going the
entire yeah i used my print okay so now
we have to figure out how to yeah all
right should I google this part ok so
what i can do is well i can move this up
and i can move you're saying I should
just pull this out and make happen don't
stab it you say up a little bit further
we're gonna need a much bigger boat
let's go I guess I can't move this oh
that's pretty cool oh there it goes all
right I moved it around a bunch so it
might take a poop okay wait let me make
it go forward wrong way okay face no go
ahead does it just come off I guess I
don't know I've never done these before
I'm more into like should I just laser
cutters where's your knife well my knife
is here but I don't want to get in on
that bed see I heard you're not supposed
to use pointy stick II mean things to
pull your things off of the printer heat
bed we might have to wait for him to
like that cool down why doesn't have to
cool down cuz it's already hard oh yeah
it's super hard so she said all right
well it's that's ow hey don't touch this
that's not what you want to touch you
know I'm already on crutches ever think
about enough for one episode i think im
just gonna peel off the tape okay yeah
don't like that I'm burned and this
tastes like acetone is not good is so
not good okay I'm gonna kill it off go I
go get some water in this boy Oh
oh this is why Darren cannot have nice
things so I'll just peel this off while
Darren's getting his guate you that's
gross okay well here's my shark so the
bottom layer was the one that I was
having some issues with and not sticking
but I figure if I just stand knees off I
don't want to peel them off and end up
feeling the entire thing apart but I
think I could just stand these apart
with a nail file or something and then
um give it a soft texture on the bottom
shape your first pretty good job dad you
know I've seen much worse alive so I
think after this I would have to do a
couple more calibration fixes maybe mess
with the temperature a little bit and
maybe even mess with the Aqua Net a
little bit more spray some moron or
maybe a little less so it just takes and
you're drinking out of a baker okay so
oh god what is this it was just sitting
in the kitchen ah it tastes nasty haha
i'm done with this episode i mean i'm
darren kitchen yeah I'm Shannon Morse to
send your feedback to check the lost dog
and check out hack shop calm for sales
and stuff and / follow and hopefully
Darren down what did you think what in
this don't trust your technol
what if abs tastes good little guy go do
it faster faster overclock it
overclocked no does it taste like
nothing this is just assistance in Tunis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
