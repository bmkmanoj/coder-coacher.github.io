by goto assist this week I'm going to be
checking out another mobile messaging
service so if you are sent in this
application called Brima which is
another secure mobile messaging platform
for both iOS and Android now they claim
to be incredibly secure and have no way
of reading your messages so I decided to
take a look obviously so first off let's
go ahead and check out the program now
when you first install it and I have it
over here on my Android device I first
installed it you'll be you'll notice
that it costs a dollar ninety-nine on
both iOS and Android but the ease of use
on it and the security seem to make up
for that small little bit you pay so the
setup is very simple you install it and
a setup guide walks you through
encrypting creating your unique unique
ID setting up your phone number data
service and adding context now both
platforms are almost exactly alike so
you won't really have to learn a new GUI
for each phone if you have both iOS and
Android 3 Emma uses a random algorithm
to create your key pair so for example
on my Android device I already installed
it it's going to ask me move your finger
in a field below to generate a random
key for your password so I move it
around until I'm done and it creates my
threema ID so on the next page you're
going to see your ID so you simply move
your finger around random ways to create
this key your ID is going to be a random
set of characters that you can give to
your friends so you can now start
sending all your messages so this is the
fun part of course threema notes that
there are three ways that you can do
this first off and you do have to have
your friends download threema as well
you can scan their QR code you can sync
with your contacts or you can enter
their ID manually as well now you do not
have to sync your contacts if you don't
feel like putting that information into
3ma if you don't want to it just means
you'll need to use their QR code or
enter manual ids to find your friends
using 3ma so another example of such
down here it gives you my unique ID
which is the duu t-that random algorithm
right there
you can now start sending best
just two three may uses users and it
gives you three options first one is the
most secure so it gives you three
different green bullet points you can
scan their code so this is actually
meeting somebody in person and saying
hey I want your QR code on threema let
me scan it so you skin it within the app
and then you get their code and you have
all their contact information right
there the second one is two orange
bullet points maintenance not as secure
you can sync your contacts so these are
your current contacts that you have so
whenever they install three-month a use
their phone number you will
automatically be synced to them and
they'll be synced to you and the third
option is entering their ID manually so
this is the least secure way because you
might run into an issue where you type
in the wrong ID code or something like
that so you might end up texting
somebody you don't actually know so next
up after you've done this setup you can
sync your email and/or your phone number
and this is going to let your friends
find your ID so for example my phone
number would be one two three four five
six seven eight nine zero and when my
friend syncs to his contacts he'll be
able to see I'm using three ma and I'll
automatically be added so now once
you've got all that done you're all set
up so let's go ahead and start to send a
couple of messages so this is the fun
part you can add your friends through
the contacts menu by scan invite or ID
and once added you can simply click on
their name to start a new conversation
so let's go ahead and add my iPhone over
here to my Android device so I've got
everything set up on my Android device
click Next if asked me if I want to sync
my contacts for now I'm going to say no
because I'm like I don't know if I trust
the Rema click Next and it asks you if
you want to link you click Next so now
it will send an SMS to my number and
it'll ask you if this number is correct
and I'll say yes and this is going to
confirm that it's verified phone number
so it's going to actually make sure that
I am who I say I am basically it's
securing my contact information for
myself so it's going to send over to me
so once you have verified your phone
number through either a text message or
you can also do a call or you verified
through email
as well you can go on to the next step
which is creating your own public
nickname so this is this will give your
friends another easy way to find you if
they're not in the general area to
actually scan your QR code so for mine
I'm going to give myself a nickname and
that nickname will be well snubs
because why not so once I'm done click
that so once I click Next
I can choose a master key passphrase for
my applications so every time I turn on
my phone I have to enter this passphrase
to actually access all of my secure
messages inside of 3 month so I'm going
to go ahead and set that so I've gone
ahead and typed in a master key
passphrase so luckily every time I go
back to the application it will ask me
for that passphrase I'm going to add a
contact on here so I want to add my iOS
phone three ways I can do that I can
click on the little guy up at the top
and either enter three my ID if I know
there's scan an ID or invite a friend if
they aren't available on there currently
so I'm going to go ahead and scan the ID
now on my second phone the iOS phone I
can click on the identification the
little profile my ID so this is going to
give me my QR code so I'll go ahead and
scan that and it'll add a new contact
successfully added now if I go back
so once I've added them as a contact on
my threema application on my Android
phone my iPhone will show up as either
their public nickname or their
identifier their three my ID if they
have not created a public nickname so
right now mine is du4 XD 5zk if you guys
want to add me as a friend on there now
I can actually start chatting so if I
click on that name it'll show me their
key fingerprint verification levels
since it was a QR code it gives me three
green bullets so that means it's very
secure and they're three my ID I can
also go up and edit and change the first
and last name if I want to click done
and let's go ahead and write a message
so I'll say hello
not easy to type on the sideways haha
hello so if I go over to my iPhone over
here I get a notification and I see my
little ID come up right here and it says
hello as a new message so on this one I
only have two orange bullet points up at
the top and of course this means I only
have those two bullet points because
I've only added myself as a friend
via my ID that's it I've only friended
myself by searching my own contact so
it's not as secure as actually scanning
the QR code now settings are very
customizable as well you can turn on and
off syncing you can exclude numbers such
as that of your hairstylist or you know
that weird guy at work and block any
kind of unknown numbers if you don't
want random people messaging you media
can be sent as well via three mom and
you have the option to automatically
save it to your camera roll which is
pretty cool now you can also set up a
mess or passcode like I did so it must
be entered each time your phone is
turned off now if somebody randomly
texts you and you don't know them you
can add them as a friend on your through
the app just by clicking on their ID and
scanning their ID and you can also tell
if they have read your message which is
kind of fun acknowledging it and see if
it failed or if it was delivered via all
sorts of different icons that appear in
the chat window
all of them are rather small so I won't
go through all of those right now you
can also update your contacts photos
through your address book and 3mo will
sync those which is a pretty cool
addition now how do you know that
threema is actually safe I mean we don't
know if they've been sent to national
security lover letter the kind of owner
gag order and companies can say whatever
they want but you don't really know
unless they're open-source now three
months end-to-end encryption sounds
really sweet and luckily threema does
all encryption and decryption handled on
the device and to end encryption is
applied between recipients and an
additional level of security is between
the application and its servers you can
even run validation yourself which is a
nice feature that they've opened up
which is right there available on the
website however the actual product
itself is not open source yeah that's a
big bummer now
creators of threema have done a really
good job of explaining all the security
and privacy in their faq located on our
show notes but I really want to know
have you used it it seems like a good
option to me and it's definitely a
competitor to the other ones that I have
reviewed on the pro side it's very
secure it's easy to use and it's
definitely cross-platform which is super
fun on the cons though it does cost
money and it's and it's not open source
so how secure is it really now coming up
