things we're continuing our discussion
on openpgp and key servers then
connecting social media and chat through
IRC all that and more this time on hak5
this segment of hak5 is brought to you
by go to assist hello welcome to back by
my name is darren kitchen and I am
Shannon Morse and this is where we
continue our mission to seek out strange
new openpgp keys yesterday or something
about what we talked about last week
that is what we talked about do not it
was a really good segment and you have
not yet sent me any secure mail so don't
worry about that you know I've been
using my mail so often for like
work-related stuff that I just don't
take the time to do it I just always
just closed the meeting what happened
everything about like you know that
we've had PGP for the last 20 years and
it hasn't seen like widespread adoption
and I hope that in our lifetime that
changes it and like we fought the whole
crypto worn one and that nobody's using
a little I think yeah and I'm a perfect
standing example of that I have the
ability now I know how to do it and I
haven't really what reason to do it
we're going to make easier today because
we're gonna talking about yeah we're
gonna tie it easy well we're gonna day
well you know what the most difficult
part is once you've got it all setup is
now I want to send a secure message over
to hiddy on IRC yeah except I don't have
his public key what's this predator
public a oh yeah ok hit me what's your
email address Republican the same thing
and I also need anything and then yeah
yeah so let's so let's fix that problem
that of course last week talking about
you know the Quick Start Guide basically
in a hope that you guys send that to
your friends and say look you should be
using this to just follow this it's
really easy and today I'd like to
address some of the usability concerns i
mean the beauty of all of this is that
the security is in the message and not
the transport so you can go ahead and
assume a man-in-the-middle attack it
doesn't even matter if somebody sees the
email that i'm sending to you you hang
PG no big deal because mine secured with
my private key yours is secured with
your private key as long as we keep
those
safe right world don't see a bunch of
gibberish yeah so of like you know Alice
wants to send a message to Bob and she
keeps her key secure and then it's
totally cool and and but the idea then
is that if Alice wants to receive
encrypted email then somebody needs
Alice's public key ok now as far as web
apps and services they are dominating
the internet now open PGP at pre has
provided a very adequate way to maintain
ownership of content mail volokh the
chrome extension you know achieves this
with as little headache as possible
while integrating with popular web mail
clients through using openpgp jas it's a
JavaScript library written for html5
compliant devices and basically it's one
of many implementations of openpgp it's
a really good example they you know
there's others like GNU privacy guard or
gnupg or gpg but basically they all do
the same thing they all implement
openpgp it's an RFC 4880 something
standard in the internet engineering
task force but the idea here is it
doesn't matter if you're using mail vulo
on chrome and i'm using thunderbird with
the nig mail and gpg we're all speaking
the same language and that's the beauty
I find in email and open PGP no one owns
it you know it's open source it's free
anyone can get an email account anybody
can use this basically military-grade
crypto and you know it's a massive
departure from the likes of Facebook and
Twitter who own your content and they
run a closed system and they don't do
anything about securing that they'll
secure your password like the one-way
hash or something but they won't do
anything to secure your content because
you know they can monetize that so keep
that in plain text and you know with
things like sista hopefully not passing
but if so you know and it just ends espa
enabling companies like Facebook and
Google and who are behind it I can't
believe this google is behind this yeah
that's kind of surprising but I guess
it's go figure yeah and there's no
repercussions whatsoever I mean they
were opposed
to like sopa because there was a
financial incentive there was like money
behind it money talks when suddenly you
know they're on the hook or they have to
spend the money to do this and suddenly
with sis by the way that it's set up is
that they're protected their anonymized
they can share everything they want with
the government and they don't have to
think about spending any resources to
clean any of the content yeah so anyway
with with in light of that I think that
it's it would be really cool to get
everybody on the same page we can all
agree that p-gp is great but for it to
be used wide late needs to be easier to
use and Mail globe and other things
using openpgp Jas have done have gone
through great lengths to make it easier
and still I think there's a lot more
work in that field and it's one of the
things that have been really thinking
about lately so I figured we talked
about key servers they're basically a
way to distribute cryptographic keys
typically public keys used in asymmetric
cryptography like openpgp which we've
been using and one of the oldest key
servers in facts hosted by MIT and the
premise here is really simple you submit
your ASCII armored public key and that
is to say basically a schemer just is a
fancy technobabble word for binary
converted to a ski because the body of
an email message was never made really
for binary okay so you know it's why
when you do your your public key or you
cipher text of when you've actually made
your way it comes with the message yeah
it just looks like a bunch of gobbly
gook but its ASCII letters and stuff and
it's not just a bunch of weird
characters that would make your old IBM
XT beep but that's neither here nor
there it's a it's a great way to just go
ahead and register your public key in
the database so now if I want to send a
message to you I can get your public key
without having to first go through that
here's my public key with your public
and waiting around and all of that stuff
X so let's check it out here this is the
it's over at PGP MIT edu is
of them and another popular one is also
the PGP global directory at key server
pgp calm and I believe these sink and
the idea here let's see if it's synced
yet put mine in the MIT database I
search my name now and I tell it on my
human that was an easy one what come on
we got that and now i'm not in a
database yet but i am in the MIT
database and i believe they sink but if
i search Darren kitchen I'm going to
find based on name there it is Darren
hak5 org and there's my key that's cool
yeah and and all there is to submitting
it is you go to mail hope and you choose
your key export display your public key
copy it to the clipboard come over here
paste it in Bob's your uncle oh that's
super easy you click Submit this key and
then so if you do that now and i
searched Shannon Morse okay let me do
that milf elope options and then I go to
my key export display public key copy to
clipboard I don't know why I copied it
and then submit and then just hit submit
to the very good it's all there is to it
added to this but how do they know
that's look at this I just did the
search for Shannon Morse and now I see
Shannon Morse OMG gmail com right there
and there's a cared and so you know like
last week we you know throw up the and
this is actually another fun way when we
were talking about the beauty of this is
you can give your public key to anyone
it doesn't break the security of you
probably know that it oh I guess I just
tied to the email address it's in the
key I'll go eat it yet so that big block
of text that you paste it in there it
contains your name and your email
address and then the public key
basically obviously and so all you have
to do is paste in that block and now
you're in the database so if anybody
wants to email you they can search that
yeah
and then if you want to reply back to
them and they're in the database you
just search their email and Bob's your
uncle this is cool this is really fun
than another thing like what we did last
week was to do like QR codes to kind of
submit to I think we're hosting it a
hack five dot org slash key / Darren or
/ ceaseless Shannon because the idea is
get your key out there there's there's
no way that that anybody can just using
your public key impersonate you will
figure out your private key that's the
beauty of it so put it out there as much
as possible I know that I've done stuff
in the past with with QR codes as our
fun or a data matrix very similar
there's a good example over at inv XCOM
is a place where you can create both of
those and you may find that for example
your public key if you're using a large
public key like i'm using a 4096 bit
public key it's not going to create a
data matrix it's it's too big oh my keys
to be big but if you're using a week or
1024 bit you could create a data matrix
or QR code of it but rather than that i
can simply take the URL over here at PGP
MIT edu on port 11 371 and you can see
here my unique you know this is the my
unique identifier that ties back in over
here you see II 1278 and that's the same
thing over here that's my like key
fingerprint so I can just copy that pop
that in here ah and it generates barcode
that's cool there you go if you scan
that barcode with your phone you're
going to yeah you know get the URL it's
going to take you to your key can import
it that's cold I hope that helps
usability some of the other things that
are on my mind as far as increasing
usability is to do a follow-up segment
with bringing your bringing openpgp over
to android there are ways to do it it's
I'm going to try to make it as concise
as possible it's not like the webmail
equivalent and that is a point of
contention where if you send me you know
a message and then I'm on my phone and
I'm like oh
aight gobbly gook and I can't read it so
but I feel like all of these are just
technical hurdles that should be able to
be overcome yeah I spent 20 years now to
come on let's get this thing mainstream
adopted yeah leave it's been so far I
know you were sorry what something yeah
I was like seven okay well with all that
I want to hear what you guys are using
as far as you know you're open PGP
implementations if we like you Dora or
thunderbird or some of the other ones
out there or Pegasus whatever whatever
have you oh yeah there is you might like
that one rainbows and butterflies yeah
you could use it with trumpet winsock
even right there and with all of that
we're gonna take a quick break but when
we get back you're getting into IRC yes
I am tired alright i'm i'm super excited
about this because i grew up on IRC so
you're gonna like it well I never grew
up but like I that's what might live
yeah you're gonna like this yeah the
International sovereignty that is IRC
all right let's take a quick break I am
really thankful to have served as a
systems administrator for 10 years back
in Virginia and I learned so much on the
job you guys know it's a constant
challenge but it's also an awesome
learning experience those issues pop up
all the time it's always something
different always keeping you on your
toes challenging yes stressful yes
rewarding totally and one of the things
that I am for sure glad is that I had go
