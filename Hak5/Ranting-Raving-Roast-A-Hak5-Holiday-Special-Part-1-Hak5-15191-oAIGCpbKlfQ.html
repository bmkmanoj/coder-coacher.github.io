by domain.com hello and welcome to this

Darrin kitchens mixes message he and I
figured that you would appreciate that I
determine my gosh oh my gosh this is the
perfect day to do a roast it's kind of
best if you want to keep rolling retake
no we're gonna keep okay because it kind
of just makes sense with today's so if
you're tuning in for tech content you're

fun of ourselves and we're really bad
sweaters cheers cheers to the holiday

we been doing this show for I've been
doing 13 to seven years august of oh
wait was when i first started which was
in UNIX epoch time about 40 years that's
so we're anyway yes yeah way too long
mm-hmm and I think we've grown quite a
bit since we first started and I know
I've grown a bit since what your purse
started I know I did your lawyer I'm not

to what walk over there or this isn't
even a blue brother just just do
everything just so what do we got oh my
god i think you were supposed to cut
that out well there's a there's a
history of this though and hak5 like
things just kind of slip in okay pretty
much what it is there's no quality
responses Tommy camera guys saying there
is no QC act 5 and I think the reason
for that is with the constant churn of a
weekly show you want to treat an
employee yeah it's live it's just
audiosurf so i'm reviewing a video game
is that you can it's not a bad video
game it's actually pretty good are you
playing right now as you're doing though
your hands aren't even on the mouse so
