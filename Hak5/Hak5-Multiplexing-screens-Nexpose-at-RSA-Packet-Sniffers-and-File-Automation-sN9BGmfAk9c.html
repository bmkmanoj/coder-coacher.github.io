much more this time on hacks 5 this
week's episode of hak5 is brought to you
by netflix go to WWF flexkom / hak5 to
get your free trial membership go to
assist express support smarter with go
to assist express and domain com your
next big idea starts at domain.com hello
welcome back pop my name is Darrin
kitchens and I'm Shannon Morse and this
is your weekly dose of techno lesson we
have a fantastic show for you guys today
because it's season 9 episode random
number one we made it really exciting I
made it to the east I mean West Coast
West Coast we're in the east bay on the
west coast so it's one of those like
east meets I were finally here I'm so
happy to be out here with everybody
uh-huh it's good how's that was the move
it was a it was hard and it was
stressful but I made it and we got all
of our furniture into the house the
apartment and it went okay once we got
everything up up the stairs oh my back
hurts I'm sure mom checking in on you as
you progress to becoming californica did
actually I don't even know Californa
cases yeah I've discovered its kind of
its own name exactly the same as I was
two seasons ago except for the Hackett
which is a jacket that hacker where's to
hacker jacket so dude um oh right its
season nine now with more how did
that get here well speaking of more
boy over here
it's Paul yeah oh I forgot about the
dance cam got ya mean my friend Oh
welcome to the west coast special
surprise so much for rejoining hack
father you have no idea how much it
means to me Paul is going to be taking
over the editing responsibilities of the
show because ah is leaking show out
that's not what it was testing like a
bazillion things going on and I'm so
happy to have Paul back on the team and
and you know I edited just about every
episode of pack 5 like all hundred and
forty of them or whatever and a couple
met you did like yeah but I'm just
saying like if there's anyone in the day
that I can trust for the editing it's
totally Paul so oh man is nothing man
what happening here well I was gonna go
back behind the camera where he belongs
so what's up in this episode we have
fantastic stuff check it out we've been
at RSA so we might have some of that or
not any we also have a fun case mod
because you know while putting
inexpensive servers inside of cardboard
boxes is fun so is building custom stuff
out of ikea furniture might get to a
little back here I know he was like um
stuff going on yeah I found this self
cleaning tool for a windows box it's a
very fun and very easy so I was like
sweet perfect it's kind of like cron too
so we'll find out about that as well as
a little bit ssl fun i figured why don't
we just get right into it it's time for
the headlines all right connect hackers
rejoice Microsoft confirms that connect
SDK is coming for the PC and Mac this
spring it's going to allow developers to
deal with the motion controller or the
wave your hands around thing and the
boys sensors and stuff I'm kind of a
higher level than what you would do
typically with the informal connect tax
the SDK will be free for personal use
and we're expecting a commercial version
here to follow yeah dude I'm totally
looking forward to that not yet I don't
have a connect better get it intact
everyone good sermon mm-hmm since the
neck ax oh fun stuff people are always
asking about consoles and speaking of
which sony playstation 3 they're
threatening to permanently disconnect
jailbroken PlayStation 3 console is from
the PlayStation Network not cool Sony
not cool Jeff Rubenstein Sony social
media manager wrote in his blog to avoid
this customers must immediately cease
use and remove all circumvention devices
and delete all unauthorized or pirated
software from their PlayStation 3 soft
systems not cool I Bailey don't agree
with that give us the stuff and you'll
be legit right because you know the only
people that jailbreak are people that
are pirating games yeah well yeah home
reason whatsoever you know major
constancy donations have closed for the
Legal Defense Fund of george hotz he's a
notable iphone jailbreaker and ps3
hacker sony's got him tied up in san
francisco federal court since january
and he's facing unspecified damages with
go figure dmca violation so was writing
on his logged out that he has enough
money to cover his legal funds for now
and basically the best way that you can
you know help is to just spread the
words oh good we're spreading the word
for you man and the latest virtualbox
four-point-oh point or update has adds
support for ubuntu 11.04 alpha guests
the ubuntu alpha codenamed natty narwhal
that's really cute throwing introduces
unity as the default desktop session
known can still be accessed as a bunch
of classic session but in a misnomer
although coupon to is words
you know I'm gonna say Katie 241 yeah
yeah all right and also to round this
out I've got to say this is me renewed
my heart SQL injections is so much fun
and when you can do it in the RL even
better gotta thank a good friend from up
north from the varsity sports league oh
yeah you know vessel Evan uberman for
sending this by because do whatever you
would give an injection attack go ahead
and just put it on your bumper and have
it oh she are right into the DB light
letters not there were too many letters
are happening go ahead Shannon why don't
you tell the Silurian about the the
challenge the crack the code challenge
this is our second week of doing the
crack the code challenge do you have
what it takes to compete in the crack
the code challenge test your skills in
our private lab network and bid for the
title supreme leet haxor winners will be
featured on future episodes of heck 5
our next event will be this sunday this
Sunday februari 27th at three p.m.
pacific visit hak5 dot org slash
challenge for all of the details will be
live streaming at hak5 org slash life
kind of like we're doing right now
throughout the day so we'll see you
there and we'll be right back after a
word from our sponsor if you are an IT
or software consultant you're always
looking to compete with the big guys the
problem is you may be a one-man show you
need a remote support tool and the best
is go to assist express the faster you
can connect to a customer the faster you
can move on to the next challenge reduce
the travel time and increase revenue by
supporting multiple requests brought to
you by Citrix you know go to assist
Express is easy and secure try go to
assist express free for 30 days for this
special offer visit go to assist calm /
hak5 again that's go to assist calm /
hak5 for a free trial
rock bottom dear in kitchen here RSA
2011 and you guys know we're huge fans
of rapid seven you know they're the
makers of metasploit and I have the
pleasure here talking to Chris curse
Chris how are you how are you doing
doing really well listen you gave you've
seen the show you know that we're here
span of the framework but also you've
got so many other products that maybe we
should just introduce our audience to
because we've got some really cool new
stuff happening with next pose yeah
absolutely yeah so I saw you talking a
lot about medispa Don the show
metasploit it's kind of a penetration
testing tool we have the free open
source framework we also have some
commercial editions for professional pen
testers and people who work in IT
security but what we actually also have
and that's actually a product that's
that are known on the market and the
commercial market is our product next
pose and that's more a vulnerability
scanner so so how does a vulnerability
scan or differ from a penetration
testing tool aren't they both for
breaking in to assist yeah a lot of
people ask me that and it's it's really
you know i like to use an analogy of you
know if you think of your network or
your IT systems as a house a
vulnerability scan is like sending
somebody like a security guard around
the house and they check you know Oh is
there a door open is there a week lock
on there and or as a windowpane broken
that you could get into and so it's like
the security guy going around writing
things up any Airport and you can then
look at that and act on it patch systems
add some firewall rules and so on with
penetration testing you're actually
trying to break into the house so you're
taking the screwdriver and trying to
prop open the window or you're picking
the lock and you actually try to get in
and you try to see okay you know am I
getting into the pantry or the server
room or you know what kind of data would
I be getting to right so it sounds like
this is a lot of enumeration but on a
larger scale because you're also
creating reports tell me about that how
does that work cuz i've seen some
reports from some other products where
there's just so much stuff yeah I know I
know and that's you know we actually
like to combine the two so vulnerability
scanning gives you a better broader view
vulnerability scans you know we scanned
for about I think it's sixty thousand
different vulnerabilities in metasploit
we have about roundabout
600 exploits a thing so just in the
sheer scale you're you're covering a
broader base and you're making a very
thorough scan in the end for
prioritizing your vulnerabilities you
want to do a penetration test because it
gives you better a better idea what are
the real risks and what can you get to
so after you run something like next
pose then you would fire up the
framework and see okay so next post told
me that you know this mail server is out
of date and there's potentially a flaw
here and then let's try it with you know
metasploit and see we can get in yeah
I'll give you an example where you know
vulnerability scans are great and
they're widely used in the industry very
necessary but i would give you an
example where this can fall down so i
just talked to colleague over lunch
yesterday he told me about a pen test
that they did where they did a
vulnerability scan and it discovered you
know it looked pretty fine assistants
were pretty well patched and they only
saw an unpatched system on one of the
machines which wasn't really an
important machine but when they did the
pen test they got into that one machine
and got some hashes a cash credentials
something they were able to pivot and
know they were actually not pivoting
they were passing the hash to the other
machines because they were all created
from the same golden image so what
companies usually do is they don't
install server after server after server
right mama I don't know windows CD ROM
they created once image system and then
deployed right yeah cheesier yeah I mean
I'm an IT guy I do that it's good stuff
everybody does it yeah but what they
don't think about is that you know if
they log on to that golden image once or
twice with different accounts those
accounts are cached so so you have all
the hashes on there and that enables you
if you get into one of those you can
replay those hashes and the other ones
so I put it on all the systems yeah
great so you know vulnerability scanning
is good necessary it's also required for
you know some business level things like
pci and so on right but you want to have
the combination of the two to really
give you the confidence
probably right wrist so you were telling
me that there's some new stuff in in
next most yeah as far as flash is
concerned tell me about that because
you've always been able to do flash
stuff before right yeah so I mean
there's two different parts to flash I
mean first of all we see like pretty
much everybody has a flash player on
their client yeah so we already scan for
vulnerabilities in the flash client when
you when you open your browser you're
playing in I don't know you have a
little flash forum you have a little
flash menu on the website and so on we
already follow the links in these flash
menus to make sure that when we do a
vulnerability scan we spider all the
different and that's just it in the
operation right there yeah right and but
a lot of vulnerability scanners are
blind to that and don't follow these
things so in web applications they don't
actually find everything what we've
added now and that's quite exciting is
we actually take the entire flash
application on the server side and we d
compile the code okay so that you can
look for forums and you can look for
sequel injections hard coded credentials
right because a lot of flashing crypto
you know that a lot of flash is done by
designers yeah designers talk to the
client they're like oh I need to write
something to the database what's the
essay passive exactly and you know most
designers have never had exposure to
secure coding and so they're just not
very sensitive to to the kind of
practices that you should have in place
and so our job here is to really look at
the entire application look at the flash
decompiler to have a look at the entire
picture and give you a secure secure
scam that is so cool that you can
decompile flash like that and take a
look I'm sure a lot of people would be
you know interested in playing with NEX
pose you said that there's a community
edition how it is that differ from the
commercial product so next post is a
commercial product but we do have a free
version it's called the next post
community edition it's fully a featured
except that it's limited to 32 IPS ok so
you can play around with it you can use
it in small company small networks and
so on scan there or if you do a pin test
for a limited network segment you can
use that and get it get a good feel for
where you have vulnerabilities and play
there okay awesome looks like something
that we could have a lot of fun with on
the next hacker challenge they will get
some copies of that going thank you so
much Chris has been a pleasure today
with you okay thank you last week's
trivia question was in the Millennium
Trilogy what is the name of the hacker
community and the answer was hacker
Republic this week's trivia question is
from March fifth of 1975 to December of
1986 this club of computer hobbyist
would meet in the Silicon Valley area
what is their name go over to hack five
dot org slash trivia for your chance to
win some sweet hak5 schwag by answering
that trivia question we'll be right back
after a brief word from our sponsor
since the very beginning here on hack 5
we've used our very own forms hak5 dot
org slash forms as an example when
sniffing passwords from HTTP now that we
have demonstrated it on our network you
want to try it out on somebody else's
okay you go ahead hit up the campus of
the cop shop sounds good to me that's
right can enable and grab TCP dump
Wireshark you name it we snip traffic
with it the basic principle is that HTTP
for authentication is like using a
bullhorn to login my password is EEF
5204 d6a now recently packet sniffing
has gotten even more trivial with
Firefox extensions like firesheep and
that's led to many high-profile sites
including Facebook going ahead and
finally implementing SSL so wise hak5
door is still using HTTP well not from
this day on thanks to domain com we've
got a shiny new ssl cert which is pretty
cool because not only can you login to
the forms more securely but it also
gives me a whole bunch of new cool
things that I can do with private
tunneling now we've talked about PHP
proxies before and how you can use them
to bypass like content filtering on some
sorts of some firewalls but with HTTPS
to one of these proxies you essentially
have a secure connection as well and
alternatively what this also means is
that you
set up using like things like s tunnel
tunnels over TLS to do things like SSH
over HTTP which is really cool if you've
got some restrictive firewalls because
it really just looks like you're making
an HTTPS connection to your server I get
into that real soon now if your
assistant min or want to secure any kind
of website you know already the SSL is
critical for securing ecommerce online
forums email corporate intranet or
really anything related to private data
so if you're looking for an ssl
certificate or looking to switch out
your provider you should really check
out domain coms thought ssl i like their
ssl 123 product first of all it builds
trust thoughts been around for a long
time and is one of the most trusted
names in SSL it's easy the thought ssl
123 is all you need to start encrypting
your site uses the strongest encryption
available plus has the validation
quickly so you get your certificate like
issued nearly immediately hak5 org we
got ours approved in less than 24 hours
and finally it's affordable use the
coupon code hak5 you can get it for less
than 40 bucks a year and really that's
the best price online for a thought ssl
123 bottom line if you need to use ssl
and pretty much we all do try domain
coms thought ssl 123 and i want to say
domain com has been sponsoring hak5 for
over a year here in season 9 we couldn't
be happier if you haven't already go
ahead and check out domain com give it a
try I totally recommend them you can get
a domain for under ten bucks and
reliable hosting for five so go ahead
and support hak5 by supporting domain
com and of course remember to use the
coupon code hak5 a check out get
yourself fifteen percent off your order
your next big idea starts at domain.com
so if you're on linux you know
automating something can be as easy as
writing a shell script and setting a
crontab but if that's Greek to you
Shannon I would do this with windows I
have a very special tool called
Belvedere mmm sounds delicious yes you
know that vodka that we always good yeah
yeah like the hacker let me take you the
hotsy totsy into some real stuff now
okay well I'm sorry it's not really a
vodka oh well dang it Belvedere is this
automated file management and scripting
tool that you can use on any windows box
you know I love scripting what kind of
scripting stuff can I do with it bill it
lets you organize any kind of folders on
your hard drive so you can create you
can create roles that will move and copy
rename you can delete files you can open
files all based on their names
extensions size or like the date they
were created all sorts of stuff so so
instead of writing a batch file and
using the at command or something in
Windows or the task scheduler is he's
got a pretty GUI yeah it's not very
pretty GUI it's very simple to use and
it's easy for any user and a user can
use it so let's dive right in and take a
look okay folder okay so folders recycle
bin and preferences these are the three
things that you're going to use folders
is where you set your folders and your
rules for each folder that you wanted to
do so on here I have set up my downloads
in my desktop okay let's take a look at
your downloads or your desktop okay so
don't let me right now I have this rule
enabled and I just named it downloads I
can go down here to edit the role its
name is downloads and currently it says
if any of the following conditions are
met the extension is either a JPEG or a
jpg JPEG then it will move the file into
my folder called hak5 pictures makes
sense moving pictures into the hak5
pictures folder right okay these are
like watch folders we use something
similar at revision3 when somebody drops
in episode there are watchful and final
cut server will pick it up and encode it
into the different formats okay yeah
that's really cool so under here I can
change it there's a lot of different
choices that I have I can choose if the
name is a certain thing or the the size
the date it was last modified or the day
created Tuesday last modified date last
modified ok so if okay so in that case
you get any last or is not in the last
so you could have like in your downloads
folder if it's not in the last seven
days go ahead and move it to like your
archive downloads folder I don't know
what you guys I never clean out my
downloads folder I don't think it's so
much junk in there but then I'd known
the Oddcast music and pictures and word
documents all sorts of stuff just
cluttering it this feeds my need to
organize stuff it does yes this does
everything for you it's so great so okay
I did this in the last two days and then
down here I have the choices to set my
rule I can move the file rename it send
to the recycling bin and I'll get to
that in a second delete copy or open the
file so I'll just leave it on move file
and then up here and there's extension
dot torrent open anyway under Rule
options you also have these three
choices enabled means that the rules
enabled so it'll have confirm action
means that a little window will pop up
whenever it's about to do the action so
if you're away from your computer don't
choose that ok and then recursive is
anything else that is in the downloads
folder like if you have several folders
inside the downloads folder then it'll
make the same action happen for all of
those folders inside it so it's kind of
like a tree excellent it keeps on
branching out great ok so I have that
set and then if I chose to make it moved
stuff to the recycling bin or I just
wanted to clean out my recycling bin
which I'm terrible about I suck at it
under here I can allow Belvedere to
manage my recycling bin ok so is this
just always running always watching that
folder like instantly like nice but it's
always in the background and it doesn't
take up like any memory at all and it
just and you can set it to start up when
windows starts up if you want it to you
have to do it manually though so I make
my recycling bin empty out every two
weeks
and then it will tell me when it was
last emptied which is very nice and the
preference is this is how often you want
it to do something okay so it's going to
look every three thousand milliseconds
so every 30 seconds that's every 30
seconds yes so every 30 seconds it'll do
its little background work it'll look at
my files and those certain folders and
make sure that there's no changes that
don't be needed and then it does
everything for me once again snobs
making life a lot easier for our our
windows viewers thank you you're welcome
okay where can people find this people
can find this over at github
project yes wait so I'm assuming we will
have links in the show notes of course
and if you guys have any other self
cleaning tools for windows even Mac or
Linux any of those please send your
feedback over to feedback at hak5 org
all right now it's time for the hacker
tip what could be more wicked than a
screen session well obviously too we've
talked recently about the UNIX screen
command and it's a great way to maintain
bash sessions on multiple ssh client
persistent connections without using
your work it's my new favorite to
command and check it out my new favorite
shortcut after invoking the screen
command is actually control a and then a
capital s check this out it splits it
into two screen sessions beautiful right
you tab between the two by hitting
control a and then tab and you can go
between the top and bottom view now
check this out this is awesome if you
are a debian user because you've
actually got the added sexiness i'm
doing a vertical split actually I
haven't seen if you can do multiple
inside of it it could get recursive
let's see could pull a couple of oh we
just got recursive now i have three
getting even more leet live to tape how
about that if you guys have some awesome
gems rocking your world hit us up share
them with us and we'll share them with
the world tips at hak5 org we'll be
right back after a quick word from one

slash hak5 sign up now with this URL so
they know we sent you
that just about wraps up this episode of
hak5 but before we get going you guys
know that we have some of your awesome
emails what did you just eat some more
candy yes and your techno spoder of the
week but I wanted to talk about servers
as you guys know we've been having a lot
of fun with these guys building the
cluster out for our for our challenges
you know the crack the code the hack
challenges and stuff like that and yeah
we built I take this no yeah thought is
an i5 yeah with four gigs of ram it's
pretty sick box for only like the 400
bucks apiece we paid but I tried to save
some money by using a cardboard box as a
computer case and while that will work
its way more fun to do a case mod so
tune in next week because we're gonna be
diving into that excess and I feel oh I
can feel the techno lyst I'm I'm
dreaming like this is this is totally
worthy of the show yay that is so pretty
yeah yeah do it with the lights oh gosh
yes no no we'll get into it later but um
but that's what I've been working on I
know it's such a tease such a tease
right but it's about what you would pay
for a computer case but you guys know I
am crazy about wall-mounted computers
why they're so beautiful why are they
not on display so hopefully we'll have
that up here in this area of emptiness
soon and that is that is my T's 49 x 0
20 9x I didn't even realize that nice
like New England neat New York exchange
near oh yeah yeah the Bell ma belle baby
Bell freak scene never mind let's get in
some emails save me Shannon it's like
the end of the show so ready to check
out so we got one email actually two
emails like new was the first one hey
I'm in dire need of a command-line Linux
packet sniffer my servers are three
hours away and none have x11 installed I
used to use sniff it a long time ago but
it looks like they like they've added a
GUI to it just wondering if you had any
ideas off the top of your head thanks
man and this was from Patrick Bailey
thank you you got to use TCP dump TCP
dump is great it's my favorite come
online when I just need to dump some
packets real quick but also if there's
something in specific specific
specifically if Pacific the coast with
the thing if you're looking for
something in particular I can't speak
highly enough about my awesome favorite
program called n grep it's like grep but
for networks we talked about it maybe in
like season 5 but it's basically n grep
and then like I don't know eth0 and then
whatever it is the regular expression of
what you're looking for say like the
word password I don't know and then
it'll show you just those things so try
out those two and if you guys have some
awesome tools that he check house check
out with the words go ahead and email
feedback at hak5 org because we would
love to hear about them so we had one
other little quickie and this was from
sparkle-face she said if you need a mind
break today check this out thanks so
much for sending that in sparkle-face
the Harmony Project over here by mr. da
biz awesome you actually got need to go
ahead and check out the links in the
about page because it'll bring you back
to someone riginal like research and a
paper by our friends a frank how do you
wash it je baby find out over as a prank
but as far as harmony is concerned this
is a really sick way to do sketches and
I think it's so great that it is
actually html5 so what you can do is if
you go to on your smartphone it'll
actually run on your smartphone which is
awesome it's a sketching program and it
does this really cool math we're like
you draw these lines and they've got
like all these different brushes and
it's a lot of fun like it puts together
these really beautiful kind of things
and and it's a lot of fun to play with I
had a ton of fun with it I think you
