you by gazelle the fastest and easiest
way to sell and recycle your gadgets for
hak5 I'm Jen cutter here at CES 2011 we
are here at the Aiken labs booth to show
off some motion technology here with
Chris Aiken chris house what's going on
well well we're here at the CES our
first time at CES and we're introducing
our new motion product called immersive
motion which is a radio based motion
sensing and capture platform that can be
used virtually on any platform that
accepts USB so we have a receiver that
can connect to any platform that will
accept the USB mouse keyboard or
joystick and then we have some remote
radio sensors a little small packs that
have 3d six degree-of-freedom motion
sensing in them you have up to eight of
those attached through receiver and you
can use those any way you want so for
example you might put one on your hand
and say radio one is now my mouse I
might take another one and put on a
headband strap it to my head and say
radio tubes my joystick put another one
in my on a glove on my other hand and
say this is my gesture radio and I can
record gestures and send keyboard key
strokes out the keyboard port to be able
to interface really to any software that
you're already on so this works right
now on the pc the mac linux and also on
the ps3 we're sort of how does this work
on the ps3 well basically if the ps3
allows you to use the traditional USB
devices in a game so this plugs in and
emulate those devices so it doesn't know
that there's not a USB keyboard or a USB
mouse or USB joystick so you can add
this motion capacity even to a ps3 okay
okay so there's no cameras it's all
radio what's the distance on it because
we can accurately pretty far back that
the radios have arranged about 150 feet
actually line of sight when go about 300
feet but if you're in a home you can go
even up to 150 feet with walls and those
kind of occlusions and the thing that
really makes us different is that since
optical base you'll have to worry about
moving your furniture in the living room
you don't have to worry about the
lighting you'll have to worry about
someone walking in front of you while
you're playing because the radios really
don't care about that so we have some
really interesting advantages there the
other reason we stayed with radio is we
want we have a mobile edition that we're
in it will be introducing later in the
year at the e3 that allows you to pair
these two mobile phones so you can take
it purely portable go outside and have
motion sensing anywhere okay now with
the radio is this going to pair with any
save portable phone normally no all the
phones the phone's Bluetooth those kinda
things all share the same band okay but
the way radio technology works is use
small packets and you send those small
packets very very fast so if you do lose
a packet there's no real problem with
that because you're going to recover
instantly we get 30 times per second
every sensor is updated to the mobile
phone or to the receiver on the host
okay very cool now I saw that you so you
can save up to what 24 shortcuts I'll be
like your most in gestures to do your
shortcuts are particularly you basically
we don't really set a hard limit on how
many gestures you can have but most
people if you're going to play an app
use an application or a game you're
probably only going to have 8 to 16 or
so gestures because you'll never keep
track of them yourself okay but
technically if you were really wanted to
really look strange and wanted to text
with this you can do a gesture for every
character and really go to town in the
airport so that could and that was what
I was wondering about so is this
available now it's not available for
purchase now we will be it will be
available in second quarter we're in our
final prototyping stages and will be in
production in second quarter so you know
you can look for this sometime late mid
to late second quarter being available
on our website first and then hopefully
into distribution alright thank you very
much for more CES 2011 coverage head to
revision 3.com / VES gazelle accepts
more than 300,000 products from over 20
different electronics categories got
your eye on one of the new products over
here
yes because L can get you money for your
old gear when you upgrade stripping is
free on all items of value and in most
cases they'll even send you a box to
ship with also few green folks out there
gazelle makes all of their recycling
partners adhered to some strict policies
there's no exports no landfill policies
in tons and tons of data security
standards whether you're upgrading to a
new iPhone a new Android device or other
tech gear gazelle is a great way to get
cash to upgrade to the latest tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
