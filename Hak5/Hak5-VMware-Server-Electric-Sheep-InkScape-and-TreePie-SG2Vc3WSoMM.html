to you by godaddy netflix and
Squarespace
everybody welcome to this week's episode
of hak5 I'm Matt less doc I'm Shannon
Morse I'm Jason Abba womp and we've got
a very very Christmasy episode for you
guys today as you can see the Christmas
tree is up I've got a half Santa colors
i have only ever seen strippers where
but that's not what the show is about
we're bringing your weekly dose of
technol us here hope you guys have a
good Christmas in case for to inebriated
to wish it to you a Christmas so happy
hanukkah uh okay what else is there well
there's uh was flying spaghetti monster
happy stripper day haha head go to some
extension ya head go the strippers sup
mr. for factory duh is that tide of the
flying spaghetti monster I think so yes
all right I just found my new religion
yeah how would really ramen what but so
today we're gonna do a very special hak5
as it is the season of giving we are
going to give to you because we are very
charitable people uh or we try yeah
would you try haha so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go ahead and offer you
some of our favorite pics for free or
open-source software stuff that you can
actually use you know and not be like
loudest piece this sucks you know
Griff's yet it gives you can't regret uh
yeah cuz it's free and you know you get
those pieces of software where it's like
wow I really just wasted 20 minutes
download and then installing this yeah
we wasted very kind of son exactly so we
got we went through all of the stuff
that we use on a regular basis or stuff
that we actually find interesting and
we're going to go ahead and bring that
to you now I am going to be talking
about vmware server 2 point 0 amazing
isn't it no what is it who would have
thought Matt would talk about vmware
I'm a huge VMware fanboy but I will
always use something if something else
is better but right now so vmware's got
a crazy little thing going on where
they're actually offering their server
product for free nice and it's in my
opinion a you could use it in a real
environment because in this economy
completely free everything completely
free no strings attached it installs as
a windows you know application on top of
you know unlike ESX it's not a you know
OS itself it installs on top of linux or
windows and real quick here you know
show you guys it's absolutely retardedly
simple to set up there's two ways that
you can administer it there's via the
web and there's also you know a client
that it comes with I mean here we r you
know looking at the status of the CPU on
this box I can go ahead and if my right
click actually works wait wait wait your
Mac right clicks oh yeah right goes
hands-on it's one of those new exactly
that's how we roll but this is actually
a production box that I'm running
there's one thing that you guys should
know if you're going to install it on a
an Active Directory machine make sure
that you turn the DNS off for the local
VMware adapters that it solves for your
network drives so you can you know
install it and installs just like any
other application does and create new
virtual machines load linux load windows
i use it for you know small businesses
people who don't have the ability to buy
four five six different servers I mean
you know so but we're going to go into
more detail I'm going to go into more
detail in this on a later episode and
look forward to actually compiling a
list of things that people need to know
about installing it and you know what
you know some other caveats are but it
is completely free VMware com vmware
server two point O one workstation
fusion are also and I just didn't I
don't have that anymore
disappeared Chris is showing Chris tell
me out here give me the teleprompter Oh
fifty percent off work station infusion
are fifty percent off January fit with
the code vm w happy holidays alright
that's hella praise a good deal and I
actually got 10 licenses half off for
the Christmas sale a vmware fusion for
my office but highly recommend vian were
products and it was not a sponsor it was
just let you guys know yeah use cuz
we're giving and caring to you guys see
right there yeah just keep giving we
didn't keep giving and giving and giving
so jason is here yeah what are you
giving us i'm giving you tree pie to
find all the way but you can't trick all
right oh I thought tree pie was tree pop
oh yeah you can't eat your chiny the
tree it's not like apple pie on a tree
it's a very cool application that allows
you to go through and find all the files
that you might have lost or find space
that you might not know you had and are
using okay so i've got this application
up and you've got you've got your
directory so pretty it is pretty it kind
of makes me happy here is it to pie it
is funny well inside of the you can go
up you can drill down and go up so what
we have here is a directory and it shows
you how much space it is up in the top
corner over here and then what director
you're actually looking at and then you
can go ahead and highlight different
sections and see what directory there
are and the cool part is you can drill
down and just see okay that has one
directory but what you can see is if you
open up your C Drive you can go through
and select parts of it and go through
and say okay well my documents well why
am I using 20 gigs when I have you know
two Word documents in there well you may
have files that are further down the
directory tree you just didn't know
we're there right so this allows you to
go through fine wish you had or find
what you've lost or find stuff you
didn't know you had that would probably
have worked really well for me I
recently was like why am I the same
exact scenario and I was like whoa weird
at all miss base go I have
we no clue right um have ended up that I
had a virtual machine that I completely
forgot about it was just like 60 gigs
it's gone completely gone I had no idea
wow you know on a hard drive it's only
you know five hundred 200 gigs you know
half your data's gone get him a temp
directory that's taking up you know 15
gigs you wouldn't even know it yeah
that's one thing you know a lot of
people don't and that's that's another
good point is a lot of times when people
are you know installing a bunch of stuff
and installing you know uninstalling
stuff like that you know the temp
directory a lot of times some installers
they're just like I'm just gonna leave
it there yeah yeah 11 hours yeah oh so
sad about it um vmware actually did it
to me once but they fixed it where it
would leave like an 800 Meg extracted
file just chillin there or like
downloaded files were just open in view
oh that doesn't get deleted yeah yeah so
I mean it okay I'm gonna have to
download down and probably run that
because I probably got I mean and
everybody does oh yeah definitely just
from you know regular usage this
computer alone had it's an 88 car drive
it at 10 gigs just work so where can
they find us they just search google for
tree pi over go ahead and there's
sourceforge or it's a tree pi sf.net
cool all right and uncle Shannon um I
have an itch what's your itch for I have
h for Gibbs what kind of gives wait what
sounds like personal fuck it kind of
does damn it i really hope i was gonna
get away with uh Gibbs frags Oh frags
okay see I understand the frogs well
gives us a Canadian oh I haven't been up
to Canada in a long time do ya damn
canadians you know let's play quake
three that was my idea so you don't like
wait three you can write me hate mail I
don't care mad at god org you're like
wait I love quake three me and Darren
are pretty much matched every time that
we play Craig quake three Craig three
creeks 333 I mean I am talking like
we're pretty good at the game and it
case it's so
much fun when you have like 20 people
into this know what I think we're going
to do but I think we're going to do is
I'm going to set the server and we're
gonna do like one of the times i'm going
to set up instagib on the book on the
machine one here one is just double bowl
so where we play we're playing at q3 dot
hak5 org and that's gonna be on January
tent by the way okay just so you guys
know yeah and also just want to thank
our sponsor netflix with Netflix you can

no-risk two week free trial membership
if you go to WWF IV or netflix com hak5
and by the way guys don't forget the WWE
next step we're going to take a break
hey guys welcome back to hack 5 and our
happy freeware edition of everybody
because you know in this gunman take a
drink stuff for free is fun yes so
Shannon you've got some fun electric
stuff electric animals electric animals
what tell us about this they make babies
and have parents and they okay well yeah
just take it a bit but that's what they
do all right take your step okay well
let me show you a sample just so you get
an idea of what this looks like before I
start talking about it um it's called
electric sheep which you can find at
Electric Sheep gorg hmm yes and it's
basically this screensaver that you can
download that changes it's not always
the same thing like your usual
screensavers is fluffy sheep no but it
kind of works like a sheep um it's kind
of a home and you know how does it work
like a sheep it looks nothing like as
babies soda frogs couldn't be electric
Ross why is it called electric sheep the
person that created this um god I don't
remember his name really like sheep it
was Scott Draves Scott Draves created
this kind of us as a homeage to the book
called do androids dream of electric
sheep will have to ask data yes that's a
good idea sure you should ask I'll get
him Merc nanny unsewn okay so um so it's
a screen saver but it does special stuff
like what do you like reducing its first
time that you download it the best thing
to do is probably run it just leave your
screensaver on overnight and it'll start
downloading all these different kinds of
videos all these different trippy
Patterson does it automatically go start
doing this or yeah it automatically
starts doing it and these sheep you'll
start out with basically the the brand
name one's pretty much and then these
brand name ones will start mutating into
different ones so your screen savers
start mingling and then they sharing
some DNA and then you get like so sure
you want to rub up against each other
and then they catch it basically so so
how do you so how do you get these
screens are like where do these screen
savers come from somebody gave birth to
him obviously right Yes not only Scotch
raised but tons of people around the
world thousands actually they've they've
created there
and sheep and depending on how people
vote for these because when you're
running them you can either choose the
up arrow or down arrow to vote for your
favorite ones oh just like we're going
to put your battled yeah exactly cuz
your case oh let's uh okay so so you get
this you start mingling with the Sheep
you vote for the ones you like and then
it's natural selection yeah the ones
that nobody is almost by Hulton the ones
that nobody like they may die in like
six or seven days and it actually says
they die wow that's so cool so you know
so you can make your own and see if they
survive you can make your own some of
them have been around for hundreds and
hundreds of days some only hours so the
ones that have been around for hundreds
of days must have got a lot of votes are
they just lucky they've gotten lots of
votes and they've also started to mingle
with other ones and create new forms
okay so actually how do you write these
like how do you make your own sheep you
can actually go here it's open source
code that you can you can check it out
at the wiki I think it's like C++ mm-hmm
Anna so there's like a scripting
language or something like that where
you can yank you around if you're into
sheep language as you will cheap why I'm
not much of a coder that's okay I'll
teach you what job there so I haven't
created my own shots going to start off
you can also check out there's oh where
is it you can check out the different
pictures on their website and from these
pictures you can go into the different
uh like a thumbnail of this game yeah
it's something all of the screen saver
and you'll bring you to not only the
thumbnail but the code that was created
for that okay so you can learn by the
others example so you can like go in and
look at someone's and maybe see that
their lineage yeah you can you can see
their lineage you can see like where
they got the idea Oh cheap tremont and
then you can see all the little people
that they got that were created from
this one image it's really cool love it
better than your average and I just love
how it changes a dynamic changing yeah
it's really pretty it's a much be really
cool it guys but even cooler sweet all
right well thank you yeah that was
electric sheep org if you want to check
it out and I'll probably talk about it a
little bit on my site smit see nice I
have a fun piece of software to talk
about going with the theme is kind of a
it's an open-source equivalent to
illustrator if you if
if any way photoshop is to GIMP as
illustrator is to this inkscape yes and
it's basically it allows you to edit SVG
or scalable vector graphic files and
create illustration I have them pulled
up here of evil server and and if you
actually hit up the hak5 wiki you can
find some more of like the cast and
whatnot and it's your standard if you
ever used an illustration program it's
the standard kind of deal where you
start putting in like pen points so make
one here and then you can do your
training here okay I see and and then
based on the different you know alt keys
and whatnot modifiers you can you can
change the properties of these and uh
and really get creative yeah well and
well yeah definitely and then he's
already yeah yellow though well then I
just picked that word there and then
thank you my good grab a circle here and
give him a little blue power pellet
which now is more about now he is yellow
amazing right beautiful art right there
oh there several pounds uh it's actually
if you've ever used a any graphical
program it works very similar yeah like
if you select an object everything is an
object everything that none of this is
bitmap based so there's a support
proprietary formats as well or you can
import some of the proprietary formats I
think I'm not positive you can you can
do illustrator and so everything is
vector so you can zoom in infinitely and
you'll still look good and a math yeah
ray so of course if you can do anything
with like print shops whatever going to
get anything printed they lot of times
one doctor yeah definitely all want
vector yeah so I definitely recommend
you give it a shot if you're feeling
artistic and creative and you know i'm
not going to shell out like whatever and
alex is for the creative suite so yeah i
got that right sure it there's something
else about a perfect oh yeah that's
right everything is an object so like
you right click on unlike an object you
can like are not up there but like over
here you can send it forward and back
and you can change the properties of the
object like if you want to make certain
great one groove exactly yeah I used to
be proficient about this
I said it only took me a night of
playing around with it to become
proficient and then I probably forgot it
but companion like you usually do with
everything anyway oh I'm so burned all
right okay so why don't we why don't we
burn somebody with some trivia yes um
actually we're not going to do trivia
this week yeah we're not so we're doing
trivia there's not a new year because
we're doing New Year's episode and
Christmas Eve episode back to back
thanks Nick so well tonight from
vacation and actually like how breathe
for a moment yeah dude we're going on
vacation no we train changed up trivia
and how it works so we've randomly
selected a winner you want here I'll
pull up the the trivia question around
this one I could just say it okay sure
what was it what was the catalyst for
this image there it is transformation
it's this image of lunch from dragonball
z and her transformation from the nice
innocent brown haired or purple haired
girl to the really evil like shooting up
guns and everything blonde chick was
sneezing and that was the only answer
that we were looking for right because
you can't have an anime without a
transformation exactly what does snubs
transformation look like like Shannon
Shannon Morse like mild-mannered girl
justice nubs like you know an erotic
action figure superhero girl I'm just
saying all right so the winner I'm sorry
oh sorry the winner was Matty D hey
congratulations Matt ed and his answer
was what she is a girl with the ability
to change personalities and looks when
she sneezed and that's all we needed was
gesundheit so and Kenny and that he's
getting a dual cores latest city it's
lost reality it sounds awesome it's good
to sit so check it out um good good
nerdcore love it and you can of course
go over to hack 5 org slash trivia when
we have trivia questions in the new year
to pop in the password and get the
question submit your answer and then we
will randomly draw a winner it's a lot
more fair yay so are we giving them a
pass
right this week no not until the new
year so sorry a little bit of a break
nope that well there was something but
it's not trivia all right and I got to
thank our sponsors Oh daddy thank you go

next up we're going to take a break and
we're going to have a couple more little
hacky snacks for ya segments finally
hey guys welcome back to the cluster
cluck and check it out it's Paul by
camera BOTS guide to life all the camera
bond i lied i love it camera BOTS too
there you go oh so we've been doing the
freeware segment show d ly um I'm
apparently the most badass mac guy in
the house trumping Matt I did two to one
because apparently I have 93
applications install compared to hold on
let me bring up his just destroyed the
mac uh 30 the default applications so
I'm going to just kind of blow through
this this is just kind of you know name
recognition is given a little brief
history so if you look at my Mac here
I'm actually not on my mac it's I'm just
kind of connected via yay happy show on
door by Shaw yeah 1password one password
i'm using because of i'm using my iphone
as my password saver um i installed it i
don't really use the desktop application
i just kind of keep it on my iphone but
if you're that kind of person you want
to sink that stuff keep a local copy
it's not freeware but it's on there I
don't know why I said that I don't know
why I have this this 7-zip who knows
there's a bunch of the ones for that
what else do we get our have UN archive
a bunch or browser I don't know where I
found this one from but apparently it's
dope sauce because it just kind of does
this weird uh I don't know I can't watch
anything let's see what happens when we
start launching applications on matts
now all right so you say bunch of like
crazy stuff on here so you start seeing
like iTunes digital control protocols
you know they sharing Shannon's library
it shows the IP with a port it doesn't
require a password like what I've been
talking about stop freaking out oh you
know just it's it's interesting
informational purposes only of course
yes yeah okay alright so with that one
um turn ahead launch with 100 Meg
patient and wire in this place someone
recommended this one in the IRC when
we're trying to figure out how to do uh
I don't know some screencaps multi-cam
multicam switching apps and like I
install this and haven't deleted it
because it actually sucks and so ignore
that one I her chicken of the VNC my
recommended VNC client for OS X oddly
enough there is alternatives but I got
to bring up Matt's stuff thank you I
like more the VNC I like beef Olivia
community we're going to go to actually
Makka my system because library for
services like totally you are totally
talking over mean these guys are
assholes I was weakly pulled screen
sharing screen sharing is a default app
installed with the OS X leopard 10.5 it
has BNC capabilities it has it doesn't
have a rdp but uh it's come station for
a free are DPF go check out cord cord I
have that installed on actually it's a
not the next one but it's in here okay
um try to shut up Paul we gotta go buddy
go um shit I don't know what that well
this is growing numbers in front of him
he's completely owed to own tool is
perfect for the iphone people especially
if you have an older one because 3g it's
not cracking yes it's over way yeah
buddy can jailbreak yeah we can't uh put
him on a you can't get the yeah the
booter huh and cracked other dude okay i
was corrected by Matt but definitely a
phone school is that by the iphone dev
team
recommend them a lot I got quicktime
broadcast or some stupid reason mac the
ripper you can download you know just
that you can break Hambrick it doesn't
give you the actual TS video files I
think we could do an entire Mac show and
that's what we're gonna have to get from
all the view actually about one thing
you ate like I wrote that application
hugging software development but no now
let me get the last one VLC VLC on the
mac is awesome it is also on every
platform yeah it can do amazing stuff
recently I've found out that can even do
screen captures you have your actual
desktop so if you're just looking for a
quick and dirty way to do screencaps it
is right there for you love it all right
all right see there are max here in the
hack house yeah told you I use one every
day I'm every week on the show I I don't
know there are you think it's just a
skin I can't see any man that can like
when is 98 of course you did screen doc
whenever it goes way later alright so we
are talking about Squarespace yes
Squarespace is hosting our hak5 land
party so that's where you can go and get
all the details about the quake three
land that we are having and I wanted to
show you a cool feature about squares
space because I told you guys I probably
freaked out last week about how awesome
it is and let me just show you how
awesome it is so that's the cool thing
about square salon with tangent that's
cool thing about Squarespace they don't
have ad copy they just say listen try
not say which actually think and this is
actual to thank the limit value some
cool stuff right so I've created this
tournament signup form it took like no
time at all i've done signup forms
before and like PHP and I mean if
there's nothing okay so that's just my
my food right so I don't have a decent
template or whatever right but I mean
rather than code your own you could just
come in here on Squarespace view like
got a square space page it created a
tournament signup daily and it was super
simple to add a add a signup form here
so let me show you how this works so if
i go into
the content editing mode I can actually
come here and start messing with it and
I can add a new field it's as easy just
clicking below link I'm see I'm in the
web page I don't have to go into any
code and I'm going to choose a so we're
just real in the web page as nobody else
today yes it's like a rest at it it's
like a winky but you don't have to go
into the code like an 80s with yeah it's
like in real time goodness so I'm going
to create new field I'm gonna call it oh
come on guys is I'm gonna call it we
friend code and and there we go I'm just
required field no I'm gonna hit save
done gonna add a new field i'm gonna say
oh I don't know um xbox live friendly
thing tag sure whatever it's called to
and then i'm done i mean i go back to
see that's what you guys see it took me
that much like wow and when i created it
all i had to do was tell it what field
is the email address field and it
automatically says do you want to save
this to an excel spreadsheet on your
Squarespace folder or whatever where you
actually have to ask your data
management stuff or do you want to do an
email to an adjacent I'm so basically
it's retarded Loserville retardedly
simple and you can get retarded simple
over at squarespace.com and for belongs
corporate and when you and when you guys
check out use coupon code hak5 and very
ten percent off the life of your account
over at square space suits key yeah
buddy go blue yep now you know yeah I
just blew your mind hot saddle see oh
that was amazing posts work by the way
thank you the whole mind exploding thank
ya cool I'm gonna have to edit this
really studied but i think that is our
