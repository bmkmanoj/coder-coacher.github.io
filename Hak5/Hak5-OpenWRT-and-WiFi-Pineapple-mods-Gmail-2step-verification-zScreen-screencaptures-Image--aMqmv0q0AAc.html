utility in the world image burning md5
integrity verification and the Auto
rickrolling rollercoaster router um do
all that and more this time on hack five
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by goto assist express support smarter
with go to assist Express freshbooks
online invoicing and domain comm your
next big idea starts at domain.com hello
welcome back my name is Gary kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse this is your weekly dose
of Technol s hey how was NAB I'm so
sorry I missed it have an NAB hangover
Oh
hence the beer that's not gonna help you
know there's like a period of time where
after which if you stay in Vegas it's no
good yes you end up getting the
conscious yeah we got the CES flow well
this was the same place the CES was held
but yeah I think we stayed one day too
long in Vegas and that's just misery see
you guys we saw some awesomes don't
leave the house you missed a bunch of
goods you MIT leave what fastest oh you
checking out in Foursquare and all the
vineyards and okay yeah crazy one girl I
went whining Wow I saw a video mixers
for under $1000 oh cool I can see why
you and Paul would enjoy this convention
we loved it that's our technology I
watched last week's episode and it was
awesome see ya I really should go back
and watch last week's episode even
though it's not about a can seriously
enjoyed it yeah look at this show is
about some hacking we got some great
stuff on the episode do and I'm looking
forward to making some Rick rolls happen
automatically yeah you'll find out it's
gonna let's just go ahead and start it
off with some hacker headlines as you
guys know we've been following this
story and Sony and George Hotz
called a truce settling outside of court
the famed ps3 hacker Gio ha agreed not
to quote engage in any unauthorized
access to any Sony products under the
law whatever anyway it goes on and on
basically he's gonna be a good boy now
and not hacking Sony products which is
behind because he's packed a ton of
other stuff immaterial move on anyway
following the settlement though Potts
donated $10,000 to the Electronic
Frontier Foundation $10,000 this was the
money left over from his legal defense
fund that was a you know the donations
and everything okay all right good to
see that that's really cool so thanks
hots yeah you're awesome so guess who
made a boo-boo
Skype yeah Android police found this
little vulnerability and the Skype app
for Android wear it seems that the
sql-like three databases were all your
chat logs and info is stored yeah that
was never protected mm-hmm Skype forgot
to encrypt the databases oops so that
means a rogue app could potentially
steal data out of your Skype app and
send it back to invent guys Android
police actually created this application
called Skype owned which is kind of cute
on the name just to show you how easy it
was to how the breach can actually
affect you so whoops
yes mom 777 is never good smart smart
chmod how are you ducking out so I can
say however I want revealed at the this
kind of related where 2.0 conference
this week security researchers published
details on how I phones and 3G iPads
have been periodically logging your
location since iOS 4.0 the file
consolidated DB has been storing
timestamps with latitude and longitude
coordinates yeah so we certainly glad I
don't have a 3G oh good yeah talking
about proof of concept apps the
researchers published an open source
tool dubbed iPhone tracker which
basically maps your devices stored
locations who isn't storing a location
Susan oh my god
so okay Skype wasn't the only one that
made a little oopsie they weren't the
only one with trouble brewing WordPress
comm servers were hacked pretty deep
root access level deep to be exact they
say a bunch of customers source codes
were accessible so they're having the
vulnerable sites changed their passwords
and api's the breach was on automatic
palm servers to be exact and there the
software company behind WordPress
platform obviously a lot of information
was viewable but hopefully all of the
customers have already fixed any issues
and api's and whatnot on their sites
all right well are we one of those no no
no so time for something a lot happier
the mad scientist's over a photonic
induction bring us happiness because
they have shared with the world of video
of their destruction of CDs it's a
racing date off of a CD by spinning it
between two high voltage transformer
thanks Epping through someone joy that's
awesome yeah alright yeah anyway it's
time for the happy do you want to
capture print screens and share them but
you don't want to go through the hassle
of saving uploading and all of that jazz
why don't you try Z screen Z screen will
automatically capture screenshots text
or files from your computer clipboard
and upload them to a destination of your
choice as well as have to link to it
automatically copied to your computer
when it's completed simply downloads
this Z screen from code.google.com and
install now I've already installed it
right over here
once it's installed you can choose your
destination for images files and text
and the type of URL shortener that you
would like to use so I've chosen Flickr
pastebin rapidshare and is good for any
of my URLs under destinations right here
you can authenticate and authorize a
screen to upload to your FTP your image
check your flickr even your Twitter page
and tons of others for myself for this
example I'm going to upload straight to
my flickr page so i'll go over to flickr
and all i had to do was type in my
username click step 1 authenticate and
it takes me over to the web page to
authenticate 'ok now z screen uses OAuth
so all of it requires is your username
not your password and it will
authenticate right through your flickr
website you can even choose settings
such as what window you want the print
screen to copy and after you've done it
you can add a watermark you can add tons
of other options once you've gotten all
of your settings squared away
hit your favorite hotkey and watch as
your image gets uploaded to your account
automatically
prtscn now if I go over to my Flickr you
can see that I've been doing a whole lot
of print screens today okay and here we
have my print screen so I hit print
screen and my full-size image gets
uploaded to my Flickr it's just like
that and after it's uploaded
I can easily copy the link from my
clipboard anywhere I want so I can go up
here click paste and it should take me
automatically there we go to the full
screen image the link is also saved in
the Z screen if I ever need to go in
there and find it again under the
history tab right there you can also
find the local path if you need to find
the image downloaded on your computer
it's a great time-saver and it's perfect
for taking really easy notes on your
screen and sharing them with others
thanks to Patrick F for sending this in
to us do you have a time saver or
something really cool to share email
tips at hack 5 org and we'll share them
and now a word from our sponsor I'm here
to tell you about a tool that's gonna
save you a lot of time and money and
make you look like a hero in front of
your clients and colleagues that's right

what could possibly be more fun than a
Wi-Fi pineapple I have a 1 that
automatically Rick rolls people because
it's 2007 no no seriously this is all
part of a bigger scheme that we're gonna
be talking about more of next week and
that is a lot of fun with spearfishing
but I wanted to do kind of like a just a
fun little trick that you can do with
not just at a Wi-Fi pineapple but really
any open wrt based routers you guys know
I'm a huge fan of that open source
project there you might be able to do
this with like say dd-wrt as well but it
got linux on your router this is going
to be fun
now I actually ran into John Bebo at
shmoocon or nas from con Def Con Def Con
18 and he showed me his Auto rickrolling
pineapple it's in the DEFCON episode it
was a lot of fun he's got a great blog
post about it over at Bebo blog John
Bebo comm and I also got to give props
to psychosis who did a great job
outlining all of the good stuff that you
need to do in the yoga forms a hack 5 -
forms if this is something that you
would like to play with now so since
we're gonna be building on these
techniques next week I figured why don't
we just go ahead and dive right in and
start setting up basically a completely
self-contained pineapple we're not going
to hit like right now I'm tethered to it
via ethernet but when this is all said
and done I can just plug this battery
pack into it leave it somewhere and have
it well for right now it's just going to
rickroll people but maybe later we'll
make it do some evil bidding so I'm
already logged in to 192.168.1.1 on port
1471 and this right here is your main
control status window for yoga I
actually had a client here a second ago
see if he's still in the logs it's weird
like I'm I'm here in the studio putting
this together and this guy connected
thinking he was part of a network called
a CT and I had him for about an hour
until I just turned karma off for this
demonstration but anyway so as you can
see karma is off because this is this
one is right out of the box just how you
know they they come and we're going to
make all of the modifications so that
this not only you know does what we want
does the automatic karma bit but it will
also take any web traffic that they're
going to and forward it to our evil web
page of an
now there's a couple of things that
we're gonna need to get started I've
already got them on my USB Drive and you
can find those at the hack 5 site where
I've got these hosted the first files
that I'm gonna want to transfer over to
my pineapple are DHCP network and
wireless now I already have what is it
called winscp running here and I'm
logged into my machine or into my
pineapple here and I'm going to just
drag and drop these over now what would
be doing this in Linux I should preface
that you know just using the SCP command
but I'm having some problems with the
stability of what was it black bun - and
I didn't want this to crash and for some
reason Windows is stable on my very
picky laptop at the moment so we're just
going to do it that way but if you're a
linux guy you know how to SCP how to SSH
so now that I've got these SCPD over
I've copied my files with winscp I'm
gonna pull up putty and connect one onto
two one six eight dot one dot one root
and pineapples are yummy so already I'm
in /root LS LS and there are my files
now those files are what we were going
to replace our current configuration
files and those live in /e TC and config
and if I LS there I see I have network
DHCP and Wireless I'm going to go ahead
and make a backup of these so that if I
ever want to revert my pineapple to you
know its default state I can go ahead
and do that just by doing CP or actually
in this case I'm gonna MV I'm going to
move them or rename them because I
already have the new copies of the good
stuff here
so I'm going to move DHCP to DHCP back
and a move Wireless to the same thing
Wireless dot back and again network to
network
dot back great so if I just do CD and
back to my root I can see that they're
there I'm gonna move all of this to et
Cie config and there we go now there's a
couple other configuration pad that I
need to make so first of all I'm going
to need to actually put together the web
page that is going to do this this
rickrolling thankfully that's already
done for us by Bevo and it's these files
here the index.html as well as these two
an mp3 in a WAV file and
gonna go ahead and copy those over to my
pineapple all right my files are copied
now it's just a matter of putting them
in our WW route and in this instance it
is in /ww so if i LS again there they
are I think can move all of that to /ww
now that means that I have my index of
HTML file there on the root of my web
server so if I were to say here in
Chrome I've got it pointed at
192.168.1.1 on port 1471 the default
karma interface if I for instance go to
just the root of this there we go so
I've got my rickroll happening it's got
some ASCII graphics it's real cool right
but we want that to happen every time
anybody goes to any web site because
this it is right now if I go to like
Google or something it's yeah I don't
want to go to Google I want this to be
completely self-contained and not
actually offering up real internet but
forwarding anybody that tries to go
anywhere to this page is gonna be really
annoying so what I need to do now that
that's moved over to my WW is take a
look at my DNS masquerading
configuration file now that by default
doesn't exist the file doesn't actually
exist on this box so we're gonna have to
go ahead and create it so that lives in
slash et Cie and I can LS DNS star and
see that I already have a DNS mask
options but I don't have a DNS mask
kampf
so I just use you that use the touch
command to create that file DNS mask
Kampf I think I need to serve I to edit
it or nano or whatever you like I'm
gonna hit I for insert and what we need
to do is actually go ahead and add add
this and it's address equals slash pound
slash and then the address of the web
server that we want to forward it to and
in this case 192 168 1.1 I'm gonna hit
escape : X to save I can cat that and
see that it is set up so what is this
what is this / pound slash well that is
saying any website now this could be
like slash gmail.com slash
and then anybody that goes to gmail.com
would end up going to this web server
here in this case the machine itself 1 n
2 1 6 8 1 at 1 the pineapple the pound
is actually a wild card that is
specifying any website you go to which
is really cool now there's a there's one
other big configuration change that I
want to make before I restart this and I
can go ahead and leave it stand alone
hiding anywhere right and that is to set
this up so that will automatically start
using the the karma or the bit that
actually listens for those probe
requests and replies and says yes I'm
your wireless access point connect to me
write the part that really makes the
pineapple pineapple right so while all
of this other stuff is pretty generic
for any open wrt based router that you
may want to set up as a honeypot this
right here is the only part that's
specific to the pineapple and in this
case I if I look at my interface here I
see karma is currently off right and
that's why I don't have any more fun
clients hanging out with me and I want
this to be totally self-contained so I
can just put a battery pack on it turn
it on and not have to worry about you
know logging into it and setting it up I
just you know carry this around not a
laptop or whatever so what I'm going to
do is go back to my SSH and I want to
come over to etc' / and knit dot d and
in there I will find the file
Yas Agha if I cat that this right here
is actually the script that starts up on
boot and it's going to this is what
you're going to use to start and stop
the odds ago that's when you click this
right here change karma - on and off
that's what it's initializing so what
we'll do is or this is the startup of it
so this is going to happen every time
the machine boots now what we're going
to do is actually modify this just a bit
so again vie Yas Agra and the first
thing I want to do is come over here to
the iptables command and actually put a
pound in front of it or I could hit DD
to remove the line if I didn't want that
anymore and then again right under all
of this stuff but before stop this is
within the start function within you
know the curly brackets that is the
function start I want to go ahead and in
turn a couple of commands so the first
one is W land config 88 0
create WLAN dev Wi-Fi 0w land mode
master to waka amp 1 waka slash dev
slash null next we're going to do IW
probe a th zero karma 1 and bridge
control ad interface BR land at zero and
finally ifconfig at 0 up and hit escape
: x to save that out now I'm gonna go
ahead and issue reboot now what is that
done we've we've changed our
configuration so that it'll
automatically bring up karma so it's
listening for those progra quests it's
automatically going to start replying
and saying yes I'm your access point no
intervention is necessary I don't need
to pull out my laptop and log into port
14 71 or anything like that
DNS masquerading has been set up so that
whatever website you try to go to when
you automatically connect to this
through karma is going to take you to
the website 192.168.1.1 which we have
been crafty enough to put in our /ww
that's too many WS directory the index
set HTML as well as the wave in the mp3
that are going to start playing our
rickroll
so hopefully this guy is back up and
running after the reboot now emulating
just like I would be if I were
wirelessly connected to here I'm on my
karma interface and I can see that karma
is currently on it came up right up on
boot and if I try to go to any other
website like say google.com
Facebook never go to Yahoo
that's right I know that's what's
happening now we're gonna pick this up
next week with a lot more of
spearfishing with the same kind of
techniques and hang out I'm gonna close
that and I hope you guys enjoyed that
let me know if you have any questions
feedback at hak5 org is the place to
send that bye and yeah let us know what
you think and in just a bit we're going
to have more about education and fun
stuff like that but first it's time for
Shannon with this week's trivia our last
trivia question was what is the name of
this prominent computer club that was
founded in Berlin in 1981 and the answer
was Chaos Computer Club this week's
trivia question is what is the name of
this virus considered the first known
use of polymorphic code hmm answer at
hak5 org slash trivia for a chance to
win some swag and now a word from our
sponsor fresh books is an easy-to-use
online invoicing service that saves you
time and gets you paid faster and makes
you look professional extra promise you
might actually like invoicing I know I

hear about us just put it in hack 5
that's it you don't know it doesn't have
to be your birthday or anything and you
know just who doesn't love birthday
cakes right fresh books calm free easy
online invoicing hey Shannon check it
out
speedy thing goes in
although I know all of you out there
protect your online accounts like crazy
there is always a way to get more
protection maybe you don't like using an
encryption program or you'd use the same
password for all of your sites although
the latter is really bad I think all of
us have done it once or twice in the
past right yeah me too
so perhaps you want to try something new
I just discovered Gmail's two-step
verification process for my Google Mail
account I've been a little paranoid
lately with all of the cyber attacks
going on so I decided to up my security
especially because my email is the one
site I really really don't want hacked
because that would be really bad yeah
2-step verification can help prevent
unauthorized access by someone that
might have just stolen a password now
when I sign into Gmail I'll not only
need my password but also a code that
generates on my phone you might be
thinking well what if your phone gets
sold stolen in that case I also set up a
passcode on my phone a series of random
numbers that only I remember and I set
it so that if I try brute-forcing the
passcode after 10 wrong codes it'll wipe
my phone I also set up Find My iPhone so
that if it ever gets lost I can also
remote wipe it which is great so back to
Gmail because this is not the Apple show
when setting this up the first thing
you're going to need is your phone if
you don't have a secure phone nearby
when you sign up into Gmail perhaps this
isn't the tool for you but that's okay
first thing you do is click on 2-step
verification so that's under your
account settings go down there and
you'll see an under personal settings
under security so you click on the first
time you do it it says setup 2-step
verification I've done it a couple of
times on this account turned it on and
off so now it says using 2-step
verification and it's having me sign
back in so you click on setup 2-step
verification and then you select a phone
and choose your phone androids
BlackBerry's and iPhones have this cool
little Google Authenticator app that
will generate all of your random codes
you very nifty the first time you open
the app which I'll do right now so the
first time you open the app it'll ask me
to scan a QR code with my phone's camera
so on my phone I'm gonna choose the
iPhone it tells me to download the
Google Authenticator app which I already
did click Next and it gives me this QR
code on my computer this QR code
generates your first series of random
digits and it ties you the phone holder
to your Gmail account if you don't have
a useable camera or you can't read the
QR code choose to create a time-based
key instead and then type in your secret
key from your computer into your phone
so I'm gonna go ahead and take a picture
of mine cuz mine does work which is
awesome scan barcode I just had to click
the little plus sign in the application
and there we go
it gives me hack 5 test 2 at gmail.com
and the verification code which I will
use once is one five six zero one seven
and I click verify your iPhone device is
now configured click Next to continue
now after I click Next and I take my
photo and it verified for me Gmail is
then going to ask me to set up a backup
in case my phone is lost or stolen which
would be no good next you need to have a
printer or a safe place to save all of
your backup codes because when you click
Next you get this series of backup codes
I had a printer installed luckily so I
printed all of my backup codes to make
it nice and simple on me you don't
necessarily have to print them if you
don't feel like it or if you feel
insecure about it worried that you're
gonna lose them you can also save them
to a encrypted hard drive or whatever
you need to do each of these codes is
going to let me sign in one time on my
gmail account so after I've printed this
and I verified with Gmail that I printed
it scroll down here click yes I have a
copy of my backup verification clothes
then I choose a backup phone now this
phone can be a home phone a spouse's
phone girlfriend/boyfriend whatever type
in the phone number and then you can
test it if you want so this phone is
good because if you lose your phone your
iPhone Android Blackberry device if you
still have a blackberry
then you can also have it call this home
phone and give you a voice authenticated
verifiable gmail verified number so I
set up my personal number or my personal
gmail account with my home phone and
then when I tested it it called me and
less left me this nice little voicemail
message with a new generated code when
you hit next you can confirm your
account and then you turn on 2-step
verification okay so it gives me a nice
little green checkmark telling me that
is it's a verified phone number I click
next because I didn't really want it to
test you can call my home when nobody's
there and then I turn on 2-step
verification now it tells me I'm turning
it on I'm gonna be signed out of all my
Google accounts on all devices including
Gmail on my iPhone all mobile
applications so I click OK that's cool
no problem and I log back in first time
I login I'll need my Google code off the
app seven four eight four zero six
verify who ride verified you when you
first log in you'll type in your account
name password and then the verification
code you can also Cho choose if you want
the code remembered for 30 days or if
you want it to ask you for a new code
every single time you log in it's up to
you whatever you feel like doing
whatever you feel comfortable with just
do that you'll then notice that after
you turn on 2-step verification all your
device is tied to your gmail account
like my gmail account on my phone are
logged out so Gmail for iPhone the mail
app etc they don't have a place for a
verification codes so to help your
security you'll need to setup an
application-specific password to do this
under the 2-step verification main page
which if you logged out and you didn't
get to this page again you just go under
my accounts under your name up here and
you click on using 2-step verification
so you get there and you choose
application-specific passwords so I go
under manage application specific
passwords re login because it's super
secure now
okay so you get to choose a name for
your device for example my iPhone is
going to be Shannon's iPhone generate
password okay so I click Next and I see
a series of letters and numbers that all
have to type into my iPhone so I type in
my username and my phone generated
password and it's really long so I'll do
this really quick and it logs me in so I
only have to do this one time ever so I
won't need to necessarily remember that
really long code on the website but you
might be thinking what happens if
somebody gets ahold of Shannon's iPhone
luckily under the code you can see my
iPhone if I choose revoke all of my
access to my mail will be logged out of
my iPhone
until I authorize it again right here so
I can see application-specific passwords
there Shannon's iPhone creation date
tells me when I did that and I hit
revoke and it's gone no more lists under
here which is great if at any time I
need to print new codes or I need to
change my phones I can go under account
settings to set verification and edit
anything that I need I can even turn off
two-step verification if I also need to
do that for example if your showing you
guys how they do it
I love two-step verification I've been
using it for maybe a month and a half
now and it's great I mean it's helped me
a lot so it makes me feel a lot more
secure about my meal personal
information it's perfect if you guys
have questions comments or you have
another program for me for my security
email feedback at hak5 org and now it's
time for kirby's bat command of the week
do you need a website about a website
for 875 a month that's right you can get
that over at domain.com they've got
wonderful hosting plans starting from
875 all the way to their Ultra plan for
$15.99 it's great service they've been
hosting hak5 org for over a year now we
couldn't be happier
you got domain names for under 10 bucks
a year and you can even get private
registration so nobody can see who you
are in the Whois database I recommend
that if you need domain registration if
you need a web host go ahead and check
them out they've got blistering fast DNS
infrastructure they got some of the
lowest prices on the web and honestly
they've been so good to us and our hak5
fans because you just tweet at
domain.com they get right back to you
they're good people go ahead and head
over to domain comm save yourself 15% at
checkout when you use coupon code 8 a k5
your next big idea starts at domain.com
that's just about wraps up this episode
of hack 5 but before we get going we've
got a lot of awesome emails as well as
your tech most weather of the week check
out Shannon we got this really good one
in from max ass he says he's been
watching the show since season 6 and
since then we mentioned this program
konbu had a lot of fun with that one I
know your sister's laptop with that um I
tried to or no no that that's right that
was off crack wasn't it the ring with
everyone anyway either of those
basically breaking into Windows systems
it's a really great tool he said he was
curious add to try it and he downloaded
the program successfully but he was not
and he was able to extract it with
winrar but when he burned it to a blank
CD it said it didn't work and he's he's
not sure if he's missing something if
you got you got some tips on that Hey
well I checked out the combat website
cuz it has been updated since the last
time like way back when when we did a
segment on it and they're saying they're
currently having hosting problems so
make sure to check that checksum before
you're using the file so ok a checksum
that's basically the md5 hash inside of
the file that gives the identity of the
file and it tells you that it hasn't
been like screwed up during the process
of downloading it no two files are gonna
be the same they're all gonna have a
unique hash signature right exactly so I
downloaded this command called fast some
this tool called FAFSA where you can
open up a file yeah let me find it real
quick in here so you've already
downloaded Khan boot from the website
yeah I downloaded com boot slash all dot
zip from the website
I haven't even unzipped it or anything
yet I right clicked on it and I hit run
and it gives me this checksum over here
so I checked that identity against the
websites one where they had a link for
mirror number one I just use mirror
number one and I checked it against the
numbers and they're all the right
numbers so that should work so this one
ends in C for C or C and so does that
one over C that's the it's the same file
so first thing make sure that the
checksum is correct
using this fast some program and you can
download this fast some program at fast
fast some com
and then I was also wondering did he use
an ISO burner like image writer or what
was the other one oh I love image
imgburn
that's a good one imgburn image writer
was one that I used really recently both
of those were to write an ISO file onto
a CD so that you can boot off of that CD
or USB to write so make sure that you're
using a image burner yeah because if
you're just burning the file over to the
CD it's not gonna be a bootable CD
exactly like that the other I get a
mention md5sum if you're ever on Linux
it's just in the command prompt and now
that'll do the same thing no the pretty
GUI but yeah okay cool so I hope those
help you out if not um you know me back
and we'll try to figure it out all right
okay we had another email from I don't
know who this is from hey guys a hag nom
