by Squarespace becks and dead space only
the dead survived
contrary to mainstream media's portrayal
of hackers were not all anti social
creatures while we may dwell in dimly
lit bedrooms poring over code coffee and
the occasional circuit board the fact of
the matter is we seek out our peers both
online and off enter the hacker
conference the epic venue to gather
converse and consume copious amounts of
beer so last week Darren and I set off
to San Diego for tour con 2008 to speak
with some of the presenters and get an
idea of what this con is all about of
course not everything went according to
plan more on that later after a long and
uneventful flight we made it to san
diego and before toorcon officially
started we had the chance to meet up
with robin wood to talk about the yaw
singer and we're better a place than
atop a decommissioned aircraft carrier
in the ground
hey guys what's up we're here on the USS
Midway and I'm finally catching up with
Robin would Robin so good to finally
have you on you guys probably know Rob
and he's a developer extraordinaire the
man behind the pineapple yes it it's for
real a pineapple and and I wanted to ask
you some questions about yas occur and
development stuff yeah yeah so we're
here at chillin at torque on and i
wanted to know how did you get involved
with Karma how did that come about been
on the mud Wi-Fi mailing like only Wi-Fi
sec mail list for a while a lot of
people been asking about getting karma
running with mud wife-ing rather than
the original my Wi-Fi and the general i
suppose you can't so i figured it's just
a bunch of patches to software drivers
I'm sure she'll be too hard to convert
them so I converted them that got me
playing with it and then people whatever
new versions chalo people kept saying
well can you get bring the drivers up to
date and I did nice yeah so when karma
was a camera was first invented it was
on the mad Wi-Fi and then when mad wife
i went to ng just was not updated yeah
that was it great so we've got to update
it and how did you get into the whole
Wi-Fi hacking seen in the first place I
always been interested in security and
that kind of thing and I used to work
for a web development company and
through them I got interested in
security testing web applications while
he's just another area that I was
interested in started playing with it
started being on the list and ended up
doing son's wireless course learnt a lot
of mats and progressed from there you'd
recommend that oh yeah no absolutely so
you've been working on yas occur for a
little while now and i'm just kind of
interested in what may be were some of
the most difficult parts of getting it
going and what not the development the
obvious thing is a limited space on the
on the phone itself that's what we
developed it for i originally wrote it
with shell scripts so ash scribbs rather
than Ruby and there was a lot of messing
about we said and grep and tools like
that and I finally got fed up with that
wrote it all in ruby and the web two
point our way yeah israel's not reals
but with Ruby yeah cool and yeah it's a
lot of plane about a lot of experiments
in the editor on there on the open work
by isn't quite vim it's not quite vice
so getting used to the differences yeah
so why open wrt why not dd-wrt here just
because that's sort of had lying around
mag hopefully i see on my memory to at
home so I figured why not put it on the
phone so what's really the difference
between yas occur the way it works and
something that runs karma on like an epc
like car metasploit at the moment not
very much it's the idea of the yoga is
that it's a modular development it's
really on the fon so it's a nice little
compact AP you can leave it laying
around somewhere whereas you wouldn't
want to leave an EPC lying around and
even all this current version hasn't got
many modules attached to it it has been
built modular so we can expand it lots
of ideas for new modules new features
for it so the embedded device is really
at the core of it as opposed to
something where you're just sitting down
and actually using as a PC using it for
penetration testing or something this is
really one of those things that's a
cheapy through a battery on it toss it
inside of a pineapple or carton of
cigarettes and leave it around somewhere
yeah so I did an interview with hangers
Josh right he was who said in one of his
pen tests he talked to steph cheap
access point and taped underneath chair
in a reception room on for the next
couple of weeks he had full access to
their network through this its access
point I mean often it disappeared and
then the end of the test he went in and
said well done somebody found it no we
didn't I'm some dude nick tete so say
with this you wouldn't leave an epc line
Rome but $30 phone you could almost
disposable and so what we say right now
a thirty-dollar fun but what about
Hardware in the future I mean the fun is
just a system-on-a-chip made by act on
then the same thing with the Venera plus
if you now have so hopefully we can see
development into the Funaro plus what
other hardware do we foresee and what
are the limitations there it will run
anything that runs got an ethros chipset
and will run open wrt really a lot of
people are asking about the wrt54g as
far as I know none of those who got the
Astros chipset and there's like a
buffalo or a yeah yeah okay so it won't
run on those you've got to have the
Astros chipset she has a big boy and
Wi-Fi yes mud Wi-Fi drivers all the room
for Arthur offs and the mad Wi-Fi the
other ones that can be patched so yeah
it's gotta be a frost based so it's not
impossible but it's just not worth going
down that road when atheros works great
yeah sweet so where do you kind of see
this project going well so I've got
plenty of ideas for new modules and
things to add on hopefully any new
hardware if anybody wants to send me any
aircraft play with them I see I new
modules he's gonna give me a picture
like like what's the module like okay so
you build in the structure just kind of
like how how what is it back track
remote exploit you got modules just pop
in the module directory you boot up you
got an lzma everything just shows up so
paint me the picture of how you envision
modules working with with y'all's occur
and how that differentiates it from
something like I metasploit and this if
any of you seen it there's the drop-down
list that you get it on the table
connected clients the plan is that you
drop a module in a new function appears
in that list to do whatever the module
does ideas have got we're talking about
integrating Wi-Fi zoo in there or part
of its functionality I'd like to be able
to also call to things like Nessus and
nmap so modules for that you see your
client you have a drop-down you set and
map this client or run Nessus against it
and like seven write it with modules or
modular based so the community can build
their own modules contribute them send
them in are quite a political site give
full credits to anybody who writes them
and it will grow from there hopefully
nice you were telling me earlier about
like some
some interesting ideas about actually
running them in tandem like connected to
each other that sounds really
interesting yeah well obviously it would
be really nice what you want to try and
do is give internet access to anybody
who's got it was connected to the air p
so if you could run two back-to-back one
is the yASA go running the AP the second
just with a client mode connected to the
internet so you could then battery pack
a pair of them leave them light anywhere
leave it with complete internet access
and then you're just a man in the middle
listening to everything nice on my way
back on this trip I've got a four-hour
layover in figure out what airport but
I've got one pineapple here and it's got
a battery pack inside of it and my idea
here is I just turn him on and connect
to his SSID that I have WP Aid Societies
pineapple and I just connect to that and
what I hope to do with the route is set
it so that on my laptop which i have
connected via bluetooth to my cell phone
to the internet make that the you know
provide the tubes for the targets so it
would anyway this is an awesome
penetration testing tool I'm really
excited about the development the future
we've already got a lot of people are
getting active in the auger boards is
that the best way to get ahold of you do
you have another website where can we
find out more about your projects hak5
forums is jessica forum in there there's
didn't www didja ninja dog i'm on there
and the yASA go specific stuff is a
digital org slash yeah saga and you can
email me yes ago did you ninja dog will
get questions answered as well great
alright Robin thanks so much for coming
on and we're having a blast so let's
just go check out some more of this
aircraft carrier
by the ride in mine I never really
looked but the Darren's travel tip
number 74 if you'll be passing through
airport security with a battery-powered
fawn router stuffed inside a plastic
pineapple be sure to take it out of your
carry-on bag and place it into one of
the plastic beds yes I was taken aside
for questioning and it turns out it does
in fact look like a big yellow grenade
on the x-ray and this travel tip is
brought to you by Squarespace
Squarespace is a publishing system for
anyone looking to build a blog a
portfolio or any kind of website with
squarespace drop boxes photo galleries
forums and blogs are just some of the
features that can be built in just
minutes without ever touching source
code they'll be building the new land
party / hak5 gaming clan site in the
coming weeks so send us your ideas of
what to include we're excited to be
working with them as it turns out
they've been fans attack five since
season one anyway you can get a two week
free trial without credit card or
commitment at squarespace com check that
so after exploring the aircraft carrier
a little more we made our way to tour
console it goes without saying that
shooting at a hacker conference is a bit
complicated we make every effort never
to film the face of anyone without
permission that said the next likely
guess was none other than dan Griffin so
Dan torque on you're talking about
hacking SharePoint what's what's going
on man well yeah I'm actually really
excited to be at torque on again this is
a I think my third reason third tour com
presentation forth to work on
presentation actually and there's
actually four things that I'm going to
talk about for hacking sharepoint and
the first is as you and I were just
talking about before we got started is
how sharepoint has kind of taken over
the world in terms of well actually
gartner predicts that sharepoint will be
more common than network file shares in
the next two years which i think is kind
of a scary car that's crazy thing to
think about for the people that aren't
familiar with sharepoint and I know all
of you assisted mins are shaking your
head right now is that it's a it started
out as a free service that came with
windows server 2003 that's right it's
for team collaboration it does
versioning and it's basically a really
nice front end for a webdav when you
really get down to it but but yeah so
it's a microsoft thing for for
collaboration it's now built into office
03 07 it's really
integration sweet piece of software yes
I love it I know a bunch of system mins
to swear by it so where's the
vulnerability what's the problem with uh
yeah everybody adopting this isn't it
much better than just a regular folder
share in terms of I mean depends on how
you look at it of course from a user
perspective yes it is much better than a
folder share because as much easier use
but then the trade-off is then of course
you have to look at that what that
default security model is and of course
as a result of being much easier to use
the the repository just grows really
quickly and people start putting all of
their data on it and of course again
talking about that default security
model it's that by default everybody has
read access to everything that you put
on the site everything everything you
can't do permission so that you know
there's certain like marketing has that
and sales has has these groups it's it's
just everything of course you can do
that okay my observation is that when
you talk about the default security
model that's also going to be you know
the vast majority of sites that get
deployed that's how they're going to
leave it and so of course you can set
permissions on the various documents and
you have a group based system like what
you're describing but I think that very
few people know how to use it and very
few people go to the trouble yeah well I
mean sis administrators being lazy with
Microsoft software I've never heard of
anything and I know so absurd yeah but I
can imagine it being especially a
problem when you've got a lot of
intellectual property there you got
somebody leaves company and what do they
do right before they plug in that USB
Drive and let's slip some piles done so
so is that the main problem war is there
are some other vulnerabilities like what
what is your what tube in your research
yeah my research has been has been
threefold the first thing has been okay
we've got that default security bottle
but unfortunately what you see is that
not even do people not go better than
the default but they'll actually do
worse than the default so to speak by
Miss configuring the site sometimes and
so what you can find this is actually
really scary but if you if you do
certain searches on Google the google
indexer has picked up a number of
SharePoint sites that were obviously
deployed incorrectly publicly on the
internet and you can see for example
administrative pages that you shouldn't
be able to see really yes and earth
there are thousands of sites that come
up what kind of things would you
I mean this really sounds like some fun
Johnny I hack stuff Google food here
what woody what kind of stuff are using
what kind of quiet you put me on the
spot i don't i don't remember the the
Earl names that you can look for I did a
blog post and maybe i can i can play
give me the link i'll put in the lower
third people yeah check that out yeah
we'll do that but anyway if you in
actually if you just play with the site
a little bit again it's free so you can
you can just use it as a hacker but if
you just play with the site look at some
of the admin links that come up on the
you know on the Earl in the browser and
just search for some of those admin URLs
in Google and you'll find sites that
have mistakenly exposed those on the
Internet so now what do you do what can
you do with that well at that point if
you find somebody's admin URLs then you
basically could own their site whether
just a share points I can you go to that
maybe get the default website I haven't
I haven't probed that far okay I have a
feeling that because of you know share
points got on asp.net component it's got
a nice a P component that plugs into is
so there's a lot of powerful stuff going
on there and i have a feeling you could
do some damage but again i haven't
proven that okay so what was the the
tool that you've been working on yeah so
the tool to back to what we were first
talking about is my observation is that
once a sharepoint site gets set up
people upload everything to it and you
talked about HR information you've got
your IT people putting documents on
there i wrote a tool that lets you
search for patterns using regular
expressions and ill enumerate through
all the documents in the sharepoint
database and you could say for example
search for a social security number
pattern or all the phone numbers in the
sharepoint documents or our numbers
credit card numbers nobody would ever
put social security numbers or credit
cards in an Excel spreadsheet and then
put them on a share somewhere that yeah
it's it's unheard especially not all 30
million of their employees or and if
they if they've got an assisted min
that's may be right out of college
didn't paid much attention during the
installation because he just wants to
get a check mark on the I got SharePoint
up a task yeah then get his action items
list a little lower and yeah next thing
you know we've we've got some major
vulnerability so what
kind of the mitigations here what can we
do if we're administrating sugar point
service to make them a little safer yeah
yeah that's a great question so the
remediation here definitely is actually
I recommend using these tools using
these techniques to kind of convince
yourself of the problem and start to
learn what the security patterns are
that you should be understanding for
your own SharePoint site and then indeed
dig into your site and make sure that
the access controls are sent the way
that you expect them to be so HR
documents should only be viewable by
people in the HR group etc that's all
interfaces with active directory so you
know if you've got a permission
structure that works there real easy to
set up sites the same way SharePoint I'm
nervous to say that that is really easy
again this is an area a little bit
outside of what I've been experimenting
with but I'm told that that actually
getting your groups to translate
directly from active director to
SharePoint isn't always the easiest
thing to do and again so we're back to
one of the reasons why people don't
necessarily put the trouble to get it
configured correctly because it can be
kind of confusing yeah very interesting
stuff so you're gonna release a tool of
course it's actually already on it's a
it's on codeplex the name of the tool is
a moss reg ex search lost it is mo SS
stands for microsoft office sharepoint
server that's moss reg ex search on
codeplex great and people can always
still find you at JW secure comm right
correct that's awesome hey thanks very
much for taking some time talking to us
we appreciate and I'm looking forward to
seniors your speech thank you alright
now it's time for this week's trivia
ready all right simply named the
aircraft Darren and Robin we're sitting
behind on the aircraft carrier be the
first to submit your answer to the
forums and we'll hook you up with some
hack PI stickers and other goodies now
this week's trivia is sponsored by
Beck's different by choice Beck's is the
number one German export beer and it's
naturally the beer of choice during the
month of October this fall Beck's wants
to give you and a friend the opportunity
to win a trip to Germany as part of its
oktoberfest celebration ah the food the
people the history did we mention
they've got a killer hacking and techno
scene well anyway if you have an
experienced Germany you just haven't
completely lived so register for a
chance to win a one-week trip to Germany
courtesy of effects on your cell phone
text VEC KS to be a ers to be
automatically registered or log on to
Beck's fear calm for the full details
next Darren got a chance to talk to Jake
Applebaum about the cold boot attack so
Jake Applebaum you just gave an
interesting talk about the cold boot
attack and I know a lot of people it's
it's really been the buzz recently but
for the people that aren't familiar with
the cold do dapat attack you want to
explain what that is and why it's
important sure yeah so basically the
cold boot attack is a couple of things
it's one an observation about how memory
specifically dram sell those supplies to
older memory as well doesn't decay as we
used to assume that it did so when you
turn a computer off people think go like
everything just vanishes you know I lost
my documents it's all gone but actually
there's a subtle process that occurs
which is that the memory chips are made
up of capacitors essentially and this
capacitor is slowly discharged and the
discharge a time depends entirely on the
environment so for example if you have a
memory chip depending on the type of
memory chip it could be anywhere from
point 1 seconds to 30 seconds before
it's fully discharged which means that
it still has some semblance of data
during that 30 seconds and if you were
to cool it with say can of canned air
which costs five dollars at the store
simply invert the can of canned air and
spray the tetrafluoroethylene
cold stuff yeah hound of the memory that
will increase the retention time and
essentially what that means is that you
can take that Ram chip out of a computer
walk it to another computer plug it in
and then read the data out of it or
potentially turn the machine on that was
just off and read the data out of that
if you're in a hurry and you will only
have that computer okay so we all know
that physical access once you've got
that all bets are off sharam so so what
you've done is you put together a tool
so that you can what restart and boot
off of another device and restore the
memory how does that work well there are
a couple of tools one of those tools
actually is right here it's this ipod
which is running a stock APPL firmware
in fact it's playing industrial goth
music right now and the only would hack
yeah I'll be sleep arently yeah this was
actually made by Bill Paul another
person on the team who wrote basically
all the memory scraping utilities and
basically this you can just boot off of
it and this is of course is physical
access but the reason this is kind of
cute is because its stock APPL firmware
and Buddha velvet it it when you go
through customs it looks just like an
apple ipod in fact it even plays music
just like it's supposed to exactly it is
an apple ipod the only difference is
that we've changed the partition table
and we've changed the way that the disc
is set up but it doesn't have to be an
ipod it could be you know USB Drive or
anything like that yeah it could be a
different one like the other one that I
have in here Oh somewhere anyway
essentially this is for local attacks
you could do this with any USB hard
drive and basically we also have two
other payloads one of them is called a
pixie payload which works over
pixie bios's which is most x86 machines
so we talk about pxe booting like like
booting off the network drive exactly
just like booting off the network drive
but instead of booting off a network
drive you boot up of our system whatever
wherever it is however you decide to
deploy it okay so so lucky you access
the Machine you've got physical access
whether it's the pxe boot or the ipod
boot you're gonna have to you know and
your restart ends and since you did the
restart and not just like shutting it
down and then bringing it back up you've
done sencha cold boot where it's the
memory is still active so we didn't
power cycle it enough I'm assuming
that's how it works since we didn't
power cycle the memory everything's
still in there but then when we boot off
something isn't that putting something
up back into memory so it depends on the
way that it's done there there are three
main ways through it one is with
physical access with the USB disk that
like the ipod method or any normal disk
the other method would be over the
network with pixie booting or with efi
booting in the case of max the macbook
pros and other mac OS 10 devices that
are new and the third way would be to
have a custom bios in the second way you
can do it over the network and in fact
if you were to take the payload to be
released and modify them slightly you
would be able to make it so that they
broadcast the memory on to say like the
broadcast address of the networking all
you would have to do is sniff to network
to see it you know your physical access
hey we just did just dump the memory
right dump don't worry over the nails
sniff it right up and put it back to so
okay so no matter which method you
choose to do you've got essentially as
much of the memory as you as was
possibly retained when you reboot it or
if you cool the chips and popped it into
another machine what does that allow you
to do with this as an attacker well as
an attacker one of the things that
allows you to do is essentially you're
going to extract the cryptographic keys
from the system now that could be for
disk encryption it could be for ssh
sessions it could be for SSL it could be
there's any number of things running on
a system at a given point in time where
there is sensitive data in memory and
that sensitive data can lead you onto a
path of recovering other sensitive data
people use the same password in multiple
places for example people say it's a bad
idea and it is it
it's also very possible that you have
one password that unlocks a like a
keychain and if you had that one
password well then you get unlocked a
teach-in and extract all these other
passwords so how do we scrub through the
memory so we've got memory dump but it's
just binary it's just nothing to us you
know it like how do you scrub that and
actually get something useful out of
that because there's it's not like do
you have like a table is it like on a
hard drive we have like a table that you
can go through and actually try to piece
back together what everything is or is
it just random bits well I mean it's
funny in some cases depending on the
amount of time that is passed by it's
possible that there are a lot of random
bits which is why the AES key finder
program that we released it actually
will do an intelligent analysis on the
data that it sees and it will basically
be able to detect whether or not it is a
cryptographic keys so we've got some
signatures we like that looks like an
aes key or this looks like an RSA key
well it's not signature based in the
traditional way of thinking about a
signature but essentially yes there is a
test that one can perform and that
performing performing that test will
allow you to determine if it's an aes
key then we do another test which is an
entropy test to determine if if it is an
aes key is it a random enough and then
we know like if it's all zeros for
example we throw that out it's probably
not the tea sounds like a really
interesting tool for not just you know
on the black hat side of things but also
if you're doing forensics and I'm sure
you know law enforcement must be all
over this yeah unfortunately okay so uh
what's the mitigation factor here if I'm
concerned about my own personal like my
laptop you know and I leave it for a few
moments to go and then I come back and
my mom is gone or like what should I do
well basically if you have a laptop and
you take it with you you should probably
never suspend it to ram you should
probably not suspend it to disk unless
it requires a password when you turn it
back on and not a login screen but like
a pre-boot authentication password so
that when you power that machine on so
as a bios password going to protect me
here you know a bus pass were almost
certainly harm you at least against a
dedicated attacker and the reason is
because a bios password will stop the
machine from booting
and continue to apply power to the
memory and sit there and wait forever
and at that point you can what just try
again or exactly you could try to do
something else you could pull the hard
drive out and replace it with your hard
drive and you could do that while the
machine is on potentially and as a
result of being able to do that you know
the bios probably doesn't have like a
advanced intrusion detection system
built into it because its proprietary
software and it hasn't been extended and
if it doesn't have that so you're in bad
shape ok so what needs to change to to
make this less of the problem or do you
see it as a problem I mean I think it's
a problem in that currently one way that
people protect themselves against
unreasonable search and seizures and in
a warrantless seizure world is that they
encrypt the data on their computer
exactly you don't you I would just
recently go in Canada don't go to Canada
without having stuff truecrypt it am i
doing the right thing is that smart or
is that you know snake oil this is false
I liked your crypt I think that that's a
really cool project is one of the best
free software Patrick's around actually
but in our paper we broke through
grappelli broke is is is is is a little
bit over extending what we were able to
do is reliably decrypt a truecrypt
encrypted disk if someone can get to
this point so if if I had if i open my
trooper file and then it stores the key
in memory and then if you can just go
ahead and dump the number you can grab
the key and then all bets are off right
right exactly so if I'm crossing the
border I got my stuff through cryptid
like a good person I should make sure
that my machine is off all right and you
should also make sure that you don't
have some sort of suspected disco Ram
where you've previously left a full dump
of memory I mean I don't know how
truecrypt handles suspend to ram or
suspend to disk these days but if there
is a way for your computer to override
the software control the truecrypt might
have in place if there is a possibility
that you can accidentally leaked key
material although i don't know that
about truecrypt for sure it is
definitely a problem in general with
software like if you have a program that
is open and you suspend the computer
that means that that that programs
memory is is written out somewhere in
some way and if that's not encrypted and
doesn't require a password to decrypt
that data in the case of Mac OS 10 where
it doesn't require you to decrypted ated
with the password but it isn't
it somehow that could be a huge huge
huge problem and you could end up
screwing the pooch on that issue even if
the software is really great okay so
what kind of practices do you think the
industry should adopt to kind of
mitigate this I think it would make a
lot of sense to have integrated
temperature sensors in a computer and to
be able to set interrupts and alarms so
that in the event of a temperature
dropping you could wipe certain bits of
memory okay if you go to probably it
probably extend Emma device so that you
could have programs say these bits of my
memory are extremely sensitive in the
event of a panic of some sort I want you
to erase them first and then it would be
a race and the race could be that if you
are shutting down your computer you know
for sure that those bits were killed
before the computer shut down because
when you and when we say your computer
your computer may be a server co-located
at some facility so exactly you're
saying the like the temperature goes
down it might be because the case is
open and some bios is noted you know
we'll let you know the biases of the the
case door actually open but maybe not so
you're saying that we should take
intrusion detection pass like the actual
virtual network but into the physical
realm yeah absolutely and and I think
that it would be really nice if we had
secure cryptographic coprocessors on
machines like a pcmcia our cardbus card
you could slide in and you could say
here's a block of data give me the
encrypted data back and you could have
the key set up on the card for example
you probably do something like that with
an FPGA that would be a useful step
forward because what we mean is that you
would have this piece of hardware that
you could program and thus you could
probably audit and as a result of that
you'd be able to trust it a little bit
more than just doing straight software
crypto and and there's nothing wrong
with software crypto but it there are
limitations to the security that it can
provide in certain cases and in the case
of some of the runs a mail server I mean
you're pretty Sol in this case there's
really a lot that you can do about it
because you can't have like a proximity
sensor yeah
what can happen is an attacker can come
to your Colo facility and they can plug
in a power sink and the power sink will
basically phase shift to be synchronized
with the wall power and then it will
back feed the power into the computer if
it's on a search do they like just
actually cap into the the leads on the
power supply there well there are
multiple ways to do it that's one of the
ways to do it in other ways that if you
have a computer plugged into like a
power like a power strip of sorts it'll
plug into that and it will face sync
with that power and back feed the entire
power strip so you catch a power the bit
that the back way through and then
unplug it and it and then you're going
to plug it and then you can and they
pick up the server put it in your black
van and run off or even better you can
also then strip the ethernet cable and
you can basically wire up a loop back
okay i doing like I've got a little
alligator clips and now I'm feeling very
beige box ish but yeah right something
like that you can basically like it's
what you needed to boot the old son like
spark stations or ultrasparc or
whichever ones it was that you needed to
loop back instead of having the loop
back for booting you could tap it have
the loop back it would cause network
collision errors at first but then when
you stop sending data because you're no
longer attached to the network and
you're not receiving you know data
anymore I mean you still have a link
there you're right in the middle and
right so you're just over look at the
ARP cache you're like riding the wire
yeah exactly so I mean that's like super
low tech there are probably better ways
to do it but you could link stays up
power stays up roll the machine out and
as far as the machine thinks the machine
is having problems reaching maybe the
upstream router or maybe the switch is
having issues for a second depending on
how you pulled the attack but this is
the stuff that the internet was made to
to just get go against our or you know
not be disrupted by it's like oh let me
go to correct this so it's not gonna
really cause any alarms ready to say
because this just happens like Oh a
packet dropped big deal right or like a
thousand packets dropped my upstream
item might be down send a page to
someone so you've explained the the
Corps boot project that's the tool where
you get off the pxe or the the ipod you
said something earlier in your talk
about the payloads do you want to touch
on a little bit of what that is well
there's a little confusion Air Corps
boot is it used to be the Linux bios
project okay and now it's called the
Corps boot project I'm not a part of it
I just simply seen I've seen it i've
worked with it a little bit and I rather
like the project but the
previous payloads were written by bill
Paul their free software there at site
Pete at Princeton dot edu / memory /
code or something totally separate from
coreboot coreboot being the free
software BIOS implementation has this
concept of payloads and essentially you
can write a program like Tetris and then
run it in the bios assuming that you
have a blast that's supported by
coreboot and like I just bought a
motherboard two gigabyte board and that
supports it so I can flash the BIOS you
could for example right as a load that
dumped all the memory okay so this is
what you would use to build you know
your rig that you would cool the memory
pop it into that machine boot up off of
it and then the that's the software that
would actually do the dumping if you
weren't if you weren't just going to
restart that machine right unfortunately
it's it's very powerful and very useful
this is good though because you can use
this to scrub the memory when you turn
the machine off or to make certain bios
callbacks that could scrub the memory
sure so that's useful for a defender but
as an attackers tool what it would allow
you to do essentially is to dump all of
the memory without actually touching the
memory see the the the USB disk and the
memory we're gonna have to load your
program into memory to dump it so you're
going to overwrite something right
exactly it could be something good but
it could just be junk right so some
people have suggested well store your
crypt or keys at this specific like
physical address and you have no
problems because that's where the bios
loads yeah in this particular case that
means you take the memory at you put it
into this and you don't have that
problem and you need one motherboard /
electrical interface that you would like
to be able to attack but motherboards
are cheap and and this sounds like
really so are these tools freely
available coreboot is available from
Corbeau info i think is the website and
that's freely available it's GPL
software and the software releases under
the bsd license that's the RSA key
finder and the aes key finder and the
AST repair code as well as the pixi boot
boot loader scraper and the USB scraper
okay so working our audience to find
more information about your research
well my research I don't know just
comes up sometimes I don't like work for
any particular group that I publish
research with I'm just okay so is there
any particular website you need say that
they should check out for further
reading on this subject uh no no no i
mean i have my own website but it
currently has a one link to my pgp key
and nothing else and not really web
design person i totally understand yeah
oh very interesting stuff thank you very
much thanks so much stock retrievers
Darrin's travel tip number 91 if you're
stuck with a four-hour layover in BFE
and one have a little fun head to the
food court and Flowery up the Oscar if
there's free Wi-Fi around go ahead and
take advantage of it share your internet
connection out for your EOS occur either
via Wi-Fi or if you've got a 3g phone
covered even better now most of the
clients around you will be connected to
the congress Wi-Fi you'll need to be
authenticated before the hop on me Oscar
I prefer loading up a lot of Nintendo DS
with aircrack and setting it to
infinitely broadcast beyond packets the
range on the DS is rather weak so you'll
need to send a friend over to targets in
order to disconnect them and sit back
maybe find a ferret and enjoy your
layover this travel tip brought to you

shows you how to throw the best
presidential debate party ever and gives
you the inside scoop on the top places
you should flee to if the economy gets
any worse or we experience an
unfortunate election turnout I for one
will probably end up going to toronto
canada new episodes of pop siren release
every
thursday at noon pacific gavin e sr day
at to work on ends and we head out to
all the after parties we must say thanks
to all the great people that made the
event really spectacular in particular
david Holton AKA hikari George Spillman
akhe oh we did an interview with them as
well but due to some bad choices and
location very strong winds much of it is
inaudible we threw that together after a
few years we finally went to her first
hacker conference Def Con if you're
interested it'll be posted as
supplemental material on hak5 org anyway
we had a really great time at work on
and I hope to see you there next year so
until next time just go
me
