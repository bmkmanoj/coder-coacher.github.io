the droid WordPress and Drupal things
the easy way and will be hacking the
Cardinal Health aleris IV system and a
lot more actually we r prime not going
to hack this it seemed a little
important
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by Nokia Squarespace and go to assist
express hello and welcome to hack five
my name is darren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse and if this is your first
time watching hak5 I'm sorry press stop
go watch another episode of hak5 Gorga
revision 3.com / at five we're in a
hospital I'm in the hospital like that
would explain my awesome get up here
Darren's in the hospital I totally
ninja'd my way in I didn't talk to
anybody at the front desk i was just
like Jim and I came into his room and
there have been fun HIPAA violations
yeah anyway um so I'm just gonna keep
the laptop on my lap because oh but he's
getting out by the way yes I hopefully
hopefully Oh actually this is gonna hear
before I'm at at hospital oh yeah anyway
I'm gonna be here for a while yeah he'll
be here for a couple days but they got
me hooked up to tubes hooray they're
giving him drugs oh I'm so jealous of
you right now we do have actually I just
told him sucking me the painkillers okay
yeah so anyway um had twitter.com so
Jack five games what's going on there
but anyways point let's get right into
the show we have an awesome a blog for
you guys lots of follow-ups some
questions at the end of the show we got
some great week for hacking I know
you've better view some software that'll
help you with themes and stuff and last
well you know what I'm doing I'm doing
the phone hacker stuff like I always do
yeah we get polling we'll see well yeah
we've got to do a quick follow-up to
remember last week we talked about how
muaks was sad because his favorite
forensics memory dumping program MDD is
no longer well he is enthralled about
fast dump community edition I've yet to
play with it but I really need to soon
it seems like a very cool thing that
will run on your Windows 2000 boxes your
XP or 2003 up to four gigs of ram so and
it's free so that's sweet I like free
yeah free stuff is good never pay for
software never pay for coffee true
speaking of coffee yes you see what I
did there speaking of coffee so there's
this forensics tool which the government
uses
it's called coffee and it is uses used
basically for collecting data off of
computers in like crime scenes and
things like that just to find out about
what's going on on their computers so
these hackers somewhere they came out
with this tool called decaf which
basically cancels out what coffee does
while coffee stick it on a USB flash
drive kind of like the USB switchblade
it's funny you mention that it there's
actually some microsoft knowledge base
articles where they mention us because
folks played indeed if you don't know
what we're talking about they're just go
back to hack 5 season 2 early season 2
and you'll see a really cool tool on the
USB Drive that totally owns computers
yeah so they take this USB flash drive
they plug it into their computers and
they collect passwords and like he logs
keystrokes and all sorts of different
history oh yeah browser histories and
other thing on there so decaf ends up
blocking the USB port it encrypts like
all sorts of stuff and it keeps I think
it erases like memory logs and stuff
like that as well it's that that it's
the proverbial giant magnet that the
hacker has in his basement layer for
when the FBI comes knocking through the
door and he does like the EMP blast on
the servers or whatever yeah i think in
pullman ja sweet hear what you know what
I'm talking about that's pretty cool
yeah and it did Topher would do but but
yeah the idea is that you loaded up on
your machine before you get busted so
that if Mike not like received uh you
know a guttural agents using its
Microsoft coffee tool were to plug in
their coffee to Linton computer I
totally lock it down at the last second
and kicked off you off so is it
available not anymore we just did follow
up right before recording and decaf was
with taken down by the author's we know
what that means because when you delete
something off the internet it's always
deleted off the internet for good just
never be back
so no I see I'm not quite pirates but to
how about Iraqi militants oh yeah that's
a good time so um what is that thing
called the predator that its pilot free
it's this plane that flies around and it
basically takes video of what's going on
in Iraq at the time if you just play
modern warfare two you know about the
pressure yes enemy predator and down oh
is that what they say yeah that's good
talk I thought they just meant like rock
castle no no no off calling in air I
should probably play that game so I know
what their died yeah are you AV is
online that's all you hear from
downstairs I totally makes so much more
sex now anyway I've just been
enlightened there we go so the Iraqis
were also enlightened Wendy could pick
up the signals from this surveillance
drone by using $26 windows shareware at
a lot of time to pick up the satellite
TV hilarious that's just any satellite
feed an unencrypted one hello I mean it
the worst part about this article that
we found is the government knew it could
happen yeah but they got that new hot
one there's a really new sexy one that
nobody knows anything about in the Air
Force just confirmed that it is a drone
but they didn't anything that's so sexy
I don't care being Air Force your
aircraft geek for a moment there but um
yeah you know that's that's what you get
when you don't use encryption what are
we talking about ssh tunneling for so
bad it's not a public Wi-Fi it's Iraq
anyway so uh you know that's how about
something a lot lighter and more fun I
like lighters about YouTube videos of
kittens oh i can has cheezburger kittens
yes i wish i could have a cheeseburger I
get saline solution anyway um WordPress
2.9 news out if you haven't updated go
ahead and update do it now before you
get hacked there's that too and good one
of the cool new features is something
called oh you Owen Oh in bed Oh in bed
is an object in bed thing that basically
allows to websites talk to each other so
they got this new feature where say like
you want to put a youtube video clip on
your
wordpress blog you no longer have to go
over to youtube and get the embed code
you just put the URL to the video and
there have been plugging seduced things
similar to this but it's it's not just
you to bits youtube it's a revision for
you to metacafe it's a lot of the big it
sounds a lot like the facebook thing
where you just put up a link and then it
will I blows it'll grab the image or
it'll grab a video from it you can just
click on the video in the blog or
whatever in the note facebook note and
play it on facebook it's similar to that
except it's even cooler because it uses
this this protocol where the whereby the
to website to actually speak to each
other in that case Facebook is just
going we found some pictures and here's
what we think is the body of the text
this is saying a facebook or Nothing hey
YouTube this user once you use this URL
what can you give me and it replies back
with like all of the metadata that you
would use to put together the object
embed code so totally worth it just for
that feature alone i think fiddler hulu
revision3 what what and you know google
video of it's still around i don't know
i just love it when website to talk to
each other in that it's like totally
that's cool its sky no no it's not so
far from its it's what Ajax would be
even Skynet um it's good oh by the way
apparently you can get free Wi-Fi on a
couple of different airlines over the
holidays until like january fourteenth
or something like that only exit
december 30th yeah i'll put the link in
the show notes pretty cool i'm probably
gonna use it for my flight to Missouri
just rub it in your flying I'm gonna be
spending Christmas don't know any want
yeah I really need to get better because
I've got a flight for Christmas but a
and I really want to take it so you know
send me some good mojo and one last
awesome hack for the week because it's
just been a week full of I'm excited
about this one okay so if you were lucky
enough to actually get a nook ebook
reader you know the new barnes noble
android-based ebook reader it has been
rooted if you will just like to droid
last week and basically
you allows you to run any just about any
Android app you could run on that
platform on the milk device including
Pandora that's all she I get to listen
to music while I'm reading my my ebooks
on my e-book reader if you can find
yourself hey milk sure you know that
they're gonna have this disk fix for the
next version i don't i don't know like
i'm sure they will how well they will
but for now it's pretty cool that we can
run android apps on the look the
beautiful thing about the heck though is
that didn't go through some serial port
there is no buffer overflow is just as
simple as opening up the device and hey
look at that there's an SD card that's
running the operating system okay so
player like this put it in a computer
change some of the linux because that's
what i get that's what android is linux
you know unlock it and bam you've got
APK files which are amazon Arkin's on
android back package files runnin right
there on on the device rooted so who r a
score one for the consumerist x 40 or US
military yes so funny yes uh now okay so
anyway that that should wrap up the
long-winded a block but you do have a
awesome sweet segment coming up here
real soon about ways that you guys can
put together teams your own themes yeah
a quick and easy way love it i love musi
we'll see alright but first we do want
to thank one of the awesome sponsors
that brings you back five
I love the freedom that my motorcycle
gives me when I'm riding twistys through
the mountains or chasing sun sets down
the coast but the servers that a support
at work don't seem to have this idea of
paid time off so I don't always get a
break that's why i love the nokia
booklet 3g 12 hours of battery life
windows 7 bluetooth and here's the
kicker always on 3g because i don't
always know where i'm going to be when
the exchange servers have like an empty
a seizure or the boss a new laptop gets
hosed but I get all day connectivity to
the sexy aluminium ultraportable that's
just under three pounds slips right into
my tank bag I don't even have to worry
about bringing the power cord
the intro price is to 9999 with an amt
data connect plan two year activation
you can pick one up at best buy
exclusively either in-store online find
out more information at nokia com /
booklet 3g so when I was in like sixth
and seventh grade I used to use
geocities calm a whole lot for all of my
different websites all of my different
anime galleries and all that good stuff
and the cool thing about using geo
cities at the time was that I could just
move around images and it basically just
let me create an example website where i
can move everything around and i can
change the text and i could see exactly
what it would look like while i was
doing it and then i just press save and
everything was good to go I didn't have
to deal with any kind of code or
anything it was awesome the cool thing
about artists here is it kind of does
the same thing it creates a it creates a
theme for you for your WordPress blog or
your joomla blogger blog whatever you're
using and you don't really have to deal
with any code you can just choose your
text and choose your colors and you can
even change the background colors to a
certain image all on an example website
without touching code so I'm going to go
ahead and show you guys a little bit of
an example for this program I am using
the standard edition trial so I won't be
able to save this and any images that I
decide to use it decide to export and
check out in internet explorer or Google
Chrome or Firefox will have trial
written all over them so it's kind of
upsetting that I won't be able to save
any my awesomely cool themes but we'll
check it out anyway so when you open up
artist here it gives you the option to
create a template for wordpress joomla
blogger whatever blog that you decide to
create a theme for so I opened up a
wordpress theme and it gives me this
example seem to start off with something
that I can basically just use as an
example and start creating off of this
so the first thing I'm going to check
out is the background tab it gives me a
whole bunch of different kind of back
so that I can use I don't know if the
regular version has more back rooms but
this one really honestly doesn't have
that many to choose from I like this one
so i'm going to change it to this
background so there you can see that my
background just changed yeah nothing
special and i don't really like the
color so i can go over to the side and
go to fill color and i'm going to make
it pink because I like pink so sorry for
anybody who doesn't like girly colors I
apologize huh look my site is pink so
that was easy I didn't need to know they
was it called the hex code or whatever
for the color which is nice I can go
over here to glare and change my glare
ratio for my background give it a nice
little touch so I have a little glare
thing going on over in the corner and I
can change the image or the texture the
gradient or I can pull from a file to
add on my own image for a background so
i'd probably pull from my own file to be
honest the next thing i'll check out is
the header so i'll go over here it has a
whole bunch of these example pictures
that you can add on to your header so
i'm going to choose this chick because
she looks kind of hot and hopefully it
opens there we go so now I have this hot
blonde chick on my website pretty cool
don't like the color again so I can
change that under effects recolor glow
and flip I can flip around the image and
I can also choose my headline slogan
which will be slums website in my slogan
text when you're all done with your page
you can go up here to the little art
thing and go to save as or save but
sadly in the trial function it says the
same functionality is not available in
the trial version so I can't save what I
just did I'm only able to try out this
demo what i can do is export a theme
so I choose export and Oh ask me if I
want to create it I say yes so I can do
that and the other thing I can do is
preview in a browser so i can preview
this in let's choose chrome and you see
there's trial warning all over my
beautiful layout that i just created
because it is the trial edition I think
the original edition for this is around
fifty dollars so if you're just looking
to create one blog or one website is
probably a lot but safer route to just
choose a professional design and go with
that one and spend the fifty bucks for a
professional design instead of designing
your own it'll save you time and it
might even be cheaper who knows but if
you're creating like a hundred different
websites and you need different themes
for each one and you want to take the
time to make it your own then sure I
think it's worth the money but it's
really up to you personally I'm not
going to spend the money on it I like my
wordpress blog the way it is right now
and I like the free themes that are
available to the wordpress users so that
was our to steer you can find artists
here at our to steer calm if you have
any cool themes or programs for me to
check out you can find me at snub see at
hak5 org or you can check out my
personal blog at schnucks ecom and i'll
have all the information and more
details about our test here in the show
notes for today's episode when it comes
to providing my users with technical
support my days of blind blind or over I
don't even bother if I can't see their
desktop and interact with it so I
convinced my employer to get me go to
assist expressed by Citrix now when I
take a call I can instantly connect to
their desktop and fix the problem in no
time I never need to worry about a whole
lot because it's 128 bits secured
end-to-end I don't need a fancy firewall
or fancy VPN just a web browser will do
so it reduces my travel costs it doesn't
waste my time doesn't waste my users
time so you know they can get back to
work and I they don't even need to be at
the computer for me to fix the problem
if it's not severe I say hey Jan go take
lunch when you come back your computer
is going to be
new so I encourage you to check out go
to assist express whether you're
supporting a workforce or just
supporting your family's computer is
definitely the way to go when it comes
to you know remote support so if you
would like to try it out you can get a
30-day trial at go to assist calm / hak5
and again to support the show you've got
to use that URL go to assist calm / hak5
so while I'm stuck in the hospital as
you might imagine nothing is going to
keep me from those delicious internet
packets and while I came a little bit
unprepared and didn't bring a cat5 cable
or an interceptor to have fun with these
guys I've been having fun with the
wireless and I kind of brought as a
back-up plan just simple little thing
USB cable for my droid to my laptop and
the idea here is to go ahead and tether
with the droid so I can go ahead and get
online and browse the internet yada yada
what the they do have surprisingly this
hospital actually has an open Wi-Fi for
the patients and it's one of those
things where you get online and there's
a you know a captive portal that steals
your session and takes you to a page
with the acceptable use policy and
totally free you just say I agree and
and carry on sad thing is there's
websense involved so I can't go to
Facebook can't go to Twitter I can't go
to hak5 I can't go to example.com
there's barely any places as I can go
but that's websense and I understand for
the patients we've talked about ssh
tunneling in the past knocking bore with
you with a hero just referenced past
episode but I will go ahead and say that
dynamic Sox tunnel working flawlessly
you know linking ports locally to like
IRC I've been on IRC hak5 org this whole
time and between the chat room and the
Twitter and everything it has made my
stay here so much better but let's say
for example this was hospital where the
Wi-Fi you know didn't wasn't open or I
didn't happen to have like a laptop that
had built in 3g like saying the note
booklet I would just go ahead and want
to use my droid as a tethered 3g modem I
know what you're thinking just rooted my
droid and I will say honestly it is
matter of moments before a firmware is
released firmware hack for the droid is
released that allows it to do Wi-Fi
tethering I've been watching the
discussion with some of the different
Wi-Fi tethering groups and some of the
developers and the limitation at the
moment is the fact that it gets
netfilter or IP blanking for a second IP
cop no IP IP tables isn't in the kernel
on the phone so basically we need to do
a little kernel modification before
we're able to use any of those sweet
tethering apps you can associate you can
but you're not going to really do
anything else with it so but I will keep
my eyes on that because as soon as there
is a 2.1 firmware that has the iptables
in there so that I can actually do a
Wi-Fi tether with this then this becomes
well I wouldn't say a mobile pineapple
because it's not going to be able to run
karma but it becomes very useful
especially in a long you know card trip
where in the backseat of that you know
hak5 bus or whatever go into Virginia
Tech and just fire this thing up and
everybody in the car is online helica my
fire or something I will say that I have
investigated the 2.1 version of Android
the the droid that I hacked in the
previous episode I upgraded it to two
point zero point one there is a version
of the 2.1 android operating system
available that can be that has been
hacked and can be flashed on to the
droid i have not gone ahead and done
that because there are some limitations
with some of the hardware not working
specifically the keypad doesn't light up
which is kind of a pain when you're in
the dark room and i've heard some
problems with the camera and some other
stuff so i'm not going to take that risk
right now especially where i am and
everything but hopefully soon so anyway
let's go ahead and get into just
tethering the old-fashioned way i am
doing this in
ubuntu and i am not using any commercial
software you could use commercial
software you could use pdanet which is
there's a free freely available version
that that allows you to tether with
either bluetooth or USB and as for
Windows Mac and Linux and the free
version has the limitation that you can
only browse on port 80 I don't haven't
played around with you know ssh
tunneling or anything like that with
pdanet there might be a ways around the
free version limitation there but it
suffice it to say we want full internet
let's go ahead and use the script now
before we get too much further I do need
to thank the author Shannon van Wagner
who put together a 15 step process of
tethering your droid to a debian based
operating system like Ubuntu and of
course that leads me to thanking Big Mac
83 on the alldroid org forms we
basically took this put together a shell
script that does it in a lot less time
maybe about three steps basically we
download the script which mod it plus X
and we run it and from there we can just
go ahead and follow the prompts to get
ourself a little tethering action on and
if we take a look at the script here we
can see that basically this is a really
long shell script with a lot of prompts
thats us and and goes ahead and
downloads what we need and sets it up
the way that we need it based on
Shannon's original post so let's go
ahead and give it a shot now i have
already downloaded and installed the
android sdk and from within the android
sdk I've untoward that and then copied
from the tools folder the ADB executable
over to bleep flush bin something like
that a path directory so that it can use
adb adb is the Android debug bridge
which is going to allow us to send
commands to the phone right over the USB
cable like a developer so start by
running android tether and what is my
name and
is I believe on this machine Darren yes
i have installed the sdk and that is
where it is yes I do have an internet
connection it is going to go ahead and
download the packages that I need for me
I hope that the fact that I have a socks
proxy locally on a DAT isn't going to
cause problem and it looks like on the
open Wi-Fi here I'm not having any
problems going ahead and downloading the
network manager openvpn and openvpn all
right and we've downloaded the packages
and we're being told not plug in the USB
so we will move on and we need to go
ahead and edit a configuration script
and at CU dev rules d anyone android
bulls and that will open up an editor
where we just need to go ahead and
replace owner equals username with my
own username save and close that and
we're ready to continue now on my actual
android device i do need to go over to
settings and under applications need to
choose development and check USB
debugging okay alright so now we need to
disable our Wi-Fi here you can see that
i'm on the care for you wireless and i
need to go ahead and disconnect in fact
we're just going to tell the wireless
network manager here just to stop using
wireless all together i'm going to plug
in the android okay so at this point we
actually need to exit from the script
open up another terminal run a command
and report back to the script its
findings and basically we just need to
run adb devices which will query device
and let us know if we have actually
successfully connected our droid to the
computer so adb devices and we do have a
device listed here rather than a bunch
of question marks and we got that good
results now this tethering requires as
you link a android application to be on
the phone to go ahead and tether I don't
have that installed but this is the nice
thing about having enjoyed the bug
bridge is that I can go ahead and
download it from my ubuntu computer and
install it so it's asked me do I have it
installed I say no and it's going ahead
and installing it on my device right
there from abb and now on my droid I go
ahead and open up as you link and check
service active so now from another
terminal we go ahead and run droid
tether and we can see what droid tether
is doing is actually just creating an
open VPN connection between the droid
and the computer and creating it as our
default gateway so that we can actually
browse the internet really Android let's
take a look so there we go we've created
an open VPN connection to the Android
which is already online now tunneling
all of our internet traffic through
there and I can pull up a browser head
over to the goob mmm turkey Reuben there
we go that is what's up so that is
tethering with an Android and you don't
even need root access on the Android to
do this which is such a beautiful thing
of course I will be doing this again
with Wi-Fi when the firmwares come out
that allow me to but for the time being
this is going to be great especially in
those situations where I don't have you
know wonderful little wifis around me
