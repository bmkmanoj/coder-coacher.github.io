carbonite welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and today I'm
getting into some more terminal 101 it's
time for some more Linux terminal fou so
last time on hack tip I checked out a
few simple commands CD for changing the
directory and LS to list files to name a
few this week what's delve a little bit
deeper shall we I'm pretty new to the
Linux side of things after several years
of using winter windows shut up I'm
branching out and teaching myself how to
use this totally awesome operating
system yeah I'm finally getting to the
point where I'm like okay yeah Linux is
awesome so back to the terminal
so when I list files if I want to see
what kind of file types there I can type
in this thing called file its file pick
if for example I want to see what this
pick file is over here obviously I know
what it is already it's a JPEG but if I
didn't know it would tell me right here
pic Jake JPEG image data jfif standard
1.0 point 1 yeah whatever that means
then there is a built-in program called
less less lets you view text files in
the terminal by typing less and the file
name so for example I can type in less
and then pineapple and it shows me the
text file that is inside this little
pineapple document right there of course
it's something like super easy and I
type Q to quit out of there and clear to
clear all that mumbo jumbo while in the
LES program you can use some other
helpful commands to move around and you
can always type less tactic help for all
of those listed commands there are
several built-in programs similar to les
that make it a lot easier to use the
terminal and this is just one of the
many that you can choose from now that
you know how to move around and view
text files you have the ability to
explore your Linux system in more depth
we'll check out a little bit more file
manipulation right after the break

and the offer code for two bonus months
is hak5 we're back so let's manipulate
some files we can move copy remove
rename files and directories and we can
also make directories as well we already
know back from one of my previous hack
tips how to make a directory with mkdir
directory name whatever that might be
now I want to copy this photo into my
new directory and this is the pic right
here so we know that it's name is pic
mkdir folder 1 CP pic and then folder 1
and that should copy it into my folder 1
there it is yep got it yeah it worked
now another thing I can do is I can type
CP pic and then I can make another copy
right in the same directory by typing
and pick one or whatever I want the
second one to be named hit enter and
then it appears right there super easy
and awesome remember you can also type
tech tech help to find out all the other
options any of those tech options that
you want to use for copy now if you want
to move a file type MV and then file one
and then file 2 and you can also move
the file to another directory by typing
MV pick documents or whatever the file
is called so for example MV I want to
move my pick file to pick
one if I do that it'll move all the data
to pick one and if I want to move that
file again I can move it into the
Documents folder or I'll do I'll move it
into my pictures folder because yeah
that makes sense so move pick one two
pictures hit enter and if I click in
here there it is pick one of course I
could also change my directory to
pictures of course oh there it is pick
one ha ha okay so let's go back into my
normal one and clear out of that so we
can get started on the next option and
command now if you want to remove a file
or a directory you can type RM and then
the file but be careful if you want to
use a wild-card like an asterisks for
example to delete all of the JPEGs in a
folder you could type RM space ask Duras
keep eggs but don't put a space between
the little star in the dot jpg or the RM
command will try to delete everything
and then it's going to tell you that
there isn't any file called jpg now next
time on hack tip I'll talk a little bit
more about wildcards and I'll discuss
what the heck it means to create links
what the heck are those now how did you
guys learn the terminal there are tons
of handy websites out there that go
really into detail about how to use it
tell me what your favorites are in the
comments below or you can email me tips
at hack 5 org and be sure to check out
our sister show hack 5 for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your Tecna lest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
