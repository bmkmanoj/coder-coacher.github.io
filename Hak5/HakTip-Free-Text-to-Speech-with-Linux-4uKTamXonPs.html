Squarespace hello and welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down the
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Aaron kitchen and today we're
piping something into another thing and
making some stuff happen more
specifically we're playing with an
open-source text-to-speech system and
extending its command line functionality
into the GUI world I have to give mad
props to John Green presenting some of
this stuff by because it's really really
really cool stuff if you're not sure
what I'm talking about already the open
source text to speech engine obviously
best of all it's so cool it's
multilingual speech synthesis system
it's originally developed by Allen black
at the Center for speech technology
research at the University of Edinburgh
and additional contributions are being
made by Carnegie Mellon University and
it's so cool because it supports Texas
speech API is among other things like a
command-line interface for extensions as
support for English both British and
American as well as well Spanish and you
can even find packages for Finnish
polish Russian what have you to name a
few and if that wasn't enough the whole
thing is published under the bsd license
meaning it's free it's open source
hooray we can make our computers talk
for free just like in more games where
joshua is all like would you like to
play a game and it'll actually kind of
sound like that so to get started we're
going to need a few packages and first
of all obviously festivals so you know
if you're in a Debian based OS where you
have apps then you don't have to get
installed festival I already have it
don't need to do that that's the obvious
first step so now that we have that we
can actually do like a quick little demo
and just going to need a txt file you uh
well tech I do you want to play a game
into a file called test2 because test
one is usually already taken so now it's
just a matter of running from the
command line Festival tak tak TTS and
then my file
you want to play a game there you go we
met a computer talk how cool is that now
of course this would be so much cooler
if we could extend it past just the
command line and into like the web so
say for example you're on a website and
you don't feel like looking at your
computer screen but you do want to read
like an article you could select the
whole article hit a key combo have a
computer read to while you're off
playing Mario Brothers on your Nintendo
DS or something I don't know whatever it
is you do now to do that pretty easy all
we need is a bash script and a little
program called Excel Excel is going to
allow us to take the selection from X or
X Windows our Gillian Linux and and pipe
that into a program gen bash like we
normally would like in the command line
which is pretty cool because we don't
actually have to do some hacker e where
we actually take something out of the
clipboard so we're actually not messing
with the clipboard at all it's only
allowing us to select something in the
GUI and then pipe that over into a
program so pretty nifty tool if you
don't already have it it's a matter of
apt-get install Excel I've already done
that don't need to so anyway now with
that done we just need to make our bash
script so in this case we're going to
cat and then I've got two Walker's into
my cat eof end-of-file and then I'm
going to put a walk of that into a file
that we're going to call talk dot Sh
because I'm not feeling very creative
right now I guess so this is pretty cool
if you haven't used this method this is
neat because it allows us to create a
script right here in the command line
without having to go into by nano Emacs
G edit notepad through wine I don't know
how you do that but it's pretty neat
because you know rather than just like
echo quote and then hit enter and then
you know do a file with it's very
similar it's just it's neat that I can I
know it's like copy kannan dass I'm
getting really excited about the fact
that I can cat file text into a file so
let's go ahead and move on shebang slash
bin slash bash great way to start any
shell script and then Excel and then
we're going to pipe that into Festival
tactic TTS just like before except this
time we're just going to have to add one
more parameter so easy tact a pipe to
let festival know it's going to read
what was piped into it that's it now I
type e Oh F it saves a file and there we
go of course we're going to have to
chmod it plus X to make it executable
and we talk sh so now we can actually
run it now if we run it right now it's
not going to do anything because we
don't have anything selected in X so for
us to be able to run it well we have
something selected the easiest way is
actually to add a keyboard modifier and
this is pretty cool because now I'm
going to be able to select a keyboard
combo just go to a webpage like here we
go I have example.com one of my favorite
websites and I can select this
information here about the RFC and y
example calm and example.org exists and
if I have those selected let's go ahead
and create our our keyboard shortcut
here and so under preferences and this
is for gnome of course if you're in KDE
it's a different method but in gnome you
go to System Preferences and keyboard
shortcuts and then I can click Add here
and create my own keyboard shortcut and
I'm going to call this TTS for
text-to-speech and the command is slash
home slash Darin slash Talk sa to the
file we just created I apply that and
we'll see all the way down here here it
is but it's disabled now if I click here
it's going to add ask me to create a new
shortcut well I want it to be easy to
type and I don't want to kind of mess
with any other shortcuts so I'm going to
use mod 4 otherwise known as super and
if you're at home sit along with me it's
the windows key I know right so hold
down the windows key and hit I'm going
to choose C or copy
except it's not copy because that would
be control anyway real easy keyboard
shortcut for me to remember and just go
ahead and close this so now with my
script there I my script is CH modded
with plus X so it's executable I've
added it to my my keyboard shortcuts and
I've got something selected in X so
really
as described in RFC 2606 we maintain a
number of domains such as exam calm and
example.org and if you're bored you can
read some rfcs I'm just saying they're
out there plenty hello now in just a bit
we're going to talk about some little
gotchas some quirks some ways to make
this our own but first we're going to
take a quick break going to take a quick
moment to thank our awesome sponsor
Squarespace and I'm sure by now you've
heard Squarespace you know that they are
the fastest and easiest way to get a
website a blog any kind of professional
site up on the Internet and I just
wanted to let you know that got some new
stuff 13 template redesigns 85 new
styles two brand new themes as you guys
know they've got iPhone apps iPad app
sound Android app it's so easy to like
integrate cool things modules for like
like slideshows for example I know for
instance I just turned my sister onto
this who's using this to show off some
of her crafting stuff and I honestly
recommended it because not just because
they're a sponsor but because it's so
easy to use you don't have to write any
code and get this fully hosted nothing
in to install so you don't need to worry
about like maintaining patches and
things of that sort it's all taken care
of you go over to Squarespace calm and
get 15% off for the next six months when
you enter the coupon code hak5 - now
right off the bat I'm going to save some
of you a lot of time when it comes to
this little error called Linux can't
open slash dev slash DSP it's not going
to happen to all of you depending on
your soundcard and whatnot but there's a
quick and easy fix I'm going to go ahead
and use Nano here to open up my dot
festival RC file and this is in your
home directory it doesn't exist by
default so go ahead and create that and
these are the two commands that you're
going to need to make everything happy
again so I'm just putting this out there
set those parameters also you may be
wondering to yourself like hey Darin
that's a really cool nifty thing except
this Texas peach guy he speaks really
really really really slow I want him to
talk faster and I'm
like well yeah I know right doesn't
everybody want to talk faster than that
why you guys tuned in because we talk
really fast is a lot of fun right okay
well anyway the place where you fix that
is in slash USR slash air slash festival
slash voices and then my case it's
English what's in here and then it's in
cow died phone and then you're going to
find a another directory in here called
fast box and if we G at it because why
don't we give some G at it love going on
this file called Cal underscored iPhone
two SCM and we need nips and there and
also I'm going to need to G K sudo this
because this file my user can't touch
because I'm not root but if a GK sudo
it'll happen and then it's all pretty
happy and there you go extract tip
because now you know that you can
totally like sudo something in KDE or
with GT k with anyway in gnome you can
open something with root that way what
I'm looking for is stretch and if we
come down here see it's one point one
and I could just change this to like 0.4
the lower you go the faster it gets so
now with that saved I can come back over
to my Ayanna and select something or
I'll select the whole thing in Windows
key see yeah we all got that right okay
then we should be done great that was I
was wonderful you know there's nothing I
love more than open-source technology
and pipe and stuff and combining stuff
and just making it really really cool
what I love even more than Festival and
UTS is hearing how you guys use the
technology which think of it what you
would like to put it to use for if
you've got other cool scripts I'd love
to hear from you guys all you have to do
is comment below or just hit us up tips
at hak5 org and be sure to head over to
our sister show at hak5 org tune in for
more great stuff just like this I'll be
there reminding you to trust your techno
