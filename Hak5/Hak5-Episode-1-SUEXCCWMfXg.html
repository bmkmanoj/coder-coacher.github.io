you
you
member
today we're testing to see if the speed
at which wardrobe affects your ability
to pick up wireless access points to
perform this experiment we're using a
Linksys wrt54g wireless ap an inspiring
700 M laptop and a hunter rubber
motorcycle well ride past the test
access point at 40 15 60 miles an hour
while recording the signal strength with
Nets on foot
you guys ready
all right I think we got it let's go
back and check out the results all right
let's head on out dude I had a lot of
fun with that
yeah so done so we're going to go ahead
and other results from the Wi-Fi test
and get back to later on the show but
before then let's go ahead and introduce
ourselves I'm Wes and I'm Darren and
this is hack point five
welcome to the show I'm glad you could
make it hopefully you guys can join us
on the fifth of every month and
basically what we've got for you is a
lot of tests mods codes hacks tips and a
ton of laughs and as you can see we're
not any X professional employees from
any technical TV network but we have a
true passion for technology and we just
love to share it with you guys and we
just really felt that we wanted to jump
on this independent media wave so before
we get any further let's go ahead and
check out the rest of these segments
let's go
we're here at the lab ready to check out
our first homebrew hack and this is
basically how to control your household
lights over an Internet enabled cell
phone alright so how do we go about
doing it well we're going to need a
couple things first first we're going to
need a light module an x10 light module
you can pick these up at x10 calm
they're really simple to plug into the
wall you plug your lamp into them we're
also going to need what's called a
firecracker it's a little convoy adapter
plugs right in through service comport
it's modeled CM 17a and mr. stacks is
like a radio transceiver or x10 logic
yes it takes the places the normal
remote that you would use with these at
10 modules but this way when we put into
our server we can use PHP and Apache and
a little dots utility and controller all
through the computer instead of having
to keep track exactly once we end them
with the webserver once we get on the
web we can use it from not only our cell
phone but also any web browser I guess
they were to do if like somebody else's
place - exactly so let's go over here to
our server the server is running Windows
Server 2003 you can download that at
Microsoft comm if you get an evaluation
copy and believe it lasts for three
months maybe less long or you could use
Linux or Mac because we're using Apache
and PHP the only thing on here that's
Windows 10 is the light utility it's
like exe from Communities msn.com slash
like home page and that that's a
windows-based system but I'm sure you
could find an alternative at SourceForge
really for the other OSS right and if
you're familiar with Linux then you
shouldn't have a hard time finding it
and configuring it yeah so we're here on
our windows 2003 server we've got a
patch of 2.0 and PHP 5.0 installed
figured we've got them set up on port 80
- instead of the regular port 80 because
our ISP locks for 80 incoming that
believe it's because I want you to
upgrade to the latest in their business
so business class exactly yeah so let's
go ahead and check out the PHP code this
is really simple stuff we've got you
know two links down here and they
basically say go to index up PHP the
file that we're on right now with light
equals on or light equals off so once we
pass the light variable on or off to the
PHP code it says well is it set to this
and then if it's on then run the system
command and tell it to run like exe with
these parameters there's a that's C 1 a
1 plus C 1 B comport 1 which is our
firecracker a being the house code and 1
being the number one module on the a
house coat exactly and Plus this to turn
it on - turn it off
okay if you check out the light uxe you
run lights face help it'll give you a
lot more information you can do you can
do like light fading and other cool
dimmer stuff but for these purposes
we're just showing you how to turn one
light on and off just copy this code to
suffer different things and change you
know a 1 to a 2 and yes and
understandable up to however many
modules you have exactly and you know
also now that we've got this framework
done you know we can add in other things
later okay we can add like the macros
like if we had a webcam then we could
put the webcam on there so you could see
your house on your way another thing
would be to you know a plug-in from when
a up or iTunes so you can turn on and
off the music and then once you've got
that all set up you can write little
macros alright and you should have like
you know your your date macro or your
corny macro or anything like exactly so
you're coming home with your Davi hit a
button on your cell phone to soft
lighting and use it exactly exactly so
let's go ahead and check out this PHP
code in action again Firefox down here
and we're looking at the site on our
localhost for 82 and if I go ahead and
click off son's plan let's turn it off
turn it back on okay so now to get this
over the web we're going to need to know
our IP address we're also going to need
to port forward or 82 to our server and
do that per the instructions in your
router we're using a Linksys wrt54g it's
really simply at the VIP address enter
in your code go to applications gaming
instead of forwarding very friendly
interface so to find out your IP address
head over to IP chicken com grab your IP
address in this case we've also made it
a little easier by using a service from
dime DNS org and nine DNS service
basically allows you to take a dynamic
IP address and put a DNS record for it
so that whenever your IP address changes
the DNS record updates with it and it's
a little application you run on your
server it had a forward as your IP
changes on DNS will forward it to
exactly so you punch this into your cell
phone if your IP address changes you're
not you know Sol yeah okay so now that
we've got that set up here we go we've
logged in over the internet with our
dime VNS or 82 on index dot PHP and we
can go ahead and turn off and on the
lights and then we were just plug that
into our cell phone dress into our cell
phone exactly so let's go ahead and
check it out and see how it runs on the
cell phone all right let's do that
have you ever had a process in Windows
that just wouldn't quit and the end task
and the task manager just wouldn't work
doesn't make you wish you could use the
Linux kill command for Windows now you
can with a free utility from
sysinternals PS kill allows you to
instantly terminate any process from the
command line it even works on remote
computers I'm sure we'll have a lot of
fun tormenting your Counter Strike
addicted roommate with this one check
out PS kill at sysinternals comm slash
utilities /ps kill HTML so we're here at
the lab ready to modify the gamecube and
let it play DVDs so wesbar show us what
what we've got represented here is all
three major consoles the ps2 the Xbox
and of course the Gamecube the biggest
advantage needs to have over the
Gamecube is that these MTV playback
already installed what we're going to do
here today is make the GameCube also a
console that will play back DVDs and
here we have an arrangement of the tool
right we'll name this project it's a
little tricky though because GameCube
uses these tiny little disks here and
you know of course DVDs use the regular
size DVD discs so the modification isn't
going to be the most easy but I think
we're going to be able to accomplish it
with these tools of course we've got a
six what is this a 9/16 inch socket
ready for slaughtering iron rotary total
miscellaneous wires here so we can
Outlook these onto the ends of solder
points 48 ohm resistors can pick these
up a Radio Shack itty bitty mini
screwdriver definitely going to come
and II regular screwdriver and to
control DVD we're going to have to
modify the GameCube controller and the
existing DVD remember so we can put
those together and of course glue gun
just in case of making mistakes with
soldering right I said it's gonna be a
really tricky project but the steady
hand and some good solder points I think
we can really accomplish this definitely
ok let's get started alright our well
how do you think that yeah mod white
thanks I don't think kind of all the
shows we've done so far I've seen a
better mod this by far is the best hack
we've done so far
you really gotta handle yourself this is
ingenious well thank you and as far as I
know this is a unique one of a kind like
a code generator double never see this
anywhere other than hack point 5 oh
definitely I read you know all the you
know online hack slides I check out
Yoshi's site all the time I'm definitely
or we didn't they're looking for the
latest and greatest acts but you don't
see this you know right I've always
wanted to myself why doesn't it play
DVDs they'll like it and I think we've
just proved to the world they can do it
can do it so let's show it all right I'm
here time to unveil all right here first
time ever on hack point 5 a Gamecube
that plays DVDs
so what once you give us a little
rundown of all the key features of this
DVD player / GameCube combo I see you've
done some interesting things with the
remote here
all right yeah we'll start off with the
remote right here the controller and the
remote have been tied into one so
therefore it's like the brand-new
universal remote control and it looks
like here with the fact that plugs into
the Gamecube you're never going to lose
your DVD remote because I know that how
they smell the time yeah others however
mode all the time but now that it's
tethered to your GameCube awesome you'll
never lose it you also just follow the
tether
now here we've got the main unit
GameCube is still fully functional the
mini disc drive is still intact now
granted the way we had mounted right now
you probably have to choose one game for
the rest of the unit life pretty much
yeah I mean just make sure you have a
really good game locked in there that
your detrás Tetris is always that multi
bit and it's a ski game it's like a DVD
player place hunters yeah anyway um
we're happy and we're good
let's see the advanced can do it next
time yeah well chest it and then of
course you can see we still have the
standard cd/dvd drive intact as well and
I just hope the internals we have talked
underneath here so it roars it made it
look really pretty
you cannot tell but this in fact if
somebody came over your place it's like
wow that's a normal-looking GameCube
that doesn't play DVDs and I'd say why
yes it does that's the smells intact
okay let's let's take it back to the
couch and see what seconds are coming up
next all right let's go recap works for
me
all right all right Oh bored
well viewers oh don't we have just
introduced you to the pack I pass half
oh the half attack welcome to hack point
5 it's official now yes it is yeah they
found this out and it's not easy and
bullshit mod let's go ahead and take
into this this is the real mod ok think
I wasn't going to enjoy
yeah we're not be asking you at all on
that one let's check it out here we are
in the backyard we're getting ready to
our first custom case mud and that's a
nice custom paint job you can buy pre
painted cases online you know from just
different websites and stuff or your
local retailer or whatever but nothing
adds that zest like custom painting you
did it yourself a few things you're
going to need is some half-decent paint
is always a good thing
ice appropriate rubbing alcohol for
cleaning cotton swabs Automotive masking
tape great for doing your trim work and
some automotive wet sandpaper this is
1,500 but it's really good makes a nice
smooth finish and it's great for
feathering out scratches also not
necessary but you might want to use it
as a sanding block to saves you a lot of
time and a lot of effort what we've got
right here is a factory side panel we're
going to go ahead and paint this thing
up first thing sand it down so got it
all nice and sanded down smooth what a
lot of you might not know and a lot of
you might know oil from your hands will
affect how the paint adheres to the
surface that's what you got your alcohol
for get your cotton swabs out get you a
good amount of alcohol on there and just
wipe it right back down so now that we
got it all cleaned off you're ready to
paint take your base coat in this case
we can't painting this one a nice gloss
black and just make it some nice smooth
even passes
multiple coats are highly recommended or
give you a nice Sheen make sure you sand
between coats that way you can prevent
your paint job from looking like an
orange peel all right once you get your
full pink coat of paint put on here you
should end up with something along these
lines right here anyway now we're going
to move on to trim work but you know
that's just what really makes your
custom paint job a custom paint job and
that's putting your own special touch on
it so here we are I've already got one
side panel already painted up right here
first thing I'm I started off with is a
nice pinstripe make sure you tape it off
nice and good and use some newspaper or
something to mark off so you don't get
any overspray
we're just nice and smooth just like we
were painting before every time you put
a new coat of paint on make sure you
sand it down so you don't get that
orange peel effect all right we're going
to go ahead and put a second coat on our
pinch stripe right here just to make
sure we've got coverage because most of
us know that when you paint over dark
colors it normally takes at least two
coats so we'll go ahead and just touch
this up right here
give that a couple minutes to dry off
real good and we'll move on to our next
step and that in this case is our logo
what I've done here is I've had our logo
printed out twice actually on cardstock
heavy duty cardstock and I went through
and exact it with an exacto knife and
cut out the first half of the logo the
hack and I'm just gonna take a nice
gloss white I'm just gonna go to the
pain on there I don't want a nice thick
coat it's line nice ghosting enough to
know that you can see the letters and
there's hat ghost it on there
alright now we're down to the final part
of this case mod and that's the last
half of the logo easy strokes
once again we're using a stencil so it's
not an exact science all right here we
are with the final unveil after all of
our paint is dried a nice hack v logo
with a nice racing stripe across the
bottom
all right so I'm chilling here with
Jenkins West and reformatting his
windows locks and is Austin setting up
Lennox engine here and we're just
showing listen to the dig caster it was
until now a jig nation big nation right
and he's setting up Windows XP and I was
like dude you got to check this out
we can play solitaire guess what so um
we don't really have to dig scripted or
anything I just thought this was neatest
hit you guys got to see this day or two
check this out so Windows XP set it up
right here
got that camera and take it along while
we're a little bored so all we have to
do control f9n oh shit defin as shipped
attend one of those at depth I'm Jeff
Jeff can trip that time we get nice
little command prompt here so now all
you need to do is just type start space
click quickens the winner purse whoops
sorry our space Sol as well look we
grabbed solitaire you ever get bored
while selling windows you can play
solitaire during the install not just
that close I'm N okay telnet face some
web address that you can tell it to and
that's sweet fix that house look at this
connect that I'll get Jays key of the
UNIX login right here so now okay
Red Hat run it over here Windows install
here but I'm gonna be doeshot well
Buddha's name of the Box were on a bath
shell right here through telnet so later
on we'll show you how we can sort of
synergy and go back forth between all
these but until then we'll see that
indignation rawr
so we're back on the cat's ready to
check out the Wi-Fi results as you can
see here on the first path we're going
40 miles an hour and we've got decent
signal strength on the second path we're
going 50 miles an hour and it's a little
bit less and we've got to make a note
here about third pass on the third pass
we kind of got held up by traffic on our
test Road so we never actually made it
up to speed but on the fourth path we're
going 60 miles an hour plus and there's
a significant difference between the
first pass and the fourth pass and I
think this is basically saying the
fastest ewar drive the less likely our
pickup access points and specifically if
you're going 60 miles an hour in a
neighborhood the only thing you're going
to pick up is probably a speeding ticket
probably now we're going to start
answering questions from the viewers and
you can email those questions to
questions at hat hack 5 org then you can
go ahead and send those to us in text
audio or video any codec and we're also
going to start doing trivia
so our first trivia question is if there
are eight bits and a byte and four bits
and a nibble
how many shades in a haircut are there
in a gigabyte you can email your
response to trivia at hak5 org so until
next time I'm Darren and I'm Wes and
this is half for fun and we're reminding
you to always
you
people network but we just love
technology and would love to save love
way too much it's really nice it is
excellent
Oh Oh Kevin Rose cut off you do you
teleprompter next episode we need to
make a mod build a telephone any time
oh can we read a teleprompter to get
special code maker I can make it
lucky instead of cannot backwards or
forwards video drivers what okay none
Darren and this is at home bye welcome
to the show we hope you'll join us every
wednesday because we're co-worker this
is awesome to get a show at every
wednesday with all that's huh Pacific
every month sorry okay we're gonna nail
it this room right now ready right dude
I had a lot of fun with that I thought
oh right on the bat did you chop you
we're seeing the same alright alright
alright Oh horrible ooh we will never
launch this show never ever will have it
done for a month I'm gonna study it
every day for a month we'll be sitting
here flying to st. Jude I had a lot of
fun with that
Oh Q right here we go it's your fault
oh we're never gonna really you're gonna
have to wear a charley horse in the face
okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
