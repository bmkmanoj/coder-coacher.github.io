existence those two letters numbers and
hopefully special characters that you
conjured up once to sit between you and
well the digital you that lives in your
pocket on your desk and up in the cloud
today on threat wire
you've heard it all before you need a
good password they need to be long they
need to be unique they need to be
something you can actually remember and
you need to use a different one on every
site and service that you use but why I
mean aside from the obvious you
shouldn't use love sex secret or God as
your password on every site what does it
matter what's going on on the back end I
mean what actually happens in the magic
cloud thing when you login and why
should you care of a service makes
headlines involving hashes and paste
bends well when you create an account on
a modern service you're typically
required to fill out a form including
well at the very least two username and
a password and next time you go to login
to that service while you'll enter those
again and if they match then you know
Bob's your uncle Open Sesame right so
how does the server on this modern web
server know that you're actually logging
in with well today's information that
matches what you set up to begin with
obviously the password and the username
they need to be stored somewhere and
typically that's in a database but
they're stored in very different ways
your username sorry you're not a unique
snowflake it's not that sensitive so
it's probably just stored in plaintext
your password on the other hand that's
kind of sensitive and it should be
protected from both internal and
external threats I say that because you
know just as you don't want crackers to
be able to nab a database full of
account passwords that are clear as day
you don't want systems administrators
database admins and other IT folks
peeking into credentials no matter how
trustworthy they seem so the solution is
typically what's called a one-way hash
now these cryptographic functions are
called one way because they employ
complex math that is outside the scope
of this so we'll just call it happy
funtime math that makes it pretty simple
to take something sensitive like a
password and then turn it into something
like a hash now it's basically
impossible to take the hash and turn it
back into the password that's the whole
one-way part of it so the only way to
check that what you entered is what in
the database says your magic ash is too
well run what you enter through the same
function and see
if the two hashes line up right make
sense so good cryptographic algorithms
are ones that are really quick to
compute that they don't you know take
too long as you try to actually log in
and furthermore no two passwords should
end up with the same hashes because well
that would be a collision you wouldn't
want secret or God to come out with the
same thing that would just be no good
those are terrible passwords anyway but
to take this even further services use
cool things like salts which basically
adds some unique data so that even if
the hashed passwords were to be leaked
in a data breach you couldn't just go
through every single hash through a say
dictionary word checking to see if they
match this would prevent brute force
attacks which is really nice now
unfortunately there are a lot of really
bad hashing algorithms out there that
were never intended to be used for
authentication but for one reason or
another they've been used and as
computers have gotten faster cheaper and
storage more abundant it becomes easier
and easier to crack passwords with
outdated functions and what's worse is
well that some services don't even
bother hashing passwords at all yeah
that's right there's a stored in plain
text clear as day just like your
username and it's almost every single
day that we see a new post on sites like
plaintext defenders com publicly shaming
organizations for like emailing
forgotten passwords to users and you
know it just emphasizes that in a
well-designed system the service doesn't
actually know your password simply that
the one you entered this time matches
the hash in the database or it doesn't
and you don't get to login and so here's
the actual most unfortunate part about
this whole thing right outside of
checking every single post on playing
affects plaintext offenders com or
something oh that's site something of
that service there's no good way of
knowing what kind of security means a
service is actually using when they
store the credentials for your account I
mean sure don't get me wrong there is
always a privacy policy but it typically
says something like we're gonna do our
best to keep private info safe
or I guess in the case of vtec it
actually says we're not going to do
squat because we don't care about hacks
but you know whatever lazy point is it's
only after a massive data breach do we
actually find out if the passwords were
stored securely or not so while it would
be nice to have I don't know say better
data protection laws or something that
would let consumers know what types of
security practices Internet services use
well you should probably just assume
that in the back end at the server
somewhere there's a guy scratching them
down on sticky notes and putting them on
the monitors of the servers which is why
it's so imperative to use long complex
memorable but most importantly unique
passwords on every single site and it
changed them frequently and if you're
wondering like what sites have already
leaked your data you can check out our
friend Troy hunts site have I been pwned
calm and to your details not your
password and find out of yours have been
breached so anyway what are your
thoughts I want to know we're talking
about passwords here I want to know if
you have some good techniques for smart
password practices and what are you
using where he is still typing in qwerty
1234 and every online service let me
know in the comments with that I'm
Darren kitchen I'll see you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
