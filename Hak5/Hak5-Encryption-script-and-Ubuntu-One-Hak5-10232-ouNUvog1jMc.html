carbonite backups are important they're
incredibly boring but they're important
they are boring Darren get over it rsync
really move to one is where it's at
thank you all right so I don't know how
many times my little sister has lost all
of her photos because she spilled some
like alcoholic beverage on her laptop
and tried the restart the thing but she
fries it yeah all the time and you lose
stuff so backups they're important so
here's the thing most cloud backups they
cost money and you gotta pay to get an
external hard drive or install an extra
dry for a raid but luckily the Linux
options are free or they're pretty close
to free at least the clout ones are so
for Linux there are several options for
software there's our scene there's
Dropbox and then there's other online
storages like I folder zumodrive and
there's jungle disk one tool that seemed
really similar to Dropbox is ubuntu one
at 10 boon to calm down over here it'll
sink any files you drop into it to the
cloud backup and to any other computers
that you have connected to it so you
might want to be careful if your
laptop's connected and has a small hard
drive because you could probably fill it
up really really quickly ubuntu one was
created by the ebu two guys way back in
oh nine and it now includes some really
nifty features like cross-platform axis
and usability and there's media
streaming you can choose your folders to
sync across platforms and the program
starts you off with a little bit little
bit of storage there's five gigs you
know it's not much but it will get you
started and from the dashboard you have
access to your folders that you've
synced device's settings and account
information you can also turn off
sinking in the top corner in case you
need bandwidth for something else now
all that stuff that's for windows
there's also a web dashboard that you
can get into you from the Linux side
after you sign in you have access to 10
boo 2.com / files one really easy way to
get to the web dashboard is by
installing the chrome extension now
after you find it it's just over in the
chrome store with everything else so you
have your extension ready and when you
click on it it's just going to take you
into your files that you've uploaded and
it looks kind of like this so I have my
desktop one right here and just a couple
of files that i uploaded yesterday looks
all nice and it's very easy to get
around clicking on the extension brings
you directly to the files that's pretty
much all you're going to get out of that
extension but hey it's it's a shortcut
pretty much along with the interfaces
for your computer there's also an app
for the iPad for the iphone in android
devices which is awesome and they are
all pretty excel phix planet or ii as
far as how to use them so i won't get
into all that stuff for this segment as
mentioned before you can try out the
music streaming service for 30 days for
free it's 399 per month after that so it
doesn't cost too much and it gives you
20 gigs of storage to stream your music
files from anywhere across the web and
awesome but I prefer music google com I
like I like Google music when trying it
out you have to use your credit card to
check out so I didn't sign up for the
free 30 day service I was like yeah no
credit cards thank you so how secure is
abou 21 it's also similar to drop box in
the fact that it doesn't have encryption
when uploading files to the cloud this
means anyone sniffing your traffic maybe
with a little man-in-the-middle attack
could make a copy of your files as they
sink yeah that's not good and to work
around this caveat of an otherwise
really nifty service you'll need to
bring your own encryption this is the
fun part this can be done by downloading
the Ubuntu one encrypt decrypt script
and I'll just put the link in the show
notes it's it's really easy to find and
it's by switch rodeo 720 awesome dude
his script makes it very easy to encrypt
and decrypt files and folders to and
from your Ubuntu one cloud the first off
make sure you download the script and
make it executable and to do this you
right click on it and go to properties
click on permissions and click allow
executing files as program and you can
just save this to your desktop or
something like that for the time being
because we're just going to end up
moving it anyway so now we have to copy
it to the correct directory which is
home slash your name / known to slash
nautilus scripts so this is where nones
file manager keeps all of its scripts
which make it really easy to just
right click on a folder and run them
without having to go into the terminal
which I love ya anything that doesn't
have to go into the terminal is awesome
for me now to get to this folder you'll
need to open up a nautilus window go
into places home folder it's pretty much
just an explorer and hit ctrl L to
change the location type in dot Nome to
hit enter and open up nautilus scripts
and I'll just cut and paste it over
there now the names kind of ugly and
messy and I don't want to see that every
time I right click on it so I can click
f2 and rename it to something a lot
easier so I'll highlight it f2 and i'll
name it encrypt decrypt script that
works perfectly now you may not
immediately see the script in your
context menu whenever you right click on
something to force it to show up you
need to restart nautilus to do so all
you do is hit alt f2 opens up the run
application type in kill all and
nautilus space nautilus and hit run all
right all right now I'm ready to encrypt
a folder so i have this test folder that
i want to encrypt let me find it over
here under my snubs directory ok so
here's my test folder and i just have a
little picture in there and i want to
encrypt it so i'm going to hit right
clip go to scripts and hit encrypt
decrypt SH and i'll choose encrypt and
then click OK and it asks you for a
strong passphrase mine is going to be
four letters long so not that also
serious then hit enter
Oh yep there it is ah it was delayed
okay so this thing pops up in the corner
and it tells me that it's uploaded my
personal to my personal boon to one
folder so I open that up and I see I
have this nice little gzip of my test
folder and it's encrypted in Des three
awesome now I should mention as well
that the script won't work inside the
Ubuntu one folder because that folder is
automatically syncing up to the cloud so
if you put something in there and then
you try to encrypt it it's already been
uploaded to the cloud as an unencrypted
folder and the same goes for decrypting
as well so you won't be able to do any
of that kind of stuff inside that folder
you'll have to copy everything out of it
so now that I want to decrypt this
folder I hit cut and I'm just going to
put it somewhere outside of the you boo
to one folder and then I right click on
it bit of scripts in crit decrypt and I
have to put in the same four letter
password really it's game which you just
lost oh I'm so funny so this makes me
wonder if you can use this grip to
encrypt documents for the boon to one
folder couldn't we just edit the script
a little bit to automatically upload to
dropbox as well i think it could work
what else do you guys use for your linux
backups let me know in the comments
below or feedback at hak5 dot org of
course coming up soon we'll be answering
your viewer questions but first let's
take a break and then check in with
Darren for the nibble
computer disasters eventually happened
everyone your computer crashes it gets
infected with a virus yeah drop it but
if you get carbonite online backup
before your disaster the no need to
worry because your files will be backed
up automatically in safely off site and
its really really easy to get them back
plus you get anytime anywhere access to
your backed up files from any computer
or on your smartphone or ipad with a
free Carbonite app with carbonite
unlimited backup for your pc or mac is
just 59 bucks a year that's less than
five bucks a month but when you use the
offer code hak5 to start your free
15-day trial you'll get two months free
if you decide to buy all the details are
at carbonite.com and remember to use the
offer code hak5 to get two months free
with purchase this nibble is sent in by
Drew and he writes if you're using GCC
to compile software you'd probably use
the tech Jay option with the amount of
CPU cores you have plus one so for
example if you have like a dual-core CPU
you would just use the option tak j-3 if
you had a quad core system you'd use
tact j5 just add one to however mate
cores you actually have and then watch
your software compile so much faster
thank you again for everybody's
presenting in the nipples you can send
in your for bitsat hak5 org slash nibble
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
