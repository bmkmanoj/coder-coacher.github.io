you by domain.com pack five is the show
for which your eyes are feasting upon
the glory of the techno last welcome my
name is Darren kitchen that works my
name is Shannon Morse
a weekly dose of that stuff that I just
mentioned as you are watching this we
are currently at the the hacker cons of
hacker cons attempting to make our booth
look pretty survive survive the extreme
Vegas heat and sniff all the package hey
come out if you're if you're there when
we're here with the time-warp like right
now during this week check out check out
our Twitter's and whatnot for the
information on when we're gonna be
speaking at the wireless village because
7i are launching wipe a pineapple from
where 1.5 it's windy yeah ap and all
sorts of other amazing things get some
hardware we got some software which
means awesome excited I can't wait to
play with the new software I'm really
excited about this I am well since we're
kind of taking it easy this week I
decided to show another alternative to
SDR sharp so that's what I'm gonna be
doing in today's episode with my fun
little antenna dongle that I carry
around in my purse hooray oh my god
first on goals first dongles so with
that why don't we just gonna cut to the
action let's do it Peter last time I saw
you we were building drones yes we were
it was a lot of fun wasn't it what have
you been doing since then well I was
working on a lot of projects but
especially on one we actually skimmed
over it when we were actually showing
we're shooting the show so I use do you
remember the Lisa s now the Lisa s is
the paparazzi auto pilot that we are
putting in the pineapple drone no it's
the smaller sister of the Lisa M that we
are putting in sorry M is medium s is
small yes exactly so a the Lisa s is
it's smaller sister and it is
really really tiny now when you say
really really tiny how tiny are you
talking like a postage stamp okay so you
made a flight controller the size of a
postage stamp however it only uses what
three access accelerometers or what and
no it's more than that it's like it's a
three axis accelerometer
it's a gyroscope three axis magnetometer
magnetometer and also a barometer and a
GPS so wait a second
that sounds like everything that the
bigger Lisa M has actually more than the
Lisa I am the least I am still needs an
external GPS this guy has everything on
board okay oh well why make a flight
controller that feature packed in that
small because you want to put it on
smaller airframes that's actually the
the main goal of making it smaller right
oh yeah I guess how small small this
small what class is that this is a
twelve centimeters so 120-millimeter
class that's a 120 millimeter class yeah
this is so this actually is a frame that
is reused from a toy and this is the
Chinese ladybird and it it fits on top
and no I know I know I have like these
little hubs and guys and they're great
they're fun toys but they don't have
barometers and GPS and magnetometer so
so this guy this guy is actually a
autonomous robot it's like it can do
everything the bigger guys can do that's
so crazy because I've spent hundreds of
dollars building big guys because you've
got you know you got a big flight
controller which means you got a guy
with a big frame because you need big
motors cuz you need big props because
you need a big battery and all of this
is the same thing that I just described
except miniaturized yeah that's really
fantastic how does it fly just like the
big guys it's just smaller and fits in
your pocket almost okay can I try this
sure okay here you go
so I take it that this works varies just
similar to any other paparazzi so
down into the right okay and let me
start wow it's like a wonderful battery
in my hand this is fantasy look at that
that is so tiny is it ready this is a
GPS and I've got some LEDs here for so
it's not a Tweedy log so it's solid the
orange so wait wait wait
this little guy has like a lock I can do
return to home I can do fixed position
yeah and it has some say ground station
so I can hook this up to the software
and actually give it waypoints just like
I would it's just so weird because like
I'm used to seeing this and thinking
like oh that's a toy whoa okay
what is the button and this is the bind
button so you can bind it to your
spectrum transmitter there we go so I've
actually got a professional transmitter
even though this guy is like I'm sorry
I'm still having problems like it's
blowing my mind because I'm totally used
to little toy quadcopters this size not
professional you can actually program it
to do the thing yeah and it's yeah the
software is completely open source it's
also the paparazzi software we are using
on the on the bumblebee it's the same
software so it should start up and fly
just like the bumblebee that we built
yeah that's right okay so down into the
right on the remote and then but this is
micro switch and the kill switch is on
the corner okay cool from your hand
alright hey guys
all right so orange is the back oh my
god whoa it's so responsive right oh my
gosh okay I've never flown this before
guys actually it's a little windy yeah
but this is insane
okay so it flies more responsive whoops
and killing and killing yeah okay well
that's weird cuz they actually just
instinctively held down into the right
that flies okay okay this thing because
I'm just made into this that flies like
a bumblebee but smaller and I guess I
shouldn't be surprised by that because
it's the same flight controller the same
software's inside of it I'm hardware
actually Peter I'm just amazing you were
able to get that into the size of a
postage stamp well it was a lot of work
it was not easy
yeah so one more thing that is really
really cool about this guy is the radio
actually it's like what we did with the
radio we figured out how these guys
communicate mm-hmm and it's a standard
standard transmitter this spectrum you
can get it in ooh next best hobby shop
and what we did we figured out how it
communicates and implemented it in the
autopilot so what we were able to do is
add telemetry with the standard protocol
of paparazzi so it's like like and
you're actually sending telemetry over
the spectrum protocols yes so not only
did you reverse engineer the control
lengths this is the 2.4 gigahertz link
between the transmitter and the in this
case of quadcopter but the aircraft
you're also sending data back over the
same channel with telemetry yeah and so
what did this dongle right here
that is fantastic what what is this
dongle doing so does this replace the
900 mega modem that I would have
otherwise rows one the the bigger build
that we did yeah that's exactly what it
is it's you you just need one radio this
way
if we wanted to save more weight saving
Radio saving spectrum your are you
saving power yeah
whoa there's power wise I mean this is a
really tiny craft I mean what the
controller is bigger than it what kind
of battery are you using and system
working so this standard kit it's like
this is this is how it comes it's a with
a 250 milli amp hour battery so it flies
around like five minutes okay I've got
some 350 s for my hub zone there are
also one cells yes yes same idea you can
extend it to seven to ten minutes by
using a bigger battery I'm so amazing
because unlike what I'm used to with the
toy I am just still like rocking the
fact that you can just program in
waypoints for this little guy and then
away it goes
yeah that's that's exactly the idea it's
like it's it's a research tool I'm
really curious what people will build
with that so that's the really big thing
about the Lisa M is as a research tool
you've got a lot of input and output and
other stuff that you can use to extend
it like we were talking about like
somebody had written drivers or not
drives software to allow it to speak to
an Iridium modem you know like why well
I don't know I guess maybe you sent your
your UAV into an area that doesn't have
any control signal that's fantastic
so what kind of extensibility do you
have with this as compared to some of
the other platforms for paparazzi so and
of course by optimizing the size and
weight you have to compromise a little
bit but we still we still have a UART
that is available we have of course BPM
channel so you can use it on other
platforms than a quadrocopter
the nice thing about this board is that
it comes with a driver MOSFETs so it can
drive for brushed motors on this tiny
frame but the same pin out you can use
people PWM to run brushless motors if
you want that you can so you just need
to add your own electronic speed
controllers but you would actually so
right now this board will speak to
brushed motors without any additional
component yeah it's just a drop-in
replacement it's like of the
toy electron donor we've covered this
but the advantage between brushed and
brushless motors its efficiency it's
they're more efficient and this way we I
I'm pretty sure we can extend the flight
time and still keep the same size if not
well not just that though if you're
talking if you're saying that this can
speak to an electronic speed controller
there's no reason why it wouldn't be
able to speak to a 30-amp ESC on a 550
class quadcopter not a 120 class so
we're talking about the big boys here
right yeah that's that's a very good
point it's a you can use this postage
stamp flight controller and then not
like a huge UAV too if you wanted to
well what that's I'm just that's so
fantastic okay
and it's paparazzi so it's open-source
and we've covered this ad nauseam but I
just am so surprised
what kind of like just the Marvel of the
engineering involved in this I'm I'm so
I'm proud of you dude this is
ridiculously awesome thank you thank you
that's I it took a while to get here but
I think it was worth it I hope you guys
agree too okay well working you guys
find out about the Lisa s and just go to
my website one bit squirt comm and you
will find the shop there it's like we
just released the hardware it is
available now and you can get it you can
hack it you can extend it and have a lot
of fun it's like a kit with all the bits
this is also a complete kit it comes
with the frame it comes with with the
charger battery everything research that
I want to start building a drone that I
can like start hacking on in my office
not having to go outside every time I
want to fly because trust me I love this
120 class because my cat must love it as
well because I fly all around her and
the girlfriend as well but this is
indoors friendly yeah it is it
definitely is and people are already
working on support for indoor navigation
systems so that they have positioning so
you can you can do it like what
the other universities do indoors you
can do that with this platform tier I
feel like we're living in a science
fiction novel this is so crazy thank you
so much dude Peter as always I can't
wait to continue our own series I'm so
loving the kinds of crazy stuff that
you're coming up with I can't wait to
see you at Def Con this is fantastic
everybody go ahead and check out one bit
squared really appreciate it did the
computer internet is now available on
the Broadband's for which you too can
have a personal homepage
this page can just be like all sorts of
magical information about yourself
and your cats and guess what when you
need that personal homepage you should
do what shannon and i do which is to
head over to domain.com they have a
magical wizard which will show you all
of the available domains and let you get
your website up and running in no time
at all and you'll realize that it is

got a coupon codes it's gonna save you
15% when you checkout at domain.com with
coupon code hak5 so when you think
domain names think domain.com
we are back and it's time for the trivia
question of the week
the last week's trivia question was
excessive second order harmonics
emanating from a 10 meter transmitter
are most likely to affect which TV
channel and if you answer that it was
channel 2 the second harmonic of 28
megahertz is 56 and this is just above
the 6m band and within the proximity of
TV channel 2 now this week's trivia
question is what is the name of the
command used to add a user to an OS X
box or an OS 10 box you can answer that
over at hak5 org slash trivia for your
chance to win some awesome hack 5
goodies good luck even though we're
packing up for Def Con over here I
decided to have a little bit more fun
with SDR because hey why not so since
we're taking it a little bit easy this
week I decided to do another alternative
SDR program that's kind of a comparison
to SDR sharp an HD SDR so this one is
called SDR radio and you can find it
over at SDR radio.com
I have the website pulled up so you can
get an idea of what it looks like
SDR - radio comm here you can read all
about it but yeah it's basically just
another alternative so we want to
download the one that is version 2 you
can find that over at v2 dot SDR - radio
comm just go over to the downloads link
and then you'll have a couple of choices
I decided to do the most recent one this
one is the 2.2 release it just downloads
a dot exe file you just let it run and
then follow all the on-screen
instructions as usual and then you just
download that to install the file once
you're done with that there's a couple
of DLLs that you need to also download
and copy and paste into your folder
these are gonna make your own SDR RTL
dongle compatible with SDR radio the
actual software so those and I'll put
this link in the show notes because it's
a little bit weird this is where we
found our dll's so this guy decided to
go ahead and compile his own version of
them to make
his dongle run with SDR radio if you
just go down to the bottom you'll have a
couple of links to the as the DLLs so
you can download either the january 6
one or the february ninth one i did the
february ninth one and then i just
copied the files over from my download
folder I have 64-bit windows so I just
copied all these and I put them into my
my folder which was found under Program
Files so it'll show up as SDR radio
procom so yeah you just copy everything
over into that folder all the DLLs and
then it should be compatible that you
should be ready to go so before you go
ahead and file it fire up the program
obviously we need to plug in your dongle
so make sure you plug it into your USB
also runs the zadig config if you
haven't done that already we did that in
the very first SDR radio segment that we
did like way back at the beginning of
this series so go ahead and check that
out so you can run through it it's a
very simple program and it'll just make
sure that you have the correct drivers
for you on your computer to make sure
that this runs correctly off of your USB
port now I'm gonna go ahead and start up
the software so I can show you what it
looks like so I'm gonna minimize these
so this is what it looks like I just put
one on my Start menu and my desktop
because it's easy that way so when you
start it up has a whole bunch of crazy
stuff on here it's going to have a nice
little pop-up that's look that asks you
if you want to add a new radio
definition so you hit yes and then
you'll have this nice little menu here
so it'll let you select a radio and the
radio that I have is of course my
rtl-sdr USB it should be able to find it
automatically whenever you have this
plugged in since you've run that driver
software
so go ahead and choose it and then you
want to choose your sample rate my
sample rate down here I have mine set at
two megahertz that might be incorrect
I'll have to do a little bit of research
on that but that's what I have mine set
to and then you hit start now I'm going
to turn down the volume on this one
since we don't really need to listen to
the volume for this segment but
basically just choose your sample rate
hit start and you should be ready to go
and you should actually hear some kind
of
frequency some kind of information
coming out of your speakers now there
are a couple of settings that we want to
go ahead and set up so you're going to
see your spectrum appear and you'll see
a nice little waterfall at the bottom
this waterfall is really really big so
you should see quite a few things
happening and then up here is where you
see your spectrum so you can see what
channels are actually receiving any kind
of information what data is going on
I mind set to the FM radio because well
it's the easiest one to actually do so
we're gonna hit span and span is found
right here click on that and set it to
the same sample rate that you had set
previously once you do that you should
hear a little bit more clearer frequency
than you had previously now we want to
click on frequency and frequency is also
found on the same panel right here when
you click on that it's going to open up
this big window over on the side so this
is where you can set your frequency you
can change it it gives you a couple of
other general options as well this is
kind of interesting if you go under
general you can click on all these
different frequencies to choose what's
what channel you want to listen to if I
scroll down you can see that I'm
currently on the 101 to 102 range right
in that section and I can also verify
that by looking up here at the different
numbers now of course you can also
change it up here as well this is the
vfo tuning window I can just click up or
I can click down to go up and down on
the frequencies to choose different
channels and then I can click inside of
my spectrum to change it make it a
little bit more clear which channel I
want to listen in on the vo tuning box
that'll let you change the frequency you
can also change the gain settings under
the RF icon at the top that is found up
here under options so this gives you
options for your antenna the RF
frequency I have mine really high forty
nine point six DBS
also your radio configuration so this is
where you can find the ppm the
parts-per-million adjustment I have mine
set to 40 ppm so that's what I've been
mostly keeping mine at for all of the
different
we're tutorials that I've been running
through you'll also notice that this
program doesn't give you as many options
as far as changing the look and feel of
the program customizing you know how
pretty your waterfall is or customizing
the zoom and things like that you don't
get as many options as you do with HD
SDR as far as this goes but if you want
to change what your waterfall looks like
you can do that over here there's a
little icon that looks kind of like a
mountain almost so you click on that and
you can change what your actual thing
looks like and I can go up and down to
heighten or lower the brightness of the
different stations that I'm listening to
oh I can make it look crazy so I like to
keep it right round in this range for
myself a few other little topics that I
wanted to mention you can also look at
DSP options so this is where you'll find
interesting things like AGC noise
blinker you'll find squelch which will
take care of any kind of horrible noises
that you hear between people talking
knotch
and then there's noise reductions which
can also help with you know messing with
your own radio if you need to change any
of those options up here is where you'll
find all the different channels that you
can listen in on so I have AMC w FM I'm
currently on wide FM which is where
you'll find all your different radio
stations SSB under that you'll have LSB
USB and DSP if you want to listen in on
any of those below that you'll see a
bunch of different kilohertz settings so
I have mine set to 48 and that seems to
work pretty well for myself I'm gonna
Center my station again so I can listen
to it and then I can also choose if I
want to I can have two different radios
installed at the same time so I can have
a vfo a and a vfo B now that can be
really useful again if you've listened
to our previous segments about different
things that you can do with two
different ones so you can listen to two
different stations at the same time that
are talking back and forth if you will
so it can be very very handy and the
last big thing that I wanted to mention
was you see this little radio frequency
in the waterfall below here this is
basically just a zoomed
version of up above it so you can get a
little bit more defined interaction with
what's going on on that station and then
next to that is an audio spectrum so
you'll see the vfo tuning where we have
our actual numbers FM stereo and then
audio spectrum so you can hit play and
you'll get an audio spectrum of what's
going on on that station that you might
be listening to at the time not much
happening on this one but we can play
around with it a little bit there we go
make it a little bit more clear so yeah
lots of different options very
customizable it's definitely a lot more
advanced than other options that you
have up there for software but it's
there if you want to use it and some
people don't want to use SDR sharp so
there you go check out SDR radio or
refer at SDR radio.com and make sure
that you check out all the different
options because it is very hardcore
there's lots to do but I haven't found
any add-ons and I really like the
add-ons that SDR sharp has so I might
just stick with SDR sharp anyway stay
tuned we have lots more coming up and of
course you can send me feedback over at
the comments or you can email us over at
feedback at hack 5 org
hey over here
Oh coming out of there what you're still
ringing sorry I'm using too many phones
at a time can you realize it alone
check this out
the radiation monitor option - okay it
says please place the sample near the
radiation detector and then press any
keys so let's go with five the sample is
emitting 3.6 and micro receivers per
hour or so says the pay phone at tour
camp phones at work out I'm free candy
Ritchie what are you trying to do you're
trying to blow up a network or something
what is this it looks like a power
supply for a Dell laptop but on this end
is a Ethernet jack but that's not right
that's no no okay listen I did I did
like ten years as a Systems
Administrator there's no way I would
ever let anyone plug this I don't know
what this does but there's no way that's
going near my network yeah although I
must say if you ever look under my desk
it's littered with these and these and
these and you don't pay much attention
to it because it kind of just blends in
so the secrets inside here and if I open
this up you can see oh oh what's what's
going on with the pie that's fantastic I
love this overtly solder you know the
s-video out of there just to fit it into
the case and it just so happens I don't
need the video anyway and then here's a
USB power supply is just taking apart so
it fit Oh like like your iPhone charger
or something like that
exactly fantastic and then you know the
power cord is the same after that and
you own this and so what does the
software do so basically I watched some
of your hack 5 videos and learn how to
do a verse SSH tunneling yeah so
whenever I plug this into a network it
doesn't personal back to my server at
home so you always have access to that
network how to do remote tech support Oh
fantastic remote tech support and it
just so happens to be in such a way that
it would very easily just disappear in a
network closet that is fantastic and I
love that it even has like the stickers
on the back and everything it was truly
an HP power supply in a former life yeah
exactly
that's really cool have you uh have you
posted this script or you're just
basically it's just what
everything everything I did to make this
happen I put on my blog which you can
find at tunnels up desktop tunnels up
comm Richie I really appreciate it and
that's really in genius Cheers
once again we'd like to thank you for
guys for watching the show and the thing
that happened we made the stuff we
survived we survived though us you made
it to the end you know deserve lovely
mustaches yeah oh it's so cute it's like
a blonde mustache
don't touch my month days if you want to
you can always check out hhk shop.com
that is where you can find all of the
hak5 goodies that we were selling at
DEFCON as well as everything that you
can find online like normal including
t-shirts and fun things there's nothing
normal about the hack shop though nope
just throwing that out there also you
can follow us hack 5 dot org slash
follow that's where you would have found
out about all of the awesome parties and
fun crazy stuff and shenanigans that are
happening with the shenanigan over here
at the deaf of the con what else do we
do what else we try and call the booze
and act on things so without further ado
thank you very much for watching
she'sshe and amorous he's daring kitchen
trust you took the lost
you're gonna do the show are you a mute
what's going on you forgot how they do
the show bad y'all that's good
y'all take a nap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
