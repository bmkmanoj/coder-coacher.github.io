you by gazelle the fastest and easiest
way to sell and recycle your gadgets for
hak5 i'm darren kitchen here at the NBC
Universal blogger lounge here with Ted
from red ted from red what's up man how
you doing good it's the end of the day
and I'm you know 730 interviews in and
still got my voice well I bet man
because you have a beautiful views of
hardware in front of you this is the red
pro 5-point oh what's what's the
significant that's just one part okay so
this is a red scarlet the five point 0
is just the the monitor is the red pro
LCD 5 inches the measurement but what
you're looking at here is the Scarlet
camera so this is kind of like this is
entry level as red gets and this is not
an entry-level camera by any means this
is a full-on high-end professional piece
of gear now a lot of people right now
are doing a lot of interesting things
with an a you know beautiful HD video
with entry-level digital still camera
something like this you can pick up like
say a TTY hack the firmware and do some
neat stuff with it you know especially
when you just throw on some really fast
glass so how does this compare to that
so when you mentioned HD video they
think they're doing HD video but they're
actually not I mean you may be using a
cropped sensor on something like a t2 I
but when you in these with these still
cameras that shoot motion they're kind
of cool in their own right they're great
for like web stuff and this kind of
thing it's it's really nicely suitable
for but for professional work just
because they pack it into a 1080p bucket
you know the raster says 1080p doesn't
mean you're actually getting 1080p
resolution you're actually getting about
half that believe it or not so those
cameras are actually very low res in
video mode in still mode they're amazing
right because they're still cameras but
people are kind of fooled a little bit
by the res and video mode whereas the
red one this camera and the epic are
full-on true professional high
resolution devices both still and motion
okay so how does it compare price wise
to something like that this is going to
be more expensive than say
Piro or a 60 diora or a 5d or 70
probably price point these are still
prototypes we're not done with anything
in terms of all the engineering and even
the pricing because right but but less
then this is floating around six grand
give or take for what you're looking at
here so what it compares to in the
marketplace our cameras that are a
hundred to three hundred thousand
dollars from other companies and then
you've also got some other things like
for example the new Panasonic stuff that
will take micro four thirds lenses what
does this do as far as lenses are
concerned this particular model is a
fixed lens this as an 8 x zoom which is
super flexible it's very wide to very
telephoto so it's always in 35 mil
equivalent it's like 28 to well over 200
mil so it's a really long range I mean
you can shoot it for everything then
there'll be a different model which will
have an interchangeable lens so you
could put Nikon lenses canon lenses
broadcast lenses on it whatever you want
our epic camera are really high-end
camera that's the one that Peter
Jackson's taking to work on the next
Hobbit and really Scott's taking to work
on the next aliens and all this stuff
and there's a big studio movie shooting
right now with it that I'm not at
liberty to say but you can do your own
research and figure out what it is I
can't tell you but you could tell people
what it is so are you saying that this
would be compatible with those lenses so
the the other version of this this one
is its own lens but and it's not about
me you were saying you know basically 35
to 200 and it's at 2.52 point yeah two
point f 2.8 f 2.5 the entire gamut of
that i think it might actually be have
24 but either way to five across the
full length of the zoo yeah and you're
saying it goes to some ridiculous iso
levels right guys yeah I can dial this
up right now I'm at 2500 which is
somewhat ridiculous by last year
standards but you know still cameras can
do that to a certain extent but we can
take this close to 13,000 is 0 which is
basically shooting in the dark what's
the size of the sensor on this guy it's
two thirds inch so this is a
professional size device like these
devices that you're shooting here are
micro micros and most broadcaster that
you know 30 inch anyway so this is
pretty big now how does that compare to
the previous red or you know the big
brother of it
so this is a slightly lower resolution
than the red one which is 4k which
derives a little over 3k of actual
measured resolution which is why you see
big movies like the gun social network
the David Fincher movie that's getting
all the buzz that's all red one the
Pirates of the Caribbean movie that will
come out this summer that's red one 3d
so that's high res 3d in fact because
when NBC booth I'll mention a TV show
that's that premieres this sunday well
maybe I'll give me a free t-shirt or
something it's a TV show called the cape
that is really cool look in action show
heavily promoted on NBC premieres in a
couple days and that's all red one for
TV so those are just a few of the many
many examples of high-end red tuna
matagi fee that's being done on the
existing camera which is the 4k and then
this kind of brings you all that
goodness goodness right so this is not a
video camera at all this is a motion
picture camera shoots raw images now I'm
assuming that you could put this in the
enclosures that I've seen with all of
the attachments and just start adding on
to the system because it is a system
like a like a just a bunch of Lego like
here's an example so this is our remote
control called a red moat that I can
attach to the camera or I can remove
from the camera and I can control the
device from say 100 feet away so if this
thing is up on a crane I don't have to
bring it down to change the settings or
roll it or cut it I can just roll it
remotely because there's wireless Wi-Fi
in the camera now it seems like just
yesterday the original red was coming
out how is the adoption bin I know that
it's been a lot in movies and whatnot
but how is the adoption bin with the
codec in your nonlinearities as you're
bringing out more entry-level camera are
we going to see support for you know
your final cuts your your premieres your
Avid's things like those in the in the
really early days of red when we first
started we had apple as a technology
partner and they've been great they've
been with us all along a lot of the
other companies were kind of like who
are you guys and why should we care
don't waste our time well now
everybody's on board so every major I
know you headed in Adobe Premiere you
said right so that has full native
integration with red files avid which is
probably the most popular for really
high-end big-budget movies and whatnot
native works with their DNX codec or our
read files
Final Cut Pro works with their pro res
codec or our red files so from sort of
the earliest stages of where there was
just one player to couple years later
everybody plays with red in a fully
integrated fashion and we actually sell
a little piece of hardware that goes
into Mac or a PC called a red rocket
card that allows all the post-production
work that you would do with a red for a
movie or TV show or even a web video to
be all real time or faster well Ted
thank you so much I really appreciate
you taking the time talk to us my
pleasure thank you kidding good totally
play with this gazelle accepts more than
300,000 products from over 20 different
electronics categories got your eye on
one of the new products over here at CES
gazelle can get you money for your old
gear when you upgrade shipping is free
on all items of value and in most cases
they'll even send you a box to ship with
also few green folks out there gazelle
makes all of their recycling partners
adhered to some strict policies there's
no exports no landfill policies and tons
and tons of data security standards
whether you're upgrading to a new iPhone
a new android device or other tech gear
Gizella is a great way to get cast to
upgrade to the latest deck yeah there's
a different attachment that's a high res
electronic viewfinder that you can sit
right here
and you can run hdmi out fer ya in this
case is compact flash or SSD approach
came out there floating in 16 32 and 64
no no not at all me but just a little
too good to you know they all the good
after the interviews over right so two
pieces of the technology puzzle right so
this particular model in this
configuration has a CF as a CF reader
which is great but because we do this
super advanced compression we can record
in 3k on a 16 gig card you're going to
probably have 15 minutes or so of
recording but what I think the most
popular configuration with this camera
will be won't be compact flash it'll be
1.8 inch SSD so we already have them we
already have a module it looks the same
as it's just a little bit longer that
can hold up to 256 gig of solid-state
memory so you can run for hours just on
this configuration it won't add any
weight it's just it's like a little
candy bar it's just a great way you know
I gotta say like even just the even just
the form factor of it it feels like
you're just I mean it's not really
awkward and I've seen some really nifty
rigs that people have put these yeah the
Scarlet bodies some about four and a
half pounds the epic body believe it or
not isn't much bigger than this it's
about five pounds wider but not much it
kind of looks the same in your hands so
there'll be people thinking be surprised
that an epic or a scarlet it kind of
looked the same it's a professional tool
this is not a toy this is you're gonna
see big movies the price of a you know
really that's a pleasure price of your
entry-level prosumer stuff correct and
it blows it away you can't even compare
it like what is a what is the sony x
help me I hear it yes yeah what are
those does around the same price anyway
so yeah show show floor one of these
well next year you're probably gonna see
a lot of these running around we might
be shooting your interviews on your
right yeah but what do you do with 4k is
this for case where we can this is 3k so
this derives greater than an HD image
from the 3k raw files yes like the 4k
derides about 3.2 k which is about the
same as 35 millimeter where's the zoom
function on this guy so there's a rocker
there I actually have it turned off
because it's an engineering mode and
there's a rocker on the remote so we can
control the zoom wirelessly as well okay
but there's no manual on the on the
there will be yeah and then you also
have manual well it's the zoom is a
rocker there and then you have manual
focus override if you want this there's
also touch focus so you can look like an
SLR focuses yet okay all kinds of cool
stuff thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
