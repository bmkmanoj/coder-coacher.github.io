up Metasploit Community Edition on
Debian so let me show you a little bit
on this we've already done our download
it's our 64-bit or 32-bit depending on
your Linux version and in this case we
are going to already have it downloaded
and chmod it so that we can run it we're
going to sue do so because this thing
rut needs to run is root because it's
installing services and such we're
saying yes we accept our license after
we go down and read all of it
yes we're reading every single bit yes
we accept select a folder where you want
this to be installed in yes we want to
run this as a service yep we're
disabling our firewall and just like on
the windows version is asus for the port
we've already discussed this you can run
it on any port you want we're going to
just go with the default 3790 the
certificate yes trust the certificate
and we start our installation
now that our installers finish we're
going to go straight into the web
interface just like we did with Windows
so let me show you copy yes I understand
the risk that I am going to a
certificate on localhost confirm okay so
next we got to enter our username which
we're going to do hack five hack five as
a user oops attack six I'm waiting for
the next edition so MSF at hack five org
