the election season hacks malvert izing
exploits millions the NSA can track in
flight cell phone use and openvpn gets
an audit coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morrison this
threat wire for tuesday december 13 2016
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and internet freedom
good news for our patrons over at
patreon.com / threat wire we are now
offering an exclusive patron only audio
feed of threat wire so you can grab a
copy of our RSS link and put it into
your favorite podcasting app to listen
to our show offline now you fun the
making of the show so thank you for
letting us bring you security news every
single week i'm doing a quote here
Shannon please do a piece on the
election on threat wire that was a
comment i received a few weeks ago to
which i wrote a topic regarding the
possibility of changes to security and
privacy that we are likely to see in the
coming years because of the election
with news of net neutrality potentially
being on the chopping block with a new
majority it seems that some of our
worries may actually become reality look
whether you are pleased with the
election or not we are not going to stop
talking about security and privacy news
just because there's a new president we
will continue to report on it just like
we did with the Obama administration so
I don't really care who you support but
this show is for security privacy and
Internet freedom news good and bad we
will take a very studious look at every
single bill just like we have done since
we started the show in 2012 if you don't
like it I promise you you do not have to
watch with that said there is no proof
that compromised voting machines change
the election outcome in November but
should we still treat voting machines
just like we do any other computer
software should they be audited while
some are arguing that a recount for the
u.s. presidential election and they are
saying that it was changed with a hack
researcher Alex Halderman of University
of Michigan argues that it should be a
default part of the election process for
any election involving electronic voting
the methods involved wouldn't require a
full recount and could
done on a small percentage level to
determine if machines were correct since
several electronic voting machines have
already been found to be vulnerable to
potential malware and some could even be
affected physically in under seven
minutes it seems plausible that an audit
should be necessary now while voting
machines may not have changed the
outcome other sources blame Russia
Russian actors were linked to earlier
hacks during the election in several
cybersecurity and US intelligence
community researchers have analyzed
evidence showing Russian ties but this
evidence is also being disputed either
way as a Friday of last week President
Obama declared a full deep review of the
cyber attacks during the election season
and requested that all research and
findings be reported before he leaves
office in January steganography huh that
was one of my very first segments on
hak5 way back in the day I was so
awkward anyways steganography is a
commonly used practice to hide code or
secret messages inside of larger
documents such as images PDFs etc but it
was also used long before computers to
hide secret messages during war times
borrowing from the words steganography
and using the basic concept as well stay
gano am al vertising campaign that began
in 2014 has been used to attack millions
of visitors to mainstream websites for
the past two months malvert icing is
used to deliver malware hidden inside
regular advertising ads on websites
insta gano's case the code is hidden in
banner ads and secretly dwells in
specific code written to change the
color of pixels ARS technica describes
the malware as redirecting the browser
to a site that hosts three exploits for
now patched Adobe Flash vulnerabilities
Internet Explorer is the main target and
the ads promote browser defense and
that's spelled with a see instead of an
S and Brock su the malware itself looks
for any security software and if it
doesn't see any it redirects the user to
the exploit site the flash exploits can
log keystrokes steal email credentials
take screenshots and basically act like
a backdoor to the user's machine sadly
attacks like these are prone to continue
because advertising networks are really
bad at detecting malvert icing and do
through the ongoing at
nth of websites to block you from
accessing them if you use an ad blocker
we are kind of in between a rock and a
hard place websites need to depend on
other forms of income or source their
own advertisements in other words not
depend on a network which might miss
malvert izing and ad networks need to
come up with a solution to detect
malware in advertisements do you use
your phone while in flight several
aircraft are equipped with GSM
capabilities these days and since
regulations no longer require you to
shut down your phones during takeoff and
landing consumers are more likely to
leave their phones on in airplane mode
or they might just never even put them
in airplane mode in the first place and
just leave them on the entire time now
in the release by Snowden the NSA had a
document detailing a top secret plan to
intercept cell phone calls and data
while consumers were onboard aircraft in
a 2012 presentation at GCHQ the british
version of the NSA was basically doing
the same thing and included examples of
this tracking actually in use all the
plane had to do was fly over 10,000 feet
and all the consumer has to do is turn
on their phone that gives away the
position which can be compared to known
passengers to figure out who the phone
belongs to if the consumer connects to
in-flight Wi-Fi along with call data
they can also track what a user is doing
such as browsing travel apps social
networks emails Google's sending texts
calls and video Wi-Fi pineapples so what
can you do keep your phone off during
the entire flight because even if it's
an airplane mode that can give away your
position but I am curious if anybody out
there chooses the convenience of your
phone for entertainment even in airplane
mode over security of turning it off or
the whole flight now that we know the
government agencies are using this
technology we are always always pleased
to hear that an open source project
aimed at security and privacy is being
audited and this case is no different
openvpn is the most recent one day at
the news as the next version of openvpn
will be getting an audit from John
Hopkins University cryptographer and
researcher Matthew D Green Green is
being contracted by top VPN service
private Internet
says to audit version 2.4 as soon as it
exits beta mode results will eventually
be made public and the source is
available on github let's do an e-hug he
