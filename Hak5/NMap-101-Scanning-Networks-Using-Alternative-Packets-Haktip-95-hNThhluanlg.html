support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are going
over discovery options now you'll notice
whenever you use and map that it only
out outputs to servers that are
currently alive and operating this is
because it sends out something called an
ICMP aka
internet control message protocol echo
request to look for any devices that are
currently alive now buying doing so nmap
will save you time by giving you
information because it's not going to be
scanning anything that's offline an MEP
will also scan ports 80 and 443 because
if ICMP is being blocked by a firewall
or something similar these two ports are
most common commonly being used by web
platforms so basically when you're
scanning your network you're only going
to get the items that are open if you
want to scan more secure targets then
these alternate discovery options might
be more useful so first off the first
one that I wanted to show you today is
called don't ping which is used with the
tach PN protocol so tons sometimes
you'll run into a target that seems to
be offline and map will give you some
kind of error that says something like
host scenes down
blah blah blah try tak PN so this is
basically what it's telling you to do
tak PN will skip that first ping attempt
and go ahead and do a deep scan of the
target so you would type in something
like this and map tech capital P capital
n both have to be capital it's different
if you don't capitalize those and then
your IP address so I'm going to type int
n dot 70 331 dot let's do 1 4 5 so
you'll notice when it runs this second
scan it looks exactly like you would
expect it to nothing has actually
changed this just gives it an alternate
way to pick up some kind of request in
response so say you want to just can't
scan the network really really quick to
see which ones are online you don't need
to know about the names or the open
ports you can only do a ping only
scan so this is a completely different
version to do so you'll type in
something a little bit different this
time we'll type in a lowercase s capital
P so nmap tack lowercase s capital P for
simple ping and then whatever your
target is so I'm going to say 10 dot 73
31 dot let's do the entire network so
while this is running it's going to just
give me back a little bit of information
about each target so once you're nmap
scan is done with a simple ping you'll
notice that it scans all the open
targets including all the closed ones
and it looks for all 256 IP addresses 16
of these are up and scanned in 17
seconds
so this basically just tells you whether
your IP address is up or if it's down
now after the break we're going to check
out a couple of other alternative
discovery options but let's stay tuned
for our sponsor the hack shop is hack 5s
premier store for all of your pen
testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and it types
like a keyboard super super fast into
your computer and we have an excellent
idea from one of our forum members
called nucleus in this script he
basically said it will quickly steal
your chromed save passwords without
leaving a trace see this is why you
shouldn't save your passwords in a
browser use a password manager people
because people like nucleus figure out
what your passwords are now we couldn't
do this show without you so we would
like to thank you with something special
you can use the coupon code snubz with
any order for your very own signed
hacked tip stickers and thank you so
much to everyone that has been using
that code thanks for supporting the show
we appreciate it
we're back so we know how to do a
regular scan and a couple of different
discovery options but there are so so
many more I mean seriously I wish I
could go through each and every one and
show you examples but pretty much they
all look the same they're just using
different protocols to send out those
requests so say you want to scan an item
that is blocked by the regular ICMP ping
that nmap uses before it does a whole
scan you can also use something called
TCP syn ping instead so this will make
nmap send out a syn packet instead of an
ICMP packet it would look something like
this so I type in n map and then tak
capital P capital S again capitals 10
dot 73 31 and we'll use my dot 1 for 5
example again and of course it looks
exactly the same when it comes out but
in this case if ICMP was being blocked
this would get around it just fine
it usually sends out the packet via port
80 but you can change this by adding a
port to your command so in this case if
I wanted to add a port I'll just bring
it back up I would put tak PS and then
start listing out the port's that I
wanted to use so I'll use port 80 I
could use 443 I could use pretty much
anything that I wanted and it would
still go through just fine now another
option is if ICMP is still being blocked
you could use TCP ACK packets which is
similar to the last command and is used
for pretty much the same reason so in
this case you would type n map
tak capital P capital A and then your
targets so it's just the option that
keeps changing this one can also be used
on other ports by adding the port
numbers directly after the tak PA
command as well so you see a pattern
here
if one request doesn't return some kind
of data from the target you can always
substitute it with another discovery
option with these above we also have the
tak PU option for UDP scans tak py for
SCTP in it scans which is stream control
transmission protocol
there's tak PE which is used for ICMP
and pretty much is implied if no other
option is given so that's what you're
usually using is tak PE Tech PP is an
ICMP timestamp ping which is useful for
getting around firewalled targets
Tech PM's ICMP address mask ping which
will occasionally be able to get through
firewall as well and each of these
additional options uses popular internet
protocols to make sure that your nmap
network scans end up being exactly what
you expected so even if ICMP doesn't
work for you you can still get around
that and get through those firewalls now
I had a lot of fun checking out all
these different discovery options but
I'm really interested in knowing what
kind of problems you have dealt with
with as far as getting around those kind
of issues and what you would like to see
me
study some more as far as discovery
options are available so let me know by
commenting below or you can email us
over at tips at hack 5 org if you really
like in nmap of course perhaps you'll
enjoy our new show it's called
Metasploit minute with mo bik's airing
every Monday at hak5 org I'm having a
lot of fun learning about Metasploit
with mu bik's it's very enjoyable over
there and of course you can check out
our sister show hak5 heck v for more
great stuff just like this and of course
I'll be there reminding you to trust
your Tecna list see you next week Matt
