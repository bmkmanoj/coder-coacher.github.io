vulnerabilities a safe running Windows
XP is unsafe and Zoma got drones all
that now on threat wire hello world i'm
darren kitchen and this is threat wire
for Wednesday July 29th 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and a huge
thanks to everybody is watching the show
and contributing this morning and it's
been just crazy lately so let's get
straight into it because quote the worst
Android vulnerability in the history of
the mobile OS that's the quote that's
going around in regards to an Android
vulnerability to be disclosed at the
blackhat security conference next week
the exploit attacks a weakness and
androids
stagefright the media playback engine
that's aptly named that debuted in
Android 2.2 and it can be embedded in an
MMS message of course sent by text
message and is Imperium the company that
discovered the bug they reported to
Google back in April in May and given
that there are 950 million potentially
vulnerable phones on the market we're
hoping that there can be a fix pushed
without too much resistance from the
carriers a workaround of course would be
to disable automatic downloading above
MMS messages in your text message client
and in response to a query on the matter
in regards to text secure the epic you
should be running it right now the
author Moxie Marlinspike responded by
saying quote we don't do any
pre-processing that involves stage
fright there are no technical details at
all about this vulnerability for maximum
hype but you'd have to physically tap on
the media and then click through a
warning about playing the media and
securely before stagefright got involved
good to see well we'll see if this
vulnerability actually warrants the
media attention when it's released a
blackhat also it has now been zero days
since the last branded vulnerability in
more upcoming blackhat Def Con hacking
news security firm Bishop Fox released a
cute video promoting their upcoming talk
on hacking into a Brinks Compu safe the
smart safe processes deposits and there
are some 14,000 that have been deployed
throughout the United States it's
estimated nearly a quarter million
dollars can be in each at any given time
and the process to hack them involves a
USB Drive and 100 lines of codes
actually looking deeper into this story
it seems that is in fact our very own
USB rubber ducky and play here actually
a Google cached version of their press
release had read quote who will also
release USB rubber ducky script to
automate the whole attack acting as a
skeleton key to open any brink safe plug
and plunder
sounds awesome the paragraph was also
removed though so we'll see if they
actually do in fact release the code as
it turns out the Brinks Compu safe is
running an embedded version of Windows
XP and it features an exposed USB port
what they expect though my god drones
they're coming to kill us and we're
prepared to shoot them down and we will
fight them to the death in Vegas I
wanted to point out these fun quadcopter
stories first off a hack add a headline
sums it up quote no mounting a gun to a
quadcopter probably isn't illegal of
course the author of the 14 second video
showing a quadcopter shooting a pistol
it was recently arrested on completely
unrelated charges in response to the
quote growing quadcopter threat The Wall
Street Journal has an interesting
article titled next step for drones
defending against them and it showed off
a company's epic anti-drone defense
system which uses radar and RF jamming
equipment to take out model aircraft oh
man and finally the coming Def Con 23
hacking conference will debut the first
ever drone wars an official Def Con
event involving nano class quad copters
under 50 Grounds grams in a cage match
with of course the standard rules two
drones enter one drone leaves I'll be
participating in the drone Fight Club on
Friday night I can't wait to see you
guys in Vegas also before I go a huge
