by go to assist you guys know that I am
all about sharing sinking and security
all at the same time and today I have a
brand new product for you and to help me
explain this I have Andrew runs from
code 42 now you guys are in charge of
crashplan but you also are in charge of
this brand new thing called share plan
right right awesome so what does share
plan do exactly chair plan is a
real-time collaboration and sync for
enterprise first so enterprises can
actually enable device Inc amongst their
employees and then multi-user sink
within projects and things like that and
then crash plan is specifically for
backing up your data exactly yeah
crashplan is the one way protect story
and share plan is the I want my data
across all my different devices and also
I want to collaborate on it oh that's
perfect now I know that there are a
bunch of competitors out there and but
well personally I do use a couple of
them sorry but tell me why why is this
different and how does it compare is it
better sure yeah you know the first you
know kind of major difference between
share plan and some of the competitors
out there that we have in this market is
that architectural a share plan was
built so I t can kind of build out their
own private clouds yeah and use that
instead of pushing all the data out to a
public cloud all right so it's all the
same stuff we've done for crashplan
hybrid private or we have an option
where you can actually use public cloud
that actually hold all of your own
encryption keys inside of an enterprise
so they can trust their data to us but
not I can be comforted by the fact that
they know that they are the only people
that have the keys to the data that's
really cool yeah I know encryption and
security are so so important to
everybody especially now nowadays when
we've had all this crazy stuff come out
about the NSA and whatnot so does this
support I believe crush plan uses
Blowfish is that correct yep does share
plan also use that share plan is our
next it's actually a fourth-generation
engine
and as a next-generation engine we've
actually transitioned to start using AES
encryption across the board that was
actually a big request from our
enterprise customers and we wanted to
actually kind of deliver that and build
it at the same time it will actually
come back and benefit crashplan in the
very near future as well so why did why
the change other than just people
requesting it um in the enterprise world
you know kind of vetted and trusted
standards are more important than one
algorithm or the other yeah and kind of
the groundswell was towards AES and so
we heard that message loud and clear and
built sure plan to support that is this
some 80's 256 it is okay perfect yeah
you can get geeky without sure yet it's
aes what's really cool about share plan
and crash plan is we encrypt all data at
the moment it's read off of all those
endpoint disks and it stays encrypted
it's never even decrypted when we stored
in the cloud or private cloud or
wherever else oh that's good yeah and
the people that have access to those
keys are your IT guys right okay so so
another question I have is I mean other
than you know your enterprise people
would I be able to use this for my
company's you would absolutely so you
can actually download The Share Plan
server and run it on anything if you
have a desktop machine that you want to
dedicate to it or you want to use our
managed private cloud appliances if
you're a bigger enterprise we have
different options for that and so you
can build your own private clouds or use
ours or whatever you need that's perfect
yeah that's super useful I have a whole
bunch of different shows that i do and i
want to be able to use use this and feel
secure that i'm using it at the same
time yeah i mean that's so important and
one of the really cool benefits of being
built for IVA clouds as well as public
clouds is we put some of our kind of
well vetted and trusted kind of
technology from crashplan back into
share plane so for example we're be
duplicating all the files that you're
sinking and collaborating across your
devices and then amongst other users as
well really so that means in a group
plan if you change a file only the bite
differences in that change
we'll actually get synced to all of your
users so it's lightning fast that way oh
that's cool yeah exactly now is this I
believe I read somewhere it was
somewhere that it like creates a peer
network yeah what we did is we built
what we call a topology where mesh
network what does that mean that
basically means that LAN if you can when
if you have to oh that's so funny
exactly so we treat all the different
share plan peers as a kind of a peer
network and we will move the bits in the
most efficient fastest way which means
that in practice everything doesn't have
to go for the sharepoint server and then
back down to all 20 participants or
whatever it could move directly to one
of them and then on that Wi-Fi lan or
whatever else bread really quickly
between them oh wow yeah that really
really speed something exactly and that
was one of the big kind of negatives
that we were hearing from customers of
our competitors it was just the time
that it took upload big files and
everything else it's true yeah and so
what we wanted to do is you know let's
use the networks that you already have
in place to speed up all that transfer
data huh now how much does this cost
because I know a lot of people are gonna
be interested in yeah the MSRP for sure
plan is ten dollars a month okay is that
for her user license it is it's per user
oh it's for users yes yes yeah that was
one of the other grace that we heard it
made a lot more sense to just license it
by the number of users that we're in an
enterprise or needed to collaborate and
not worry about the number of devices or
how much data they had or knew that kiss
yeah exactly now I know that you have
versions available for Windows Mac iOS
and Android crack do okay so I want to
go ahead and get into a bit of a demo of
this and show people what it's all about
absolutely well the first one is let's
just look at my finder so I have small
icons here where you know installed very
similar to other sink and collaboration
tools where we're putting icon overlays
to indicate sink status and things like
that but I have a share plan folder I
can add anything in here just like we're
used to with those other tools the
difference with us is we're building
this on top of all the knowledge we
already have four crashplan but you can
actually right click on any other folder
on your machine and have that be managed
by share plan cool it's fully integrated
it is I can take this folder and I can
put it somewhere else I don't have to
leave it in my share plan nice and I can
put it my projects or wherever it needs
to be I was so useful that's the first
thing that we did I can add any files in
here if I want to actually create a plan
or anything else you know you can right
click on it and say let's make this a
plan and I've actually already done that
so if we open up this guy here is a plan
that I am participating in with a few
other users ok I can add other users to
it I can leave this plan if I want to I
can even customize what bits of data are
being synced very cool so sometimes so
this is just the user interface right
now exactly ok yeah and we have a
timeline view to see who has contributed
one at different times yeah we have a
technology called selective sink and for
any of the plans that I'm participating
in I can elect to just have the events
inc to me or even just still be part of
a plan but not think you need the new
events or files as part of that as well
ok so like for this big launch if I
apply here share plan has remote data
kill capability who's the best way I can
explain it so if I t or myself or
whoever else no longer needs to
participate and see those files they
actually can disappear off that endpoint
oh really that's one of the things that
we built to enable bring your own device
yeah because a lot of work forces now
they let you bring in your iphone yes
that's what I do for my company's
exactly or your Android tablet or you
know maybe they give you a windows
computer and you'd like to use a mac or
vice versa or whatever else you can do
that and then you can participate and
collaborate in all these different plans
and then when you need to leave those
plans or IT said you know we're done
with this project whatever else they can
pull the strings remotely and then
actually just remotely kill just the
manage portion of your data and not the
rest of your machine and also projects
come and go yeah there's a lot of
different reasons to do that so that's
it you know it's a really simple
interface we wanted to build it so it
was very easy to under
stand and from an end-user simple is
always going to be best yes and then you
know you can add more things on top of
it if you need to and so this is our new
admin console we've changed the branding
a little bit so if you use CrashPlan
ProE you before this will look very
similar it sort of different at the same
time yeah it does and what we did is
just added a plans category and I can
actually see all these different plans
so these are all the different people
that are in the company and yeah we
planned exactly so there's personal
plans for a bunch of different folks um
you know you could probably actually
find me and as acts as an IT employee
you would have all access to all of
these yes okay cool yeah so here's my
personal plan I can see the number of
devices that are actually attached to it
so here's my iphone there's my macbook
air and from the IT side they can
actually you know remove access to these
different things and here's the big
launch plan and from the IT site I can
see that these are the users that are
participating in this here are all the
devices that are participating and from
the admin console they can actually edit
the participants directly so I can
actually hang it as an administrator
remove Andrew from this plan and what
you'll see instantly happen is you get a
notification on your exact you get a
notification on your phone and also on
my computer directly so if we switch
back to share plan we're already seeing
that that plan is no longer on my
machine cool and it's the data that was
actually part of that has also
disappeared from my computer wow that
was almost a median it is a sect yeah I
like it do I have like a separate key
for each of these yes you do ah good
yeah so every plan is a separate
encryption key well which basically
means it's a separate archive on the
back end yeah and people can come and go
and do all that kind of stuff that's
awesome so we have this for windows and
mac grants mac com the android version
of Cher plan is really awesome because
it actually treats it you know kind of
as a file system nice so all the files
that are shared in sync and stuff on
there you can edit and it automatically
updates and does all that as well and
then of course we have i oh
and all the versions of share plant
Windows Mac Android and iOS all look
identical and that was something that
yet also worked really hard but needed
to do so end-users understood
immediately when they were using these
different devices what share plan was
going to do for them there's another
company out there who does sharing not
at this level but I downloaded their
application on my iOS phone and the only
thing you can do is view the files
that's it yeah it drove me nuts i hated
the pink so much I was like what I can't
sync from here this drive me crazy yeah
so you have this downloaded on your
iPhone 5 correct exactly okay show me
what this looks like on your iPhone 5 as
well and share plan has all of the stuff
that I do in my desktop on my mobile
device so you can add new data to it you
can add participants if you need to
eight and you can see all those files
natively on here Wow yeah it does look
exactly like the other one yeah that's
perfect exactly and that's what we have
intentionally built to make it really
easy to understand for end users when
they swap across all these different
devices yeah that's gone enterprises
aren't just one type of computer anymore
right nothing they really are ya there's
not a share plan available for Linux at
the moment yes the thick app is not we
didn't write one or Linux yet yes um we
really wanted to focus on the fork or
platforms first yeah and see what kind
of traction needed to happen there that
you're talking about enterprise though
the main ones that they use our mac and
windows yes and you know when you write
native apps for linux you have different
libraries that ya need to support and
it's just more difficult but we do have
though is a full-featured html5 web app
or share plan right everything will
access about everything that you can do
in any of these thick apps you can
actually do over the web and it actually
looks identical wow that's so awesome I
can't wait to like show my entire
company this and be like we need this
right into hell for a company please
this would be so useful right now I mean
especially since I have all these
different shows that I do would be
really
to create all these different products
now for anybody who really wants to
check this out where can they go to find
more information they can go to our
website code 42.com / share plan and
there's lots of videos and all the
different information they would want to
see for sure plan and this was just
released october first it was yeah it's
brand new awesome well thank you so much
Andrew it was a pleasure having you here
thank you so much for telling me all
about share plan and for you guys if you
want to check out more definitely check
out his website and check out the show
notes below we'll be right back I know
how it is working in i.t it means
constantly jumping from one problem to
the next and everything of course needs
to be solved past I remain account to me
you can't waste your time juggling
different tools and duplicating data
entry that's why I use go to assist less
copy and paste it's from Citrix though
the leader in remote sport and get this
you'll have all the tools you need in
one nice little integrated cloud-based
platform so you can work faster and more

it's time for the techno less photo of
the week in this week's photo is from
Ray who drives a semi for a living he
set up a 19 inch TV pushed to TV box a
laptop and a couple more monitors for
whole big dual set up of course it's
running back track he said he loves the
show and he loves our episodes on ssh
tunneling and it is proven useful to him
to access his own ubuntu 12.04 server at
his house while away that's awesome it's
so good to see so many different peoples
from you know all types of walks of them
on the earth doing all sorts of
different things with our show so it's
great to see that thank you so much for
sending that in you can send your photos
over to feedback at hak5 org with the
subject line tech the last weird every
con 2013 i'm darren kitchen here with
aaron from art of exploitation and how
are you mad doing good I'm really stoked
about this this is a crazy looking pi
device what's going on with this toy you
put together so this is a kind of a pet
project of ours this is a Raspberry Pi
that say it's actually a Raspberry Pi
that we use for some of our courses we
teach our arm assembly courses and have
these sitting around and wanted to build
a forensics device so how we have a lot
of USB devices that we need 20 eyes and
image and there's a lot of expensive
hardware to do that but we wanted to
have something that was a lot cheaper a
lot more flexible you're saying that the
hardware that's available commercially
right now to just plug into a drive and
zero it out as expensive it's
ridiculously expensive than a Raspberry
Pi $35 Raspberry Pi $25 first screen you
got yourself you know what a forensics
box will do for 800 bucks no way oh I
love this I love this is this open
source it is it is we're working on
getting the source code posted we're
actually giving these away at Derby con
2013 here so we're gonna send a bunch of
folks home with these and now I I'm
really hoping they'd spy thon is what
it's based off of I want them to dig
into the source code and have fun with
it sure but for folks who aren't so
lucky to win one they're going to get
the ability to get the source code so
you say it's based on Python what's the
underlying base here is just using the
Raspberry Pi OS or what
using raspbian it's a debian based
version of made to work on the Raspberry
Pi and then it's a custom python script
that we've written that uses a lot of
open source utilities things like DD
parted to just scan the disks and zero
eyes an image so does the only zero wise
or does it can you do random data or
however so right now it's just utilizing
Worth where I have a long to-do list of
things and honestly we're getting a lot
of good feedback from the Derby con
attendees for what they'd like to see it
do as well so before the weekend's done
we'll have some more features in there
too but it also does cloning and then
we're going to have it be able to you
know format with certain file systems
maybe do multiple passes just kind of
depending on the feedback we get sure
sure make it like DoD spec or or what's
the even better when the RCMP the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police have a better
hard drive wiping spec than the DoD I
love it yeah exactly there's a 35 past
Gutman like yeah well whatever folks
want to do we can do it sweet and so
you're saying it can actually clone
because obviously you have two USB ports
here what kind of speeds do you get off
that so it's it's limited by the
Raspberry Pi it's only USB 2 but
honestly the the main feed you know the
main use I see for this is a lot of
folks at cons get the little free USB
drives and you're like I don't really
want to go home and plug that in these
things aren't the fastest things in the
world to begin with so truth is is not
that big of a limiting factor but when
you get into the really high performance
drives unfortunate get a little bit a
little bit limited by the Raspberry Pi
no wonder what's gonna happen when you
plug USB rubber ducky and they're
thinking its mass storage I really want
to see that actually I we were talking
about that probably just start typing
into your terminal or whatever because
because you can just plug this because
right now what you've done is put a
really beautiful you know this is one of
these Adafruit modules here to give you
a nice screen and we can go through your
menus here but this is still a Raspberry
Pi if i plug this into a TV and a mouse
and a keyboard right so the one thing I
have going for me is that the way this
is built the way we're giving away right
now is it doesn't drop you to a terminal
on the device itself so you have to ssh
in they do the menus you can get the IP
address enable ssh it'll tell you the
creds it randomly generates a password
so if you plug a rubber ducky into this
right now i don't think it's going to to
work i mean i'd welcome to Tallinder but
i think that i think it might it might
stand the test yes this is really cool
so what's what's your dreamed for this
to go you know the next version so
honestly we've got a long list of
features we'd like to have see at it
onto this formatting drives maybe
ideally what I'd like to see is with a
larger SD card have the ability to
automatically make bootable drives so
let's say you want you know kali linux
on a USB Drive you just plug it in this
wipes it expands the iso on there makes
it bootable and now you've got all your
iso is ready to go at generic USB
toolkit i love it hey Aaron this has
been a pleasure where can people find
the code find more about what you guys
do with the Arctic of exploitation so
we've got our website art of
exploitation calm we'll have some stuff
up there on our blog probably the best
place to watch and we'll get the source
code up there we're working through the
bureaucracy but we're gonna make it
happen nice really appreciate it thank
you well that just about wraps up this
episode of act 5 before we get going we
wanted to again remind you guys that you
were all welcome everyone is welcome to
come out to this party all ages it's
going to be a good time and point
richmond in the San Francisco Bay Area
park place yeah seven o'clock on october
health free beer for those 21 and over
get yourself some pineapple schwag find
out about the new pineapple right that
way moon into the live stream if you're
not able to make it out in person oh yes
we're gonna have the youtube live stream
it's going to be wicked i am on cloud
nine i can't wait start talking about
what we've been working on and doing a
whole bunch of new segments on this
stuff because it kind of ties in with a
lot of things that we've been building
on ya li it does saw so yes that's my
jam ok that is that's how it you know
and of course as always you know email
us feedback at HEC five dot org you can
also support us directly hockshop calm
and hak5 donnell work / follow to find
everything that we are doing including
information and details about the party
that's it and of course you know just
emails feedback attacked by daughter
let us know what's in your heart and we
will see you guys next week until then
I'm Darren fine Shannon trust your
techno lust
it's right here is a prime example of
why you shouldn't come to Der Beek on
you may get iced and it's going to rock
this is a warm ice agent called Isis you
called Smirnoff warm
alright work we're rolling ready all
right Wow look at that that's how you do
it right there I look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
