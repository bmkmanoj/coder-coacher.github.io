an inside job
ATMs hack through EMV chips update your
iPhone now and voter records are stolen
in a state hack all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for August
30th 2016 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom make sure to subscribe to our
YouTube channel to get these shows
before anyone else and check out our
patreon to see how you can help the show
grow patreon.com slash threat wire is
the place for that onto the news with
our leading story from the NSA of course
the NSA is always a leading story we've
got a few updates this week regarding
the purported NSA hack first being the
possibility of get this an inside job
yes according to an article at cnet.com
several well-informed people close to
the matter suggested this could have
been the case a professor at the
illinois institute of chicago who
specializes in text analysis and
attribution suggested that the broken
english used in the shadow brokers
auction was actually intentional and
that the seller is actually a native
english speaker an NSA employee
considered the naming conventions of the
data stolen and suggested that it was a
one-man operation from an internal
system and while snowden did release
several files from the NSA this breach
dates to a few months after he left and
it includes data that he did not have in
some that he did so who done it well
only time will tell but we'll definitely
follow up with more information as it
comes out along with this update is more
information regarding the zero day
vulnerability to cisco systems that was
released with the NSA files it turns out
it's much worse than previously thought
many more product models are susceptible
to the hack a silent signal a
penetration testing firm in budapest
hungary found the exploit also works on
newer models of Cisco's adaptive
security appliance aka a si by simply
changing a small bit of code in the
malware so cisco has released an update
that will trigger a warning if it
notices the flaw which is called extra
bacon i mean who doesn't love extra
bacon apparently it's called extra bacon
extra bacon but
patch fixing the problem has not yet
been released as of the day of recording
users on older cisco esa software have
been advised to upgrade to nine point
one point seven or higher Thailand has
been hit with a slew of ATM hacks from
July night through August 23rd at the
government Savings Bank aka GSB for
short to total about 12 million baht
which equates to about three hundred and
fifty thousand USD researchers at
security firm fire I discovered the
malware being used against ATMs in this
hack and named it Ripper after part of
the naming convention used in the
malware 40 bank notes can be withdrawn
during any given transaction which did
limit the total stolen for this hack to
work an attacker would install malware
onto the EMV chip on a credit card on
the front of the card and has slipped
the card into the ATM the EMV chip would
then reap be read by the ATM for
authentication and the malware would
upload to the ATM Ripper would disable
the ATMs network interface so that it
can't talk to its bank or phone home it
then replaces legit files with itself
and adds itself to a Windows registry
key to maintain persistence so it keeps
on going for a very long time the
attacker can then withdraw money from
the ATM and move on while Ripper hides
in the background it's time for you to
update your iPhone's if you haven't done
that in a while three zero day flaws
have been found in the wild allowing an
attacker to steal encrypted chat
messages and a lot more it's named
Pegasus by security firm lookout and
researchers believe these
vulnerabilities have been used to spy on
a political dissident in the UAE pegasus
can copy history text messages calendar
information contacts and it can activate
the camera and the microphone as well as
track movements of the phone and steal
those encrypted messages users are sent
SMS messages with links that lead to the
malware and once it's installed Pegasus
pretty much just takes over and
jailbreaks the phone pegasus works
because of three different bugs on the
iOS platform altogether all of which
have now been patched by apple in their
newest update a full report on the flaws
can be found in the links in the show
notes below in an FBI flash briefing
posted earlier this month the FBI
announced that
had found proof of hacks taking place at
state election databases specifically
for Illinois in Arizona so in Illinois
up to 200 and thousand voter records
were stolen and in Arizona no data was
stolen but malware was indeed found the
hack was tracked through several
different virtual private servers owned
by hosting companies in the US the UK
Scotland and the Netherlands and it
lacked major sophistication so the
attacker most likely found the
vulnerabilities was some kind of simple
commercially available scanning tools
because of the hacks the FBI's Flash
briefing issued a warning to state
sector industries to amp up their
security and be on the lookout for
potential suspicious activity on their
servers and hopefully they take that
