fear-mongering on Russian hackers all
that more this time on threat wire hello
and welcome to threat wire this is your
summary of what's threatening security
privacy and Internet freedom I'm your
host Darren kitchen and I'm trying
something a little bit new today as I
kind of evolved this beta reboot of
threat wire here and what I'm doing is
I'm actually recording live to tape and
so what that means is that i'm actually
editing as i go the benefit of that is
that I'll potentially be able to do
these much faster but you know it
forgive ative it's a little rough around
the edges and of course value your
feedback so let me know what you think
this and we're gonna go ahead and begin
today with bitcoins we get a story here
from TechCrunch reporting that Russia
bands bitcoins if you're in Russia using
Bitcoin if you're an individual or a
business you are now a criminal the
central bank of russia emphasized that
the official currency is in fact ruble
confused with the group from The Legend
of Zelda Russian Russia considers
bitcoins a money substitute so now it's
banned and if you're you know if you
criminalize bitcoins well then only
criminals will have bitcoins and if
you're a Russian Bitcoin based company
you're going to need to look elsewhere
interesting thing about this story is
that this is a prime example of what
happens when something supremely
unregulated and decentralized and
distributed so I'm familiar like the
internet say in the case of Arab Spring
it is when it's no longer aligning with
the government objectives well then it's
banned or turned off or censored or any
way Russia is not the only one there
actually recognizing Bitcoin they are
joining the likes of China who in
December denounced the validity of
bitcoins with a notice on the
precautions against the risk of bitcoins
but here in the United States in fact
we're actually farther ahead in the game
back in August of 2013
bitcoins were recognized as a currency
by the district court a Texas judge said
that bitcoins should be regulated just
like the dollar in fact just yesterday
report came out of library of congress
outlining how countries around the world
view bitcoins in particular brazil a
massively emerging market in october
embraced bitcoins enacting a law
allowing the country to regulate them as
well as other crypto currencies and
we've seen the likes of canada and
germany finland singapore all of these
guys recognize that in fact i believe
even track points on bloomberg so that's
kind of awesome so this is a lose for
russia but i guess in the overarching
thing you know the overarching thing
here is a Bitcoin overall i believe is
winning and that's a good you know it is
not winning is fear mongering on news
this is the latest example of you know
what you would come to expect from your
NBC's of the world so real quickly going
to play a little fair use clip here of
the story the opening ceremony is this
coming Friday night the games actually
begin on thursday two days from now with
three early events in primetime as
tourists and families of athletes arrive
in sochi if they haven't been warned and
if they fire up their phones at baggage
claim it's probably too late to save the
integrity of their electronics and
everything inside them it's probably too
late to save the integrity of your
electronics Thank You NBC this is
actually a report with a Richard Engel
who began with a quote from the United
States State Department that warns
travelers that they quote should have no
expectation of privacy even in their
hotel rooms is of course being travelers
to the Winter Olympics Games in Sochi
and I love this because it's you know
from our own government saying like
don't expect privacy you know unlike we
have here in America this talk though
with with Richard Engel is with a Kyle
will hoy a security researcher at trend
micro and he's been getting a lot of
flack
on Twitter for this because well i would
say namely for the editing you know they
do a demo where they take out a brand
new mac and a pc and an android and they
actually go ahead and you know proceed
to hacks or the box ins as you as if you
will and you know in the demo it's all
basically done on machines running you
know out of the box with no updates
installed they did actually install a
couple of lifestyle applications like
you know adobe reader or microsoft word
but otherwise this is pretty much
getting debunked around the internet
because of well a couple of things first
of all we got a great report here from a
redis security am wrote a nice blog
piece outlining kind of some of the you
know glaring holes with as first and
foremost they weren't actually in shoji
which isn't really a big deal because
that actually second point is that this
could have happened anywhere third of
all the phone actually didn't get hacked
they willfully downloaded mail malware
and fourth of all in fact in order to
install them now where they had to
enable 3rd party applications to be run
on android if you're familiar with
installing side-loaded apks now will
play is like i said in getting a lot of
flack here of course NBC you know coming
under you know criticism from Business
Insider as well as the Washington Post
now Oh Wilhite actually respond Twitter
with a blog post here with a link lum in
micro blog where he kind of outlined and
actually goes into a you know a whole
wipe gear on how to you know it was all
about this this really reminds me of
kind of the the pitfalls of mainstream
media because if they actually use this
opportunity this hell I don't even know
how long this news clip was let's see it
was three and a half minutes so they
could have used that three and a half
minutes to actually educate the public
but instead no it doesn't get the kind
of headlines like those Russian hackers
are after yo jada and as such you know
this is what we see and I feel like the
only person being exploited here in fact
is actually Kyle I have the
most respect for a security researcher
and I feel really sorry for him because
I know how it can be when I mean I'm
with these miniature media folks and you
never know how we're going to take your
word and use them against you and edit
it to become some crap piece like this
and I don't think that it should be any
news whatsoever that in an economic
disparate place such as Russia it would
actually foster cyber crime because we
would do the same thing in Nigeria and
China anyway so I feel like people
should actually go and check out the
white paper and check out the blogs over
at trend micro I mean of course trend
micro has kind of like know their mode
of maybe I mean one of the points that
they said is to you know by antivirus
software so you know okay take that for
what it is but the actual art of this
hack in the security researcher actually
went through the trouble of creating a
nice honey pot and making it a pretty
rich one by even creating a fake Richard
Engel account and making it look as if
it were him that in even you know
getting spear phishing attacks i mean
sure okay so you know NBC kind of like
really lost out here really you know
drop the ball and with the
fear-mongering stick rather than a
constructive carrot but yeah regardless
I feel like you should check out the
paper or I mean basically says you know
update your software don't rely on
default security settings I love this
trust your instincts and of course go
straight to the source when it comes to
your security software interesting story
thus who our comment which this week I'm
Patrick a who writes BTW censorship is
also affecting the USA linking to this
story about how media blackouts on the
new snowden interview and why the
government doesn't want you to see I
don't know whether or not this is
something that essentially the
government want you to see or if it's
just the mainstream media kind of just
you know brushing this under the rug
maybe we've heard enough about it or at
least that's what the you know the
producer is over at your you know
mainstream news may think but otherwise
the interview is totally worth watching
so I'll have links in
show notes check that out it's a
30-minute interview that just happened
last week with Edward Snowden it's
fantastic piece it was done by ard in
Germany and no it isn't getting any
attention here in the states you can
speculate to your heart's content anyway
with all of that uh in in this show I
would really like to hear your feedback
on what you like about this what you
don't like what you would like to see me
cover what you kind of you know how you
figure you could improve this and you
know there's an interest in live
streaming or hangouts or whatever else
I'm really just having fun with this I'm
passionate about this stuff and I want
to bring it to you and I'm trying to
kind of work it all out so we're being
beta will be in beta until you know for
as long as gmail is but until then once
again I'm Darren kitchen and i will see
you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
