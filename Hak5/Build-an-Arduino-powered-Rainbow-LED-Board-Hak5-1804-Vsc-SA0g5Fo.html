by domain.com hello everyone out there
and welcome to your weekly dose of
techno last my name is Shannon Morse and
this is Greg Greg is going to be my
co-host today because I've been having
some trouble finding there he is Darrin
hey welcome back
lonely I thought it was a little lonely
you know he was a good co-host but
people just had some trouble hearing his
audio that's so they need to tune into
the carrier frequency yeah I thought it
would be good it's good to see you
likewise so good to be back how was
Europe fantastic I got you know it was
really fun in that I had the opportunity
to revisit some of the hacker spaces
that I saw last time you see how things
have changed over the last couple of
years which was really insightful
because the last time I was there it was
on a diplomatic mission for Alderaan in
the ITU doing awesome stuff with
telecommunications and since then I
don't know Snowden's happened so lots of
fun things huh yeah a curse based fear
especially in Europe I guess it has been
that long uh two years two years yeah
and we live in a different world now
thanks to that awesome whistleblower so
it's very cool I've been my pop tart cat
I love your Arduino powered I'll talk
about that in a sec but first you have a
bunch of stuff going on with you well
you know that it's not just me like I
you know in touring hacker space is one
of the things that I love to see was
like although the projects that I'd like
yeah I've seen that on hackaday and
stuff like that so I wanted to bring it
up because it turns out that this week
is very apt that the new hackaday prize
is going to be announced that is the you
know the prizes to either win a trip
into space or $196,000 the winner from
the 2014 prize was so cool it's called
sat Nog's it's an open source ground
station to be able to speak to
satellites the dream is that one day at
least this is my dream that one day we
can free ourselves from the dependence
on the infrastructure that is owned by
the corporations and the governments
that get to decide how our packets are
going to be abused
and actually have our own even if it is
just you know really low baud rate
store-and-forward stuff but it's that's
amazing yeah so so brilliant stuff is
coming out of that yeah I love that
they're putting some money towards it
and I'm excited about this year's
contest which is about building
something that matters it's talking
about building stuff for pollution for
food for energy I know that we are
tinkering around with nothing I don't
think it's gonna be something like to
submit but you know I want to go to
space man I'm gonna submit it and it
will probably fail but whatever okay
well uh hackaday dot io / prize I just
thought I would plug that because you
know they're doing really awesome stuff
and you know what
speaking awesome stuff you may be
ridiculously awesome shift register
shift read yes I saw in the doc we use
just like Google Docs on the backend to
collaborate on this kind of second and
when I see like shannon's project for
the week I got really excited because we
could not just that Arduino ders and
electronics are fun but like shift
registers made a huge impact on this old
supercomputer called Colossus which
nowadays this is why you should never
name your supercomputers epic stuff
because then in retrospect it's gonna be
like Oh
Colossus I've got like an app that
emulates that on my watch
cute but let's Lee park you guys are
probably familiar with Alan Turing yes
uh-huh recently party he's my bro yeah
and actually epic story will link this
units to some further reading on this
and the government code and cypher
school which later became GCHQ that
machine was the Colossus mark ii was
like improved like orders of magnitude
over the mark one because of shift
registers so it's cool to see them being
used now instead of breaking World War 2
era you know access codes but to
actually be used to make your pop tart
cat have rainbows coming out of its but
they're backwards but hey whatever
that's okay I should probably mention to
the GCHQ ones there that I really like
you guys so I asked I also saw you in a
daily tech news show by a friend Tom yes
talking about your favorite is awesome
things that you saw over in Europe well
I did mention that um it was fun having
the opportunity to revisit also new ones
like in Berlin but then I got to see
some of the ones that had been be for in
Amsterdam in London and it's just cool
to see kind of like how things have
changed and some of the trends and stuff
and one of them that I was really
surprised about is the drones I know we
could have called a drone across Europe
later I got done running into right I
went on there on holiday as it were to
you know enjoy my birthday and fly
around Berlin I was not expecting to
then do fpv racing in that was cool for
the first time ever in Amsterdam or then
also to run into London aerospace and
learn all sorts of cool stuff about nano
Hanabi and stuff so that was kind of a
trend I think there's a really big
cross-section to as like for instance
just yesterday I was at the FPV meetup
in Berkeley and most of those guys are
sis admin's right so it's like you know
hackers tinkerers makers sis and men's
you know net jockeys whatever you call
it like nerds and quadcopters or
multirotors or UAVs or UAS or whatever
you want to call up drones there's a
huge crossover there and one of the
things that I'm really loving about it
not just that it feeds my 11 year old
desire to be a fighter pilot but it's
also like it reminds me of building
computers in the 90s unlike today where
you get a what is it 11 millimeter
gold-plated MacBook with no board anyway
I mean whatever so yeah sure drones were
huge also nanotech yeah really cool and
in fact I wish that I got in an
interview with these guys to learn more
about this but basically and this is
something I'd love to revisit because I
know that you're really interested in 3d
printers
yeah it's mmm it's this type of
lithography and I'm totally blanking now
on what the name is mano
something-something but essentially
remember burning CDs back yeah
burning DVDs the way that all the time
the technology the way that that works
is it uses this laser and then there's a
chemical reaction and that would make
these grooves or these pits and those
would be ones or zeros yeah and then
you've got all sorts of cool
techniques and stuff that go into that
as well but essentially some really
awesome hackers in than hog or The Hague
in Netherlands have put together this
ridiculous rig that is mind-blowing
where you put in this substrate right
and then using like microscope lens
assemblies and off-the-shelf projectors
using UV light you can create a chemical
reaction that's going to turn that
solvent into like a solid in certain
areas but not in others so then when you
clean it off you now have a part yeah 3d
printed right that's so weird
well here's the coolest part the machine
the like gears and mechanisms and the
little tiny things they were printing
yes at on the head of a pin what
yeah like nanotech like wow that's so
cool I know so that was like oh this is
just what you know you couple that with
those tiny space net I do have to space
met it's a you know how I have a fun and
interesting relationship with LDAP but
turns out when appropriately implemented
with radius and other cool
implementation techniques you can build
a Wi-Fi network that using you know
proper certificates and things of that
nature I do
intro to dot 11x you know you get good
stuff where by if I have an account at
say the hacker space in Amsterdam I can
now go to the hacker space in The Hague
or the hacker space in London and each
time I go there my certificate is valid
for their Wi-Fi networks because there's
a chain of trust because there's all
federated network which means like I'm
like logging in Darren at my home hacker
space yeah this is so cool it allows you
to room I know that a lot of
universities have like eduroam for this
sort of thing well this is that for
hacker spaces and it is proper
enterprise level security for Wi-Fi and
I would love to see something like this
setup for the shmoo cons the def cons
the derby cons because you know while
it's really fun to go to the network you
know the the network camp yeah over at
UConn and then wait for your WPA key to
be generated I mean you know
it takes a while would maybe be better
if we just had that and I just think
it's the coolest thing when you also
couple in what we were just talking
about the the Sat Nog's
yeah stuff right I mean there will be a
day in our lives where it is inexpensive
enough for a couple of hackerspaces and
maybe some crowdfunding to actually put
together not just a micro set that only
stay in orbit for a few days but like a
full-blown this is our network you can't
take it down until you shoot it down
u.s. or China that's awesome
I also stopped that with the missiles
it's bad it's create a space to breathe
we don't like that but you know a couple
of those technologies in and you've got
like federated access to our own
infrastructure and I think that really
dives with me yeah that's awesome yeah
the other stuff that I saw was just a
lot of Snowden posters everywhere for
asylum just everywhere and of course
Club Med Club Montag which we will keep
flowing I found a distributor in the
United States so soon the hak5 warehouse
will you don't even know yeah I don't
know it's like what is this like horse
urine and hay but you're going to get
used to the flavor and you're going to
love it okay I'm assuming this is a
drink yeah that looks like lemonade no
it's like yerba mate a you guys know so
while you've been gone I have been
actually working on installing the new
cable so once we move into the well it
actually what has taken me months
because I've been working on it myself
yeah with the cable company and I've
been digging all the ditches for that IV
you wish yeah you get in bitches in
heels what else so those are wedges yeah
whatever but I can't believe you know
that why do you know that you guys know
yeah I know I haven't really been
digging ditches but yeah sure I know
that there might be video of me digging
ditches what are you just gonna dig it
you did that
but when you do what I think that you
need to when we're done with this shoot
you better get out there and keep
digging we can't give this bandwidth
soon enough sorry I can't answer all
your emails we need we need ideas too
because we're about to have both lose
your bandwidth they're gonna back up the
bandwidth truck it's a big truck it is a
big traffic series of tubes member they
aren't actually digging that they're
literally like they've gotta cross an
intersection so they're like tunneling
through and Here I am thinking like who
think of all the cool stuff you're gonna
get like mining through there like you
might find some ore and I'm like Oh
Darren you've been playing too much
Minecraft but minecraft would be one of
the servers that we will run on the new
act 5 warehouse network that we hope
that you will become a part of because
we're gonna be shale accounts and
bouncers and jitsi stuff and jabber XMPP
and we need your ideas so in the
comments or in our feedback emails as
always because we love you guys about
all of the fun stuff that we will be
able to host here now that we're going
to have a bajillion bandwidth and lastly
I saw your video of you racing drones
not the one from Europe but the one in
Berkeley this is just the craziest thing
because I've been flying a TV for the
last year and a half and that that's
when you put on the goggles and it's
like a first-person view we did it
episode like six months ago about this
and it's my happy place and um I have
had the unique opportunity to finally
discover that this is happening my own
backyard like awesome way to go Bay Area
and I just it turns out every Sunday the
FPV explorers and racers got to give a
shout out to them if you're in the San
Francisco Bay Area and you are also a
quadcopter to run UAS UAV multi-rotor
enthusiast you should come out to this
because everybody collects together at
the park in Berkeley by the marina and
fly in fact I only discovered it because
I went out there to fly like a month and
a half ago and I'm like you know before
you turn on your video transmitter the
first thing you do is you turn on your
receiver and you check your channel to
make sure nobody else is transmitting on
it now of course what are the slim
chances of that especially in the weird
woods that I fly but I did because it's
the right thing to do and I was very
surprised to see that oh oh there's
somebody flying on this frequency and I
go to the next and on this one and I go
to the next and on this one we look up
and I hear the distinct sound of a
multi-rotor I run over there like hey
guys yeah so I competed for the first
real time I guess you could say just
yesterday
cool I was in four heats I took first
right 'some awesome Congrats and DNF and
the other two cuz I smashed into pylons
but I put a video on the channel it's so
much fun I'm excited to be competing
next Sunday so by the time you watch
this next Sunday in the game of drones
what yes truck yeah it's gonna be in
Oakland they've got braces they've got a
cage match whoa yeah two drones enter
one leaves oh yeah I'm assuming you're
doing that - no have you seen snowflake
or whatever her name is
it's 240 grams most other quad copters
in this 250 class are like 700 gram like
a third of the weight of most of these
guys and I can't believe it won anything
turns out if you're the last man
standing though all you have to do is
complete the course one epic thing you
know what we're running long I want to
talk about direct sequence spread
spectrum see I should definitely save it
for next week because I can't pronounce
direct sequence sequence spread red
spectrum
can we just say dsss sure that works for
me yeah it's a signal technique used in
Wi-Fi can I talk about my pop-tart cat
let's get into pop-tart cats and and
next week we'll talk about radio horizon
and diodes and hacking transmitters to
do fun things well at the same time
staying legal with the FCC but first
would it take a quick break
is that good yeah he agrees yeah a break
okay
it doesn't matter if you're a fan of
Greg the dinosaur or the nyan cat for
whichever reason you watch hak5
when you have great ideas you know what
you need to do I know you know you need
to get them online instantly you need to
take them from your brain into the
interwebs and there is no service that
can do it faster more efficiently or
more epically awesomeness Lee then
domain.com I've told you guys about two
main no Tom they have that to mean
discovery system where your ideas will
just poop onto the web in like no time
it's really fantastic service we've been
using them for the longest time they've
been supporting the show for the longest
time because they're huge fans of hack
five they've got you know they just make
it a fun place to do business because
they're affordable they're reliable
they're easy to use but mostly you can
tweet them at domain.com and see they're
crazy enough to support us which is just
crazy and of itself so you should
support them and they hooked you up they
have with the coupon code its hak5 it
spells hack five and you can use it
domain coms check out to get an extra
15% off so when you think domain names
think domain.com
the beaches of Normandy would never be
the same without the cool breaking power
of the Colossus and it's shift registers
but today shift registers can be used to
make rainbows come out of cats butts
right Shannon yes yes you are correct
sir
in everything it's very big slate so
this is been watching your segments well
abroad and it has been fun
I've been building on top of them I've
been building on top of them for every
single Arduino segment in this week or I
guess I started building this last week
I found this thing on Instructables and
it was written by OTB paintball it's
basically it called a rain board so he
takes an Arduino Uno powers it up with a
12 volt wall adapter and then he is able
to light up all these little strips so I
ran into some complications and stuff
and since all of this is already in
instruct Instructables I just I'm not
gonna go over the tutorial or the code
because it's there for you sure but I
wanted to talk about my experience with
it well I mean that's the whole thing is
we can learn from each other's
experiences and then hopefully not make
any mistakes or the next thing you know
you've got Pop Tart cats so first off
check your bread boards this apparently
I had a bort breadboard and I like I
posted a picture on Instagram and I was
like why are only half of my LEDs
lighting up and all these people I use
to power its parachute power and I was
like it can't be a power issue I bought
the correct power supply what the heck
is going on and then like some random
guy and he called himself a noob and I
was like you're not a noob but everybody
isn't you but something he goes maybe
it's the breadboard and I was like it
can't be the breadboard I just bought
this well I mean you know what it is
freakin breadboard you replace
everything until you've got nothing left
and then you're like oh so I replaced a
bunch of wires because I thought my
wiring was incorrect still had the same
issue so eventually I replaced the
breadboard and rewired everything which
took like an hour ok so it was the can
you break it down for me what exactly am
I looking at where these come so first
off you have all these LED strips it's
not actually a big square it's actually
a long strip of cable that looks like
that so those were broken into yes
oh sorry so these are the color of 5050
RGB LED strips you can get them on
Amazon for like 25 bucks a strip and one
from China yeah I need to find that
website yeah so apparently yeah 25 bucks
on Amazon it comes with plenty to do
this build and you can have plenty left
just in case you break them it's really
fragile I ended up breaking a bunch of
these because I was you have to solder
them on to little breakaway points at
the bottom yeah I get it
so the trick with these is you have to
cut them in three hedeman little threes
yeah and they have a little solder
points so you can see with the little
gold plates at the end wasn't it and
each one has these four points so you
have G for green R for red and then B
for blue and then there's the 12 volts
it's for the four little pins so you
want to cut each one wherever you see
the pins and then you have to solder on
these breakaway little headers and yeah
I was pretty easy so I was able to stick
him in my breadboard but I noticed if I
put them all in the same row it was
impossible stickmen because they
couldn't they couldn't fit next hmm so I
had to play some one pin in front of the
other which was kind of annoying or one
sure okay next to each other works so
that was a slight issue that I ran into
and I broke quite a few of these because
they're very fragile at the end if you
bend them too far they won't work yeah
this one doesn't work as we've all
noticed you can't also it is flexible
this you shouldn't do that yes these
dresses we have these all over back 5
warehouse for our rave nights I also had
to get the shift registers for this the
dips or dual in inline process I'll come
back to your talking with this chip
right here yeah oh I thought that was
just for the power I thought that was
just to shift the power these are for
power
oh those run the LEDs altogether yeah I
was doing some reading on the shift
register it's really interesting the way
that it's basically just like you know
if you give it a 1 and then you come
back around and come back as a - yeah in
binary in sales with all these
components together and all the fun
stuff and the shift registers I had to
buy all those cuz I didn't have any
everything costs about 100
if you don't have anything if you
already have the Arduino the wires and
the breadboards then you'll come out to
like 50 bucks for everything so it's
really good ladies what I love here is
that your your building on what we were
talking about when the last time I was
here in studio which was about fading
LEDs and no they don't actually it's not
varying the voltage it's actually the
the pulse width modulation yeah and that
was so fun cuz I was able to use it
again I didn't have to write the code
for this one but you can see it in the
code for this one as well you'd notice
it whenever I pointed a camera at it and
I posted that video on my Instagram as
well you can see the flashing for the
pulse width modulation of these so the
reason why we're using PWM again for
this is to quickly change the amount of
light given off by each of the different
LEDs in the strip and because each color
of the LED is at a different frequency
or a different wavelength if we use PWM
to fade from one color to the next
it'll look like a rainbow because it's
gonna have to go through the different
wavelengths of each and every tip so
that's actually how you address each of
these individual LEDs to be red green or
blue or some combination therein is
you're actually just changing the PWM
value that they're receiving yeah cool
that is so cool
so to make each and every one of these
strips there's 15 total strips each one
go and sync we have to use the shift
register yeah you've got a you've got an
R a G and a B so you're going through
the gamut of your PWM or the red then
then the blue and yeah and when you mix
it properly kind of creates that ring it
creates that rainbow it's so
cool-looking and then with the shift
registers and those are the little guys
the little smaller I guess the little
black things on there mm-hmm
look like little bugs those will fill up
each and every different channel of each
of the strips with ones and zeros for
the data of the colors that you're going
to be using once it fills up it goes on
to the next one the next strip and then
after that it will fill up and go on to
the next strip so it's repeating the
same cycle for each of the strips and
it's just doing it in a kind of clock
formation so each one will change right
after the next right because you've got
your clock input which is actually
telling it out
cycle to speak and then you've got your
lock which is the other pin that's going
to tell it hey I'm about to talk to you
here's your new value and I'm done
talking to you
exactly it's so cool and then the last
thing that we had to use are these
things the bigger registers I guess you
would call them they're called uln 2803
muscles the power so these are the di P
thingies so the LEDs run off of 12 volts
which is kind of weird for an Arduino
but it works shift registers why not run
off of 5 volts that can be a problem
since there's pull two different
voltages that you have to use so it
feeds 12 volts into the Arduino through
the voltage in yeah VI in port or pin on
the Arduino Uno and then it feeds it out
to the LEDs through the voltage input
and then the shift registers control the
UL ends through the breadboard
connections on here
yay wiring you know that's actually a
very common thing in electronics I've
never done it before is it it was cool
yeah different components want different
voltages and you're constantly like
bringing it up taking it down every time
you do that there's gases involved and
so and then that generates heat and
things of that nature so there's like a
lot of like really awesome science that
goes into like how are we going to most
effectively use this power and this why
you see you know common things like 5
volt and 12 volt rails as they were on
power supplies and you know PC computers
so same reason yeah it was it was cool
being able to use these things in I
guess concurrently together because I've
never been able to do that before so I
was able to learn a lot about why you
would use shift registers and why you
would use these dual inline packages
products as opposed to like a whole
bunch of different wires so dual inline
package is when you have a product like
this it's a little icy yeah I see
exactly that's the word I was looking
for so it basically means that you have
a bunch of different pins on here I
believe this one is 18 yes yes you can
Tron loop yeah it's the package type so
you count from pin 1 all the way down to
pin 18 and you have a bunch of different
pins that you can use for all your
different code it's very similar to what
you have on your breadboard it's just
that it's been condensed down into one
integrated circuit exactly integrate
miss of that very cool stuff you know
that same power thing that you were
talking about 12 volts and 5 volts I do
the same exact thing with where did it
go back with my goggles which require 12
volts and I like to power them off of
USB yes
and so to achieve that lose my cable
I lost my cable well find your cable I'm
gonna have a problem it's okay you're
doing spring cleaning you'll be fine
this was also the first time I had to
add a library to my Arduino IDE it was
kind of weird but it's easy like you
just if somebody already has the library
available you just download the zip file
you extract it into your Arduino
documents folder and then it shows up
and your IDE and it just shows up under
examples and was reborn it's like magic
saved as an example in my folder and
then when you open up the code it's it's
actually really short for all the
craziness that's happening here but it's
pretty much just in charge of the
brightness changing the brightness and
the flow depending on the clock time it
was very similar to what you did before
making the littles except this time I'm
running 15 different lines of code
instead of 15 different strips of LEDs
instead of just well once you've learned
how to do it in serial now do it many
times and call it parallel and then once
that's fast enough then condense that
back down to serial and then do it again
and so it was cool it was really really
fun and I was happy that it worked for
me even though I had an entry with the
breadboard Oh stupid breadboard yeah
cool it happens well that is pretty
awesome if you guys have some feedback
you can of course leave it in the
comments or send us email feedback at
hak5 org let us know what other kind of
man Katie goodness you see
yeah I like it and with that we're gonna
take a quick break but when we get back
the week it is now time for the trivia
question of the week last week's trivia
question was most modern TVs draw power
even if they are turned off the circuit
the power is used in does what function
when the TV is actually in use and the
answer is simply remote controls because
obviously that needs to stay plugged in
if you want to turn it on eventually so
this week's trivia question is what
frequency range is the high frequency
band and you can answer that over at H
ok 5 org slash trivia to win some
awesome hack 5 goodies that's just about
wraps up this week's episode of hack 5
before we get going just wanted to
remind you guys all of the ways that you
can support all the cool things we're
doing here at hack 5 warehouse including
just tuning in sharing liking
subscribing all of that jazz you heard
it before you know the drill but also I
