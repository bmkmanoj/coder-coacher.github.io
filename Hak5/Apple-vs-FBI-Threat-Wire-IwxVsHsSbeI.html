encryption versus justice we're going to
talk about that whole Apple DOJ thing
today and oh yeah let expect got hacked
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Patrick Norton and this is
threat wire for february2014 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and a big
thank you to all the viewers has support
threat wire at patreon.com / threat wire
okay big story Apple versus FBI but is
it really that simple let's talk about
privacy and safety they've made it big
part of the conversation for many
Americans not just security geeks ever
since mr. Snowden started leaking NSA
documents a few years ago throw in a
generous helping of security failures
say Home Depot target nationally Madison
and a soupcon of fud because hey that
seems to be how news media outlets roll
and you have the great battle of privacy
2016 which comes down to a legal battle
will Apple create a tool that will make
it possible for the FBI to guess the
password on the San Bernardino
terrorists iPhone it's not really a tool
it's not really a back door in one sense
well the DOJ says they're asking for is
a special version of the OS tied to a
particular iPhones udid that will allow
the FBI in the words of director James
Comey we simply want the chance with a
search warrant to try to guess the
terrorists passcode without the phone
essentially self-destructing and without
it taking a decade to guess correctly
that's it Comey adds the particular
legal issue is actually quite narrow the
relief we seek is limited and its value
increasingly obsolete because the
technology continues to evolve we don't
want to break anyone's encryption or set
a master key loose on the land I hope
thoughtful people will take the time to
understand that maybe the phone holds
the clue to finding more terrorists
maybe it doesn't but we can't look the
survivors in the eye or ourselves in the
mirror if we don't follow this lead this
is an interesting concept that was
essentially a response to Apple CEO Tim
Cook's open letter which begins the
United States government has demanded
that Apple take an unprecedented step
which threatens the security of our
customers we oppose this order which has
implications far beyond the legal case
at hand
interesting interesting thing and I'm
going to say that part interesting over
and over again because this is going to
get messy because this is the real world
we're talking about because once that
special version of the OS is created
it's safe to assume that a the US
government will try to make it usable
and other devices because they do that
and be it'll eventually leak out on the
internet and then see in the words of
Tim Cook have the potential to unlock
any iphone in someone's physical
possession let's pause here for a moment
this iphone is pretty high-profile but
there are at least a dozen more iphone
unlocking warrants dogging apple and the
creation of such a service for the US
government would probably compel Apple
to do the same for every other country
on the planet many of which don't
require a search warrant they just do
what they want to when they want to the
FBI in their credit they say it's not a
backdoor we don't want to break
encryption just just this one phone
apple says it is because it will
undermine quote decades of security
advancements that protect our customers
because it's never as simple as undoing
one thing it's about undoing all of the
things that work together in the
operating system to make that phone less
penetrable to hackers and people that
would seal your information or your
banking think about everything you do on
your phone now do you use Apple pay do
you use any of those other devices do
you purchase things on eBay do you do
your banking there and then take a step
back and think about right now if you
take an android phone which doesn't have
that whole self destruct as you guessed
passwords option in there I am told by
people familiar with the process that
you can get through the oh wow see
there's one two three four digits on an
iPhone that's 9999 possibilities maybe
10,000 if you do all zeros I'm not good
at math I majored in lit but what that
means in an android phone if you
automate the guessing 16 hours that's
not a lot of time so really not a lot of
time if it's automated and they do some
of the other tricks you can do
especially if your phone is in
somebody's hands in the wild or maybe
just an angry little kids sister should
you be protected from your kids sister
did I mention this is interesting and
messy let's talk about what happens next
court battles mostly over whether the
FBI is overstepping the all writs Act of
1789
to require apple to write an OS that
will undermine its security protocols
which Apple believes and you might want
to brush up on the NSA Snowden documents
when you think about this well quote the
government apple says could extend this
breach of privacy and demand that Apple
build surveillance software to intercept
your messages access your health records
or your financial data track your
location or even access your phone's
microphone or camera without your
knowledge and hey that's assuming they
already aren't because the NSA when they
tell us tech companies to open things up
they also give them a gag order so they
can't talk about it on the other side
FBI director Comey says this case is
about the innocence attacked in San
Bernardino it does highlight that we
have an awesome new technology that
creates a serious tension between two
values we all treasure privacy and
safety that tension should not be
resolved by corporations that sell stuff
for a living it also should not be
resolved by the FBI which investigates
for a living it should be resolved by
the American people deciding how we want
to govern ourselves in a world we have
never seen before we shouldn't drift to
a place or be pushed to a place by the
loudest voices because finding the right
place the right balance will matter to
every American for a long time damn
right it will props to Apple for taking
this fight on but it's time to reach out
and educate your congressional reps and
brace for impact because you better
believe that the Supreme Court is going
to decide on this one long before
Congress does anything about privacy or
security or which one is more important
to the American people because director
commis words to the side it usually is
the loudest or most empowered voices
that decide what happens encryption and
privacy are total government access
which side are you on citizen which side
are you on but wherever hacked I so if
you downloaded Linux Mint 17-3 cinema in
addition on februari 20th this is not
the sort of thing you want to read if
you downloaded linux mint on februari
20th but we got to give the mint crew
props for recognizing the breach and
making the community aware as fast and
as public and as loud as they could
essentially hackers put a backdoor in a
min I so in the hopes of building a
botnet and then hacked mints website to
point to it Linux Mint blog has
instructions on how the check of your
iso is compromised how to fix it backup
your data reinstall the OS then change
your passwords and in a statement i
truly love in a world where high-profile
hacking k
are continually denied and under played
by corporations and governments on the
blog page there's a big bold subhead
that asks is everything back to normal
now and the men cruces not yet we took
the server down while we're fixing the
issue I heart honesty way to go linux
our feature comment this week comes from
privacy required who in response to SMS
APK posted on youtube we need critical
reporting hak5 i mean seriously SMS APK
can't anyone see that this newest piece
is only reported as an advertisement for
the security firm oh my goodness he got
us you're totally right this isn't about
a vicious new way of attacking
high-profile operating systems like
androids not used by most of the phone
users on the planet android doesn't have
security update issues this this doesn't
sound like the early days of email
phishing when broad assault shield of
brandon results before crackers develop
targeted fishing made for vicious
attacks like i don't know nailing
people's banking accounts this is all
about promoting oh sorry you use the
word advertising for nothing that
security firm right Oh a quick heads up
for Tyler who asked why aren't you
talking about the Apple FBI thing this
was posted last week also because the
story broke right about the time Shannon
was in studio recording threat wire
sometimes a weekly schedule is cruel and
frankly the story was an evolving mess
we wanted some time to think about and
we hope we did it justice this week

today's stories leave them right down
below and we're going to scan them when
we get a chance before I go I want to
thank everyone who supports threat wire
on patreon if we're helping you sort out
the hot mess of privacy and security
sorry privacy required will try to do
better next week please become a patron
at patreon.com / threat wire we may even
a feature you're adorable furbabies
orderable adorable fur babies or
ethernet jacks like this one in the next
episode Oh pic tribute to help us keep
this coming completely independent and
