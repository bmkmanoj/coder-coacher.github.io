Squarespace
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today
I'm checking out my top fives Chrome
security extensions number five is
password fail this extension for Chrome
warns you to back away whenever you
start to log into a site that sends your
password as clear text a lot of sites
don't encrypt or hash your text and just
send your password to a database
completely open and ready for hackers or
any curious phone to get their hands on
it
password fail will call these sites out
on their crappy security and hopefully
help you from losing sensitive data now
I have this one pulled out let's see if
it works
whew this was a good one maker shed and
what will happen is you'll get this
nifty little icon in the top that lets
you know before you log in that your
password might be potentially stored in
a database with no encryption whatsoever
now number four is KB SSL enforcer
some sites offer HTTPS or secure socket
layer logins this extension will force
those sites to automatically go to HTTPS
instead of HTTP so you have more
security and encryption in case you
forget to check which is something that
happens to me a lot now if I go over to
a site where I don't have it set I can
click on my bookmark and it sends me
automatically to HTTPS awesome number
three is viewed through a lot of times
on Twitter and whatnot people post tiny
URLs or bittley's and I have no clue
what they are but I'm I'm a curious cat
and I always click the link anyways even
though I don't know what kind of site
I'm going to stumble onto and sometimes
that can be a really bad thing view
through pop-ups a little blurb that
shows you the page you're about to visit
when you hover on a tiny URL address so
I'm going to
has this let's go to my Twitter feed see
what's new and happening okay perfect
say Frank posted a bitly up at the top
and it gives me a nice little blur about
the bottom and it's very unobtrusive so
it's beautiful lets me know it's a
youtube video so yeah I I'm gonna say
it's okay number two is the Chrome
extension for LastPass LastPass gives
you an easy way to fill up forms with
autofill and remember passwords
passwords are stored locally so even the
LastPass team can't access your
passwords using LastPass gives you a
vault where only a master password will
unlock all of your data for more info on
LastPass make sure to check out hack tip
number 20 coming up next all let you
know my number one security and privacy

back and number one is web of trust
aka what this small extension gives you
a small icon in the top right corner of
your browser that shines either red
yellow or green red means bad and green
means good obviously the cool thing
about web a trust is all the site's
ratings are submitted by user feedback
not a virus detector or a corporate
affiliation you can add your own
feedback by left clicking on the icon
and choosing the color you think the
site deserves so let's go to hack 5 and
see how it rates and this is where the
icon shows oh we're green and I can
click on this choose my own ratings I'm
gonna say we're very safe we're hacker
friendly in a way
and if I want to I can go here and view
all of the comments oh yay thanks for
the comments guys

colors that's awesome
