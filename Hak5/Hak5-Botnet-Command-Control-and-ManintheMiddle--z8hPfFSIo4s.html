control with creo c2 and detecting
man-in-the-middle attacks plus a big
season 7 announcement stick around for
this episode of hack 5
this episode of high five is brought to
you by Netflix go to assist Express and
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain
hello welcome hak5 my name is Darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse
and she is not a bundle of puppies or
kitties
no I'm a bundle of happiness and Julie
and sugar lots and lots of sugar
somebody fed her the candy yeah I has a
cavity oh it's true
any go to the dentist season seven we
haven't torn down the digs yet where we
eventually will get a new set for the
season as we try to do as we progress
through that I guess you're wondering
because there's 26 episodes and then we
go to another note that's just because
they're in runs in the mindset of
television networks no I'm running the
mindset of it's easier to wrap my head
around seasons because then I can be
like oh that was that season that we did
that thing and that's true
7:01 and we are excited to be on the the
process going on today yeah we've
student we are blessed to have Robin
went down I love him right back from
spook yeah cheer for yourself Robin we
got one person in the audience and it's
Robin cheer for himself
yeah he's gonna be talking to this about
Cree OC to botnet command and control
tool that he just featured at a talk
that he did at shmoocon
with zombies well talking about the
social zombie talk with Thomaston and
and Kevin Johnson so good stuff there
that was actually one of the talks that
I got and it was very interesting I
liked it a lot
yeah I got to see through talks this
year yeah wasn't that cool we got to see
talks this year last year I went to
shmoocon didn't see anything I even got
a shirt boot shmoocon 2010 yeah nice and
I'm also going to be talking about ways
to detect men in the middle attacks that
are based on art cast poisoning and then
next week we're also talking about
Robins back in studio to talk about
different ways to do man-in-the-middle
attacks that don't include our cash
poisonings to stick around for that as
well as big announcements at the end of
the show but at the moment I'm in the UK
and this is prerecorded so that time
lapses
matter but I'm sure it'll be great show
so let's kick it off right and go right
into the robbing segment so sound good

27th at game hack 5 org and I get a give
a shout out to the vessel for supporting
us with their servers you can find
information about them at the vessel
calm and a range of their game servers
at the vessel comm slash of game servers
thanks for that and we'll see you on
Saturday so botnets are all the rage and
here to increase the viewership of hack
5 tenfold Robin wood with krios right
yeah that's what we're doing with it
yep Creole c2 No so it's not actually
for for increasing x5 viewership for
there potentially could well what is it
what is creo Sun canoe - this - ok
Krissi - I've just released version 3 of
it it's designed to be a botnet or
command control channel system that runs
over social media now I've never owned a
button in myself but I've seen where I
could potentially rent one um as far as
I know bots are controlled on IRC I know
because I've seen how flood channels
before
okay--oh are a bunch a number is all
show up in yeah yeah well the idea of
this was hopefully most corporations now
and most people
yeah most companies are blocking IRC
from their networks however very few of
locking HTML HTTP yeah I can totally see
that
right but why so what part of HTTP what
well the original one version one was a
used purely Twitter so the commander
sent tweet out which basically said BOTS
do this and the boss saying listen to
the no I actually just saw a little bit
of news when that when that broke about
because somebody actually used it
legitimately weren't well there but now
am I not really somebody used one of the
concepts that I had but maybe they came
up with themselves but the way the way
this is written it's it's very
deliberately written as a proof of
concept it's all in Ruby it's not
stealthy it's not optimized so the stuff
that I've done can't itself be used but
what they picked up on is one of the
ways I suggested to send commands is
base64 encode them and then put them on
Twitter and it happened what does it
look like if you're following someone
that's a Bart master well it's very
because the way it works is you can
choose what language you want the
communication to be done in like what
like Python parole no no what I mean is
the default is a very basic it does :
CMD and then whatever they want the bots
at oh so ping something or execute
command or download a file but then what
I thought from there was that I'll get
be fairly easy to block that so why not
make it so they can be changed
so the language is purely a module is
plugged in so if you want to change it
you can write a module that does or we
have a module that does it in say
English so I'm saying : command paying
one in two well state m1 it will say hey
look at this IP or look at this address
ten women to whatever so that almost
looks like a legitimate Twitter because
yes it there at Witter Post that is
because it's an English yeah and the
more effort you put into the language
then the more you can make it fit in
excellent
so do use this with your own private but
net no I've I've only used it just for
practicing at the moment okay well what
are the what's new with the newer
version well the new one I've just added
LinkedIn sports and test fit on the
windows working there so LinkedIn well
how do you use use it with LinkedIn
LinkedIn have recently added the ability
or had it added an API should say that
allows you to read any field in a
LinkedIn users profile but then on your
own profile you can read and write the
status field so what I'm doing is
posting the command into the status
field in the LinkedIn profile so you
have to create like a dummy profile yeah
okay and then all of you so is so what
about the actual bot like is this is
this something that you incorporate into
your zombie program they have to install
under you know the Windows 2000 machine
that hasn't been patched or what and you
can do what you want with it it's say
the current one is a proof of concept so
it is just a big lump of Ruby that runs
on its own it's not designed to be
stealthy or built into anything at the
moment it's purely you've got a manual
installed rubygems for it you've got a
manual install Ruby and then install the
rest okay but you've got it all working
in Windows now yeah so there you go next
step what are the kind of control
methods the other two that I've got are
you cronic of a JPEG which I got this
idea somebody else beat me to this one
they did a JPEG header just the header
followed by the commands hmm
but when you look at that you can't
actually compute the JPEG
it's garbled because there's no body to
it it's kind of like steganography but
nothing's there yeah yeah so I like the
footwell JPEGs allow metadata so why not
keep a valid JPEG and is so the command
into one the metadata field so you can
have the
the truth kittens and you know that's
good so what would the bot have to just
pull this JPEG over and over to you have
anything is updated well that works the
the way it works at the moment is the
bot knows one JPEG one image on the net
and it just grabs that periodically but
you could very easily say here are 50
JPEGs grab all of them that that's not
going to throw off any IDs or you know
any other and a filter is to say you
know I mean it's is a far cry from IRC
for your work machine to go and check a
JPEG yeah on some some random server
that's not going to throw up any flags
that's some scary stuff what are their
what are the methods to have the final
one is going over tiny URL really so
what white tiny URL well is that GB or
Italy or any of those because I don't
know if it still is but obviously it was
the first and the probably one of the
most popular ones and the way this works
bit convoluted but ten URL allows you to
specify the alias that is being
shortened down 200 case and then that's
why we ends with is good yeah some of
the other services like wait again it's
all modular you could very easily write
your own just by creating a 10 you're
like what would the tiny URL look like
and you'll assign URL but the way the
alias is created it's based on a
timestamp and a hash around the keyword
there all hashed together and the number
of them are created per time slot so
every 10 minutes you can have up to 5
valid hash public aliases so if the
commander wants to send out command it
generates that list of hashes that
aliases and this is the first one
available if it is it creates it says
please shrink me this URL using this
alias the URL is added a Creole comm
slash ping 190 wants it's a query string
so what the bot then does every 10
minutes it generates the same list
because it knows that the algorithms for
it goes to tiny URL says does this
exist yes okay what URL is that
shrinking gets URL part of much is it is
this about the command yes so X cube so
how does it recognize that is is that
the hash is that the secret key that
your BOTS and you only know well it
works out hash and then it says ten URL
give me the URL though it's has been
shortened by this alias I didn't used a
regular expression just to say does this
look like a valid command that I can run
so what's to stop somebody else from
stealing your buds at the moment on that
nothing ok again what you could do for
that is add hashes or encryption do you
have hashes are encryption in any of the
other yes there are one of the languages
is encoded so basics for encoding for
the hash Java C isn't encrypted but then
there is also an encrypted language
where bottom commander sharing key and
yes so they support decrypt that it's
just like LinkedIn or Twitter spam yeah
at that the bots fear they're taking a
look at that's awesome now look it can
somebody extend on this is it a
framework where say like I wanted to put
it into RSS or atom could I do that
yeah very easily it's it's deliberately
designed the the languages are all
modular the control channels modular and
once it's open running there is a change
language and change channel command and
you the commander just says right BOTS
use this language instead and the bot
goes to a website downloads in your
language file I've changed to that so
you can you can have them like shifting
around all the time yeah I never know
you know as soon as you think you know
there aren't here you've already moved
on to the next social network yeah so
it's using encrypted on Twitter and you
think well yeah that's being noticed
so we can now move to English on
LinkedIn and then you can move somewhere
else and then you could used to be
uploading je pays to Photobucket or
something yeah that is awesome
now I got to know what is what does
curio stand for
what is that mario's is a Greek Titan
God and then c2 is what military used
kind in control okay excellent
well thank you Robin this is totally
excellent stuff I'm sure that people can
you know dive in is there a forum the

topic of the day is detecting
man-in-the-middle attacks and who better
to have onset than of course Robin wood
Robin how's it going man good I still
enjoy in the States back from shmoocon
yeah let's retreated you well I really
didn't it so we're talking about
detecting a man-in-the-middle attacks
and this is apt because it's you know
what we've been doing for quite a while
we have tools like the AWS Agha the
pineapple and the Interceptor in the
monkey yeah and and what's interesting
about these hardware-based ways of doing
man in the
all the taxes how are you supposed to
detect if you've got a monkey in between
your connection very hard to detect the
intercept the monkey is virtually
invisible slightly to most normally
useless it wouldn't be able to spot that
it's there so it like if you were the
victim of one of these what what signs
would you notice like as far as your you
know the route are going to change is
the DNS gonna change no nothing would
change to a normal user so so almost
undetectable and what about the farm
though well the the pineapple of your
house ago you get sucked into one of
these on the wireless the the obvious
thing about the pineapple is you
basically think where am i I've just
connected to an Access Point SSID should
that be here so if you're starting an
airport and you suddenly connect to your
home access point you should really
realize there's something wrong your
home access point is not at the airport
mhm and then how would you like what
have you just oblivious I mean is there
something you can proactively do to
notice that it's out there because a lot
of times your machine just connects to a
network and you may not notice you know
well windows certainly XP will pop up
little dialog box for a split second to
say yes it's connected to a different
access point that's about it that's all
that it does I guess the the MAC address
though is identifiable though these are
all you know although the ones that
we've been having fun with are based on
the phone simply because the atheras
chip and yeah the RET ability warmth it
used to be availability of them yeah
through worth roof on but you know now
through act on the the original chip it
all says hey I'm off on right it does
yeah I suppose potentially you could
have some software that would look at
the MAC address of the access point and
say yes it's a phone I'm expecting it to
be Linksys or whatever and do that and
pick up that there's a difference there
and I think that's that's I guess that's
what we're getting at here is like when
it comes to on the attacker side being
the man in the middle all we're trying
to do really is tell I'm going to tell
Robin I'm the
and I'm gonna tell the router I'm Robin
and I'm basically spoofing myself and
positioning myself in the middle but I
can't actually spoof my MAC address as
the router if I did packets would just
drop dropping on the network it wouldn't
work you can't have like the zip it's
for instance I've shown you there's
little 40 $50 devices the problem with
them is they all have hard-coded into
the same MAC address so in my testing I
was like bringing up multiple I was
bringing up two or three of them at the
same time trying to get him all set up
it's like how come the packets are
dropping and I just had and the next
thing you know it's like oh they all
have the same MAC address yeah
that's not too good flavor an idea so I
mean for of you know hacking into the
router itself how would you using
traditional methods of man-in-the-middle
attacks not these Hardware solutions but
using their you know software you can't
necessarily make yourself completely
invisible
no they the traditional style face up
cache poisoning basically what that is
white said you're telling the rotor that
sir you're may I know telling me that
you had the router and that's it -
you're sitting in the middle and then I
send all my package through you so in
terms being visible or invisible
straight away I should be able to see
that the address has changed it's a
different MAC address I'm talking so so
what do you like to use when it comes to
just you know in software in Europe
spoofing going on well the standard one
is apps both through decent decent if
packaged the song grub the original one
good stuff and then we've talked about
on windows way back in the first season
Cain and Abel that'll do it just point
and click
yeah and account letters as well yes
these just need to do a little series on
other cat there's a bunch of fun filters
you can get yeah I just outside don't so
nuts yes some mysterious fun I've been
meaning to do that one for quite awhile
so I think you finally get to that this
season but but so let's let's take a
step back and rather than thinking with
our black hat on think about this as the
victim or the potential victim
especially like coming back from a
conference like shmoocon
this is maybe something that you might
want to consider installing and setting
up on your system so we're talking about
iron geek stool decaffeinate ID or
decaffeinated this is a really cool tool
that Adrienne just puts together these
awesome tools that we should all have in
our kits and this one takes a look at
the MAC address of the router and alerts
you to potential dangers yeah basically
watches the MAC address if it notice
it's changing it gives you a nice pop up
gives you a warning say something's
going on
so I actually have a little demo set up
here figured we would put it through the
test and actually show it off so here we
go Windows machine I've already gone
ahead and run this once and you'll see
that we get a log file after the first
time we run it where you can actually
see you know when the MAC address
changes the IP address and it'll give
you alert here we also have the
configuration here where we can change
whether or not we want to you know be
monitoring the ARP cache be monitoring
the firewall the gateways and whatnot
but let's just go ahead and run this and
believe it's one of the based on auto IT
and we can actually come in here and
take a look at the source so if you're
an auto IT kind of guy you can actually
go ahead and play with that but it's
compiled for us so we'll go ahead and
run it and we'll just get this little
icon here in the system tray where we
can check out what we're monitoring and
check out our configuration here but
that's pretty much it it just lives in
your system tray and alerts you when
something goes tits-up so let's let's
give it a shot so I've already gone
ahead and set proc cisnet IP for two IP
forwarding to 1 so we are forwarding and
from here I can just go ahead and run
our spoof on our Ethernet interface our
target is that machine 10 1001 46 or at
least I believe that still it's IP
address and 10 1001 which is the IP of
the router so we'll go ahead and run
that and it will do its magic
backtrack for final rocking the pound
sauce and there we go
IP address 1010 a1 changed MAC address
from to this new I back address and it
says this IP is a gateway something
weird is up yeah
is there any legitimate reason why a MAC
address of your router would change that
you could think of no if you've got
particularly at home your standard Soho
rotor no reason got to change yeah I
mean I'm trying to think even unlike an
enterprise level if you're moving from
department the Hartmann the only thing I
think of is load balanced by own routing
so most papaya space multiple gateways I
think this is a great tool to just
basically get a signature of you know
your your network and notice if anything
has changed I think there should
probably be more tools like this just I
mean you could probably detect whether
or not you know if you're being
connected through yoga just say hey is
the domain controller that I'm expecting
to be here actually there yeah well the
same thing I'm sure this tool could
easily be modified the all the phones
have got the standard or UI first pass
the MAC address which is fun obviously
that can be spoofed right but if people
aren't spoofing yet you could
potentially build into this tool hang on
your access point MAC address it's a
farm are you sure about this yeah do you
have a phone maybe sensor write down the
MAC addresses of all you're not running
to like this but anyway I thought that
we would show off this tool because this
is something that if you're going to be
at a hackathon on Wi-Fi and stuff like
that well it probably would be going off
non-stop but still very cool tool go
ahead and check it out iron geeks
website and of course if you have any
questions or feedback about arm spoofing
other men in little techniques and stuff
like that
go ahead and shoot us an email feedback
at hack 5 org
rotted me off you know that good
I don't want to yell ya XP what about it
I knew where everything was
and then I upgraded to seven and well
it's prettier than XP but it's annoying
me I need to set up my game pad and turn
off autoplay and tweak the power
settings and all the settings are all
over the place
and can I just get an old-school control
panel well there's this thing called god
mode can you do that assistance
thingamajiggy that you do at work yeah
you mean go to assist
yeah it's that can you go to assist on
my computer up here sure I'm sending you
a link click 'add look at ok good
alright all you have to do is create a
new folder anywhere on your computer and
then name it god mode doc squiggly this
stupid long hex code so if you want to
be a lead about it you just hit Windows
R and then desktop hit enter and then
all fwf and then just paste that in so
then you've got a spiffy new icon for a
control center and it's got like
everything built in so you can change
all sorts of stuff like your auto run or
your power settings oh is that a game
controller if you want to support more
clients by spending less money try the

alright guys that just about wraps up
this episode of hack 5 but first we do
have some special announcements here
this being the first episode of the
seventh season the most exciting season
and I'm not actually here right now
now you're in AI when this release is on
Wednesday I think we'll be in Sheffield
which which is actually eating
Manchester in the amount of people who
have signed up on Facebook to attend the
event by like four people now so that's
awesome Sheffield yeah I'm moving to
Missouri as crazy as it sounds we don't
normally get very personal about our
lives or whatever on the show but this
is one of those times where we're just
gonna go ahead and map it all out for
you guys that they understand what
season seven is all about so you can
stick with us and understand the way
that the show changes and evolves around
our lives just as it has between the
apartment and cast and and houses and
all sorts of stuff so go ahead lay it on
us yeah sorry
yes well I'm from Missouri well kind of
I was an army brat but yeah I'm from
Missouri my family lives there like my
close family brother sister mom and dad
and my dad was recently diagnosed with
some stuff so he's in the hospital he's
been in the hospital for like the past
year almost so I'm gonna go home and
spend some time with him and I think
being closer to him will you know
hopefully have some kind of effect on
like helping him out so yeah I'm going
back home but it doesn't mean I'm gonna
leave the show or anything no you're not
leaving the show you're gonna be on what
every every week right yeah excellent
excited I have a present for you here
you go this is great
Oh God nope a remote hosting kit you've
got you lied to me what this is dig okay
but you know what he said it was small I
said it fit in a couple small enough Oh
like like lunchbox shmoocon red fox
style duffel it's got the lights and the
tripods and everything you need and and
it even comes with a slightly smaller
but yeah I've got some extra stuff in
there it's actually all based on a very
small camera so David you told me you
told me remote host kit in yes gave me
this and I was like sweet yeah there's
some support stuff there
welcome to hey we've got the lights but
it's it's trust me it's small and and
yeah that's how we're gonna do this this
is gonna be crazy we're actually
deploying these across the globe because
hak5 is going global and we're gonna
have a lot more faces on the show as we
proceed through the exciting challenges
that the season is going to present us
with one of those being so my move is
temporary by the way if I lived in
Missouri for more than like I don't know
a few months I would probably kill
myself so trust me I'm not gonna stay
there for the rest of my life yeah and
this this works out because we will be
reconvening rendezvous Aang but no not
on the East Coast will be out in San
Francisco yeah not awesome ah so for the
longest time we kind of resisted the
fact but that's that's where the action
is and while you're out in Missouri
taking care of your dad and as soon as I
get back from the UK the process starts
of selling the car the house most of my
worldly possessions he's putting his
house up on the Facebook marketplace I
might put it there yet but I have at a
crossroads here and the situation that
may present itself would potentially put
me in a place where I would be too
exhausted to continue the weekly doses
of Technos and while I think it's
premature to make the leap that I'm
doing I am going to go ahead and put all
my chips on the table and rather than
fold my cards I'm going to continue to
bring the weekly techno list and just go
out there so as soon as the car and the
house go
I'm FedExing or UPS in or something a
cat well I'm taking it you're thinking
Kirby you're gonna take care Kirby well
I'm gone so while you're out in Missouri
I get rid of all this stuff and then
boxing up what I care to keep in my life
which includes HD cameras laptops and
not a whole lot else you can tell where
his heart is set yeah and then I'm going
to ship all those out to the west coast
and then I'm going to be loading up my
motorcycle with camping gear HD camera
gear and clothing of course and I'm just
going to and a monkey of course strapped
on the back
and we are going to start the 3000 mile
trip across America and it's going to be
I know a lot more than 3,000 miles yeah
so I'm actually starting going up to
Pennsylvania and then I'm gonna be
coming down the was it called deals gap
I'm going to do that and then I'm
probably gonna hit some of the TAT and
I'm going to be zigzagging all across
the u.s. and the Trail of Tears yeah
good good roads which highway is that I
know how many numbers I don't remember
I'm gonna try to say off they are the
motorways or the interstates if you will
but yeah just the the UK the trip that
I'm on at the moment is a proof of
concept for this adventure and I put up
a a PB for couches in the UK and I got
such an overwhelming response that I
have a feeling that if I were to put up
an open Google Maps document kind of
like a wiki if you will
putting out APB's for couches I could
feeling that some of you might you know
wouldn't mind if I came by cooked you
dinner I offered a couch up so that you
know do the show and zigzag across
America for a couple weeks
recording hack fives and having an
adventure and making that happen so
that's that is Season seven I'm gonna
take a road trip to yes because I no
longer have a job except for hack five
right but you've built up enough savings
in yeah so that is yeah that's about the
most person we've ever gotten on the
show but that's without so excited yeah
what I want to do and I'm like yeah well
yeah I mean I'm at the thing where it's
like alright grind or passion and one
has more it really all depends on the
way that you quantify success and I
don't think numbers in an account are
what really quantify success
so you're saying grind equals money in
your pocket well animation equals
awesomely cool memories and good times
and awesome people that we get to meet
every day I might be poor but will sleep
on couches and and yes two times and
make high-five I would take the passion
yes any day yeah I know this
so crazy and exciting but anyway we'll
get into more to that later as it
progresses but that is a season in a
nutshell and I figured it was only fair
for us to just go ahead and lay it on
you and map it out so that you don't
freak out when all of a sudden snobs are
coming on you know via remote but we're
still trying to do the show just as we
always have
except I was going to say something but
I better not
so be the last chance we have to do well
the last chance for a couple months at
least to do a proper show in person
studio it's good stuff though I'm glad
is that really all you got is that
really all you've got woo okay okay
you wouldn't oh I won all right people
