be a crime I'm Jen cutter from open
alpha you're watching hack point-five
hey a cleans welcome to episode number
four of hack point five I'm your host
Wes and I'm Darren and this episode
we've got a ton of good stuff going on
and you know too much to even list so
we're gonna get into a classic mod
segment but first if you're watching on
the fifth November 5th and you'd like to
join the party we are most likely
hanging out on IRC impound hack 5 on the
tech file IRC network that would be IRC
debt Tech file dot CA so if you'd like
you can join us there but on with the
episode yeah well as soon as I make my
glass meet your glass oh come on dude ah
all in good taste so join the party
serious episode 4 Cheers hey a clings
it's Wes again and I'm coming back with
a mod that I think you'll kind of enjoy
but before I go into what the mod
actually is and how to do it I need to
give you a little background on it and
tell you where it came from and just how
it evolved from there so let's go look
at that first all right so the whole
idea for this mod is basically born of
me and Darren sitting here on the couch
just like this playing video games and
we just kind of broke out into
discussion dude playing Street Fighter
sucks with controllers dude you eat line
I want an arcade so bad I do too
I'm gonna go down to that crap you want
at the pizza shop dude that's not even a
freaking arcade there's none around here
yeah dude you know what we need what we
need our own cab well she can't afford
an arcade cabinet where do we have the
room for with a set and everything come
on dude I'm telling you I can make a cab
for less than a hundred bucks and it'll
fit on a bar top you serious yeah I know
I can do it can you do it for the show
of course I'll do it for the show you
have it by Thursday Thursday yeah yeah I
can have it done by Thursday all right
all right my mission now is to build
this mini arcade that'll fit on top of a
bar counter and cost less than $100 so
first things first I need to go do
design work hey hey what's up d7 I'm
actually working on the plans for the
arcade as we speak yeah I'll have it in
both the bitmap form and an actual DWG
in case our viewers want to modify it as
they see fit no problem all right
designs taken care of now the next
biggest thing is parts we have spare
computers lying around and spare game
controllers lying around so those are
going to get recycled however we will
not be using this so all right we're
gearing up to actually do all of our
cuts and build this thing but first
things first we need to take all of our
plans set them out mark out all of our
cuts on our piece of MDF and make sure
we've got enough wood for it just use a
pencil it's real easy
March really well and when you're
cutting make sure you account for losing
that eighth of an inch while using a saw
all right
we're ready to rock and roll
everything's laid out time to cut now
safety tip make sure you follow all
woodworking shop procedures while using
power tools and keep your safety glasses
on at all times well except when
watching the show as far as cutting goes
since nobody's perfect you're gonna have
to do some sanding to clean up those
rough edges and maybe a couple of those
off cuts that you might have made using
your jigsaw or your circular saw so you
can use a rotary tool to take out the
big portions and get some half-decent
hand sandpaper to really finish it up
and make it look good one of the really
good accents that's gonna make this feel
like a real arcade is that plexiglass
cover that you'll have over the screen
to make it look really good you can
paint and outside pour damnit paint I'll
be right back all right like I was
saying we're gonna use a piece of
Plexiglas IDE border so it gives that
authentic look you cut out your border
leaving the square in the middle peel
the protective film on the outside off
you paint that
and that paints gonna go on the inside
so when you look at it from the reverse
side it's gonna look smooth even and
just have a really really nice gloss and
an authentic look now that you've got
all your cuts done all that prep work
you can actually start to assemble it
now what I did was drill into both the
edges and install L brackets on the
inside so that way you have really
really good support and you don't have
to worry about it ever getting tipped
over and torn up so the cab's all
assembled right now except one vital
piece your control deck now for controls
we went to xrk dot-com and picked up
their package deal for 30 bucks you can
pick up two joysticks and 20 buttons and
those 20 buttons include white player 1
and player 2 buttons if you want that
really authentic feel you can go to Happ
controls comm and pick up the same setup
but for about twice the price okay now
that we've got the buttons and joysticks
mounted we have a bigger issue to tackle
that is how are we going to interface
those with the computer there's a few
different ways of going about this you
can get a custom keyboard translator
like the eye pack but they're kind of
pricey so we've decided to stay away
from that you can hack the interface of
a keyboard directly but since I already
molested a model M I thought I might
want to stay away from that I'm sorry
Jen
so we had some very inexpensive USB game
pads lying around so I decided to hack
those let's go take a look at that all
right so what we have here is what's
left over Raw gamepad the way these
things basically work is when you push
the button down it connects these two
halves of this pad completes the circuit
sends it to the IC computer recognizes
it now we have to get that kind of
translation over to our actual arcade
buttons way I went about this because
you drill a hole in the trace for both
the positive and the negative solder or
lead on to it be very careful that your
solder does not bridge the connection
then on the other end we just use these
little quick connects
they slide right on these tabs here so
now when you push this it does the exact
same thing that if you were to push a
button on a normal gamepad computer does
not know the difference and it works
just as well
all right hatchlings here it is fully
assembled your own personal bar top
arcade machine now let me point out a
few key features first things first
contact paper marbleized for most of the
cab and the granite for the control deck
it looks really good and it saves you
from painting okay next you can see all
the buttons laid out here but there's
some accessory buttons that you cannot
see right now first are the pinball
buttons on the side so you get that same
authentic feel and on the back I have a
power button installed so you don't have
to crawl and cut inside of the cab to
turn the machine on to get inside of the
cab if you need to do so I've installed
hinges and a latch on the back panel to
make that access very easy I'm gonna go
into the hardware next month so hold
tight so for less than $100 and about a
weekend's worth of time you can have
your own personal arcade machine so any
questions or comments please see the
show notes at hack 5 org slash forums
and I will supply the building plans for
you but until then it's time to kick ass
and chew bubblegum and I'm all out of
gum
bring it what you got son Oh
was taken of my life I was in sleeping
normal hours or returning my friends
phone calls my bills were piling up and
I was wasting away my savings account on
subscription fees my Slashdot addiction
was getting serious my friends would try
to take me out but I just log on to my
cell phone I just had to get first post
or write about Soviet Russia and beowulf
Klosters then one day Darren told me
about the slashed eye patch for
Microsoft Pharmaceuticals this tiny
little once a month patch helped me get
off so I stopped for good now I can
enjoy my life like everybody else I even
picked up this harmless little computer
game called World of Warcraft
I think I'll install it tonight Thank
You Microsoft Pharmaceuticals you saved
my life did I use a slash eye patch if
you are pregnant nursing side effects
may include blogging dating courting
podcasting and projectile vomiting
consult a physician if a loss occurs so
Darren last month we demonstrated a
man-in-the-middle attack using Cain and
Abel and other real yeah but like we
also said you can always secure yourself
by using something like Gmail which uses
SSL exactly right so this month we're
gonna take it a step further by doing a
direct attack on the SSL protocol and
show you how to decrypt SSL v3 a TLS
traffic that sounds like a lot of fun
but I can't hack on an empty stomach
let's go get a bite to eat and then you
can show us how it's done okay
all right we're back from lunch Harrison
thanks for coming back on the show how
are we gonna perform this tap like
what's involved okay well first of all
we're gonna be using WAP --ax i used wat
version 2.7 and that's just like Knoppix
it's a linux live distro it's based on
space on topics the author of the
program basically he was he's a security
auditor and he was doing it on it for a
company and they said he had to use
their computers and he couldn't install
anything so I mean how you gonna get
anything done right really so he said
all right well now I'll play by the
rules and put all of my tools on to this
one lot Norfolk CD and all my exploits
basically boot off the CD and I got a
you know a portable hack toolkit now
that's not the only portable hack tool
quit there's a
knoppix STD yeah auditor flak flak what
is flexed and thank us thank you okay so
there are a bunch of different toolkits
all right so we're booted into optics
what's the first thing we need to do
okay well the first thing we're gonna do
is run a program called frag router and
this is going to route the IP traffic so
that once we perform a man-in-the-middle
attack it's everything's flowing in the
right direction
great ok so once we've got that done I
just assume we start the ARP yeah
exactly we're gonna use as opposed to
Cain and Abel we're gonna use Arps poof
ok this is a command-line tool and we
just enter the target address who we're
gonna ARP and the Gateway and that'll
position ourselves in between it all
right now that's not all that's involved
in the arc attach those no man line
exactly since we're not yet Cain and
Abel does that automatically but since
we're using a variety of tools the next
thing we have to do is DNS spoof and
that will complete the attack and it
runs silently ok so once we've got DNS
poof we're pretty much sit between them
we can see everything that's going on
exactly we need to get the SSL attack go
here on well this is the heart of the
attack what we want to do is use a tool
called web mi TM which stands for man in
the middle to create a spoof certificate
and it's gonna sit on the network and
just listen and as soon as it the the
user tries to attend our attempts to go
into a secure site that certificate is
going to come to us and it's going to
stop go no further instead the user is
going to be getting our fake certificate
the big stuff it exactly and then what
we do is just pull up either real sit on
the network and sniff up all the traffic
and as soon as the user you know enters
accepts the certificate and this is
password we're gonna see web MIT M it's
gonna start getting a lot of activity as
soon as that happens the next step is
just stop the other wheel we can stop
saving a dump file actually we don't
need okay so so we've sniffed up the
traffic we've seen that they've gone to
an SSL site like Gmail right now what
are we gonna do we've we've got
encrypted packets right well here's
here's there's a key we can save that at
the real traffic and then use a tool
called SSL dump now what that does is
uses a combination of the encrypted SSL
traffic that we sniffed up plus the key
pair because we created the scientific
and we created the certificate so it's
an encrypted key pair between us and the
user so we have all the information that
we need to decrypt it so SSL dump will
just do that all for create it all in a
dump file name it's a simply a matter of
grepping alright so what would we grep
you can grab only you can grab a
combination of things to find the right
the right you know passphrase or
basically we're gonna look for like
passwd or PA SS or e-mail can ask for
all the things that might and now it
would be there in plaintext it would be
in plain text but not only that's gonna
show us the string of the string of
traffic that actually contains that you
like the email log on and the past or
logons another one to search for all
right okay so we've got what site they
were going to the username the password
yep then you know you've completely
owned the box
now there's one problem with your attack
here and that is when you go to when
you're the victim of this attack you're
gonna get their fake certificate and
that's going to pop up and say hey
you're trying to go to gmail but this
certificate just isn't signed it's not
correct you know what do you want to do
and if you click yes well then you've
accepted the fake certificate exactly so
you're relying on users it's kind of
like a phishing attack it kind of is and
if you examine the certificate and show
the details it'll say it's not a trusted
certificate and you can look at where
it's from
so there's more you protect yourself I
just don't accept those even sources but
hopefully next month I can run off you
oh no you're not gonna want that again
just remember embedded objects are your
friends sounds like fun
alright so if you'd like any more
information about any of the stuff we
talked about here go ahead and head over
to the show notes hak5 org last ones
trivia question was what is the TI a
designation for cat 5 cable that was
correctly answered by Tony from
northeastern Pennsylvania who wrote the
designation for cat 5 cable by the TI a
is yeah a TI a 5 6 8 Wikipedia is your
friend so there was actually two parts
to that trivia question the second part
being what is the name of my cat which
is not on Wikipedia
my cat's name is Kerberos she protects
the network so that is correctly
answered by plaster from pound hack 5
and Tom be from Boston UK now we've
hooked them all up with gift
certificates at old mp3.com for about
285 rubles that's about 500 megabytes of
under your own music enjoy the
legitimate music so in recent news
there's been a lot of controversy about
a new worm with that said we have this
month's trivia question what is table X
send your responses to trivia hack 5 org
now coming up next is a fantastic
exclusive we had the chance to interview
a game developer working on the hot new
total conversion of Goldeneye Goldeneye
source this is some really hot stuff
they're putting Goldeneye the classic
from the n64 with the hl2 engine
gorgeous so let's take a look at that
joining us here is Aaron an independent
game developer that's working on the
wildly popular Goldeneye source
half-life conversion now Goldeneye
double-oh-seven has a place in many
gamers hearts since its original release
in 1997 on the n64 Aaron thank you for
coming what can you tell us about the
Goldeneye source gold my source is like
you said total conversion for half-life
2 our goal is to recreate every aspect
of the original Nintendo 64 version and
how did you get involved in this project
someone mentioned about mentioned it on
some forms and did a little research on
it seemed great
I became part of the community and
posted some of my own work and they
actually picked me up as a team member
and what do you do what role do to play
in the game development I'm a modeler
and I make anything from
weapons too props to map objects and
what kind of experience do you have with
modeling what's your background they
started modeling the court recently I
started messing 3d studio max and I just
picked it up and if you ever worked with
game development before other any other
mods I have a little bit of experience
before I had worked on a battlefield
1942 mod called galactic conquest okay
and how do you guys collaborate with
this mods install online I assume right
communication is a little bit limited
but we do have IRC and the forums and we
do have teamspeak they have member
sessions and okay we could quite a bit
done so what's it like developing a game
online rather than the traditional sense
like I said communication a little bit
more limited with our the benefit of
being an office together things like
that but I think we managed now there's
been some other mods that have had a
commercial success most notably
counter-strike or day of defeat is this
something that you're pursuing
professionally professionally I don't
think this is something I want to take
anywhere but as a side thing I think
it's great and I really enjoyed doing it
but there definitely are people in the
mountain community who want to take this
to the next level and become game
developers so what would you say to any
aspiring game developers just find a
program and comfortable working with and
practice makes perfect
just just takes time really you'll get
the hang of it okay and as for a
goldeneyes source when can we expect to
see 'la a playable version of this right
now we're pushing for a Christmas
release a beta release for the public
and it's going to include a few maps
some weapons and character models and
what do you guys plan to include like
the final release I mean can we see some
of the more fun features of
double-oh-seven like that the paintballs
the slapstick and all that stuff is
gonna be in there it's just gonna be a
ball play awesome now you are able to
pull some strings you've got with you
here some exclusive game footage right
talked to a few people put together some
game footage and great so let's take a
look what are we seeing right here yeah
here is a brief run around of the back
zonal facility
just to give ear as an idea of what
we're trying to accomplish and what
we're working on you know it looks like
with the half-life 2 engine the
increased textures and everything it's
really making this game vivid and pop
but at the same time it looks like it's
pretty much staying true to the original
facility as far as I can remember it
yeah we're keeping it representing the
original in every aspect I mean it's no
different and this of course is just
Egyptian or I'm sure a lot of people
will recognize this already
it's Egyptian is one of our pretty much
finished up maps and it looks like
you've taken you know put your own
creative flavor in here with that little
pond of water
yeah the pond rapper added it we you
know we felt the the original Goldeneye
engine couldn't give enough life to the
to the map so we figured we'd add our
own little things and help it along give
it more life yeah definitely bringing
out of the old 1997 technology and
enabling you guys to make it a game that
I love my play yeah so Wow miss lighting
is absolutely gorgeous yeah half light
to really the engine really enables us
to give it a lot more life and feeling
than previously possible and it's great
yeah it's gonna be some great
multiplayer Aaron that looks amazing
thank you so much for coming on thank
you for the exclusive footage where can
anybody find more information about
Goldeneye source gonna find out more go
ahead and head over to www.hsn.com into
the silver screen this summer
Micra shaft Entertainment Group presents
Counter Strike ii spawning camping at a
theater near you harrison i was thinking
about that attack that we did last month
right the archives poison attack right
we were at the coffee shop and we were
on the Wi-Fi sniffing that guy's packets
and we could see all of it since message
communications in clear-text ring
passwords - right now I was thinking
there's some plug-ins for like game to
encrypt your stuff or Trillian yeah but
the problem with those is first of all
trillion is cracked and second of all
with game you have to have this this the
both clients have to have the same
plugin install right and that doesn't
encrypt all of your other traffic so
you're just specific why don't we let
everybody know what we use here to
encrypt our traffic and stay secure
while we're on unencrypted wireless
communication okay well we use a VPN
this is a Virtual Private Network and
that's basically a tunnel between you
and the server that's encrypted and
capsulated if you were to sniff at UMT
and garbage just a bunch of garbage now
we use Server 2003 here right but you
don't have to use Windows Server 2003
you can also do an XP right yeah that's
one of the most overlooked features of
Windows XP is there's actually a VPN
server built-in it's not as robust as
the Server 2003 but the only main
limitation is that you can only have one
concurrent user well for a home network
that's not too bad no it's not bad at
all I use it at work to come into the
home network and be able to get access
to my mp3s stream music if I don't have
my ipod on me cool well sure it's real
easy just open up network connections
and we create a new connection and we're
going to create an advanced connection
and accept incoming connections then
we're gonna skip that go to allow
virtual private connections we'll select
a user and then we'll click properties
on tcp/ip and this is where we specify
the IP range that we're going to assign
to the users that log into the system
but if you see XP that's not really
important because you only have one well
it's just important to have right so now
there's only one IP address that's going
to be used because it's one concurrent
connection next finish and the only last
step is to make sure that your port
forwarding in this case it's 1723
because it's point-to-point tunneling
protocol so just make sure you port
forward that to the router right to the
server
and then we've got our incoming
connection all right well what do we
have to do on the client in know the
client end can be Mac Linux Windows XP
Windows 2000 there was even a download
for Windows 98 and below really yeah so
what I've links all that in the show
notes okay and to do that in XP just
create new connection again and we're
going to do this we're going to choose a
network at my workplace VPN and then
give it a name I'm gonna call it home
and tell it not to dial an initial
connection because we're not on dial-up
I'm gonna give it the public IP address
public IP address or your dined DNS it
might have service like that and then
after that you just entering your
credentials so I'm going to give it my
username password and save that and
connect and there we go
well I'm Network and if we go over to
details you can see that we've been
assigned the IP address at 192 168 to
108 okay and that the server is on to
dot 100 so all I have to do is go to
backs this backslash the server's IP
address there you go there we go
sell the sheriff both right so now I can
access all of my stuff that I have
shared on my computer where you can also
do some pretty cool things as well like
for example you can access all of your
shared iTunes music and yeah and if
you've got an airport Express and you
can log in to your network and blast
your oh yeah I remain away with music on
the stereo that's a lot of fun when Wes
is home and not expecting it yeah so
this is a great thing to do and we
highly recommend it for anybody who's
planning on using unsecured wireless
networks today we're going to talk about
buffer overflow attacks
now buffer overflow attacks well the
most popular method for attackers to
perform arbitrary code execution now
arbitrary code execution in case you
don't know is where like let's say he
has a script or you know some code and I
have some code I'm gonna send my code to
his and basically like make some
happened so before we talk about all
that though I'm gonna go ahead and well
let's break it down and make it simple
and start off by explaining what exactly
a buffer is alright a buffer is
basically allocate a memory that a
programmer creates and uses so that he
can store and manipulate this data oh
yeah well so let's talk about this from
the hackers point of view basically we
got this buffer now we're gonna fill it
up and then continue to pass data to it
until it overflows data that overflows
has to go somewhere so it goes to an
adjacent or you know the next memory
slot and what that memory slot now we
have access to run our own code possibly
pass in some of our you know some
assembly or some C right that's also a
function that's assuming that the next
memory slot contains a function call or
executable code yeah that's what I just
said yeah what it is but you want to
make sure you want to make sure that you
really you know have a good idea of
where your code is going maybe it's not
the simplest thing in the world to do
but yeah let's think of a real-world
example so we have for example a
firewall and it's firmware okay so the
firmware has to accept the password and
make sure that it's valid so we're going
to write a piece of code or some
software that sends some sends the
password fills that buffer up then
continues passing data to that buffer
and after the password is is is filled
up assuming that the developer didn't
make a write a program to check you know
the size of the password we can write or
inject our own machine or assembly code
to manipulate what the program does from
there so we can get root access or you
know change users modify users change
the settings that sort of thing
now bring a great up example of you know
what languages do you actually use to do
these type of buffer overflow attacks
and I guess we'll go into lower level
level languages which is a
probably the best way to do it was
assembly and see that's and that's keep
in mind that's because see and assembly
C++ lower-level languages require that
the programmer managed the size of the
buffers and it doesn't necessarily make
them bad languages because they're very
powerful and very useful it just means
that they have to be very careful to
manage the size of their buffers right
but this language is like you know wisp
Lisp and Java and Perl okay great
examples of programming language that
actually allocate the memory through
compile
that's like runtime checking and Static
and now it's exactly so so I guess we'll
go into a live example of this isn't
actually do this this is an example that
we can all come we can all can relate to
because it has it'll be R so let's
assume that this glass right here is a
buffer and this is a buffer as well now
John is the malicious user Mallory right
you're Mallory the malicious user I'm
Mallory the malicious hacker I'm gonna
be Bob okay Bob and ugly function yeah
hey come on man they'll be too hard here
I'm the function that is going to be
calling this memory so what the data
that's in this memory spot so however
however okay this is the actual buffer
that we use for the actual login for
example this is the login this is though
this is the buffer that takes the
password right so so we're gonna go
ahead and pour some answer enter our
username and login and password blah
blah blah and then event give it Klunk
enemies blah blah blah ever gonna use a
blah blah blah okay then we're
eventually gonna go ahead oh that's it
some extra variable or extra extra input
and give him a little bit of extra see
the thing is not only that he spilled
beer on my fingers but he also passed
data into my buffer so me being the
function call in this buffer I have to
read it and see what I see you know see
what see what's in it sorry so now this
is when I actually take control of them
