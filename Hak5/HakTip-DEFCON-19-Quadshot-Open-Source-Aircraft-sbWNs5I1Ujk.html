carbonite already knew that the hackers
took over the airwaves as far as the RF
was concerned but I'm here with Peter
Peter dude
hackers are just getting into avionics
like crazy now what is this guy well
this is a new UAV platform it is
currently more RC airplane it can take
off vertically like a quadrocopter it
has four rotors just like those and then
it can transition into forward flight
and fly on the wing to you have longer
range and an end speed yes of course
sure what's your inspiration behind this
guy well I I was involved with
quadrocopters for many years before and
different projects and I was working for
a company that was doing bigger systems
like that and we went into an argument
like what is better a quadrocopter or an
airplane and we said like ok let's put
it both together put a wing on a on a
quadrocopter and get the best from both
world it's kind of like an osprey in the
fact that you know it does the anyway
that that's so fantastic what was your
like what is the niche for this though
are you try like is there a particular
are you going for speed are you going
for payload or what's the idea so so for
now it is more like RC RC toys so so
that we explore this this frame and we
also have one version with a very
powerful autopilot so it is a great
thing for researchers that basically we
want to see what people come up with
okay so what kind of payload would you
have on like this guy right here and
it's about one pound
I feel like enough for like a Wi-Fi
pineapple
okay cool so uh what about the range the
battery how do you operate this and you
were yeah so it has a lithium polymer
battery and it has endurance of around
fifteen minutes you can put also a
second battery if you compromise the
amount of payload and then you get to
twenty five minutes flight time so we
were flying it in racetracks for about
six miles so that's okay and I see that
you also have a camera mounted on one of
these systems here is that part of the
autopilot and how does that work and so
we have a camera gimbal on on the other
airframe and that is compensating pitch
when when the device is flying so it is
stabilized and so that you don't get
sick when you're flying it so the we
have a telemetry camera with direct to
video linked to the ground so you
theoretically can fly it
first-person so you could basically sit
in the airplane we also flying it with
GoPros and other cameras so you can get
really nice HD footage from air in from
like beautiful perspectives even flying
to somewhere where the way it is
difficult to reach that you want to see
the waterfall or something and so I
could imagine that this is exciting for
you know hackers videographers anyone
seems like kind of a general purpose
platform how did this is like what
revision is this and what did the first
one look like computer disasters
eventually happened to everyone but if
you get carbonite online backup
beforehand you'll be worryfree because
your files will be backed up
automatically and safely off-site and
it's really easy to get them back plus
you can get anytime anywhere access to
your backed up files from any computer
or on your smartphone or iPad with the
free Carbonite app with Carbonite
unlimited backup for your pc or mac is
just $59 ears that's less than five
bucks a month but if you use the offer
code hak5 to start your free 15 day
trial you get two months free if you
decide to buy all the details
over at carbonite.com and remember to
use the offer code hak5 to get two
months free with purchase this is
exciting for you know hackers
videographers anyone seems like kind of
a general purpose platform how did this
is like what revision is this and what
did the first one look like oh this is
this is already the 11th iteration of
the airframe the wing is the ninth the
ninth wing so we made different
approaches so this on our team this is
of course a team effort
so we have our era engineer on our team
that is really great and optimize the
wing and and we went to get it really
really right and be very stable so it is
also when the motors fail it is it is
self stable so you can glide down on the
wing and save your payload nice we also
like saw something's like pushing it
around and it kind of like compensates
for that how does it do that well there
is an autopilot on it it's it's a
paparazzi Lisa M autopilot
it's an STM 32 microcontroller so a
32-bit chip that does has an IMU on it
so it so what is an IMU it's a
combination of 3-axis gyroscope the
three axis accelerometer and also three
axis magnetometer we also have a
pressure sensor on the system this is
not particularly a part of an IMU as as
such but this way you can measure the
altitude you are on and control that too
and since you know the speed and pitch
and everything else you can maintain
stable flight without the need for GPS
and well if so steady flight yes but you
don't know your position so you cannot
do a completely autonomous flight
although the hardware supports a GPS so
you can hook up a GPS to this too so
that would work is this a system that
you're commercializing okay so basically
we want to bring it to as many hands as
possible so yes we have a Kickstarter
projects currently to pay for the molds
to injection mode the wing and what is
the material here and this is EPP this
is
expanded polypropylene so this doesn't
weigh much at all no it's just weighs
700 grams with battery and everything so
if somebody were to go out and get in on
Kickstarter what would it take to get
something like out of the box where you
can already start flying and throwing
ridiculous payloads on and so we have a
Kickstarter special it's $300 how long
is that going to it is still going for
another four weeks
Oh wonderful didn't - I can't wait to
get it and you guys are Bay Area so we
have to come by and see this stuff I
think this is fantastic it's really
amazing to see how hackers get into all
of the other you know the systems and
subsystems I mean flight is really just
another hack within itself so I'm stoked
to see when this launches how you know
how creative the community is going to
get with it thank you so much thank you
for having me and now where can people
find the website it is a liquid shot
comm all right thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
