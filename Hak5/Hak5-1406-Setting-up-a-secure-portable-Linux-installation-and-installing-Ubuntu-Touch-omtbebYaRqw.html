Ubuntu touch in setting up the ultimate
fast secure portable and persistent
Linux installation all that and more of
this time on hack 5 this episode of hack
5 is brought to you by domain.com hey
everybody and welcome to this week's
episode of hack 5 this is your weekly
dose of everything techno lost worthy
and this is greg no it's not well does
he want to be on the show doesn't he
look cute look at his shawl he's
adorable
you can't a little glam pop on us so
cool hi I know that's a terrible lunch
mm-hm so how are you I'm good
it's so weird having you back in studios
and a girl from that weird dude oh my
god this weekend I went to Alcatraz and
the guy he turned to me and he was like
hey do you do hack 5 and I was just like
yes and then we took a picture oh it was
so cool it was kind of exciting you know
what actually to happen so the guy in
point Richmond who came up to me in the
market the other day I was like hey man
I like witty response no I'm from hack
sex and then you were just all like oh
oh and then ran off
oh no it wasn't being a douche I was
just playing around oh that's so neat
yeah okay well anyway what's up hey I am
so excited because I just discovered
this thing called it went to touch its
Ubuntu's new like mobile interface thing
already this is the boot on the Nexus
right but no it's different it's totally
different like you know that one was
kind of Jane it was crap yeah it was
been the one thing that I liked about it
was that I could plug in a USB you know
flower you know they're getting into the
new cell phones they're trying to come
up with like a whole mobile OS this is
kind of like their first installation of
it on a whole bunch of different Android
phones and mobile
let's pour conical they're going through
so many growing pains and PR nightmares
and not transparent and with stuff and
they just I I wish them the best because
I do because it only it takes big names
to keep Linux going I mean remember
Novell like in the 90s keeping this
thing going so it's very important that
Canonical's keeps putting money and
momentum behind you know stuff like this
and they're also awesome stuff with
Google and the Linux kernel so yes very
cool however unity has some growing
pains and I think it may be some time
before things feel quite right quite
like they used to
they're just not it's still baking yeah
a little little it's a little in the
oven yeah it's a little flat so they
just need to bake it a little bit longer
maybe like five minutes preheat 350 yeah
yeah exactly so what are you up to today
I am getting the ultimate Linux
installation on oh wow I don't didn't
even bring it in I see this isn't the
Linux installation I can't even bring it
in as an example because it's too heavy
I talked about that machine you're in
lenovo and you know what i love the
machine because it runs Linux so
beautifully yeah and I hate this machine
because it doesn't right that's only
because of some some quirks with the
RAID controller and all that stuff
anyway point being what we're setting up
here now is a dual boot configuration
except we are not using hard drive we're
going to just use flash memory and
that's going to allow us to have a lot
of ease and flexibility and we're also
going to make it secure enough to cross
a border oh that's awesome
I'm so excited well we have a ton to get
into today so how will we go ahead and
start off the show man all right well
I'm going to go ahead and get into it
without further ado if you want to check
back later and we'll get your blue to e
stuff on well do all right so check this
out a little bit of backstory hack
across Europe it'll kind of spawned out
of the fact that I was asked by the ITU
to attend their worldwide
telecommunications Policy Forum in
Geneva kind of an epic opportunity
couldn't really say no so the long short
of it is that the United Nations is
making play for Internet governance and
after stuff really hit the fan @w ICT
and Dubai last December they started
embracing what they call the
multi-stakeholder model anyway along
layman's term for that is basically they
let the hacker in anyway all of this
prompted a new laptop because both of my
boxes have significant issues well
namely one of them this one runs Windows
and the other one will run an
unencrypted Linux distro in fact it's 12
moon to 12.10 which I'm kind of over
sorry Ubuntu it's you not me and there
and the big the biggest problem is that
they're both rockin the obligatory
hacker stickers which is just like
sticks out like a sore thumb at border
crossings and it's it's because of that
reason that I was really concerned and
making myself something secure something
fast and so we're gonna do something now
for that portable style so I'm about to
combine three elements for the perfect
fast portable and secure Linux
installation so firstly I want it
portable so it'll so I'll be installing
it onto a USB Drive and you know not on
the the laptop itself hard internal hard
drive that's just gonna make things
easier if I move from machine to machine
and you know not booting from a live USB
because that's that's easy I can just
show you a unit Boonton but there so in
the disk and the boot up and there it is
rather we're getting to actually install
it to a USB Drive as if it were a
regular hard drive and so this means
that we're going to have we're gonna
treat it just like any other
installation which means no need for
special partitions or other kind of
workarounds to make it persistent
meaning our files and everything is
still there when we reboot now why USB
this is the crux of it sadly this
machine has a horrid software raid that
makes it absolutely a pain they asked to
try dual booting or anything like that
and as much as I hate Windows I guess
philosophically for reasons of like
editing I mean I need Photoshop and
illustrator and Premiere and and After
Effects and all those things and SimCity
so I'm gonna need Windows now I suspect
though that a fast and roomy USB Drive
will be enough to get away with having a
persistent and portable install on a USB
3 Drive now second as I said I'm going
to be using a USB 3 Drive and I'll do
some benchmarking first so that we can
actually see if we're going to get an
ideal perform
increase out of that you see my last
install was actually on one of these a
SanDisk Cruiser fit at 32 gigabytes and
while itsy-bitsy I love these because
they just kind of disappear when plugged
into a machine
it was slow as all get-out and so for
this I'm going to ahead and replace the
whole shebang with a Kingston HyperX
Drive 64 gigs this guy is highly rated
and so we'll see if it will in fact do
the trick now third I really want a what
I really want is that you moon to based
install because I love apt and I don't
know if I'm on my way to Debian or to
Arch but whatever it may be
unity is totally failing me and what I
want is mint because it's easy and it
supports full disk encryption and we're
going to be you know you're talking
about border crossings even if you're
not crossing borders how what you should
be doing is is encrypting all the things
no matter what they are and I don't want
anybody poking around my sheet machine I
feel comfortable with full disk
encryption and so what's the worst that
could happen somebody denies you access
to a country because you didn't let them
look poke around your laptop or image or
drive anyway let's go ahead and see the
speed difference here that's our first
bit I'm going to go ahead and format
this disc I just plugged in the Kingston
I'll label this
and we're going to make it NTFS even
though that's not the filesystem we will
use when it's all said and done I do
want this comparison to be legit so I
have two drives plugged in one of them
is the new Kingston FASTA and the other
one is a SanDisk cruiser fit so we're
going to use this application here HD
speed to kind of get an idea of the
speed difference in these and let's go
ahead and elevate our privileges after
it scans the drive this is a nice little
utility it's only ninety kilobytes so
you really can't go wrong with that love
portableapps
yes scanning drives again let's go ahead
and choose the Kingston Drive here I'm
going to tell it to benchmark for
fifteen seconds we're going to do a read
and write test and this is going to be
sustained in bytes per second we're not
doing a birth rate or anything so go
ahead and hit start and it's going to
say hey since we're writing to it we're
going to destroy the contents of it we
actually want you to type destroy data
to confirm that you really want to do
that
and there we go that was a quick
15-second test and I can see my average
is 47 megabytes per second if I do like
a read test I was getting previously
about 60 megabytes per second so so far
so good for the Kingston I think that'll
be fine for an operating system
especially something as lightweight as
mint or as lightweight as it can be
let's try the other drive
so the same test and yes
yeah that wasn't so good not even a
tenth of the bandwidth now I've actually
had an installation on the SanDisk
before and it was slow but I will say it
was bearable and so my suspicion is now
with the faster Drive this will actually
be quite responsive we're gonna find out
as far as installing what we're going to
need is first of all a live version of
whatever the district is casement 14 for
me already on USB or cd-rom if you rock
those so I'm going to go ahead and
reboot off of this
now we're here in our Linux Mint live
USB and the first thing that we're going
to want to do is enable Lux full disk
encryption so Lux stands for Linux
Unified key setup and it's a platform
independent descriptive specification
most notably in Linux and unfortunately
while Lux is natively offered in the
latest Ubuntu installers it's not so
much in mint 14 which is awesome but
anyway this is easy enough to fix
simply by upgrading the installer before
you and start installing that makes any
sense
so booted up on our USB Drive all we
need to do now is open up the terminal
make that bigger for you guys and I've
already connected to the Wi-Fi and I
want to do a sudo apt-get remove
ubiquity
now we do a sudo apt-get update
a sudo apt-get install ubiquity
now we plug in our USB Drive that we
actually want to install to in this case
the Kingston
it'll fit next to the HDMI port oh man
well that was fun make sure before you
do a demo on act 5 you check the width
of your HDMI cable and make sure it's
not obstructing your only two USB K
thanks yeah what was it doing again oh
right so now all we need to do that
we've updated ubiquity and plugged in
our our drive in fact if we come over
here to say disk we will see there is
our kingston drive and it is in slash
dev slash SD e all we have to do is
start ubiquity so i'm just going to do
sudo ubiquity
and we're in the installer so of course
English sounds good
and we're going to say yes install the
third-party software I know I know I'm
that guy
we're not plugged into power that's
gonna be fine I don't want to bother
doing the updates right now doing the
install just to make things quicker
and we're going to choose guided and
we're going to do the entire disk setup
encryption with LVM and so this is the
part for the lux with all the happy
goodness and we give it a password and
it's going to here ask us for the drive
and this is where things get wonky with
my raid in fact it's not even showing
all of the crazy devices it shows up as
in Linux but we're going to make sure we
choose our destination which is the
Kingston and not my internal hard drive
and
standard questions here set up our user
some people say don't bother with the
password I say do obviously even if you
are going to use encryption or no it's
not don't bother with the password some
people disable the the login screen
because you've obviously already
bypassed the encryption screen which
will be every time you boot up your
machine you will have to enter your
encryption key to decrypt to the hard
drive in this case the USB Drive and
then actually get into the machine you
could make your life a little easier by
disabling the login I don't bother
and we don't need to check encrypt my
home folder because we've already
encrypted the entire hard drive so we're
just going to require the password you
can choose login automatically if you'd
like
now mint makes this very easy you really
just select the drive in this case the
USB and say install if you are doing
this with another distribution namely
Ubuntu all you really have to do is in
the you know choose what does it not
replace Windows or alongside Windows you
choose something else and then from
there you'll actually see a partition
manager where you can select three Drive
like I said in this case it was SD II is
going to differ based on your machine so
check Disk Utility first of course and
then really it's just a matter of
formatting it as an ext4 filesystem in
that case you just really need to choose
what your mount point is and in this
case you'll want to choose slash it may
complain if you don't create a partition
for swap space it's pretty safe to
ignore if you have enough RAM this
thing's got like 8 gigs so I'm not too
worried about it but either way if you
feel comfortable with it otherwise you
can always go back later with say
gparted and add more partitions but that
is the basis for setting up a encrypted
portable installation on installation
minute it has gotten so much easier over
the years now to actually go ahead and
do this so at this point I'm going to
say continue testing wait for this to
exit out and then we will reboot into
our new OS
so I've rebooted off my USB and as you
can see all it does is ask me for my
encryption
and there we go SDE Crips setup
successful so that's pretty much it I
like that this gives me the ability to
have an encrypted and portable Linux
distribution for when I need it on this
machine which is most of the time that
I'm not doing anything like gaming or
Photoshop
sorry GIMP it's just it's not me but
otherwise I want to hear your feedback
what do you guys think is this is a good
solution for you what are the kind of
workarounds have used in the case of
just wonky machines when you need to get
your Linux on and how do you feel about
Lux encryption on your distribution hit
us up as always feedback at hak5 org and
when we get back I know it's more Linux
when we get back Shannon's going to be
into touching this thing how are you
gonna touch it what are you gonna just
show me where you will be back budding
entrepreneurs startups and innovators
everywhere are turning their ideas into
realities and it's all backed by one
awesome TLD you know I'm talking abouts
dotnet it's the domain name with global
recognition it's one of the most popular
extensions in the world and the domain
name injects your business with instant
credibility entrepreneurs and startups

so you might remember way back in like
early January when we did hack 5 episode
12 20 and it was the whole episode where
I talked about downloading and running
Ubuntu 12.10 on the Nexus 7 which is now
1304 now it was kind of janky it was a
little crappy and to be honest he had to
like plug in a keyboard and external
into your Nexus and the keyboard was
tiny on the screen and well pretty much
everything was tiny on the screen well
today we're checking out a bunt whose
touch version for the Nexus brand this
is Ubuntu's brand new operating system
that they first reached out to
developers about back in January and
this version is now being ported on to
all sorts of Nexus devices including the
Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus 4 the 7 and
the 10 now at the time of recording they
did say on their website that there's
about 30 plus other different ones that
a boot to touch will work on but these
are exactly compatible yet they're kind
of you know there in the forums people
have been working on them they're not
completely ready at this point but this
is the main installation guide that you
want to follow if you have a Nexus Nexus
device and you're ready to you know
check it out and maybe start some
development for some new applications so
let's go ahead and get started the first
thing that you want to do with this is
to actually install the Ubuntu touch
installer repositories and these are the
ones that only work on the Galaxy Nexus
so you're just going to sudo apt-get
those sudo apt-get and this is called
the
just gonna copy this from the website
it's so much easier that way
you
repository tools putting your password
of course then you press ENTER to add it
basically you just want to follow the
on-screen instructions after that you
want to do sudo apt-get update
the apt-get enos awesome and then you
want to install and I love that they
call it this the phablet tools Android
tools ADB and then Android tools for
fastboot so I'll go ahead and get those
and it tells me that I've already
downloaded all of these because I did
previously try to install this to make
sure I wasn't going to Bork it during
the recording so I've already got that
the next thing you want to do is unlock
it now if you already have a nexus
pre-installed with the original Nexus 7
of fastboot then your Nexus 7 is
probably already unlocked but if it's
not I'm gonna go ahead and run through
these directions so there's a locked
bootloader on the original Android
device the software on the Nexus 7
this can be unlocked by first rebooting
the Nexus 7 so you hold down the power
button so I'm on my welcome screen
because I previously installed it on
here you just powered it down
and then once it's powered down you hold
the volume button down which is found on
the side and hit the power button again
hold both of these down until you see a
fastboot mode which looks like this and
now you want to plug it into your laptop
so you're going to run a command to
actually unlock this guy so let me plug
it into my laptop there we go
make sure that's on the screen cool
alright and I'm going to verify that
fastboot does see the device on here
hello fastboot so we have fastboot and
now we need to type in sudo fastboot OEM
unlock
and then it's going to sell you either
the bootloader is already unlocked if
you already have it unlocked or it'll
say it's unlocking it and they'll give
you an OK when it's done it only takes a
couple of seconds either way so once
fastboot has already unlocked your
device over here on your Nexus you're
going to see it come up and say hey do
you really want to unlock this and you
just press ok and it'll reboot and then
you should see this screen right here
now down here and really really small
print it tells you that the fastboot is
unlocked it'll say let's see I can
barely see it lock state unlocked so
once you have that complete you know
that your Nexus 7 has been unlocked so
you can now move on to the next step
alright now on my computer again so now
I want to make sure your fastboot does
see the device so sudo fastboot devices
and it does so I only have one device
plugged into my laptop I know that that
fastboot device is in fact my Nexus 7
now we can actually start installing and
our Nexus on our Android device so this
is the fun part so you want to follow
these initial steps on your device to
make sure that it's all prepared and
ready to go
in Android they do have this option
under development developer mode to do
USB debugging you want to find this in
your setting so get on here I'm starting
up Android on the device
okay so to get into your settings which
you probably already know how to do you
click on settings at the top and then
you want to go all the way down and find
about tablet so you click on that and
you want to look for the Android build
number which is down at the very bottom
now this is in Android 4.2.2 the reason
I'm doing this is because well it's
because of costs
sothanks costs you kind of you made it
jelly bean and pay attention to what you
were doing way to go dude
so down here you click on build number
and you want to click on it seven times
I in developer note you are now aid
developers so it tells me I'm now a
developer so I can go back so now at the
bottom I can see developer options which
is a new option on here I want to click
on USB debugging and then just click OK
so this enables you to actually
basically send data through this cable I
can debug it I can put applications on
here I can hack the thing to death which
is super super fun so on your computer
you're going to run a really quick
command because Android 4.2.2 needs you
to accept this host key on the actual
device so if you already have a DB
installed you can do the following on
your workstation you put in ADB and then
type in kill server semicolon ADB start
server
Damon started successfully awesome let
me go ahead and clear that out so once
you've done the unlocking on your
machine and once you've started this
into developer USB debugging you want to
plug it into your computer via the cable
down at the bottom and depending on your
installed version of Android a pop ups
going to show up on the screen and it's
gonna give you this nice little host key
and you want to just go ahead and say
yes that is the computer that I do want
to communicate with my workstation so
you click OK and then you're good to go
some yeah thanks cause thanks Derek so
now you can actually deploy Ubuntu touch
so for this it's a very easy command you
just run fablet which i think is
hilarious still flash tak b and then
press enter
so right now it's telling me a whole
bunch of times this file is already
fully retrieved nothing to do but the
first time that you run it it's actually
going to show you a taskbar and it's
going to download all of the different
device files that it needs to download
to actually flash everything that it
needs to onto the device this whole step
all of the different statuses and all
the different things that it has to go
through are going to take you fully
about 10 to 15 minutes and once that is
done you'll actually see your Android
device reboot into the unity shell and
it might look a little funny if you're
used to the regular Ubuntu 12.04 or
13-point o 4 on your Nexus 7 because
this one's entirely mobile and made for
touchscreens so we're gonna go ahead and
wait for this to download everything
that it needs go ahead and flash the
device and once that's done we'll check
out Ubuntu touch
Donna
okay so once it's completed it should
actually boot into the bun to touch
screen device operating system you'll
notice that it's a little bit dark but
and you also see this little circle
right here now you would think that Tek
actually get into your profile you would
just you know click somewhere in this
thing and that doesn't really work you
have to slide in from the side and
that's what we see so this is their
touch interface it's completely
different from the regular Boone to that
I'm sure you're used to on your computer
there's about five different pages that
you can go to the home one is in the
middle obviously and they also have a
whole bunch of apps pre-installed to
give you an idea of what they look like
now unfortunately a lot of these apps
are kind of broken right now because
this is a Developer Preview so they
don't quite work yet but this will give
you a nice idea of what they would look
like on your actual profile screen I can
go into a couple of different things for
example I can go into the camera and
you'll notice that doesn't really do
much there's nothing nothing happening
so you can tell that it's still in
Developer Preview unfortunately but they
are working on it they're getting there
on the side we also have our apps over
here there we go and you can highlight
and move up and down and choose
whichever one you want to go to if I
want to click home it'll take me back to
my home option and it has this nice
little interface for your favorite
people if you want to add people to the
screen and call them very quickly you
can also move up and down and notice I
have like favorite music on here all of
this is just their example that came pre
downloaded on the system you can scroll
down and view all of your contacts all
of these contacts are hopefully fake or
those are real phone numbers in here and
then we have another music page on here
so they're definitely going for a very
very ease of use with this I do hope
that they include a lot of the a lot of
the things that we really like about
Ubuntu how how you can you can root
devices really easily and things like
that and I hope that they continue
development with this and they do
include a
brand-new interface for it that actually
works with all the apps that are
pre-installed in it because I can't wait
to check it out some more I think it
works really fluid with the current
Nexus 7 that I'm using I really like
that it's very responsive and there's no
real lag issues so it definitely it
really uses the processor really well on
this Nexus 7 now if you did try this out
and you didn't like it very much or you
think okay well this Developer Preview
obviously isn't for me and you don't
want to just have your Nexus 7 sitting
there forever you can go to a mbutu's
website where they state you can restore
Android now actually I actually used
their really really old directions about
this where they say you can download a
tar file from google.com which has the
original Nexus software on it and you
basically just put your Nexus 7 back
into fastboot mode you want to change
your directory to wherever those files
from the tar are and then you just flash
SH and you can ignore all the warnings
that come up and it basically just takes
another 10 minutes or so and then you're
back to your regular OAM version of your
device and you can also download the
original image from your device if you
don't want to lose all of your settings
and all of your original profile and
whatnot from the Nexus 7 before you
actually put Ubuntu on there so with all
that said I hope you guys really enjoyed
it I did I had a lot of fun checking
this out and I I kind of liked the abou
to touch interface so I want to kind of
stick this on a phone and start calling
people and seeing how it works with you
know actually social social networking
and engaging with other people with it
but for now we're going to go ahead and
end this segment with a nice little hack

couple of times you know double piu and
I'll see you on the other side yeah

show today but I wanted to go ahead and
