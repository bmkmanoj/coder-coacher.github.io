hackerspace and the portland brain silo
this segment of pack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com frack across America damn
kitchen here on May twenty-fourth at the
Eugene hackerspace let's check it out
alright so this is our main entryway or
kind of small office wherever sort of a
3d printer station so you got the thing
ematic right here which is printing what
do you predict keychain handy a keychain
key chain that has a pocket inside for
rfid tag now with that it that's what
this is a test bed of it yeah and
basically rfid tag in the keychain so
you
rub it on the phone and launcher
application this one just you know goes
into the gps application okay so so this
is kind of where most of our members do
the 3d printing prototyping stuff like
that this is our electronics bench here
we got a whole bunch of different basic
components resistors capacitors pair
oscilloscope soldering station all that
stuff then here's kind of the main shop
where i will start over here I guess
normally this base open this was our
project for our contest we did it's a
target shooting range or you shoot the
target to flip around it brings the
bells and that was pretty fun step right
up the game is free so I need a lot of
volume I'm ever gonna turn a profit this
is our member storage wall so everything
we try to give all our members storage
space so that they can keep some of
their projects here um we're getting so
many members down on the walls
incredibly full that everyone gets a bin
that's all that is all these parts a lot
of this stuff came from an electronics
company electrons copy that went out of
business that's actually where i got the
shelves so these are all like spare
parts left over from project stuff like
that that people just throw on the wall
so all our members can just benefit from
all the leftover scraps aren't we good
see this is actually project i'm working
with a couple people we're gonna be a
vacuum forming table so you can put an
object on here sheet of plastic lift it
up it heats up and then you suck it
it'll stretch over an object turn on a
vacuum it sucks it right down that's
going to be pretty cool once that's done
this is a mill / wave that I've never
used someone brought in recently is one
of our newest tools that somebody's
lending to us so people can do some
machining what's this up here oh
is an air rocket launcher that Kevin
built so it's actually on a swivel arm
so you can kind of change the angle it's
got a double barrel we can attach to it
but you make these rockets at a paper
template that we actually found from
Make Magazine and you will bring it to
like make your fair and stuff we have a
lot of kids they'll make these rockets
out of paper in like 10-15 minutes and
then they launch like 100 200 feet in
the air and it's all air powered so
that's pretty cool Wow a little bit more
sophisticated than a potato cannon yeah
although that's what that is that one
right above it is the air power to ya
got the community fridge this is kind of
our wood area most of this stuff is
gotta go to recycling to the Senate some
of this some of this is gotta get snacks
back over there but that's why it's kind
of messy right now really just got so
much scrap stuff to get rid of but it's
kind of where we have our woodworking
tools most of our power tools that we
want out most of the time we got more
basic power tool stuff like that this
was probably the first piece French we
had here a couple of us built this one
night so so that was a really sturdy
table this is where I set up this
welding boots so that I could build that
vacuum forming table so these curtains
can come out you can kind of isolate
yourself and checked everyone else's
eyes and then you can it's like our
chops I'd cut it and then you can do
your welding or whatever you gotta do
here for all your metalworking i'll tell
you all the welding supplies here and
then this collapses back so you can save
this space because we're kind of cramped
than you think um yeah I've stereo and
I'm really that interesting
we have a server rack case anyone does
want to do some kind of computer-related
packing right now no one's been using
you we're gonna host our website the
server was just too loud and then up top
he's called the pickup art and that's
basically it's like most of what's up
there's old electronics like printers
and routers things like that that our
members had in their garage and because
they were new they're going to use apart
from it someday but never did and so now
we put it all here so whenever work on a
project we need something not quite sure
what you go up there and usually you can
find something you need I mean that's
basically the tool that's our space in a
nutshell although we're currently
looking for a bigger space because we've
got about twenty eight members now and
there's just not enough for I mean you
can see how cramped it even with these
many people in here how long have you
guys been around we let's see a little
over a year well we've had the space for
about a year and a half but our grand
opening was about a little over a year
ago 14 15 months ago so in that time
we've grown pretty good so we're looking
for a bigger space yeah what were some
of the challenges and just open this
space the first challenge it's a chicken
and egg problem with maker spaces right
you need you need a space to bring
people but you need money to get a space
and you need people to have money so
it's big circle so what we did was we
got about five people who could each
afford about a hundred dollars a month
and we said okay we can all afford hard
dollars a month for six months will
guaranteed let's just get a place with
six month lease that cost five hundred
dollars a month that's what this space
is and for the first half yeah it was
let's say wow come to Oregons yes this
is 600 bucks a month that this was
little less than 500 plus utilities um
it's about a thousand square feet so at
first there's plenty of room for our
five of us so we got yeah we got our six
months lease and as soon as we got the
space I think our membership double
because I met one guy who knew five guys
and once they could come and see that
there's something here they all brought
in all these tools and it was like okay
now we've got tools double the members
and then it was like every month we gain
one or two
members and so we had about 15 and then
it kind of leveled out for about half a
year over the summer time we get a lull
in the summer because in Eugene rains a
lot in the winter so in the summer comes
everyone's gone so kind of had a low and
then just this winter we doubled again
we're almost at 30 and we're finally
breaking even so now we don't have to
pay any extra on top of our membership
dues anymore so once you have people and
tools and a space and then money what do
you need with ness people tool space and
then you make this yeah boy I want space
okay that's a hard thing it is that
we're at the we have this thing where
you know our do sir twenty-five dollars
a month or two pretty low for a cur
space terms the problem is once you get
enough money to pay for the space you
now have too many people for that space
and now we have to get a bigger space
and go back or we're not enough yeah
back in the day I had this problem in
Sin City and then I'm saying we want to
see them until I built the mysterium and
I went bankrupt because it costs too
much to run Stadium yeah it's the same
problem again the steward don't build
the mysterium right um yeah that I would
say that's the hardest thing when you're
starting what we did the very first
thing we did was we form a non-profit
got a bank account and that way we could
accept donations and things and put it
in a gaming company account was that
process like because you formed the
501c3 before you had numbers and a space
so we did we reserve maybe like two or
three of us I got together and we did we
did filing your articles of
incorporation actually filing with the
state is actually pretty easy and I
think it was like fifty or hundred
dollars a year to do that the hard part
was writing the bylaws which I would say
cliff probably did most of the work on
that we took another group took another
groups bylaws as a template and then
heavily modified them and we met every
week or every other week just to kind of
go over what do we think about this one
we think about this one because we want
to make sure that when the group started
we had a good rule set to work from we
had we knew how things should be run at
least from the organizational standpoint
so we got all those together before that
took probably five to six months really
to get through all that but if you
weren't as paranoid you know you could
really put together some basic bylaws or
borrow someone else's and get going like
that it sounds like you did a vehicle
source way and you just for some yeah
well yeah I was yeah we did it totally
did so we got we got the organization
filed the state and then we finished the
bylaws and then we got the group we got
the house five guys together to look for
a space and that took about four or five
months over the summer for us to
actually find a space for you to for
those big enough so what's the average
day at the makerspace like the average
well it's I share our average day to be
we have open hack nights on Tuesdays and
Fridays where we're open to the public
and those are most busiest sort of
regular nights and so the 3d printer is
pretty pretty popular so usually there's
somebody printing and someone else who
wants to print and can't because it's
already in use you know generally
somewhat often find someone on the
oscilloscope a lot of people just come
in and they're just hanging out talking
about what their what they want to do or
what they're doing at home even and then
that's its other than that there's not a
lot that's always the same I mean it
depends on who's working on what was
there anything that you weren't
expecting that happened that they're
kind of surprised to you after creating
it and then all of a sudden these people
that show up and who are these people
and suddenly you have a space and people
are here hacking away stuff I was I was
on stage surprised at how quickly it did
grow and it i guess i should say I'm
surprised that there are these really
good bumps of growth I sort of expected
to be more linear we get a member to
every month but it was really like there
was just bump only first got the space
then we kind of low there's another
small bump and it was like a low and
then just this winter it was like
doubled in ice kind of suspect once we
find a little bigger space move our
tools there we get more stuff in it's
gonna probably explode again
or I dislike was like the old fish tank
very good to go to gold fish tanks a
bigger the goes out yeah I'm hoping
that's what will happen anyway because
we're gonna need more members to support
a bigger space man thank you for your
give me one yes I should come working
people find out about the space yeah WWD
Eugene maker space com that's our main
website so just head there check it out
we've got a wiki we've got mailing lists
and then this yeah animates I we're on
facebook man check it out alright thanks
so we're here in an industrial side of
Portland where we're going to check out
brain silo it's kind of a difficult
place to find if you've never been
before that I was told just find the
alleyway with motorcycles and just be up
here on the left Hong a bad space ah
maybe like four or five months now by
originally founded by complete happens
chance I had never found this place
except that I started getting to 3d
printing and I went through this service
called shapeways where hbu sent him your
models they print it send it back and
they were having a world meet update and
apparently the person that was hosting
Portland's did it here in the brain silo
and so I showed up to that and was you
know and in that whole meetup thing and
then I realized I was like wait this is
a place this is somewhere I can keep
going and I've I've been coming here
ever since it's amazing like I've like I
walked in here there's like oh my god
there's a 3d printer that's the first
thing I saw and then I realized holy cow
this is this is really cool and like I
went yet if there's all the hardware I
could ever want here for anything we've
been working on uh mostly I'm 3d
printing stuff but whenever I need to
work on anything else like I've rebuilt
two or three computers out of just
random here and because you can see we
have much hardware to nickel space so
how did this pace come about
uh you might have to answer that
question yeah so I've only been here
since about December so our fearless
leader is away on work he works on DC
and he does important stuff for network
security so a lot of brain sailors
intentions were to be focused around
network security but we have all these
great tools so in our when I came here
we had three or four people that were
meeting constantly every week on
Thursdays from then since then i should
say we've four nights a week that we
come we hang out we do 3d modeling on
tuesdays do open house on thursdays and
then we go and attack the city with Roiz
on Fridays no taxes is version Simpson
who throws oh dude well the throw is the
cool thing is you know we could just
kind of put them in the plastic and all
that jazz but I'm here I gotta keep you
like a magnetic ones oh yeah I've got
some notice oh there we go throw he's an
action all stuck up there there so this
is my my light up box gets a lot of
people's attention because they're like
Tron oh my god and then I got a bunch of
neodymium that I got off ebay this came
straight from China so if you've ever
been there if you haven't I don't know
but I got there magnets I got a bunch of
jazz in here I have liked it to go kit
so i can just going to throw it in the
pocket hit the max and hand these out to
screaming children to make their parents
love them more shrink tubing is what i
used to bind them all together so when
you buy in bulk you can get the
batteries a thousand 498 bucks from some
distributor in florida off of ebay and I
mean a thousand batteries hundred bucks
that's like a whole year of fun it's a
lot of fun a lot so so each throw e
compiles of about 4 cents worth of
materials it's like throwing a nickel at
somebody every time so if you have a
nickel to spare you know to light up
somebody's day it's it's pretty awesome
just show me what it takes to to light
up somebody's day we build one yeah yeah
I I like making these flashy ones and I
like putting resistors on there just to
make them more complicated resistors
totally not needed I take take the the
long pen that's the positive wrap this
around here with nimble fingers if you
don't have them so what are you wrapping
wrapping a just like a 1k resistor
something yeah so you got a product
pretty simple and then on new batteries
this time they came prepackaged I hate
packaging I emailed the guy and I said
no packaging next time just give me
those stupid white sheets and but
basically you got a throwie these throw
ease are about a point 4 or 5 cents
apiece so you bout to for a penny and
when you buy them about 200 of time I
can get a cheaper if I bought more but I
was just experimenting these I'm sure
you can't see it but if you can there's
a tiny little chip in there that flashes
an RGB so there's no like arguing no
necessary and these are annoying because
you throw these up on a two story window
ledge it's going to take a week at least
before some maintenance
dudes goes up there and pulls them down
so if you're trying to just mess with
people that's fun or if you give them
the children just tell them not to eat
them because magnets magnets are bad for
you apparently if you eat two of them
and have them stuck in your intestines
and they'll kill you so don't do that
also you'll have to get your stomach
pumps from the battery so don't don't
eat batteries but these are the things
that people have told me why I'm such a
horrible person for buying a thousand
throw ease and distributing of people
they say you're going to kill some chill
child and you're going to feel bad for
it but you know what there's there's my
policies so what do you putting on it
now this is shrink tubing I typically
you would apply heat to this but I don't
recommend that because you're going to
mess with the battery or the message a
magnet your MSP led so you just live a
magnet in between created like a little
sandwich yeah yeah little sandwich with
two or three two CMOS battery one very
cheap LED from China one very cheap free
at in fact they send these for free when
you buy LEDs I and then the shrink
tubing believe it or not the expensive
part of this product is the magnet and
the shrink tubing those are the
expensive parts but so not the LED not
the LED a lady that does all the cool
well yeah listen miss the cheapest
probably the cheapest part well other
than the resistor either resistors are
necessary I'm just try and get rid of
okay so what do you how do you do the
throwy aspect of it
huh weird echo I think it's on the
ground so we actually do this park or
status since since I want cheap on the
magnets I'll go up in very tall places
on stickam places yeah so if you can
bounce up our wall on the village
somewhere suppose you're going to get a
lot of build up a lot of attention not
very sophisticated we only print one
color at a time if we if I got some
white out there I probably make it look
pretty cool is that ABS I'm really
really corn yeah it's corny we've got
abs but i like to pla mor prince nicer
this is a little this this is the
largest print we've ever made out of our
MakerBot so it's it's 3d printed out of
this machine we have over here and does
it is it like somebody's face or well
this is a like a low polygon 3d model
that we that we got off of a thingiverse
which is a collection of models that
people have made to work with the
MakerBot's and just hit a button and
printed it out so he like put it on
you'd be like one of those polygons men
from the Nintendo 64 days yep we've
gotten that one quite a bit we thought
we've also got what's the max headroom
Max Headroom is a big reference got it
yeah and this originally started out as
this Oh silly focus huh just won a huge
and recognizing faces yeah this is just
like one of the incredible amount of
things we've printed out of this printer
like like temple dick printed this one
which is Master Chief nice and that that
one took some work like he was talking
about how he had to clean it out and
stand it and stuff you've seen you've
seen that oh yeah printers you know I on
the way here stopped outside of
Sacramento and saw the Printrbot guys oh
you're saying yeah that must've been fun
yeah it was really cool it cool it get
to tour their Factory and then you're
getting me so hmm yeah going to put it
to work so what you have it over here
printing right now where's the
right now we're printing
when I first started printing here we
started making housings for LEDs and
stuff and so how's this really deep yeah
this is where we're at now so in the
bottom there's this slot for an LED
battery or a watch battery and then
there's an LED in there that's clasping
the battery around it and this is
actually an idea we got off of
thingiverse but then so we take this
globe and I go into my modeling program
and I what's the word I want whatever
modeled the name of our hacker space
into it the brain silo and they're
fairly they're pretty sturdy too we you
can throw these things around and they
will stay fully together I mean unless
you know just being it at the wall it
might explode huh yeah please right this
is a this is exciting because it's like
we've we've been printing a lot of
little stuff then we printed that mask
which is huge and realized that the
bigger we go the nicer it looks it's a
little bit more time consuming but it's
pretty cool sup on meetup no I mean up
calm and they come in and use our space
like collaboratively all their member
people like come in user space and their
members too so so everything works out
with a lot of a DIY bio like doing
yourself bioengineering and stuff for
instance this is probably the very party
my best example of what they do this is
microbial fuel cells and these are
buckets of dirt that generate
electricity and small amounts there
charting it on this computer right here
and it's actually logging the data and
throwing it up on Twitter every so often
I think it's every hour I was under the
understand I'm that they had it at like
every five minutes and this really feels
like like every hour or so it'll pings
Twitter and say this is how much output
your bio batteries are producing Wow
yeah so you see these are just bucket of
dirt that look it's an electricity yeah
yes I'm going to have any buckets of
dirt it would take to carry around it'll
charge my phone that would take a lot of
buckets of dirt but I mean everybody's
going like all solar and everything
there's there's a lot of power
alternatives I mean bioengineering this
is pretty fun stuff there's a lot of
information right up here about how the
stuff works we've never really used any
of this stuff DIY bios mainly do this
and then they're only here every every
sunday or so so and they only come in
like once or twice non so we we came to
the realization the other day that we
only use the weekdays and we never use
saturday or sunday and we're only here
between like 7 and 2 a.m. you know it's
like so that's a lot of hours for a hex
base not to be used and we have so much
more potential like I think that printer
and our CNC mill
and especially a jukebox if she listens
just getting to be it's no surprise that
budding entrepreneurs and innovators are
turning to.net to realize their
solutions online dot net is one of the
original top-level domains it's got such
great recognitions it's been around
since 1985 and you can enable the power
of dotnet with your great idea as well
whether you're registering a new domain
and say the dot-com you wants already
taken a dotnet is a great alternative or
we already have a dot-com add-on net is
a great companion we just did that with
hacker cross america and i did my
personally with darren kitchen and you
can get your own done at the same place
where Shannon and I shop because we love
domain com not just because they've been
supporting hak5 for years but because
they're really easy to use they don't
try to upsell you with stuff you don't
need it's a really quick and painless
process you can find a dotnet there for
as low as eight ninety-nine a month and
get this the guys over domain com

it's time for trivia now last week's
question was what man-in-the-middle
attack exploits address resolution
protocol and the answer was ARP spoof or
ARP cache poisoning this week's question
is where does the term arf arf gotcha
