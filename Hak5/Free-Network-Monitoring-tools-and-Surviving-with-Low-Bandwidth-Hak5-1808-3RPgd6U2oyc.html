by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen this is actually
Metasploit minute my name is shannon
wars no it's not medically minute we're
on we used the set for what we started
with it for buzz out loud and then move
expose just here we've got new season
many minutes starting next Monday and
there's so much yes well you loved us
you I didn't I didn't mean to wasn't my
choice
yeah I was dragged away where did you
Joe King in screaming oh I went to a
place called Saint Martin saving the
Virgin Islands really cool place it's
called the friendly Island and half of
its Dutch and half of its French when
there's good food and good drinks okay
well I'm using some French oui okay and
you got it you got an obvious I got a
tan she's not even wearing pants no I'm
not wearing anything so we should
probably try some of these yeah thank
you this is my gift from not so much man
okay it's in st. Maarten Island liqueur
hey pull over you're gonna get one of
these wow the berry yes yes I'm gonna
have yeah the guava berry I don't know
if you can drink the whole thing yeah
but yeah cuz it's pretty strong we we
actually had a bunch of these we call
them guava berry coladas uh-huh and you
just mix em you make them into little
frozen beverages okay yeah they taste
really good you're not supposed to that
is just mix it okay cuz that does not
taste like officer a little strong
they're really strong so you mix them
you make little mix mixed drinks with
them so we had some called rum runners
some Cod waffle berry coladas and it's
this big thing on the island like they
all make them and there's this like
super touristy place that you can buy
him off from I even got honey made out
of this stuff thank you for bringing the
shots to the show of you guys shots and
then try to wash it down with the club
bought a okay
I'll drink my green tea this is a very
club bought a infused episode in fact
I'm yes I'm just I'm just rearing to go
I'm very - I'm so excited I found all
sorts of fun things to talk about
yeah so it seems that we both kind of
came together at the same time with
very similar ideas so that works really
yeah well okay sorry alright so what are
we talking about browser extensions
we're going to be talking about network
management tools we're talking about
ways that you can make the most out of
your bandwidth and ways that you can
stay safe online or at least know when
people are trying to keep tabs on you
mm-hmm mm-hmm so why don't you start us
off Janet okay I will so you're probably
familiar with this thing called pixel
image tracking or pixel tracking or
track tracking pixels right right
because everybody is like oh you know
disable cookies because I'm being
tracked with cookies but you know
ultimately every connection you make is
what what goes back to you as the source
right unless you're running everything
through an anonymous a ssin service like
I to P or tor then don't expect all of
your traffic to be anonymous in which
case even just a pixel the one pixel by
one pixel image or really any resources
reloads for that matter it's a one by
one image that you can put on websites
or you're in this in this example you
put them in little emails and it'll
basically track whatever you click so
there's a whole bunch of like marketers
and advertisers PR companies will use
this as long with like merchants to
figure out what will best sell to you as
a consumer but some people will also use
it just for their own reasons as well
right is the usage in the context of
email is if you load the email if you
open it up
yeah and that then pulls the resource
from the server because it's not a one
pixel you know one by one pixel image
that's as an attachment to the email
it's a one by one pixel that's like it's
linked to an external resource so if you
can make if you can watch that external
resource and say has this image been
pulled and there's a unique image for
every antique email then you can tell
whether the email has been opened or not
so luckily Gmail or actually google.com
they have this whole website that's
basically dedicated to what pixel
tracking is and they talk about how it's
set up and some examples of how you
might find it in whatever content or
creativity thing that you're looking at
so it gives a pretty good example of
what you can find if you're looking into
the code for the different emails
you're looking at but there's a whole
bunch of different websites that use
this a whole bunch of different
companies yes where comm is one they
sell like a free plan if you want to
track a hundred emails per month
banana tag and streak streak is the one
that I've heard of before because I had
done a review of it before so all three
of these are companies that will
basically sell this ability to track to
other you know merchants PR people and
whatsoever so recently there was a news
article that went through and it's about
this Chrome extension called ugly email
so ugly email basically just gives you
this nice little what looks like an
eyeball right next to the subject line
of your email and it tells you that it's
actually being tracked by one of these
little pixel trackers oh that doesn't
prove does it not prevent it also from
being loaded it just lets you know oh by
the way yeah so before you open it you
can be like okay I'm getting tracked
maybe I don't want to open this email so
there's another one I did some more
research and I found out there's another
email extension and this one's called
pixel block this one actually worked
really well for me because it's supposed
to block those pixels from tracking you
so they say that it blocks people from
tracking when you open and read their
emails specifically and when I tested
this in my own emails so I went over to
my like Shannon at hack 5 org I noticed
that there's a little red eyeball that
shows up and it tells me that I'm being
tracked if you click on that it'll tell
you how many trackers are in the email
and how many you know pixel trackers and
then the source so in one case I was
using this with a PR person that I email
to get like you know reviews for tech
stuff turns out she's tracking me so I
was like oh that's not cool
so it she's using streaks so it actually
gave me a link to street comm so I could
go back there and be like oh what's this
and I was able to check it out so I was
like that's kind of weird I wonder why
she's tracking me because she only put
one link in that email probably because
she is a PR person works for PR agency a
public goes through a CRM portal at her
slave yeah so that you know when she
gets replaced with the next PR drone
that they have the full history of you
or guys engagement and all of that stuff
so if you think about it like how can
you actually block this kind of stuff
without having to use
extension well you could just turn off
all images and all your emails or you
could use something else yes okay so
we'll get to that in just a sec because
I feel like some of these really kind of
angled merge together but before we move
on from that I got asked are you
comfortable having extensions Chrome
extensions load into your Gmail that's
the thing not necessarily because I feel
like they do have to get access to your
Gmail mm-hmm so at the same time I'm
like maybe not I'm not necessarily cool
with that and I'll probably continue to
use Chrome just not with those
extensions yeah before people email us
they should probably also point out that
Thunderbird is a fantastic client that
you can configure with Gmail or most
webmail providers to go ahead and and
and get that over various means like pop
and IMAP and various others but and with
those you can do extensions that are run
locally on your machine that will
prevent the image tracking and all of
that as well so maybe that's follow up
but I just wanted to point that out
before we get the well actually well
actually yes so what do you have well
okay so this actually came up because I
was I was while I was traveling and hack
across Europe I have to hand it to
t-mobile so I had like I normally don't
hand it to telecom my Internet's going
down to the Virgin Islands if I wanted
to turn on my phone it'd be like you
know 300 dollar charge well I wasn't
cool with that yeah so it is I'm on a
virgin Oh or not virgin what's it called
frozen oh okay yeah yeah so I was like
I'll just turn it off for that anyway I
hate giving props to a telco
but t-mobile did it well we're like the
to give you an example the hack across
Europe I did 2013 five countries six SIM
cards wow that's not cool you know it's
not too difficult to go into a store and
save OSC some carton and getting get a
media Commons or whatever card yeah it
makes it my French isn't good so I
didn't do very well in Geneva but anyway
it's a real pain yeah
t-mobile made it easy in that
international roaming for US customers
it's no big deal in Europe every time
you land you get a text message and this
is because it's actually you legislation
is so great you get a text that says
here are the rates right and it was
pretty cool it changes from country to
country
but typically what I found throughout
Germany Netherlands UK and Ireland is
that I would basically be given about
five hundred megabytes or I would be
given like a small small amount of like
4G and then it would be dropped down to
a hundred and twenty-eight kilobits per
second oh god that's twice 56 K that
hurts yeah that barely hurts and so
rather than you know upgrade and pay
bucha bucks for more data or faster data
or whatever have you I just kind of
dealt with it because honestly 128 kilo
just for a second that's like ISDN sorry
seriously that's like ISDN that's yeah
that's you know coming from the 28th or
2400 bonded days I don't feel too
uncomfortable at 128 kilobits per second
but in the modern web it is it's
atrocious yeah it is and it's not very
good reason though like I remember in 97
learning HTML 3 or 4 and it was funny
like all the books would recommend that
your web page be no more than 30
kilobytes oh my gosh yeah
those days are long gone well did you
know that Google because they're talking
about becoming like a carrier themselves
or whatever they're discussing making
their you know across the world
worldwide mobile you're the fiber stuff
become unlimited mm-hmm just be
unlimited wherever you go right but on
mobile you know with Los Angeles Oh
interesting I don't know what that
you'll see how that goes
yeah anyway I don't want to get into a
rabbit hole about telcos yeah because I
have a interesting relationship with
them and I will note that there is
probably a pay phone back there we
should do something with that I hear an
asterisk there's boxes there's little
coloured boxes we'll talk about it later
so yeah that's one of them right that's
the other one so listen this is so great
because basically while the web has
gotten like you know more complex it's
it used to just be like HTML and
animated gifs of hamsters now you've got
CSS and JavaScript and flash and
Silverlight and cookies and all of those
things and sometimes what I want is just
to be able to turn those off and I found
the best extension for Firefox that
actually has me switching back to
Firefox in this context this is so cool
it is called it is called quick Java and
actually one of the reasons why I even
came to know quick Java is because I
want a very simple way to go back and
forth between using a socks proxy
instead of going to preferences and
advanced and network and settings and
then click manual configuration and use
my socks proxy and then click no proxy
when I'm not using it because you know
admit it we all do it this has a
fantastic like one button switcher
between like I'm using my proxy I'm not
using my proxy and when you're traveling
internationally we use in proxy so
that's this button up here that's the
red P in the top so that's nice I can
click that and now I'm using my proxy I
click it again now it's red and now not
well what about everything else this is
the coolest thing
Jes is JavaScript I can just go ahead
and disable that J is Java F is flash I
can disable that I is images and will
refresh the page here now and you'll see
no more images a is animated gifs C is
cookies CS is CSS as soon as I click
that hey and then SL is Silverlight so
here's a web page that now doesn't have
anything if we load something like
Reddit comm right yeah here's reddit
without actually it's loaded the CSS
there's reddit without CSS or anything
honestly this isn't this isn't terrible
like the important information is there
like Wikipedia yeah here's the English
Wikipedia again I don't know why the CSS
thing isn't keep loading but yes there
we go
it's actually not bad and when we was
disabled all of that stuff you end up
with a I feel like I'm you know sure
it's not as rich of an experience but
you get with my distractions and it
loads faster saves tons of bandwidth
yeah because the web was it's not made
for I'm so sorry for anybody who's
watching on dial-up I'm so curious how
anybody could be watching on diet
anybody watching on dial-up right now
yes mail us five minutes Market Street
number three nine three seven one San
Francisco California nine four 104 you
probably have to do it by snail mail cuz
you know yeah it'd be too slow over the
Internet's yes so anyway that is that is
my browser at the school shin oh and
then one other because I needed a
similar thing for for Android and
because what I've been doing is just
heathering on my phone yeah but for when
I'm browsing on my phone there's no good
there's no good equivalent to this on
Firefox for mobile so I just want to
point out that little web browser too is
a fantastic well it's a little web
browser it's a browser for Android
cancel that does not do images and so
you know it's it's pretty basic but you
know what it gets the job done it makes
everything look very simplistic it does
CSS but it doesn't do images and so
those are like the number one thing that
slows your page loading experience down
that I've found on mobile it also means
you don't get any of those ads yes
although there is one ad that I should
point out which is fantastic because it
keeps hak5 going have you heard of this
it is called domain.com yes that's right
domain con these guys have been
supporting hak5 for years and they have
an awesome hookup for you because you
know what we all have awesome ideas and
we want to make those ideas come to life
on the web and to do that you really
want yourself a domain name and web
hosting and you can get both of those
things really quickly over at domain.com
they've got a domain discovery system
we've told you before other affordable
reliable and easy to use but mainly I
love these guys because you can go
drinking with them in port
or you know they're just really fine
folks to do business with you can tweet
them at domain.com and see why and
because there are huge fans of hak5 they
want to hook you guys up with a special
coupon code it's hak5 really easy to
remember of your hak5 viewer and that
will get you 15% off of your domain
names and everything else over at
domain.com so when you think domain
names think domain.com see I like this
whole set thing
I'm loving this I can't wait until Paul
can we go pro for a sec can I go pro oh
my god there's a GoPro yes the GoPro
yeah it's just sitting over there it's
this thing is transforming we finally
have him sorry we have room to do this
stuff yeah rock Sock'em anyway he's such
a boy so that was fun moving on I had
something else that I wanted to share
with you that also works with the whole
browser awesomeness experience yes this
is very old-school browser I just can I
just say how old-school this is like I
think I was a baby when this came out in
1992 okay so I was like seven eight this
this is what you're about to explain is
actually my first experience with the
web because I was big on the bulletin
board systems back in the day the
dial-up VBS is text only sorry and see
graphics for the window we have one of
those coming yes kill that red dragon
and what it and what it allowed me to do
was dial in and not just played or games
and hit the message board on my local
BBS where everybody lives in town and
you can go and see him at the user group
but actually hit the World Wide Web
thank you Tim berners-lee and it wasn't
just mosaic that was making it awesome
back then there was a text equivalent
yes there you are dear in my heart I'm
so excited and heart warm that you've
discovered this so share it with us so
adorable and I'm running it I'm running
it on a Windows 8 laptop Windows 8.1
that makes no it doesn't make it as you
do this I'm gonna be up get installing
this okay that's probably a lot easier
than why I had to do write to Google it
for the web site
for the download oh you had to google it
yeah that's so much harder than just
opening up a terminal and app getting
that that shiz so this is called links
it's a fully featured world wide web
browser for users on both UNIX and VMs
platforms that is connected to those
systems via cursor addressable character
cell two terminals or emulators aka
computers that includes vt100 terminals
and desktop based software packages
emulating vt100 terminals yeah like
Kermit hey Kermit rod I in fact their
description it is just sudo apt-get
install you already got links yeah if
you're on Debian it's gonna be so much
better than mine gee to go and I want to
go to Yahoo doc no Lycos because we are
using a 90s browser so let's go to it do
we want to use cookies no V never oh
goodness
so um yeah can I can I show you what
this looks like a my computer so it's
it's not as pretty I actually like yours
with the black background but it looks
pretty much the same pretty easy to use
if you hit H you go to the help guide
right here and you can use your up and
down arrow keys to get around this is
website and then if you want to click on
something you just hit enter so I can
hit about links and then great about
links if I hit key that will
automatically take me to the keystroke
mapping so I can go up and down through
this and look at all the different
options that I have as far as getting
around on the internet right because
don't try clicking on anything here so
that was the first thing I know I was
like my mouse isn't working I don't know
what this one is
what is this oh yes two ports haven't
been invented yet I guess they have
can't to use girl
I don't understand this I don't
understand it at all so if I want to go
somewhere I hit G to go and then I can
type in let's just do it for double use
google.com so it takes me to Google and
then if there's cookies on a website
it'll ask you if you want to use the
cookies if you want to share those or
you can just say never always whatever
you want so I just hit never never use
my cookies and then if I want to search
something I have to arrow down go to
that let's see I'm gonna search for
myself this could be dangerous
Google search
all right and yeah that's all pretty
normal
where's my website let's see so if I
want to scroll down I can hit page up
page down let's see page down
who are these weirdos looking like
Surgenor shannon morse wedding check it
out
tekzilla I'm looking at the Wikipedia
article for tekzilla and this does not
look bad
this doesn't look bad at all I mean it
doesn't know yeah it doesn't look very
bad at all let's see oh Shannon Morse
home that's my website so it'll tell you
that it's loading it loads in like two
seconds and then you can browse my
website so cool I love it yeah so it's
pretty easy to use
and you can actually save different
sites if you want to into files if you
needed to or you can print them so you
can use it generally just like a regular
browser in this case is just strictly
text really so epic about that is since
it couldn't handle an image to save its
life or same thing the CSS the
JavaScript or you know flash or any of
that other stuff it's really low on
bandwidth if you just have an SSH
session between your say your phone and
your shell this is kind of perfect and
there's a great way that we can actually
see how much bandwidth this easing you
want to check this out I've got some let
me cue to quit and I want to show off
some other words favorite oh whatever
will get to using pine in no time
well it's an email client oh we're gonna
totally convert her into 1994 snubs it's
gonna be so great
oh god I don't want to see 1994 so these
are my four favorite and network
monitoring tools for Linux and because
sometimes you're just like well what's
going through the wire why is it taking
forever to load this page or what
application is hitting the web and why
do I have an application that's hitting
the web when it doesn't need to maybe I
want to uninstall that so on Linux there
are some fantastic ones I'm going to
start from kind of the least cool to the
most cool and Mon is really the most
simple on sudo and Mon and it's not the
most gorgeous thing in fact this one
will also do CP
we can take a look at my CPU utilization
or Q is not Q is quit or memory or disks
but if you just hit n you can see I have
a couple of interfaces here I have an
Ethernet interface I have a wireless
interface obviously loopback as well as
since I have VMware on here a couple of
V nets and if I don't notice a table
over to hack five in chrome and start
playing you'll see that lots of packets
start going but this is just real-time
yeah so it's it's it's kind of okay
let's pause that for a sec so that's n
Mon it's not the prettiest what is nice
is IP traffic
so if traff it's n curses which is
basically pretty menu systems yeah it
does good and curses does look like a
BIOS and we can monitor the traffic for
the wireless interface and you can see
that I have a ping ICMP replies for 80
to 88
why probably because in the other tab
over here I have a constant ping go go
go and that's you know something that I
do quite frequently I can also open up
example.com and I can actually see this
and I can sort these of you hit s you
can sort by say P for packet if we load
up something bandwidth intensive like
YouTube and let that run in the
background you'll see there's quite a
few packets going on for YouTube and it
basically just it's kind of like TCP
dump or yes that's what I was thinking I
like it doesn't show you by process so
but it does show you a whole lot else I
mean you can do interface statistics
where you can just watch well here let's
just let's just throw something on and
then you can see the actual you know
bandwidth utilization and all of that
stuff if we go to the detailed and
actually see like based on you know the
type of traffic it's TCP or UDP your
eyes it's pretty cool doesn't show you
processes but you can get a lot of stats
and things packet size breakdowns for
different interfaces see like large
packets versus small package yeah things
of that nature
it's got filters I mean it really goes
on and on
but as far as a network monitor to just
see the traffic through your interface I
think it looks pretty good if top may
just be my favorite though if up so
pseudo if top and then we're gonna
choose TAC I for interface NW Land 0 and
here is you can see my computer on the
left and you can see as it's going
through the router and where it's going
and how much traffic and so we can
actually see on a connection by
connection basis hear everything that's
going in it's got it's got basically
like a progress bar at the top for how
many megabits of stuff is going on and
if we load up something bandwidth
intensive we can you know make that go
wild
so another pretty cool one it's got
other sorting and stuff like that a
whole lot of options just hit H again
this is all just text-based and while
there's some really cool stuff for linux
where you can see it like this you know
system monitor and all of that stuff
this is just a fun one on for text my
very favorite though is net hogs so sudo
that hogs w land 0 and the reason why I
love this is check this out we've got
chrome over here playing move X right
and then we've got Firefox over here
we're gonna get it to go to zombocom
this is the best website ever notice the
zombie comm says plug-in missing if I
hit it was a flash F yeah up here and
refresh the page hey now now we've got
Zombo goodness and we can actually see
check it out
opt google chrome chrome is you know
sending and receiving these bytes
firefox all right there is
sending/receiving those bike bytes
we've got dropbox over here hey we've
got an ssh session over here so on a per
process basis I can actually see what
applications are using what bandwidth
again for example if I am tethering to
my smart phone in a hotel in a random
country and I have very limited
bandwidth I may want to notice like hey
is it did I forget to turn off Dropbox
background synchronizing files and
eating up my data plan and slowing down
the rest of my web browsing yeah that
totally makes sense that could be a huge
issue if you didn't sign up for a data
plan internationally yes I would like to
hear what you guys think as far as your
favorite tools for not just better web
browsing or lightweight web browsing
which is I guess kind of the theme here
but also what tools do you use in fact a
cross platform because I'm only showing
Linux tools here do you use links you
can use links on Windows apparently you
can't watch hak5 and links unfortunately
no yeah but you know where you can watch
hak5
where can you hk5 org we're also on all
sorts of RSS feed so just like search
for us and subscribe hey you know what
while you're at hak5 org you can also
click follow and find all the ways to
subscribe and find all of the hosts in
act 5 and find all the cool ways that
you can get involved with the community
there's you know chat there's forums and
in the top right or the toolbar I think
there's a link to the store that takes
you to one of my favorite domains you
know that domain it's over there yes the
domain is over there that the store
domain is literally over there like high
domain no no we don't host it in-house
we use a service provider that's PC I
complain and all that stuff oh I want to
do our PCI compliant to the processing I
didn't think so I'm talking with the
hack shop HSN shop comm it's where you
can support us directly we've have fun
announcements coming so stay tuned to
Metasploit minute on Monday find that on
hackpad org as well o as well as tech
thing and all the other good stuff on
the network so yes tech fingers good
times mm-hmm they make tech misbehave
mm-hmm we misbehave yes we need to break
things and then we fix them and
sometimes misbehave hey I haven't I
don't think we've done an episode
