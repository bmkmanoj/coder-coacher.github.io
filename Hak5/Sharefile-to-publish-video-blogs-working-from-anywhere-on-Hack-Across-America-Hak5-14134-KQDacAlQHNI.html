America backstage I'm really excited to
show you guys how I am running my
business while I run across North
America all thanks to the guys over at
citrix who hooked me up with all of
their software check this out so a lot
of people have been asking about how I
do my video blogs and I just shot one
here I'm still building out the van the
latest and greatest is that if I'm to
put the sink in that's right i am now
hak5 the garand plumber to be like mario
or something but do so it was pretty
cool I got running water so I just shot
this video blog and basically i'm all
about simplistic workflows and so the
way that this works for me is I
literally just take my phone and I
record with the front-facing camera just
like this and I mean okay so yes it's
not the kind of like HD stuff with the
lighting and everything that we're used
to in studio but what's important is
that I'm able to anywhere when the
moment strikes me when something cool is
happening just pull out my phone and
honestly the cameras on these things
have gotten so great over the years the
first hack across America I use what
Motorola Droid it was so god-awful but
now just with this galaxy note 2 I just
record with the front facing and then
when I finished this is the best part
because I am a little bit of a stickler
when it comes to quality yes I'll do the
handheld video blog on my phone but it
can't just end there I have to at least
have an open and slate title and so
here's the thing once I've recorded my
video blog the latest one I got I got
all this goodness in there this is so
cool i'm pretty proud of this I've got
my fresh water and my um my grey water
there and it's all hooked up 12 volts to
this and this is
ER on this sink here but I want to
rotate this I get water and then it just
flows back down so great so I do that
little video blog stuff and then check
this out so I've got this file what i do
is i rename this right so rename two
kitchens sink you know cuz cuz i'm
darren kitchen and it's a sink okay so
the reason that i rename the file is
that the file name will become the name
of the video blog when it goes to
youtube now how does it get to you tube
with that cool like intro graphic and
outro because i am a stickler for
quality well this is pretty cool get
this so i just hold down just like on
android with the regular intentions and
hit share and the intention that i use
is share file this is pretty cool stuff
it allows me to quickly and easily get
this file up there without having to
worry about like ftp resumes or it being
too big for a file attachment and since
i don't want to go straight up to
youtube I want to go to my server which
is going to add those graphics to the
head in the tail and publish it out to
YouTube publish it out to twitter and
google+ and put it on the hak5 blog i'm
going to use share file here and
basically i choose my destination and
this is pretty cool i've set up all of
these different watch folders that have
different presets so i go into my email
and then i have the darren kitchen vlog
watch folder I've got my default watch
folder and I hit upload and then BOOM
I'm uploading so if I come down here
just pull this down I now get a little
progress bar so I can watch as that
video file uploads I also use a really
nifty application here to kind of get a
sense of the transfer speed and it's
called network speed and basically I can
see this red line here i'm getting 136
kilobytes a second up on the 3g
connection here and then i can see my
downloads and everything else here it
shows me on cdma
you know the link quality because i
don't know i geeked out I love that kind
of stuff but what I what I mostly love
is that I don't have to worry about this
file getting there as soon as I hit
share I just what record rename share
it's done I know in a couple of hours
it'll be processed on youtube on all of
the social networks so it's all about
simplicity of workflow or I'm not going
to do it and talking about simplicity of
workflow me guys tell you about share
file if you're in a business and you
need to share a file secure late this
might be the perfect solution for you
let me tell you a little story about
when I was a systems administrator in DC
I oh my gosh this person this person
would email confidential data in a zip
file with a password okay but then they
would follow up with another email with
the password that's not secure we've
been talking about PGP on a hack five of
the last couple of weeks and you guys
know as much as I do it's really great
except it doesn't have the kind of
penetration and it doesn't have that
simplicity workflow its convenience you
know because if it's not convenient
people aren't going to use it this is
convenient share file is so easy to use
any file size you can get your file out
there and share that link that secure
link and here's the best part you get to
know who and when the person read the
file so you're like you know somebody's
slacking or if they've actually met that
checkpoint and they're doing their job
so great and so this might be a perfect
solution for you guys businesses what i
thought i would throw that out there
because it's what i'm using to run my
business as i run all across north
america and so we're gonna continue
doing these hak5 hack across America
