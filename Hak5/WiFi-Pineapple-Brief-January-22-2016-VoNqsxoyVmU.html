sebastian kena and we have an awesome
update about the new 6th generation
Wi-Fi pineapple firmware we sure do
aardwolf ambulance call game lots of fun
developments yes
figured we were just kind of brief sued
through some of these if you haven't
already already an apple you need to do
that yeah so the first thing we did is
we kind of made pine AP a little bit
easier we divided them menus up a bit
more we added a toggle for pine a tepee
itself so this looks pretty good
um and so so you know makes it bit
easier we also added a refresh and
download buck to the SSID pool and the
same goes for the the pineapple log to
choose those things now be able to pull
those funds down yes that's good stuff
in addition networking now supports the
use of third-party Wi-Fi interfaces
through USB dongles such as those from
raleigh no theros real tech those
chipsets are supported like the ones
from the alpha aw us zero through six
neh that's a mouthful as well as the raw
link RT 50 370 which is the nub in which
i think looks pretty good with the
tactical in the half shop as well but
yeah you know so that way if you're
looking to do Wi-Fi client mode those
are great options for you I particularly
like the nubbin because 70 milliwatts at
peak power usage that it's it's great
for for clothes things
yeah and in general like the the entire
network stack there we kind of revamped
it made it much more liable that was
coming with issues there with you know
yeah exactly bug fixes there but general
stability fro fur right dashboard got an
update so just little minor tweaks
niceties like clicking SS ID number or
client number will take you to their
respective modules and speaking of
modules huge support now right I mean we
we put the module manager out which
wasn't we didn't launch in the very
first words where we push that out and
we're slowly adding modules now big
shout out to Fox Trot to Tesla to a
newbie to Whistler master into everyone
else that's currently working on putting
modules out there right really glad to
have the community support us and really
glad to you know be able to push these
out and see what's coming it's exciting
I mean if there's many in development
many already being released such as evil
portal and map TC
be dumped you got a gat and n grapping
yeah get her to come ok cool URL snarf
is coming as well as you know all the
SSL strips and splits and POF random
roll excited about that yeah ever right
well anyway that kind of brings us to
the the big news which is on Monday we
will be doing a hangouts on air to
introduce the six generation Wi-Fi
pineapple API yeah so basically a little
bit of rundown on how to you know make
modules coming familiarize yourself with
the API kind of like let's code so yeah
that's exciting stuff oh you know what I
didn't even put this in but this is kind
of worth mentioning as well if you're on
the linux side of things wp6 that sh got
updated with a little choose your own
adventure kind of way to set this up
just makes it a little bit easier so a
lot of niceties a lot of bug fixes and
other conveniences added along the way
