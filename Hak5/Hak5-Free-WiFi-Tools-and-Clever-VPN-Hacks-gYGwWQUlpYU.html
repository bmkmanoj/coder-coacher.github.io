scanner that works under windows 7
windows VPN tricks and save sis admins
from pulling their hair out utility of
the day all that and more on this
episode of hack 5
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by go daddy
Squarespace Gamefly and viewers like you
right well hey there and welcome to hack
5 my name is Darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
and I'm creeped out but I like creepy
you guys out it's you know little weird
you out do some unorthodox stuff like
I'm gonna be doing on the show today
you've succeeded yes thank you I will be
making some system mins creeped out as
well as soon as they see the crazy stuff
that have done the windows and VPNs and
it's it's a hack like duct tape and n
twine not a hack like way on your
network I like use paper towel rolls in
duct tape you make binoculars out of
those yeah I don't know what I'm gonna
try I have a short little tease for you
I'm doing something kind of cool next
week after we have parts on order I'm
excited yeah I am showcasing a wireless
network scanner that works in Windows 7
and it's also a precursor to some
greater and much bigger things that
we're going to affect them yes yes but
yeah I mean it's very systems focused
episode so let's go ahead and kick it
off right and find out what is up with
our utility bill ease when it comes to
moving a bunch of junk from one place to
another you've heard us sing the praises
of roadkill net unstoppable copier what
happens when it comes to those two
places that should have been identical
if something weren't a mess and that's
why this week we're showing some love to
win merge this open source light

so today I'm gonna be showing you guys a
tool that I found born out of necessity
much like all the other tools that you
guys have in your briefcase
in your pocket Drive whatever you want
to call it today we're gonna be taking a
look at a Wi-Fi finder that I needed to
use in Windows 7 now I'm using the
release candidate however that doesn't
matter because even on the RTM that I
found Nets tumblr which was last updated
about five or six years ago know five
years ago yeah five years ago doesn't
really work well under Windows seven
let's just put it that way so what I did
is I went on a hunt for a network
scanner that worked under Windows seven
and what I found was called insider now
insider is made by a company called meta
geek Medicaid net is the place that you
can go to download the software for free
now it's really just a stripped down
version of some of their other products
which are called channelize errs now
meta geeks specializes in Wi-Fi channel
range frequency spectrum analysis it
doesn't show it here but this utility is
strictly for finding locating and seeing
what is on or around you in terms of
wireless networks now the reason that I
like this utility better the net
Stumbler is it gives me a nice arc of
channel you know interference and things
like that like if I'm on channel 4
there's a little bit of fall off between
channel 3 and channel 5 now I can
visualize that here in the software so
coming back to it we can see here that
hack 5 is currently sharing the same
channel as two other networks one of
them is guy Vil I don't know who that is
and the other just disappeared but and
then Linksys and Nancy PC network are
also sharing the same channel now if we
wanted to take this and deploy it in a
practical scenario we could say there's
nothing around channel 12 let's take a
look at channel 12 and see if we can get
some better reception with
the interference of having competing
access points on the same channel now
taking that a step further what we can
do is we can come over and actually
purchase some products from Mehta geek
and these products are called the Y
spies utilizing Y spies that come in
varying channel ranges whether you want
to transmit or just receive they come in
2.4 gigahertz as well as 5.5 gigahertz
for Wireless N and things like that
and we can actually generate things like
3d views of the spectrum analysis of the
range of megahertz or gigahertz that we
want to actually take a look at so come
in here we could actually see that we've
got a 900 megahertz spectrum scan and it
is now visualizing a 3d graph of that
coming down here we can actually see the
spectrum analysis for pretty much what
the insider utility is showing us but we
can actually see what frequency ranges
that there are actually covering in and
things like that I put a call in to
Metta geek to see if we can't get a unit
to test and highlight for you guys
because there's some really interesting
stories in graph results that that they
have online that you can take a look at
and utilizing the Chan Chan eliezer as
well as the waif spy utilities we could
take a look and see if our cordless
phone is interfering with our wireless
signal if things like our microwave are
interfering with our wireless signal
anything that the spectrum analysis
really goes above and beyond what you're
going to find just by searching out
other access points hit me up if you
have any questions mad at hack 5 or
forums at hak5 org or just head over to
Metta geek net and find out for yourself
right now Shannon's gonna come in and
tell us what's going on with this
month's land party this month LAN party
is Team Fortress 2 and we'll be playing

public database check out revision
three.com slash go daddy for all of our
GoDaddy codes and offers tonight I would
like to share with you an IT horror
story and it begins with a hard coded
192.168.1 ex office network and I don't
even want to get into why it's hard
coded or why it's not going to change
anytime soon but suffice it to say
that's the bane of my existence also the
need to implement a VPN and I know what
you're thinking there are no fancy
routes that are going to fancily route
the fun happiness that you need when
your corporate networks on the 192.168.1
that whatever and your home users who
are connecting on their little net gear
Linksys home network dealies on the same
subnet so what are we gonna do well it's
not optimal but it works mind you there
is no money to throw a hardware at this
solution so we are gonna do some ghetto
systems administration tonight so let's
take a look at what we are working with
I have two servers set up here and this
one right here in the red is Salt Rock 5
org I am just gonna mock this up here on
our network at home at the hack house
and you can see that I actually have
little active directory going on let's
take a look we got some users and all
that fun stuff and we've got a routing
and remote access server so we can
actually except VPN traffic and that's
kind of important when you're trying to
put together a VPN this is just about
the easiest way to put together a VPN
and if you guys are interested more this
stuff trust me I have a bunch more fun
stuff that involves open the VPN later
for the open source crowd now let's come
back over to our other server this right
here is our boring accounting server of
boringness right it might be running
tomcat and it's not that exciting
well let's take a look here oh great
well so that pretend this 1010 Oh is
actually the 192 that I am loathing and
we're going to realize that we don't
have a lot to work with here we need to
get both of these on that new shiny hat
network and if we take a look at the VPN
server you can see that I've already set
up part of that with the VPN server and
that is the 172 dot 16 dot 85 100 that
address is there because we've actually
set up this VPN server to give out a
static address pool of 172 1685 102 172
1685 249 hooray
now if we can get all of our clients on
here and we've got our one server on
there were almost there except we've got
all these other boring servers that we
need to also connect and that's where
this little tweak is going to come in so
let's take a look at how we will go
ahead and connect these two bad boys
together so I'm on my boring server of
boringness here and I'm going to head
over to my networking and we'll create
our new VPN connection just like we
normally would and VPN that'll work 10
1001 18 is the IP address and we're not
using a smart card and we're going to
say finish there we go and I've actually
already created an account here on the
server in users and computers it is
boring server I'm going to reset its
password - all right let's come back
over to our boring server and log in
we're gonna say that we'll hit up
properties we'll go to the networking
we'll make sure that it does not become
our default gateway under advanced in
tcp/ip we're also going to uncheck the
prompt me and we're going to tell it to
redial 99 times every 10 seconds if it
does get dropped but don't drop for any
reason verifying user name and password
we are connected and we can see we have
that new IP address hooray but this is
not going to happen every time that the
computer turns on and that's kind of
important and I've seen stupid little
tricks where it's like throwing the
startup thing but it's a server it you
know things happen it reboots whatever
we
this to happen every time the server
starts we needed to connect to this VPN
so there are a couple of ways to go
about this and I'm going to demonstrate
one of these here and that is using R a
style and a fun little option here so
let's go ahead and take a look at R a
style so R a style is a command that
allows us to connect and disconnect and
whatnot manage our dial-up connections
and when I say dial-up connections I
mean like you know VPN dial-up right so
let's rest I'll sighs disconnect and
we're not on our VPN server anymore
hooray and remember that the profile is
called VPN here I'm going to run rath
style VPN because that's the name of it
boring server is the username hour
pretty lame password that we set up and
we're connected so now that we know that
we can actually script our dialing of
the VPN let's go ahead and turn that
into a service now Matt talked about I
think in season 4 ways to do this for
letting people use like fire demon or
something daemon that allows other
people to manage services and we talked
about in serve I believe that won't work
so well with this what we're actually
going to end up using is a cool tool
from the Microsoft resource kit called
Auto X and T it's kind of like
autoexec.bat but as a Windows NT script
so let's take a look or service if you
will so let's take a look at that now
Auto xmt and it's buddies live that here
in the resource kit tools folder and we
actually need to copy it as well as a
few of its friend over to the system32
folder ok and now that we're in system
32 and we have our batch file here it's
just a matter of installing the service
so we were on instant MT install and I'm
gonna give it slash interactive as the
switch and there we go we have
successfully installed the service if I
come over here to my services and
refresh you can see there's a new
service listed Auto xnt I'm going to
give it some properties love and tell it
yep wanted to be automatic
and if I start it you will see that I am
now connected to the VPN this will
happen every time it connects now there
is something to note here and that is
that I initiated this as the
administrator the user that actually
created this this profile remember R a
style DHC just tells it the profile I'm
not giving it all the parameters but how
does it know the profile well that is
actually stored here in documents and
settings and all couldn't pull this up
so this PBK file here this rasp phone PV
cave I actually take a look at this with
something like notepad you'll actually
get an idea of what is stored in here
and these are all of the parameters that
specify my VPN well this is in the admin
folder and what's going to happen here
is that this service is going to run as
the local system not as administrator so
it's just a matter of copying this
Rascon dot pvk file from documents to
settings administrator application data
Microsoft network connections PPK over
to document settings back slash all
users and then the rest of it so that is
how you get a server to connect to a VPN
every time it boots and now we don't
have to deal with that nasty IP issue as
long as everything is always connected
to the VPN and it's I'll be honest it's
not optimal but it works so anyway if
you guys have questions about this VPN
stuff go ahead and email me Daren a hack
5 org or feedback at bob dot oregon and
of course I'm always trolling the forms
that act 5 dead org anyway we are going
to go ahead and find out what's going on

slash pack alright so Darren I have to
give you mad props I guess I should say
for the duct tape that is your network
now and you know it's kind of fitting
that I'm accelerating on why you need to
correctly implement and renumber and RER
contect and all this other stuff your
network and you just really don't give a
crap dude no it's not that at all dude
trust me I would love to how much did
you just write a check for a reai p
costs nothing nothing mmm
nothing so we have this thing that's
hard-coded nasty you know how much it
would cost to have that rewritten anyway
this theft is not worth getting into but
I should probably like put it on some
bastard subnet and do something with it
it probably uh maybe a little tunnel
action with some VLANs that would be
better than having all of your servers
connect to the VPN over but hey you know
you you can use that same what I taught
you over there in that segment can be
applied to many other things I mean you
now know about the wrath style and about
the service thingy and it doesn't have
to be together you can use them
independently for good not evil yeah
that's true I guess we have no choice
but to trust you in the fact that it
works it works and when you've got no
silly so do you want to bet how long it
takes before it actually screws up or do
you think that I mean no because the
moment you
because eventually you know when water
enters the sticky side of duct tape duct
tape no longer sticky so I'm just saying
that's all I'm saying
Jenna you've got she's got this evil
Brendon or v yeah knows that she's got
parts on the order that are going to be
epic
yes and so I figured out that there's a
way that you can actually get into the
bootloader
of the Kindle what we're talking about
couple weeks ago hey yeah you're right
because we're talking grub it's kind of
like rabbit you boot or boot man or you
foods I'm there either way I'm gonna
wire it up and be able to fit into it
using will be fun quiet SEO all right
you know see that's what I'll hopefully
be doing next week
excellent it's kind of like the
pineapple you know when you get the root
on it with tapping right in yes I love
it when hardware manufacturers put those
pins on their board and just it's nice
and easy to get to
yeah I have to get to it somehow huh huh
yeah you're right I guess they do when
they build it there you go
so write that in JPEG mm-hmm indeed all
right well without further ado we would
encourage you to as always trust your
Tecna list
you
I'm on a boat I've got my flipping
cabbage dude there's a shot in that
video which makes me cream my pants
every time I see it it's where no the
where the rapper is like just standing
there and then the camera slowly pans
and helicopter comes into view oh it's
like slow motion it's like dope ass I
was like I need a shot like that for the
show yes let's share your desktop at
hack 5 org splat splash I did it again
share your desktop at hack 5 org slash
shit shut up share your desktop all of
you I hate you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
