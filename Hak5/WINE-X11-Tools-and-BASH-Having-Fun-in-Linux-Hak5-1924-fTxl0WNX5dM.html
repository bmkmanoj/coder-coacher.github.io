with wine and x11 tools this time on
half 5
hello and welcome to hack five this is
your weekly dose of Tecna lest I'm your
host darren kitchen my name is Shannon
Morse
yes I see I did it backwards this time
it did I was like where do we go I don't
know like trained monkeys up in here we
really are it's called being a podcaster
following up on last week's episode on
text-to-speech engines for Linux we are
taking a look at another that well okay
I'm gonna break it to you it's not for
Linux it's for Windows I know
broke my heart to Darren why are you
doing this to us I realized that I use
Windows but that's mostly yeah well I'm
bringing blasphemy into the world of
open source because we can because I'm a
huge fan of TTS for Texas Beach it's a
great way to listen to articles
especially when you're supposed to be
working and I got used to one in Windows
where I would listen to so many amazing
ones from commander taco and all the
gang had Slashdot that just got sold by
the way oh yeah that's the end of an era
and so what's happened though is I you
know when I was a child I'm gonna move
on from that one I'm just having hackers
references in my head eyes and for loops
so the idea here is that moved on to the
Linux and I miss this one app for
Windows and I know I could just get used
to the text-to-speech apps like a
speaker festival I showed you guys last
week but I figured hey what better way
than to show you some hacky workaround
in Linux of course it's gonna be fun it
built on x11 tools like from last week
and it introduces some cool Python stuff
and wine I love wine wines not an
emulator
no I'm serious I love wine come on let's
just you know no real word so we were
talking about go to the wine store that
seller no yes
okay I'll leave her in the cellar yes we
aren't here now we should have a fan
meet up at a winery that's gonna handle
it so why does that emulator is actually
an app that allows you to run Windows
apps and Linux and this particular one
couldn't be easier seriously it's like
no dependency hell or anything so here's
an example I'm just gonna pull it up
speaker nia is the name of it it's the
kind of wine I like alright so the
picture oh yeah actually there you go
and so here's our example from last week
and so I'm gonna just paste this in here
and hit play so you can hear this guy
okay it does sound pretty terrible but I
like it okay that's cool so you're going
to make it do the thing how are you
gonna do this so you're gonna pipe it
into Excel I wish we could do it like we
did last week just take an exit doesn't
work like festival and you speak oh no
of course not because it's not a native
Linux app it doesn't adhere to the
beauty and you realize like that example
last week was like nothing just taken PS
and ox and piping it to grep and awk
that's okay dude i've seen commands that
stretch the terminal it's amazing how
many things you can pipe to other things
that you can pipe to other things that
you can get the idea but it's the
windows app so it doesn't adhere to that
beauty but it does allow you to open a
file systematically so get this you
could in Windows say notepad dot exe a
space like a file yeah and it would open
up that file a notepad fantastic we can
do sort of the same thing and since we
can pipe Excel to a different file let
me show you a little demo and it all
makes sense okay so here we go I'm going
to in this case let's say let's say I'm
going to do Excel and it'll just give me
all of that stuff yes it is beautiful
now I want to take that and pipe it to
/tmp slash test file right now if I cat
that test file you can see there it is
okay so we've written a file by using
this operator here and what that does is
instead of printing the output of this
command to our terminal like it did in
the previous example where we didn't
it's actually going to send it into this
file and it's going to overwrite
anything that's in there if we wanted to
append it to it we could just put two of
these walkers and then it would append
to that file and then when we cat that
file it'll be even longer if I had more
stuff selected so now we have a txt file
that has all of that
well what's beautiful is I can using
wine just
ahead and open this program with that
text file already open and then this
Texas Beach program for when like Linux
will already be populated with this text
okay and well you know what if we're
gonna do that we might as well just make
it prettier to it happier which brings
us to some really fun and amazing x11
tools so yeah we talked about one of
them last week which is Excel and I just
show you an example but X do tool does
just about anything 4x windows from
getting the active window to setting the
focus of the active window to moving the
mouse and clicking and pressing keys and
typing text and more okay
similarly WM CTL is a ctrl or window
manager control maybe I'm not sure with
WM ctrl stands for but it's another tool
that will interact with X very similarly
so this is kind of it sounds kind of
like your scripting with a USB rubber
ducky sort of like scripting for the USB
rubber ducky you're not familiar you
taped string hello world plug in the
duck and it types hello world the
difference here is while this allows us
to do like typing and clicking and all
that stuff it's not it's systematic
because it's part of the operating
system so we can tell we can say like
make this the focus window which is good
because you want to know that you're
typing into the right program and these
both of these programs are just awesome
they're they're command-line tools that
let you it bridges the gap between the
command line and the GUI so yeah I
figured this will actually allow us to
build upon this with a little bit of
Python scripting and yeah - scripted
yeah I make it do even more so let me
show you an example I've written one
right here and I'll open that in sublime
because I don't do atom and let's see
it's called speakonia dot py and so let
me make this a little bigger for you
yeah it's really shortened actually this
could have easily been a bash script but
you know why not why not import OS and
time so the first thing that actually
does is we create this file and /tmp
called speakonia and we set it up to be
written to and then we run this command
excel which ends up getting written to
that file so what we end up with
is /tmp /p Konya and it gets whatever
came from Excel okay very much the same
way that we just did that except to /tmp
slash speakonia there okay so then the
next thing is that we're gonna kill any
instance of speakonia that's already
running there's an important reason for
this we didn't then every single time I
hit the shortcut key I'll have like a
million versions of this open gotcha
okay yes and then the whole system will
just run amok so we have to specify
we're gonna set a variable called kill
command and it's this it's kill and in
this case we're actually just using PS
ox this time instead of just doing kill
all why well I don't know sometimes you
just get used to old ways oh and you're
still using the same command where
you're talking the call the second
column mm-hmm okay cool yeah yeah so the
other big difference in this case though
is that we're also sending the output of
it to Devon all cuz we don't care about
the rest of the stuff right of course
and that's what this guy does here
because we don't care about hearing any
output from it so that just sends it to
the ether okay which like if I did MV
snubs to slash dev slash null we would
no no no i won't i won't do it i won't
do it we don't know once before it took
a long time to get me right don't know
if you guys watch to the very ends of
the episodes but you should okay the
next thing that we do is we actually run
this command so this next P open is so
it runs this command which was setting
that variable and then get this
ampersand ampersand which is a fun thing
in bash what amp amp means is as opposed
to like you know using a semicolon to
string a bunch of commands together
which I could do let me show you an
example of a semicolon in bash doing the
thing so I could do LS right and it's
gonna give me all that stuff and I could
do LS semicolon cat /tmp slash
what did we call it test file and you
see it does this followed by that right
well what amp amp does is says hey if
this command is successful continue on
and do that
oh okay cool which is awesome because if
the first command wasn't successful then
it's not gonna do anything right which
is kind of cool that's handy it is so in
this case what we'll end up doing is
will kill speakonia with this command
here and then we'll run wine and then
the you know C colon backslash yada yada
yada the Konya run speakonia and then it
passes B Konya parameter which is /tmp
slash speakonia that file that we just
wrote with Excel and then the rest we
just pipe to Devin all because we don't
care about seeing any of the other stuff
okay
so that basically opens up speakonia
with our with whatever text we had
selected so WM ctrl is going to allow us
to activate that window
then we'll sleep for about a half a
second and using x2 tool key f5 you want
to imagine what x2 tool key f5 does what
press the f5 key really yeah check this
out
so we can even have a type of we wanted
to so we could actually have x2 tool
instead of doing this this method where
we actually open up speakonia with that
temp file yeah the reason we do that is
because it's like super fast but if we
went to we could just open up speakonia
and then using the x2 tool we could type
whatever is in X select or Excel yeah so
but the problem with using the type
command is it's it's not very fast right
well I mean it's fast but like if you
it's like a giant article from The New
York Times or something yeah yeah but
this key f5 all does press the f5 key so
if I pop open speakonia now and put a
bunch of stuff in there if i press f5 or
you can actually see under tools or SART
speech play is f5 stop is f7 so or alt
f4 just close the thing okay and no we
don't want to save it okay so this sleep
half a second again this is like a bit
of a hack but you know it works so why
not we can see you're sleeping and
giving it enough time to copy basically
yeah because otherwise like the window
will pop up but you know what my systems
running slow and it takes it a half a
second to pop up so we don't want to hit
f5 very similarly too
a key script so with that the last part
of this is to actually go back to the
active window so what we do here is we
minimize this tool right here X to tool
will search for the visible for a window
with the visible name speakonia which is
kind of like PS ox and grepping for
Speed Konya what we're saying is you
know extras who will find the window
that has this and a window yes and let
me actually pop it up here and show you
an example so I've got that going and
I'll just paste that and I'll end it
with quote oops there we go and these
are the numbers of the actual windows
where as long as just similarly to have
we how we have the numbers for the
process ID but this is something
specific to X to each window mm-hmm yes
and actually because it's in wine and
all of that other stuff we ended up with
a few they saw it we end up with a few
windows which is which is okay because
we really only need the first one which
is why we have this head attack one so
it gets the first one that's what so we
pipe the output to head tack one so that
ends up becoming our window similar to
how at the very top of the script we set
a current window to be X to tool get
active window so if I run this it's
going to tell me the number of well this
window my and they were going that's
active window yes the the window that
I'm currently in okay so what's the
reason for this is because we've set
this to be current whatever I was in
when I you know hit this program and
window to be speakonia so what it means
we can do is X to tool
minimize window plus whatever that
output was so remember we had just
figured out the number for this window
here using get active window yeah well
watch this if I say X do tool window
minimize and grab the output of that
well oh you have to grab the number
oops sorry the dollar sign goes on the
outside nope it minimized my terminal
window because it was the active one
yeah so the idea is that we find out the
number of speakonia and then why is it
so I don't know it's really fun to
script GUI components because you're
like we okay so I'm familiar with bash
scripting now all of a sudden I can do
cool stuff with a GUI that's awesome so
I just thought this is a fun example
because there's lots of cool things you
can do with it yeah of course oh yes
well then that brings us to the last
line the final thing is just to set the
current focus and activate current so
current was whatever it was when we
first opened this program so that means
if for instance I'm in Firefox or Chrome
and you don't have to manually go back
to Firefox or Chrome one speakonia is
open and done exactly gotcha
so let's do an example of just that so
I'm gonna go ahead and fire up Firefox
and pull up snob Zeebo comm snubs
e-portfolio all right there's a bunch of
text at portfolio cool so I'm gonna
select this paragraph here and it's just
like last week when we made these short
keyboard shortcuts I'm going to go to
shortcuts and show you this custom
shortcut of created called speakonia and
what it does is that python file and
what the kill speakonia does is well it
kills it right and actually I'm not
using kill all right but you know old
habits and I've set this to super C and
super V or the windows key + C + or the
windows key + V so now wait what that
was not add let me select whoops and I
select this paragraph and hit supersede
cool so they did it yeah that's awesome
yeah you know and I know like you mayn't
have no interest whatsoever in running
wine programs or text-to-speech engines
but it's really fun to be able to use
these examples cuz these are actually
real world things that I use and and
it's because I had a problem I had an
itch and I was like surely somebody else
has had a need to interface with other X
Windows systematically so it's really
fun to be able to just build on other
programs and what's your age that's this
is awesome I actually think this would
be extremely useful because we we had an
email from a fan who's visually impaired
and he was asking about ways that he can
better use the Internet
for example there you go so yeah using
text-to-speech especially if you can
just set it up so automatically that can
extremely help his life oh yes such a
great and actually a lot of this like
you know all of these hacks everything
comes together starts out as a hack and
then it just gets refined and then at
the product but you know it throw hacks
we could show off the hacks with the
buttons that people have been asking
about that uses a very similar technique
but in Windows so let us know if you'd
like to know about that feedback attack
find org is the address I think we
should yes I think we show when you get
that great idea you're gonna need your
cell phone great domain and if you're
like Shannon and I you'll love using
domain.com because there's nothing
simpler they have an intuitive domain
discovery system and an easy checkout

a tweet at domain.com and say hey thanks
for supporting hack 5 when you think
domain names think domain.com that just
about wraps up this week's episode of
hack 5 yes but before we leave mu bik's
with modus Metasploit minute sebastian
who's the software dev for the Wi-Fi
pineapple darren kitchen hosting a new
pen test with hack 5 class on March 11th
through 13th it's a weekend super super
fun
really cool story driven training
nothing that you've really seen before
in InfoSec training so pen test with
hak5 comm if you want to check that out
still have a few seats available so
definitely register if you're interested
yes at least when we're recording this
otherwise we hope to maybe expand it out
we'll see where it goes yeah if you
can't make it to the class however you
can get the awesome tools that are
included such as our brand new Wi-Fi
pineapple nano and you can find those
details and find all the fun tools with
the land turtle and the USB rubber ducky

being very careful right now because
Kirby she's on the mixer on the video
mixer she can very likely she could
change the cameras right now yeah it's
not going for it good I'm gonna just MV
snugs slash dev slash null oh not again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
