this time on hack five hello everyone
and welcome to your weekly dose of
Technology me Shanna Morris and today we
have some excellent coverage from DEFCON
25 and who are you how are you as his
work what'd I miss this place yes
welcome back
it sounds like stickers and everything I
know this is video it looks just like I
left it you haven't been here in ages
March I think a lot of it half months
Wow
yeah it's almost been half a year the
world is good the world is good it's
nice to be thanked thanks for liking you
did you check on all Ron no you know
what I think you get into your own thing
yeah yeah we'll see when I can resume
that diplomatic mission but for the time
being I'm just going to have a little
layover here and San Francisco for a few
months or something yeah you know I'm
going to stick around for two weeks
before leaving two weeks that's it
absolutely yeah seriously
no no regular episodes are about to
resume with the launch of season 20 will
be our 23rd season I know it's been a
while and it's ten-year anniversary I
hacked five is coming up oh my gosh
you're right yeah and 2008 parenting
2018 oh yeah good times
let's go ahead and get into it with our
first interview from Def Con so I am
here with woody one of my longtime
friends as well as Tim hi Tim how's it
going man it's good to see you nice to
meet you too Woody's nice to have you
back on the show again I'm here at
DEFCON 25 and these two guys found some
really interesting things with a go
tenna so first off for everybody out
there what is it go tena so go tener we
have one here there's actually newer
ones all of our stuff was done on the
original version of it
the way it's set up here - football game
you have a crisis where there's a flood
or there's major storms and you lose
cellular service your Bluetooth talks to
the antenna and then the antenna uses
the mers channels to be able to send
text that you can now travel miles even
with no cellular service or even if you
have a phone that doesn't touch the
cellular network
you use that to be able to send messages
to each other or relay and speak to
people part of it is a non encrypted
protocol and part of it is an encrypted
protocol and we started working with
that so you have to do with the NGO tena
if you have to use it is turn on your
Bluetooth on your phone plug it in I'm
assuming you plug it straight into your
computer or your phone
thanks via Bluetooth however nothing we
did touches the Bluetooth side of it we
were looking strictly at the murder site
because we software-defined radio is
what we were playing with so wait what
were you looking for when you first
started messing with the NGO tena so I
was sitting around bored kind of like
when I started doing iris and I was like
man I wonder if I recorded a message
from a NGO tena could I then replay the
message and have other doe tenez
listened to it and hear it like a relay
attack or something like that
well I would never actually rebroadcast
unless I was in a safe zone because it
does use MERS but I'm assuming it works
okay I see where we're going with this
okay so what did you find when you
started messing with the go tennis so I
called Tim and I go Tim I think this I
think you can do some more stuff with go
Tim and we are initially thinking so he
immediately said well we need to see
ones and zeroes and he came over and we
started playing with the I was using a
hack RF and he brought his radio over
and we started putting things together
and looking at the spectrum analyzer
okay so what did you see with your
spectrum analyzer was there anything
that really stood out to you yeah the
first thing we noticed was it started
out with we knew the channels because we
looked it up on the FCC database we knew
would use 150 megahertz and so we tuned
there and we found out there are five
channels that are used and it was moving
back and forth between the channels
pretty quickly whenever we send in
messages and I was thinking oh no this
is some sort of Bluetooth thing but then
woody noticed that it's always happened
on channel 4 first and I said you've
only seen like three packets there's no
way you can know that it's too fast wait
hold up so you notice that you even with
just three little pack packets are
rather small when they're transferring
over radio so how did you pick that out
so suddenly every time you'd hit sand it
would always pop there first and then
hit the others quickly and I was like
aha
I wondered that too that's got to be a
command channel I bet it's starting
there and Tim sometimes doesn't have he
thinks I'm a unicorn hunter so what
interface were using to actually view
all this information yeah Osman Khan FFT
I've no comm FFT whatsoever yeah we
didn't have to program a single thing to
get it up and going all we had to do was
run Osmo comma 50 and just look at the
waterfall and we found I said I don't
know if I believe you yet what do this I
need I need like through some
repeatability here I'm a scientific man
so we what we did is we turned off one
of the radios and we figured if it's a
control channel what would happen is the
first radio that's starting to talk
would say I'd like to talk to you over
here sort of like a trunk radio system
so then it would go over there and wait
for the other person to acknowledge that
and star like TCP Sendak right so we
figured if there's no acknowledgment
sent maybe you would try again
and what that's exactly what we found it
would sit there on channel 4 hello is
anyone there
I think where'd you go so how many times
did it retry I was about four times
something like that just just enough to
get a good effort but not like at the
expense of battery life so what did you
find when you eventually like started
delving into those so we we had to do a
lot of work to get down to the packet
level we actually had to write a custom
block that would receive packets and and
turn them into little packets to analyze
because the new radio is very stream
oriented so when we got those little
blocks of bytes and data we started to
pull it apart and try and figure out
what are they sending can we see text
and for a broadcast that shouldn't be
encrypted right because how else would
you receive it so we sent just ABC and
we look to see if we could find ABC in
the package sure enough it was there
which is you know that's expected it's a
broadcast packet so as soon as we found
that we knew we had a foothold so you
try at ABC did you try going for like a
step further like ABCD did you find
anything when you did that we did that's
how we found where the length was in the
packet we had to know we've got 50 bytes
or so sitting in front of us which one
tells us how long the packet is because
we need to know that so we my block
knows when to stop receiving bits so so
what happens if you send an encrypted
message over this does anything
different happen well the length isn't
going to go away the radio still has to
know how many bytes is going to receive
it's pretty common to not encrypt the
length just like when you're receiving a
package you know there's a 2 in a from
field and there's a weight to the
package I kind of know how much is
inside that package just by feeling it
so one of the pieces that does happen
with an encrypted packet is the command
channel still tells me what channel all
the communications are going to be on I
can still see see that I can see who
it's going to and I have the ability to
know who it came from so with that
information we can also tell the size of
whatever the payload is although
encrypted we can't see what it is so we
can say you sent this person something
and this is the size of the packet so
tell me a little bit about the phone
numbers because you showed me a slide
from your talk where you can basically
figure out by by the hex code that you
see on there what the phone number might
have been so if you know the OSI stack
there's there's like six or seven layers
in there and the six layer if it's seven
you're right this is so I don't know it
the six layer is the representation
format and so we were really confused we
saw a string of numbers you know
starting with you know nine one two four
or five three and that's what we saw on
the phone but then we didn't see that in
the bytes and so we were trying to
figure out how do how do they encode
that into the bytes and we tried all
these different things trying to match
the bits around and figure out where it
went but it turned out it was really
simple if you just typed in the
hexadecimal bytes into the calculator
and turn them back in the decimal we
would get the packet the I type the
Goten ID for the transmitter and the
receiver I feel like that could have
some serious implications if you're
trying to hide your identity and I feel
like this gets a little confusing for a
lot of people because encryption well I
would say like you said woody that
encryption does not equal anonymity
right absolutely
one thing we want to clarify with the
phone number piece of it is you can use
your phone number as your unique
identifier for your goat in a-- but if
you do it just like it releases the name
of the goat anna's ID the g ID your g ID
that we catch is
the phone number for the to-and-from but
you can change that inside the go tennis
natural protocol as it is and just use
did randomize gid so we highly recommend
people do that but anonymity versus
security if I'm a celebrity and I have a
security detail I am now safe and secure
but I don't have an anima T now if I'm
on the street the same celebrity and I
hide myself and I make it look like I'm
a person you can't recognize I now have
anonymity but I no longer have security
so the two are not always the same right
exactly so where did you go from this
what was the next step also the next
thing is well we found that they weren't
encrypting the the from field and we
sort of looking to try to understand the
protocol and it was it reasonable for
them to say this is the to field and
this is a public information we feel
it's not unreasonable they could go for
a more difficult protocol that would
encrypt that but for something that's
getting off the ground it's a hardware
startup they've got battery-powered
embedded software radios the sec all
encryption all of that we thought it
wasn't too unreasonable for them to have
the to field but the from field when we
saw that never being encrypted even on
private communications we thought hey we
could do something kind of fun here and
and start showing people the messages
that are being sent without having a go
tenon you could sit and you could listen
to the everyone talking so so it's
almost like a man-in-the-middle attack
with your computer sounds sort of like
that exactly we're not really messing
with the data that's going between
people but we're just passively
observing it so you're doing some
reconnaissance basically that's so cool
so what can people do to protect
themselves if they are worried about
their information being intercepted I
one I do want to state I'm Pro go tena I
think it's a great policy especially in
areas where if something goes bad you
can communicate so this is not a dig on
them at all and they do have a new radio
that we haven't had a chance to look at
and test but to protect your identity
one of things you want to do is never
use your phone number as your unique
identifier and the protocol redesign
inside of itself so that you can change
that and the other thing that I would
recommend is if you're trying to do
things or you don't want people to know
that person a is speaking to person B
and person B speaks to these five people
what you need to do is you need to
change your
unique identifier regularly and you did
also find it as you change those unique
identifiers you may want to change them
at different times because we also found
out that it's a time-based sequence that
gives you your unique identifier so if I
hit two phones at the same time they're
just milliseconds apart everything
except the last very section of it is
often again I was told that doesn't
happen but unicorns are real any more
data you just need more data yes exactly
that's what it is confirmed it is
confirmed now okay awesome
I think this is really cool and really
interesting your talk is later this
afternoon I really hope I can go and get
away from the vendor booth if I can't
where can people find more information
on your findings and are you going to
release the code on this back end so
we're going to release the code five
days after Def Con will release on our
Twitter feeds where you can find that
we're doing that because if people are
using their phone numbers we want them
to have a chance to change that before
everyone has access to this and that way
we just think it's more it's going to be
safer for everyone so our twitter
handles you're able to find tim's 'as of
BJT 239 oh four so mine is TB 6 9 RR so
some of you know I have traumatic brain
injuries so 6 9 is nice Oh TB er if you
can't laugh at yourself don't laugh at
anyone that's perfect I love it thank
you both so much and again thank you of
course and thank you for bringing tune
on with you I love checking out the dogs
whenever they come to the convention is
there anything else that we missed that
you would like to share with our
audience I just realized that we did
this whole thing other than own by the
way Tim's the personally says rights
thanks he writes these amazing blocks
but the tools we use for analyzing
packets doing everything else were get
it they were grep cut and sort and
control left using get it and with that
and some basic programs we were able to
do all the packet analysis so you don't
have to have extensive tools to do this
that's awesome and that's something that
happens a lot in the hacker realm of
devices is you have these open source
software that enable you to do amazing
things and I really appreciate what you
guys are doing for the community I think
it's awesome
and if you guys want to find out
anything else we'll put their Twitter
handles and the show notes as well as
the lower thirds thank you guys so much
I'll start on going pretty great are you
hungover yet I was younger days hahahaha
meteorite is got a great idea
bring it to the web the way we do and
head over to domain comm we've got a
slick domain discovery system and an
easily checkout process so your site
will be online in no time
and the domain.com guys have been
supporting hack five years and they want
to celebrate with a massive promo code
use a JK jumbo with 35% off new domain
registration now through November 30th
it's a limited time offer so when you
think domain names think domain.com
hey everybody I'm here at DEFCON 25 with
Anthony Anthony how are you doing today
I'm good how are you I'm very good so
Anthony is one of my good friends he's
also a patreon on threat wires if you
want to check it out it's patreon.com
slash threat wire something we have been
talking about on that show a lot lately
has been voter registration databases
there was currently a leak from the GOP
databases of tons of personal
information and I think this is very
important just because like I do online
shows I don't necessarily want my info
out there especially since I've had a
real world stalker so like you found
something crazy that you can do with
that right yeah absolutely you can take
the public information that put out
there by the government like the voter
registration database and you know the
county auditor websites and things like
that and you can resolve those into
personal information like social media
profiles pretty easily so how do you do
this kind of stuff so I for some states
it'll be more difficult because they
don't let you download the information
but for the state that I researched
which was Ohio they the Secretary of
State's website allows you to download
the full Ohio registration databases in
fact they updated every single week so
it's always up-to-date wait so you're
saying all like addresses names what
kind of information is in these
databases so it actually has 99 columns
as far as I saw I think it was about 99
columns that I counted but the main ones
are going to be like first name last
middle name date of birth home address
your party affiliation things like that
those are the big ones they have your
county and zip code and stuff in there
too but you can use that information by
itself it's already pretty nasty because
you can you can search for elderly
people or young people you know who
knows what people can do with those you
know that information you'd be able to
steal steal Social Security checks or
you know maybe or you know if there's
predators targeting you know young
people there's that capability but
unfortunately that's not the end of it
you're also able to take that
information and resolve it
pretty confidently to like base book
profiles which then you can get you know
their interests and their sexual
orientation and you know they're a bunch
of other information pictures and
location this is really scary so uh what
kind of script did you create for the
ability to resolve these as Facebook
profiles so I built a just a demo
application it started out as a demo
application called Alohomora and I'm
releasing it tomorrow yeah right exactly
so I'm it's written in c-sharp it's
pretty simple I and I try to comment
everything so people want to go in and
hack with it they can but it's just a
tool and it lets you go both ways it
lets you take the voter if you want to
search for 18 year olds on your street
or people that voted Republican or
whatever and try and resolve their
Facebook pages you can do that but you
can also go to Facebook inside of the
application and search for people that
work for my local police department or
people that work for nuclear power
plants or whatever and import those
profiles into the tool and then resolve
their home address through the voter
database you can it also has a people
API plug-in which gets you their email
and phone number relationships and all
that stuff and it builds a nice target
profile for you so why did you build
this because I feel like this is it's
incredibly scary to have that info out
there so why would you make it public
right so I was on the fence for a long
time about releasing this but I think
it's important and I people in the
InfoSec field we know it's an issue we
know it's a problem
and we tend to not put stuff on the web
that would lead us to this issue but um
the average Joe doesn't know that or
they don't care they think oh you know
what somebody going to do with my my
profile you know on Facebook well one
one example that I've given people is if
if like an agency finds out that you
have medical conditions and for some
reason the ACA didn't exist and you
could be denied insurance because you
had a pre-existing condition like you
could end up paying thousands of dollars
for health care because you were denied
insurance strictly because your public
information was out there and that's
something that could really hurt a
crapload of people to be honest yeah
absolutely it's it's a real danger and I
hope that through this application that
we can maybe get some people interested
in changing the laws because that's the
real problem the problem isn't so much
that people are putting this information
on the web people are dumb they're going
to do that it happens the real problems
are one Facebook shouldn't be defaulting
making all their person all their things
public like that should be default
private and you should have to opt in to
make it public if they were just to flip
that switch then 99.9% of this would go
away but the also the other big problem
is that the government database the
government shouldn't be releasing
databases of information like your
traffic violations which have your first
last middle date of birth and your home
address and your you know you the voter
database which has all the information
and you know if I buy a house there or
if I register my license my dog like
these things shouldn't be public and I
completely agree with you and I'm yeah I
hope that the laws will change in
honestly this has happened before and
it's probably going to happen in if you
remember Firesheep the the guy that
created Firesheep
he had the same thing where he wanted to
release it he was on the fence about it
he didn't necessarily know if it was
going to go a good way or bad way but
then when he released it SSL became a
better thing you know better things
happen in security when you release that
information and say hey this is a
problem it needs to be fixed immediately
and it is a problem I completely agree
with you and I'm so glad that you
brought
fashion-forward and that you're making
it you're making us aware you're making
us aware that that's an issue so where
can people find more information about
you and about what you're doing right so
if you want more information about me or
if you want to follow my projects you
can follow me on twitter at Russell comm
or you can go to my my tech blog dotnet
Russell calm and I believe you're doing
a talk so is that going to be recorded
and on the DEF CON channel yes
so I'm doing a talk in the Recon village
on this and that'll be recorded and put
out and my slide deck will be on my
github along with all the code for a
little more Oh that'll be out there as
well perfect thank you so much Anthony
really really appreciate it and if you
guys want to learn more you know where
to find them well that just about wraps
up this week's episode of hacks v osss I
mention there is no teleprompter and
other than integral now we didn't it
says end graph we didn't write anything
we're just throwing to the content all
right that's right again I know how to
do this okay done this before
you got that all right well that just
about wraps up this week's episode of
hack 5 but before we get going see you
do the you do the poop with the throw
right again I love it I know this we
want to remind you guys that the best
way to support hack 5 is to head over to
our very own hack shop over a check a
shop comm that is where the gigantic Def
Con booth has now made its way back into
its mothership home at the warehouse at
home it's Jerry yes we've got awesome
stuff from that lot we've got all of the
swag from Def Con is being printed so
that we can have it into the store all
the time awesome look for into the kid
risky bands yes yes which we're actually
really cute and worked great as a little
like hair scrunchies so this is what I
do can this is what I do on the plane
just every time I fly everything I'm
like a just bitch you need that and a
gin and tonic yeah done
that's all you need and some melatonin
oh yeah unless you're going to Australia
where it's like a controlled substance
which I was not aware of whoop smuggler
also make sure to checkout hk5 org
that's where you can find all the
information about whatever we are up to
our schedules conventions that we're
planning to go to etc such as well as
our social networks which is also where
we post information on what we are up to
and all of the shows so you can find
Shannon on hack tip and tech thing and
fret wire and hack five tax time and I
talked to move exhibition that it's
played many can overlay going so very
excited so good stuffs in the works and
so yeah I expect some cool changes here
real soon yeah I'm still then we want to
remind you as always
trechie take a look I haven't done that
in so long
we got the audio to land on the music
out in the warehouse I'm all Greg keke
haha evil servers here for scaring off
Houston evil server has been watching me
record episodes in here since he left
you've been watching like out of the
corner of my approval I know he's been
sitting there the whole time and he
watches every have a floppy drive oh my
god actually that would be really useful
because somebody gave me a floppy drive
at Def Con I don't know we should make
sure he's our guy
yeah we better be our deaf I think you J
what are they running on Celeron Oh God
well OS pure evil pure readable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
