ITT vigilantes are on the rise and Intel
devices can be pwned all that coming up
now on threat wire greetings I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire from May
2nd 2017 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom if you have not checked out our
patreon yet please do so we have lots
that we want to do for the show but of
course we can't do it without your
support my next goal is to add a monthly
Q&amp;amp;A which is exclusively just for our
patrons and we are going to also upgrade
our threat wire set new camera is
definitely on my list patreon.com slash
threat wire is the place to support
threat wire and the link is in the show
notes now on to our first story FCC
Chairman a GTI is wasting absolutely no
time on removing net neutrality ideas by
the way he's on Twitter so in case you
want to share your thoughts or opinions
toward him or maybe just throw shade I'm
just saying he's there for the taking
net neutrality has been on PI's chopping
blocks since before he was chairman he's
publicly spoken up against what we
consider an important part of Internet
freedom which is the ability for
consumers to access content equally
without ISP favoritism the FCC released
a 400 page document on Wednesday last
week detailing their new plans which
include allowing ISPs to give or sell
access to sites that pay them while
blocking or slowing down others the
original FCC 2015 open Internet order
protected those key features of Internet
freedom while pious FCC is intending to
get rid of them now there is a 58 page
fact sheet which is publicly available
and linked down in the show notes for
you to read the FCC claims that before
the adoption of the Obama era net
neutrality ruling ISPs flourished new
networks were constructed at faster
paces and high-speed Internet access was
available at affordable rates
I don't know mine 60 bucks I think it's
rather affordable right now they want to
go back to this early 2000s era internet
plan where government has a very light
touch control over Internet access and
they want to allow ISPs to determine
what is best for them the FCC argues
quote in the title to order despite
virtually no quantifiable evidence of
consumer harm the Commission
nevertheless determined that it needed
bright-line rules banning three specific
practices by providers both fixed and
mobile broadband internet access service
blocking throttling and paid
prioritization so blocking legal sites
throttling sites and paid favoritism by
ISPs doesn't harm consumers I mean I
really don't I don't need an analyst
statistical study to tell you that
that's kind of a bad idea there is a lot
of questionable content in the public
draft issued by the FCC and not enough
time here to cover every single bit of
it but it's pretty interesting so highly
suggest that you read it public comments
are permitted via the FCC website
officially starting May 18th but you can
already go there and comment if you want
to with a deadline of July 17th quality
over quantity for the comments is
recommended though I am rather skeptical
about how much weight they will actually
carry in the FCC's final vote not
surprising is the huge amount of
comments on the FCC site that are
obviously copied and pasted into the
page from American commitment which is
the same group that called net
neutrality Marxist back in 2014 a second
activist group has begun the scene
commenting where they're just copying
and pasting and coincidentally as I was
writing this report the FCC site crashed
and stopped loading isn't that strange
hopefully it is back up when this
episode post so that we can start our
own flood of quality non copy and paste
and comments wouldn't you say on the
other side of the spectrum I never
thought I would say that is the NSA what
yeah so starting in 2008 the NSA was
using section 702 of the FISA Act to spy
on foreign targets outside of the US
part of section 702 and FISA also
allowed for something called downstream
spying which is basically prism back in
the day except they just decided to
rebrand it and then upstream spying
which is communications that are - from
or about a specific target which could
include the targets email address in the
texture of the body of an email that is
related between two persons that are not
targets
sells and not related to the entire
investigation so during the enactment of
FISA two incidents occurred where the
NSA had to report unwillingly collection
of data from u.s. people that were not
targeted but just happen to be a part of
that collection after considering
current technological requirements
mission needs and privacy interest the
NSA has decided to stop including any an
upstream about collection in their data
they will also be deleting data that was
previously required in this section now
you may think I have never contacted or
included a criminal in my emails I'm
perfectly fine got nothing to worry
about why should I worry my pretty
little head about privacy so not
necessarily actually email providers
group email traffic together during
transit and that bundle of emails is
picked up by the NSA in one big grouping
instead of just separated out one by one
and specifically targeted this was a
concern back in 2011 when it was
reported and affixed was attempted by
moving those bundles the emails to a
separate repository for analysis but it
turns out also analysis weren't
searching them correctly and they can
look at private emails from people who
had nothing to do with the investigation
so they didn't really fix it now while
this is a step in the right direction to
stop those about emails from being
collected towards better privacy
protections for US citizens it does not
solve the NSA's technical problems for
investigations at most I kind of
consider it a band-aid on an act that
needs to be replaced not amended also I
do want to mention PGP pretty good
privacy that is pretty good it's not
perfect but at least it's something if I
look really hot it's because I am it is
super hot in the studio today because we
finally got decent temperatures here in
the Bay Area but anyway moving on I have
a team botnets those are still prevalent
but we are starting to see some new
surges this past week first off there
was Bricker bot which bricks Internet of
Things devices whenever it infects them
and it's had a resurgence so Pascal
demons documented the newest instance
which he dubbed brick or bot point three
and point four which started on April
20th it has spurred a little under 1,400
attacks at his own research honeypot at
the time of recording and just like
Mirai these
attacked badly secured cameras DVRs and
other internet of things devices deci
matrix over on our patreon account
points to an article about the attacker
who calls him or herself janitor who
claims to have bricked two million
devices since January with brick robot
according to janitor the source code for
this has not been leaked and it is still
being used to this day with that said
two other vigilantes have come onto the
scene to help with securing IOT devices
or so we think
first is CloudFlare the infrastructure
company who have been working on a fix
for 18 months
they are calling their new service orbit
which works like a VPN for IOT devices
that CloudFlare were used to set up a
virtual patch for the device or block
connectivity from malicious devices to
the vulnerable one obviously a drawback
of this would be putting all of your
trust into CloudFlare service the second
vigilante is hajime it's still kind of
like hajima Mazda and Hajime I believe
means beginning in Japanese so I'm
pronouncing it that way if that's
incorrect well too bad
aji may is a white or gray hat botnet
that has infected at least 300,000
devices so far and works on a
decentralized network to issue encrypted
updates to those infected devices while
also blocking ports that are normally
used as attack vectors and it lacks
beat-off capability with that said
though can you trust it is there any
sort of backdoor capability I'll know so
far it has not been malicious in any way
but is this a Trojan horse waiting for
the right moment waiting to attack so
many things that then it can attack
everybody else the best way to be safe
for anybody is for the owner of an
Internet of Things device to actually go
in and change the password and update
the firmware on the physical said device
not necessarily wait for a stranger to
do it for you in a confirmed briefing
from Intel on May first Intel active
management technology standard
manageability and small business
technology firmwares can be hacked
remotely this affects any device with
AMT is M or SBT abilities from Nahal M 2
KB Lake or copy Lake depending on which
PR person you talk to where the remote
management is turned on firmware patches
were released by Intel on
25th to OEM if you have a MT or is M
turned on on those business devices
disable them until the firmware is
available through your manufacturer the
attack could still be used locally even
with remote capabilities turned off
though now while normal consumers don't
necessarily need to worry about this on
your home laptops and stuff this can
affect companies that have security
systems like ATMs medical devices
digital signs secure cameras etc etc
