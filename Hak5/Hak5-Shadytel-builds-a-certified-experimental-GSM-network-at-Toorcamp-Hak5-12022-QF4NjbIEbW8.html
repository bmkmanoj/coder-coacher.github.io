by dice calm there isn't any internet
access out here or at least in the range
of the sponsor cabins at tor camp and
I've resorted to reading these um
because they're like paper blogs so like
this is just it's just like an ordinary
blog post except you can't like you
can't pinch and zoom or anything and if
you want to comment like you have to
like mail something takes a while so
pretty linear to snow search function or
hashtags but it works you just you keep
flipping you know AB block is a little
bit more difficult but yeah I will say
though layout is beautiful i love layout
so here's a fantastic observation about
hacking these guys over here this this
whole unit here houses 24 or 25 of these
1 watt lasers and they projected it up
into the sky and it was absolutely
gorgeous and the whole thing required
approval from the FAA to do and
meanwhile over here the shady tell guys
have an entire cell network built they
had to get approval from the FCC and
it's like what just happened here when'd
attacking you know like I thought we
were just you know having fun with the
FBI now we're having fun with all sorts
of governmental agencies that is so cool
so what are you breaking down right now
I am breaking down shady tells gsm
telephone network we set up a cell phone
network for this camp they took about 12
hours to set up once we pulled pulled in
with the car and it was running for four
days yeah yeah so what does it take put
together a telephone network it takes a
lot of equipment as it turns out we've
got some fun stuff here on the site so
one thing we've got is is a computer in
a bin because it's a bin and then on top
of that is a a 1 T 1 switch that is a
device that takes in a bunch of a bunch
of lines it's got a ather nets which
it's got a t1 switch it has some serial
ports and it's basically it's sort of
like a linksys router for a cell phone
site yeah yeah so I've got one card
inside the pc if you look at it this
card right there is the e 1 t1 card it's
a Chinese knockoff of a Digium card like
you can buy for asterisk Scott's about
130 bucks on eBay and then that spits
out one line out to here and then that
line gets split out into a bunch of
different lines each one for each base
station oh no way yeah and so how many
subscribers can it handle at once well
each base station can handle up to seven
concurrent calls at once and a more or
less unlimited number of subscribers
it's basically limited by the amount of
traffic that their that they're sending
and so was the load like here load was
uh I didn't really know what to predict
um we predicted that everybody would you
be using their phone heavily and so we
thought we'd need for base stations I
was a little lighter than that because
not everyone use their phone and they
didn't use it super heavily so we got
away with two what about the actual RF
like how do
can you go about that oh that's fun so
this right here is a I can hold this
this right here is a 2 wat base station
it's got two transmitters this is on
loan from Jacob Appelbaum that actually
we didn't use because we we weren't able
to make it happy but up on the tower
over there you can see there is there's
to shrink wrap base stations and that's
what we used for the actual network and
so this isn't like open BTS where you
use for example a usrp from etis and
kind of like hack together some stuff
with asterisk this is the the legit
stuff that the telcos use yeah this is
actual telco gear we were using open BSC
which is a which is by some German guys
um awesome o'clock in BSC stand for it
stands for open base station controller
and the base station controller is the
piece of hardware software mix that
talks to all the radios and make sure
that they're in sync and doing the right
thing and how do you go about getting
the hardware for that uh you just gotta
know the right people as it turns out ok
yeah it's it's not the sort of thing
that you can find for sale on ebay very
often I mean occasionally you can but
more often it's it's it's it's sort of a
low demand low supply sort of thing yeah
and so what frequencies is operating on
we're running an SM we're running gsm
1900 megahertz which is us high band is
it but there's a bunch of GSM
frequencies there's 850 and 1900 are
used in the US and 900 and 1800 are used
in Europe and so that's not like you
know at the is M band or some of the
free unlicensed spectrum no do you go
about legally operating a telephone
network on that spectrum we got
permission from the FCC turns out that
if you give them sixty dollars and wait
a month or two and you tell them what
you're going to be doing and where
they're probably going to give you an
experimental license if you ask nicely
enough that is so cool yeah and what's
the next step after that I mean are you
able to you know do something more
permanent we'd like to we'd like to make
this more more easily deployable and
look unless crashy we also like to bring
it to more conferences yeah yeah so what
about the you know this seems to be like
a thing that's like just now popping up
just a week ago at Def Con there was a
shady tell no that was ninja town we're
shady tell Jenna so I actually put the
the shady tell sim in the ninja
telephone to see if they might fight
that worked yeah what about what kind of
wood easy next coming for like you know
hacker phone service oh dear there
there's been some talk of setting up
roaming between the two between multiple
conferences so you can take sims from
one place and keep your number and go
somewhere else there's there some of
that in in the German CCC network where
you can keep the network keep the number
across conferences or across years of
chaos camp but I'd like to set that up
for all conferences and make sure that
that is consistent that would be really
cool nice who was the biggest challenge
in setting this up oh dear planning
really yeah planning and figuring out
hardware it wasn't isn't code it wasn't
no actually I wrote I wrote a bunch of
code but it wasn't finished in time yeah
and what was the inspiration behind the
the Porta Potty telephone with the
that's that's an innovation of the chaos
camp as well they called them data
toilets I'm not super fond of the idea
because our eyes kept overheating
because I guess we did it wrong yeah
maybe you need some liquid cooling in
the data toilet no that's a terrible
idea III think that if I if I were have
to have a choice I would be really need
to have a telephone booth with rackmount
ears in it oh I love that that is so
wicked thank you so much Duncan yeah my
pleasure real fantastic thing you guys
are doing here i hope to see this more
and more at different camps and so you
know i'm sure that you did a bajillion
you know hours of research oh yeah and
so maybe you could give some pointers
anybody else is just wanting to kind of
scratch the surface and start digging
around in building phone networks well
anything that any resources that popped
up that that you found super useful
resources the popped up
no I just I just read a lot yeah you
guys yeah going through the actual like
specifications I'm printed out a bunch
of the actual specs about four inches
worth and those are actually relatively
easy to read and they're they're open
access which is nice I'm cdma is not
open access oh really yeah okay so with
GSM it's actually pretty inviting 20 you
want to be a phone company you want to
use gsm yeah you want to you aren't
writer from scratch sure go ahead and do
all the work I'm not completely sure of
CDMA is not open access but I seem to
recall it being hard to get it's kind of
like ldap versus active directory yeah
it sounds about right yes gsm is an open
european standard from 1989 and it's
interesting stuff nice well thanks so
much really appreciate it absolutely
guys calm is the careered hub for tech
in the last 20 years they've been
