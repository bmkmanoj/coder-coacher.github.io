go further with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES 2013 at digital
experience and I found obutu I mean who
doesn't love a boon to I know all you
guys do and I'm here with mr. Richard
Collins thank you so much for joining me
today you guys have this new ubuntu
phone we've heard so much about it and
we have it right here to show off to you
guys now what makes this so awesome ok
so this is as you've just told everybody
the the new ubuntu phone OS that we
launched here at CES is there this week
so i can't see the phone with the
microphone oh sorry reverse all right
yeah but so this is this is going to
take you quick demo so i'll just take
you through up so this is our welcome
screen so as you can see it's it's got a
very distinctive design this particular
example is showing the Twitter activity
of the user on a particular day so but
it could just as easily say suggest
something around a number of phone calls
made and reveals receives so it's it's
just something we've designed as part of
the smartphone experience that's kind of
neat very nicely designed and very
personalized the other thing about this
phone is that it doesn't have any soft
keys or hard keys so we're using all
four edges of the phone in terms of
allowing the user access to all of the
features and functions of the system
itself so we think this is very
distinctive or a unique it's something
that certainly the conventional
operating systems don't employ in their
user experience designs so this is
something that you know we feel is you
know a very interesting part to what
we've done with the phone OS now I think
this is something that open to has
really had to jump into I love the fact
that you guys are doing this and I've
been really excited about it myself
being a linux user at work for hak5 now
coming from the linux operating system
on a regular computer with ubuntu like
12 point 10 and
all the newest upgraded ones how does
this compare with that is it would it be
really easy for me to jump into it yeah
absolutely so the the ambition that
we've had for a pantsuit for some time
is to introduce up into to run on it
over a large number of different
different devices so we've been very
successful on desktop OS last year we
launched a bun 230v where this is
obviously a bunt for smartphones and we
were looking at a bunch of a tablet so
the way in which we're engineering those
ubuntu across those phone factors is to
ensure that it's pretty much the same
code base that's running across that
same family devices so the UI for
example is pretty much the same code
base that will work on the TV the
desktop the tablet etc so we're making
it very very straightforward and very
very easy for you know for developers
now i know we have a lot of IT users as
well a lot of hackers out there and
internet and forensics lots of IT guys
out there that would love to get their
hands on this would this be really
useful for them in a work environment so
one way in which we've we believe we've
got particular advantages with our
smartphone product strategy if you like
is to enable the the phone OS to run on
quite powerful hardware such that once
that phone is docked to a desktop
monitor it would also run the full
Ubuntu desktop OS as well so you have a
really fully converged device in the
sense that when you're on the move it's
a it's a phone but that same hardware
can also act as your your desktop as
well so you have a bun to desktop OS on
your phone you have ubuntu smartphone s
and you don't you no longer need a
laptop if you like you can have the
phone to run as i say i've been to as a
phone platform as well as a pc as well
as a pc platform oh my god I'm so
excited when it when it can I actually
get my hands on this on the operating
system do you have any hardware coming
out as well with this or is it going
to be something you can port so we're
taking a very specific approach in terms
of how we start to progress things here
on so in the next few weeks we'll be
releasing the the code base for the demo
that we've been showing here at CES so
all the hackers all the developers all
of our a bunch of friends can get hold
of that code base and there will be an
ISO image as part of that to allow them
to install it on my galaxy nexus phone
that would be the recommended hardware
that worm that we suggest beyond that
you know we want to continue to work
with handset manufacturers and carriers
and we're working to a timeframe whereby
we will allow them to ship their phones
running the ubuntu OS to retailers at
the end of this year beginning of next
year oh I'm really looking forward to
that but I got to be honest hey Paul
that Nexus that you have in your pocket
this might be the next thing that we
show on hak5 I'm just thinking about
that future segment I think so thank you
so much richer for Chen with me about
this nexus boon or the xubuntu phottix
so excited to check this out myself I
can't wait until I see this on the
market now you said a few weeks right a
few weeks yeah so we don't have a
specific date just yet but honestly and
truthfully it will be a very very soon
as to when focus between get access to
this this code base themselves yes with
act 5 i'm shared of horse and you can
find all of our coverage at revision
3.com thank you i'm here at the Ford
booth at CES 2013 with ed how are you
doing a Darren I was gone and we're
checking out the TDK what is a TD k I'm
just do an SDK let it run it to DK TDK
is a technology development kit that
developers can get for you know appling
and labeling their abs
set up you know buying a vehicle or if
they already have when they can use an
existing one so this is a TDK you
basically have all the same interfaces
as you would a normal vehicle you got
the screen you got a center stack with
all the different buttons pretty set on
scored back as well as some car
simulation toggles so you can turn the
car off open doors set it to go forward
and reverse haven't parked or not part
so what kind of partners have you guys
teamed up with to enable apps to come to
port right so I mean everybody knows you
know a lot of the music streaming apps
like pandora radio slacker and PR we
also did some navigation based apps
scout from tell a now we have our own
sink destinations and we'll be at bat
I'm a whole slew of more coming out you
know every every few months awesome
working our hackers find a developer
network to start coding up some awesome
stuff is pretty easy just like
everything else developer for calm there
we go all right and with all of that I
want to thank once again Ford for
powering our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
