transfer files between two computers
without USB Ethernet Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
and this time we're going old school and
using audio oh yeah this segment of hak5
is brought to you by goto assist now
continuing my search for esoteric ways
to transmit files between two computers
of course I looked at the obvious like
hey we could use you know serial
Bluetooth but now I want to really go
analog here and that's not the last one
with QR codes and webcams were pretty
good but you know would be even better
using something basic like DTMF or
dual-tone multi-frequency you guys may
remember that as touch-tone from
old-school landline phones
oh yeah harkening back to my phone freak
days or the other idea was even to use
CW or continuous way of the hams and the
audience know I'm talking about you
probably know it as Morse code
unfortunately though Morse code while
still is awesome today as it was in 1836
it doesn't support more than
case-insensitive insensitive those in
sensitive cases they're all uppercase
alphanumeric characters so yeah PGP
messages obviously that's not gonna work
they rely on ASCII which includes
uppercase lowercase numbers letters you
know special characters and I think it's
still worth mentioning though that Morse
code is pretty cool and useful and you
know can be transmitted and received
with Linux pretty easily
the FCC used to require it for amateur
radio licenses but Morse code
proficiency was actually dropped in 2007
but still it's really cool I figured
that I could actually fire it up an old
copy of Ubuntu did this because of some
esoteric driver problems with pulseaudio
and the old-school OSS that
notwithstanding check this out
there is an awesome a program here let
me find on my desktop cold CW text right
CW text is wicked basically you can use
it to let's see echo hello world to CW
text and there we go we get our dits and
DAHS so with this alright sure that's
just a ski in the command prompt but CW
text also comes with C
WPC em or pulse code modulation this
allows us to actually generate audio out
of this so for example if we were to go
ahead and echo hello world into it with
a couple of parameters and pipe it to
slash dev slash DSP again that's the
reason for the old version of Ubuntu we
would actually be able to get it to go
make some fun tones so check this out
echo SOS and pipe that into CW PCM with
a frequency of 3200 and a word rate of I
don't know 100 words per minute and then
send that over to slash dev slash DSP
and take a look how many of course we
can do that with something a lot longer
like hello world I'm sorry but I just
think that's damn cool it's not really
gonna be helpful in this scenario
because what we really want is ASCII so
yes effectively to transmit ASCII from
one computer to another we're gonna have
to move up a little bit as far as modern
encoding schemes are concerned and well
you know what this is actually an
awesome opportunity to break out sound
modem and get into a x.25 networking and
actually save that for another day
instead we're gonna turn back to the old
days of Bell tones and frequency shift
keying that's right we're going back to
baud rates and modems so a modem is just
a modulator demodulator typically over a
plain old telephone system you may
remember your old 56k modem but before
that the original modems used a really
primitive technique of just alternating
between two audio frequencies with you
know the corresponding two different
bits say a 1 and a 0 these symbols were
actually measured by their baud rate or
how many symbols per second
the first commercial modems were the
bell 101 and 1958 and Bell 103 in 1962
they operated at 110 baud and 300 baud
respectively man that Bell 103 was
pretty sophisticated without a pair of
frequencies where the calling part
a pair of frequencies for the answering
party little tribute here it's actually
really cool that the reason for all of
this was because back in the day only
AT&amp;amp;T equipment could be connected to the
telephone network and no I'm not going
to descend into a rant about proprietary
networks and state endorse monopolies
just suffice it to say the brilliant
hack of the time was actually to use an
acoustic coupler basically some suction
cups with a microphone and a headset
that allowed you to you know if you've
ever seen the movie wargames you know
I'm talking about pick up the handset
put it on this device and just
acoustically like we're about to do with
two machines transfer some data Oh makes
me so happy okay now to give you some
perspective at 300 baud the average HD
episode of hak5 weighing in at about a
gigabyte would take the mirror 330 days
to download a megabyte is about eight
hours at 300 baud so yeah thankfully
we're not transmitting any things so
huge as megabytes we're just doing short
PGP messages so this actually should be
pretty sufficient and for that I turn to
an awesome Linux utility called mini
modem so let's just go ahead and dive
right into the demo I've set up this
machine here with mini modem and if I
cat message from for Bob text at a ski
that we can we can see there's our PGP
message there and just for illustrative
purposes so that we can see this on one
screen and not have to do anything fancy
with the video switcher I'm going to
send it to itself but this the same
principle applies if I were to say hold
this machine to that machine or anything
like that we're really doing it over the
air as it were so in this case what I'm
going to do is set mini modem on one
terminal on the left to transmit and on
the other terminal on the right to
receive so let's check it out so on our
receiving computer we do mini modem
tak-tek Rx for receive and then ASCII
for our encoding type and we're going to
do it a hundred and ten baud because
we're going classic here and then on our
sending computer will do again mini
modem
with the transmitted flag again ascii
for encoding type and 110 baud
do this I'm not gonna really get
anything other than a cursor but if I
type say hello world
and we'll go ahead and set our receive
when you hit enter oh yeah there we go
and we'll close both of those out so of
course you know the message integrity
could be increased if from our computer
to computer we used an audio cable it
wouldn't make as good and as annoying as
a demonstration but it is still really
fun let's go ahead and continue this and
send over our PGP message so in this
case I will cat message for Bob text ASC
see that file right there and pipe that
over to mini modem transmitted will try
300 baud this time go a little bit
faster will actually do ASCII 300 baud
and then over on our receiving computer
let's change that over to 300 baud
and
all right I'm gonna stop that for a sec
and you can see what's going on here is
we're actually not getting a really good
signal I mean obviously we're not using
a cable between these or anything and so
we'll see we get we get little dots when
it's not sure what exactly the data was
so now here we got four oh we're not
sure Dec 8 we're not sure
and over-the-air from one computer to
another really what I've found in my
testing is that you need to use a baud
rate of a hundred and ten or less it
actually gets really fun when say for
example we'll just echo something will
echo high over at say ten baud and
actually if we do it this slow you're
actually going to hear the bits this is
pretty amazing so there we go is that
obnoxious yes it is but is it cool
affirmative what do you guys think are
you ready to hot glue your USB ports and
take a step back to 1960s analog
technology let me know in the comments
or email us directly feedback hak5 org
you can also find my PGP key hack v dot
org slash keys slash Daren and be sure
to check out I have a bunch of further
reading in the show notes over at hack 5
org I'm really excited about this we're
gonna try some more of this stuff later
with free space optics so stay tuned but
first we're gonna take a quick break and
thank one of our sponsors
seems these days everyone is working in
the cloud from so many different devices

of the week this one comes from Kevin he
dragged a tough book all the way through
India and he sent us a series of photos
from his trip he went to a security
researcher Khan in Goa it was a great
ride he jerry-rigged a lot of rap and
made it through the country with about
$40 a day including buying three prepaid
cellular lines to 3G data's and one
voice and he had no reservations or
bookings either i Kevin I have to
applaud you that's crazy I don't know if
I could go somewhere without having
reservations I'm way too organized you
can always send your photos over to
feedback at hack 5 orgs thank you so
much Kevin gonna do it without you guys
and remember to use the subject line
tech no less so that we can find them
easily and we can share them in next
week's episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
