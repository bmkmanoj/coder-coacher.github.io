this episode of pack 5 is brought to you
by windows azure go to assist express
and domain com hello welcome to hack 5
my name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse of course if your weekly dose of
technol list and that's a kinder egg
yeah it's episode 3 9000 did you melt it
oh it was sitting next to you oh no
hahaha hungry is melting don't let it
mess up the toy you got over oh no it's
doing do we anyway stay tuned to the end
of the episode I don't know they're not
just turn in the end the episode one
time I went to Italy and I got a little
scampering and it says ciao this
probably is they probably didn't tune it
for that ciao I'm sure you didn't why
can't we get kinder eggs in the frickin
us well they're blank because we have
non edible compulsion oh don't make me
start okay what makes the American kids
not smart enough to know not to put that
in their mouth compared to the kids in
Europe for the canary get smarter all
the stupid ones okay now and then they
die and then all the you know it's like
natural selection survival of the kid
that didn't swallow their like toy it's
not cool it's cool no it's not cuz I was
not able to live with those let's do
hacker headlines okay fine alright
Google's reporting on their blog this
week that they've uncovered a targeted a
campaign to collect the passwords
through a phishing attack amongst the
marks are US government officials asian
country's military personnel and
journalists now the campaign appears to
have originated in China
and it affects gmail accounts google has
disrupted the campaign and they are
urging people to go ahead and improve
their security by using an enabling the
two-step verification which is awesome
by the way and if you didn't see that
you should totally go back a couple
episodes and two-step verification okay
anyway if you ever wanted to stream
torrents through iphone without having
to download them or you just wanted to
stream them at all the work of hacker
sohail prasad might make this the case
he's working on an app that will be
available at now street am now stream
soon that'll grab a torrent link and
it'll pass it into the applications
interface and start streaming the media
whether it be video music or whatever
sohail is currently trying to figure out
a legal standpoint for this app because
he doesn't mean any harm but we'll see
if it actually makes it into any of the
app stores I hope it does that'd be cool
what's not good following the breach of
our essays network defense contractors
are beginning to be targeted with
supposed inside knowledge of the securid
technologies north of Bremen they're
joining l-3 communications as well as
Lockheed Martin on the list of victims
of the former abruptly shut down to
their remote access to their network and
instituted a domain name and password
reset across the entire organization
ouch oh that's not good those looks now
although Google is totally about open
software development and they're cool
with you rooting your device they aren't
so cool with you renting movies on those
rooted devices hmm that's not good users
that have been trying to watch renting
movies from the Android Marketplace may
see a pop-up that says something like
failed to fetch license for a movie tile
or 49 I found never had an issue but it
seems like this is a malicious video
issue well you know what the thing is
links all that's gonna that's not gonna
prevent any piracy whatsoever it's just
going to it's not at all it's just gonna
make it just gonna make it more
difficult well I can't rent it legally
I'm just gonna do with it mmm works out
I hope that they fix this wall and you
know release it you want to see
something really really cool yes hak5
your jmaxxx wrote in to demonstrate a
pretty nifty motorola xoom exploit is
uncovered basically the tab
encryption that is to say if you need
like a pin to access it but it has a low
battery you can hit the button about
battery usage and then get into the
settings menu enable debugging then push
whatever software you want / adb with
the USB port that detective thanks Jay
metal of loc and physical attacks that's
that's pretty awesome well that's it for
the hacker headlines and now it's time
for Kirby's internet meme of the week
more chocolate
do you have what it takes to compete in
are correct the code challenge brought
to you by go to assist express test your
skills in our private lab network and
bid for the title of supreme late axe or
winners will be featured on a future
episode of hak5 our next event will be
on sunday june 19th at ten a.m. pacific
visit hak5 dot org slash challenge for
all of the details it will be live
streaming at hak5 org slash live
throughout the day so I'll see you there
until then I'd like to thank our
wonderful sponsor go to assist express
for making it all possible as you know
there are a variety of tools on the
market that let you remotely work on
another person's computer but the only
one I trust and rely on is go to assist
express brought to you by citrix the
reason well the exceptional performance
the ease of use and well it's not to get
the security no I T maintenance or
updating is required and so fast you'll
be viewing your clients computer and
troubleshooting in just seconds plus
support clients computers even when
they're not at their computers I go to
us express free for 30 days for the
special offer visit go to assist calm /
hak5
honestly guys the last time I shared my
real programming it was on a five and a
quarter inch floppy and it was a dot
bass file but I hear things have changed
and that's what Jason what's up man she
want us how to do in the cloud right yes
absolutely with Microsoft Azure all
right yeah it's it's this new exciting
cloud thing that everyone's talking
about I like the cloud stuff and you
like the programming stuff so let's mash
it up and baylor game on well we got
this whole big project laid out I love
the idea paint me the picture of the
project because I'm super stoked about
this so I will paint you the picture of
the prom so we're going to take kismet
look or or mess someone some blur thank
you or net stay nuts tumblr and we're
going to take their KML files that they
generate which is a mapped xml version
of google made a standard called kml i
think google it or the geo standards
body made it anyway um they may hold
markup language that's keyhole markup
language because keyhole was originally
google earth so it is in fact a guy
google anyway there's made by the
company they bought maybe brother coming
to the latke hall so keyhole it's XML
with data and what we really care about
is the fact that you know what's really
cool netstumbler kismet is you can find
access points yeah you take one of those
you know just gps receiver ready USB gps
receiver you fire up your kismet you're
finding all the different wireless
access points in the area and now we can
map them to what we're going to we're
going to have everyone upload their km
else and then when they upload them to
ours your application it's going to
display on a map so we're going to go
ahead and lay out all of the the KML
proof points on a map and everyone can
go and see you know the access points in
their area that other people might have
uploaded and okay so if I'm completely
new to programming for Windows Azure
what do I need to do to start so to
start you need a couple things you need
visual studio you're going to need an XP
or excuse me a windows vista sp1 box
more greater probably won't run windows
seven probably you want to run Windows 7
and I said visual studio and you need
the azure SDK as your SDK you got from
Windows Azure calm under developments
development dev windows azure calm and
then it's just getting started you just
like to can sit right in two yeah
great individuals to cool so visual
studio 2010 all right let's fire it up
yeah the remote we also need an account
noon as your account all right cuz it's
going to the club you go somewhere yeah
so you get a free 90-day account from
Windows Azure to start programming your
application nice all right well let's do
it with that then absolutely so we're
going to go ahead and fire up visual
studio so you got visual studio fired up
go under new project and then under
install templates visual c sharp and
then you're going to look at cloud then
the client you'll see windows azure
project if everything set up install
correctly you'll get your next dialog
box the new windows azure project and
then under there you're going to see the
kind of add roles to subtract roles you
know the you know come think of this
sushi what we're wooden roles at what
are these roles do so they think of it
as as deployment full scale deployment
like four servers so you know we're
using asp.net PHP things of that nature
just kind of bundled up and ready to go
to be plugged into this it just takes
then just compiles 31 just things as you
roll just little tie side bite-size
delicious it is isn't it then what
you're going to do is click visual c
under visual c sharp you'll see asp net
and then a STI that you're gonna click
the little this nice this and that will
move it over to your solution okay then
you click ok that'll close that dialog
box once you've done that you kind of
get this hello world already preset
ready to go nice okay so at least you
have like the framework and at the
stable then you can sit like a page fun
there's a fault that I HP you can see
the actual code it's got some HTML in
there okay so it is like a web page
sounds like a web so do I get like a how
do I get this on the web now yes
together the web it's very simple right
click on your project uh-huh click
publish once you've done that you'll get
two files you will get a your project
name dot CSP
gee and then you will get a service
configuration dot CS cos config okay I
can fix ya see NM cg yes right because
it's c sharp config and c-sharp package
of the two piles so you ever thought
about that but probable computer science
maybe mmm possibly okay that's it you
finished your work with visual studio
now you need to log into your as your
account at windows azure com once you're
there all logged in up in the top left
hand corner you're going to see new
hosted service once you that will be a
dialog box enter your name your url
prefix your deployment name my
deployment my searcher here and then who
are all you want to enter okay so you
just do that once to like set up your
instance yes so you gotta set up your
instance but you're also publishing your
content there as well okay so once
you've done that though it's just a
matter of what well no I hear you here's
what oh yeah oh then man in this
dialogue so next time I don't have to do
this you kind of do okay that's how did
you do other deployment so you have to
republish and then re-upload these right
but this is but like if it was like a
new version of the same project oh yeah
because the things I and I'm published
when I think about like programming in
cloud I'm like sitting here you know
with notepad writing some PHP and then I
got an ftp client and then I I'm hitting
save weight easier alt tab drag it over
over right go back to you know my
browser hit refresh and like okay now
I'm gonna make this tweak gotta go back
you know it's Sam everyone knows yeah
the be the ftp ftp notepad dance yeah
yeah no pad ftp refresh browser do da
dope a ftp yeah dude out of the day um
so it's a little bit like that but way
easier because you just got the
configuration file and then you have to
service file but those are two things
it's under package location you enter
your package name dot CS PKG and then
under file a configuration file it's the
service configuration file those two
files once you hit OK your instance will
start and then in the left hand left
hand side you'll be able to see the your
dns name because you do the stage
environment instead of production you'll
just see the dns it won't resolve your
actual good until you
what is it a web URL yeah its web URL
it's it's there's already online
sorrynotsorry okay you fit published
here so we're gonna do that with the
project that we're doing with the a.m
l's and the kismet files last week can't
wait I can't wait to hear what everybody
thinks about this project what kind of
features would you want to do what
projects are you interested in getting
in the cloud and thank you so much Jason
if we're kind of breaking down the the
quick run-through on how to get started
with Windows Azure and of course we'll
have you on in the following weeks to
build out the rest of this project
excited yeah last week's trivia question
was this cinematic sound cliche most
notably featured in George Lucas's films
has been included in over 200 movies
television shows and video games since
1954 and the answer was the Wilhelm
scream this week's question is this
operating system also refers to a 1982
science fiction film a board game and
song off of the prodigy CD beside what
evil lurks answer over at hak5 org slash
trivia to win some sweet swag and now a
word from our sponsor I want to take a
moment to thank our wonderful sponsor
Windows Azure as you know they are the
cloud platform for developers that lets
you focus on building and running apps
instead of infrastructure it has
scalable pay-as-you-go capacity meaning
developers don't have to wait to develop
get faster speed to market and to
generate and meet immediate demand only
rent what you need when you need it it's
a rich platform with built-in
connectivity and development tools
meaning you can focus on business logic
and get a head start on time to market
flexible development gives you the
ability to run on Windows Azure on your
own systems with Windows Azure births
capacity you can deploy with confidence
running your apps where and when it
makes sense without have to worry about
overwhelming systems to learn more about
everything you need to start developing
with windows azure check out w WM IQ
softcom / cloud / windows azure
I have about a million websites that I
have to log on to day to day seriously
and with all of the hype about website
infiltration and stolen data it makes me
worried a little bit about my own
usernames and passwords now I have
recently upgraded my google mail account
to use two-step verification which I
explained a few weeks ago in a snubz
report but what about my Facebook and my
Twitter my online banking expecially
these sites all say things like password
must be so and so characters long with
at least one letter and one number but
some are so secure so how will I know
which sites will have a data breach I
really don't so I use somewhat different
passwords for all my sites but honestly
if someone had the balls in the time to
figure out my pattern they probably
could do it but I don't want to download
a password protection program to use on
my home computer because I use several
different computers and I may not have
access to the software or my saved
encrypted passwords when I'm using a
public pc not to mention if you don't
want to use LastPass or keepass because
you just don't trust them well there are
other options out there if you don't
want to use more software you can use
something a little bit less technical
and probably the best security you have
your memory so this is password card
it's from password card org slash Ian
it's a card the size of a credit card
that I can stick in my wallet and carry
with me what makes this unique is the
series of random digits and letters that
are included on it the rows are
different colors and the columns have a
different symbol at the top you can use
this card to think of a very strong and
tough password and use the colors and
the symbols to remember it better yet
each code card is randomly generated and
there are android and iphone apps so
here's an example of how to use this
tool first off you need to go over to
the website and print out your unique
card now i have a laser black and white
printer but if you do have a color
printer I'd suggest printing it in color
to give you more options for remembering
your passwords you can then cut out your
card and laminate it if you want keep
the rest of the page though because it
has your unique card number on it and
I'll give you a little bit more
information about that in just a second
then you can choose your password now go
over and choose
symbol and a color row number and use
the letters and numbers in that
combination that are seen in that row or
column and all you have to do after that
is go to your website and change your
password now if you lost your password
card you can always go back to the
website type in your unique card number
and hit print or you can pull it up on
your mobile phone so for example I
printed out my card and I'm gonna choose
something that I can remember so I'm
gonna go with let's say music note up at
the top and the number 7 so that means
that my password would be H a G 8k G&amp;amp;T
qug who's gonna figure that one out
right this tool is super simple to use
and it's completely free the website can
be visited safely via HTTPS and the
algorithm used to create the codes is
available in case the website goes down
and you really really need to repaint
your card which is awesome if you don't
feel safe printing a card just download
the free app on the android marketplace
or the apple store this app will let you
generate a random card or pull up your
own card if you have it memorized it'll
also let you generate your own personal
password card based on a series of
random hexadecimal digits so when i pull
the app up i have some options i can use
symbols and i can include a digit area
in case i want that i can enter a number
if I know a number or I can choose a
random card and I can go through
thousands and thousands of thousands of
these so i'm going to enter a number
that i memorized myself and it has to be
16 digits long press done and it pulls
up a card that correlates with that
hexadecimal digit so now that random
card that i generated will always be the
card that pulls up on my phone for me to
use now if you're a little worried about
someone getting a hold of your unique
card number don't worry about it they
still wouldn't have your actual
passwords because those were all created
from the numbers and the letters found
on each card and there could be
thousands and thousands of different
password combinations now I think this
is a pretty cool idea and it's easy
enough that I could probably show my mom
how to use this so enough of using
crappy passwords you have no excuse now
now this is just one of the tools
available out there for password
generation
do you have one email me at feedback at
hak5 org and now for the hack tip we get
a lot of questions from people saying
hey how do I start playing with linux
that looks complicated and no it's
actually really not i mean yeah bachelor
super easy super awesome and you can
play with it now in your web browser
because everyone sent us in this link
over to bail org slash j/s linux because
this guy has done a phenomenal job
converting over the linux 2.6 point to
Colonel over into javascript and you can
actually go ahead and run it right here
in your browser and see if i do like LS
look I'm using bash you know I can uh I
don't know I can like cat stuff and I
can you know anyway like you it's
actually really neat because you can get
your own programs over on to there
because you can do files transfers
through the clipboard so for instance
like this hello dot C right here i can
like cat hello dot C but if I want to I
can actually export it out to my
clipboard by doing cat hello dot C and
then send that over to / dev / clipboard
and there goes and then same thing on
reverse I could put you know it's say i
have my only shell scripts i can put
those in there and bring them in its
kind of its got the c compiler so you
know if you just wanted to learn a
little bit of programming if you just
wanted to toy around analytics i think
this is a really neat way to do that and
you know just kind of keep an eye on
this because they're talking about you
know maybe potentially adding networking
support and you know but like if I
paying a date yeah nothing's gonna
happen no networking yet I have config
nobody saying now it's just low yeah
anyway I just thought that was awesome
had to share that with you guys thanks
so much for sending that in I've been
having a lot of fun playing with it what
have you been playing with what kind of
fun hack tipperary stuff do you have for
us and have you checked out our new show
hack tip we have a fantastic episode
this week I just did some some just more
than you ever needed to know about mac
addresses and I Triple E and it's really
good stuff like Max or single step yeah
fundamentals so if you're like I'm new
to bash it's like dude get this and then
subscribe to that show you're so excited
is that my love some actives
you know what yes let's go ahead and
thank our sponsor all right let's do we
were asked what would hack five be like
if it were a paranormal investigation
show so we went to domain.com and
register dot TV to find out these are
the hack files kind of a monster would
decapitate 200 mannequins obviously it's
the work of evil server miss telekinesis
again agent kitchen you know as well as
I do inanimate objects cannot decapitate
mannequin truth is out there in the
photo one from a security camera
oh wait I see something there in the
window zoo enhance that okay go to
sector 27 up there enhance okay zoom
enhance
Oh Paul Tobias oh
if you're building a video site or your
website has a play button a dot TV
domain is the way to go TV websites let
you showcase your original content and
create a unique site not just another
YouTube channel go to domain.com and
search for the perfect TV domain for
your new idea then use the coupon code
hak5 at checkout to save an extra
fifteen percent looking for hosting save
fifteen percent on that too at
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
that just about wraps up this episode of
hak5 before we get going and depart this
wonderful podcasting experience that a
vehicle yeah we have technol Espada's we
have emails and all sorts of information
for you but first I would a dimension
that somebody I know is in the New York
Times and The Herald Tribune moon yeah I
wasn't the one on the International
Herald Tribune the pitcher likes this
kind of creepily yes that's why you need
to be like on the Facebook or whatever
is so long all the social media cos I
agree that's just fine out or you can
find us in 160 different countries in
paper format yeah they perform at I
guess you don't have the internet stream
all right if you didn't have the
internets you'd be watching on toaster
ovens with LCD screens that get such a
class microwaved and now for the emails
let's do some emails effects rights I
know you have talked about rainbow
tables a little before on the show
however I find them extremely hard to
understand and even to use could you
recommend anything to help me on my
technol s quest ha awesome or maybe even
a little more on how they work how are
they made are they all as society
specific and as to why tables versus
dictionary files rainbows versus
handshakes Patties from cows what yeah I
guess things a lot to it and I mean you
you bring up what was it you bring up
the WTA's and send assaulting and stuff
like that and yeah the thing about
Rimbaud tables forget the oh is this for
you know WPA networks is this for ntlm
is this for land man is this for you
know sha-1 and b5 whatever it may be all
of these different cryptographic
algorithms these hashing algorithms we
use them because it's not really secure
safe I were administrating a linux box
here and had a bunch of users on my
system I wouldn't want to actually keep
their passwords in plain text on my
system like we talked about last week
what was the plaintext defender last
week oh god I need a wall of sheep yeah
there's newegg right so I wouldn't want
to be like Newegg and keep the password
in plain text because then you know they
then it's like sony ps3 network whatever
all over again ELISA hasn't come to that
there hopefully they were hashing but
the idea is you don't store the password
you store hash of it right we've talked
about salts before about that but the
idea is you know so if somebody gets
that you know because it's really easy
to take a string take you know something
that's that's like legible and convert
it into a hash but then to convert the
hash back well then you have to try
every possible permutation and that
takes a long time to do so if I were
just to say okay I got this crazy hash
here is it Apple no is it orange no is a
banana no wait that's gonna take forever
what if I do that for say like it takes
I don't know like like two months
straight with like clusters of
supercomputers to do that um you know
that really suck to try it on one pass
or me like yes two months and I got one
password okay now let's try this
password and have to do it again right
so the idea is it's called rainbow
tables are just another form of look-up
tables on what's called time memory
trade-off where you trade off memory and
I'm talking about just hundreds of
gigabytes to store some of these you
know they exponentially grow as you
increase the effectiveness of that so
like to give you an example LMK hashes
which are like some of the weakest
hashes and we've been talking about them
forever on act 5 really old-school
windows like you know they're backwards
compatibility but you found him like XP
and stuff um those hashes just to do
like a complete set that is like every
key on the keyboard of seven characters
because that thankfully that one only
goes up to 7 characters for that hash
it's still 200 gigs right so and that's
for all uppercase because everything it
also gets converted to uppercase in
addition to get truncated 27 character
yeah horrible hashing algorithm that
said you know all of that memory you
know you know these these these buckets
of hard drives are you gonna have to
keep around just so that you can you
know trade-off that memory for time
because you corrected that one time you
send your super computers at it for two
months right right alright cool you got
that password now it's time for the next
password now you've got a lookup table
and the idea is like you can imagine it
kind of like an Excel spreadsheet or
something where you've got apple banana
always yeah and then just the hash and
then you're like you know you do like a
like a sequel statement you're like
select law where you know from table
whatever where Shannon clue equals
greater than one and there you go but
what the difference there between that
and like rainbow tables rainbow tables
is what I just mentioned there a you
know time memory trade-off computing
table but what they've done is uses this
this really cool and it's kind of
outside of the scope of this right here
but I will send you to some really neat
papers in the show notes but it's also
really cool crazy science stuff some
crazy math stuff basically using these
things called precomputed hashes that
don't have to store all of the
information obtained and it's really
cool the way that they string together
so that you can have like all of these
different chunks of this rainbow table
set and it makes the lookups a little
bit slower but kind of you're talking
about the difference between a couple of
milliseconds in like a couple of seconds
so it's like now still doesn't matter
you're still getting and by using the
rainbow tables technique of doing these
chains you end up saving a ton of
storage space so you know that's just
kind of that's the idea there and i'll
send you guys there's some links in the
show notes some fantastic papers but
that's basically what it is so you know
we've talked about like wpa having them
you know but since they're salted with
the different SSIDs of the access point
there's going to be a different one for
every asset whether it's linksys you
know and we could spend all day talking
about brute forcing and rainbow tables
but I hope that that kind of clarify is
just the fundamentals of what a pre
computed you know hash lookup table is
yes and why rainbow tables are much
smaller
oh isn't there like a 51 or something
yeah that's what we're talking about at
the beginning of the anti the LM won the
200 mega full set and I think he might
still be able to get that there I think
there are links on the forums yeah
alright so yeah that's good stuff and
cool you know there are plenty of these
online sites now where you know people
have okay so we only need like one
person to have the full set we really
only need like one person with a with
you know giant bucket of hard drives I'm
thinking like a blue one with like a
walrus or something connected to a web
server and then you know everybody else
can feed off of that so I know that
there's like md5 lookup com if you just
google for like hash crack and I don't
know hash cracked com there you go and
they do md5 sha-1 my sequel ntlm and
there you go that you give them the hash
and then they give you the word it's
that simple we time loop now I don't
know why this questions coming in
because we talked about this last week
we'll go ahead with the cracked code
challenge yeah okay all right well thank
you for that vary somewhat brief
explanation and now for a tech knowledge
of the week solis sent in this really
cool picture of his hot spot which is
named lime and he says okay so the
plastic pineapple is on the way but I
