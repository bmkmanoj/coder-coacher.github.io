into copper ski last pass was breached
and the Cardinals are getting their hack
on all that and more coming up on threat
wire I'm Shannon Morrison this is threat
wire for jun 17 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom hey we have tons of
news today so let's go ahead and get
right to it first off sign digital
certificates those have been used for
years to prove authenticity for a site
or a service but when those certs are
stolen things could get a little bit
sticky so most recently it's been
discovered that the nation-state malware
called Duke you two point oh yes it's
called Duke you used a signed digital
certificate from foxconn you know those
are the guys that are from Taiwan and
they make electronics for let's see
Apple and Google + del to hack into
kuparski a leading security firm and
hotels that were used during the UN
Security Council and Iranian nuclear
negotiations the hackers had to get
Foxconn signed certificate so that they
could sign their malware with the
digital certificate now researchers
believe that the attack originated from
the same hackers that did the Duke you
attack in 2011 two European networks and
possibly its israel-based now the Duke
you malware has many parts that are
identical to Stuxnet which I'm sure
you're familiar with so do Q 2 point 0
is thought to be the newest form all
three of these have used digital
certificates from Taiwan based companies
on their malware and software and the
software is loaded onto the praise
machines and used for data theft and
reconnaissance now companies use sign
digital certificates to legitimize their
applications their drivers their
software of all sorts and it's been used
for a long time since this kind of
malware has been affecting networks for
several years now this begs the question
of how reliable the certificates are if
they are being used so often to infect
next up is all about last pass an online
subscription based password manager
which just happened to be breached in a
hack on Monday June fifteenth in the
breach email addresses password
reminders aka the little reminder that
you remind yourself
for your password the server / user
salts in authentication Hasse's were
compromised the authentication hash is
used to verify user when they sign in
via their computer and is salted and has
one hundred thousand rounds of
server-side encryption so basically that
means that it takes a really long time
to decrypt the hashes and figure out the
account credentials now if a password
reminder made it incredibly easy to
figure out your password like your
mother's maiden name which somebody
could look up on Facebook well you might
want to change your master password then
as well LastPass is requiring new
devices to be verified via email and
less using two-factor or multi-factor
authentication users will also be asked
to update their master password user
data from the users vault were not
stolen so passwords stored inside the
password manager are okay LastPass also
warned that if you used your master
password on another site change both
immediately but folks don't freak out
chances are you are safe just remember
one change your master password to make
it really really hard to guess to use
two-factor or multi-factor
authentication which you can set up in
the settings number three make your
password reminder something that's a bit
obscure and hard to figure out and for
if you use the master password elsewhere
which you shouldn't do anyways change
those two you could just not use
LastPass as well if that's your thing
and there are plenty of alternatives and
from the OMG really part of the Internet
the FBI is keeping an eye on the st.
Louis Cardinals who may have hacked into
the Houston Astros network to steal
player personnel information and files
this would have included trade
discussions scouting reports and
proprietary stats about the team
subpoenas have been served on the
Cardinals and the MLB and would be the
first of its kind to be committed by a
professional sports team or somebody
that's working for the team the heck is
believed to be unsophisticated in nature
simply performed with passwords from an
associate who moved to the Astros team
after working with the cards get your
game on
our featured comment today comes from
sick Nick 64 who in response to
Patrick's show on Monday says it's as if
the setting of splitter cell chaos
theory has come to life it's a
never-ending battle to one-up each other
in terms of security I make this
eyepatch this patch broken ree patch
repeat to speak from the server's point
of view some just can't afford to patch
their systems properly unless it's made
from scratch and maintained by the
original creator it requires hiring
someone to look into the server and fix
the necessary bugs or if someone who
knows how to upgrade the service
software properly not to mention buying
the updated software and having a legal
registered copy improper install
software leads into a whole nother
problem the problem focuses on the host
of the server if they can't keep up they
put themselves in all users at risk
thank you yes I agree and this is why
it's so so important to know what's
going on in security and privacy yes
it's a never-ending loop of repacking
and updating and breaches over and over
and over again but what other choice do
we have should we just give up I mean
you're right if you can't keep up you
put yourself at risk so thank you so
much for the comment sick Nick 64 and if
you have any thoughts on today's stories
leave them below in the comments FYI
there are a few other really great
stories that we don't have time to
report on today's so I've included those
links below specifically emojis instead
of pin codes for banks apparently that's
the thing Samsung phones have a keyboard
vulnerability that's not good and Google
has an Android bug bounty problem
program that is good now before I go I
want to give a huge thanks to everyone
