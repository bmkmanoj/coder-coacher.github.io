cancer not him not people that you care
about or no hey everybody and welcome to
hack point 5 episode 6 as always I'm Wes
I'm Darren and well this episodes can be
a little truncated between the whole
like moving thing and the holidays and
just this that and everything else time
kind of ran out yeah yeah you know
what's happening is we are moving out of
the apartment into a nice beautiful new
house and we are so excited to be
getting out of these cramped quarters
and finally getting everybody at techno
lyst productions under one roof and it's
kind of you know interesting to be
saying goodbye to the bakery to the
studio yeah the studio as it is yeah but
we will be bringing you studio 2 point 0
and all its glory hopefully we have it
all set up by the time we're shooting
next month slip so you just might see
you know the evolution of new set
throughout filming you set your studio
very excited going live to tape that's
gonna be a blast yeah it's gonna be
awesome and that's actually what we're
talking about in this episode it's just
going to be one really good segment on
the video production station so many of
you were so interested in it after the
live show hey we'll give you what you
want and I think Kirby is going for the
new position is awesome its IPTV kitties
so Lab Rats fifth and doing here heart
out we see you on the other side hey
when hak5 started in about mid-2005 we
started out with some really lame
equipment and really not a lot of idea
of what we're doing over the last year
and a half we've been through a lot of
upgrades I'm sure you've seen the set
the cameras the production quality has
gone leaps and bounds and one of the
things that I want to talk to you
leading off the second half of the
second season is live to tape real-time
editing that's what we've been striving
for in the second season and I think
we're almost there so what we're going
to do is take a real quick look
the broadcast console something we've
hacked together that's going to allow us
to get away from these huge stacks of DV
tapes and countless hours behind it a PC
editing together the show which will
give us more time to invest in R&amp;amp;D and
bringing you the technology so as we say
goodbye to the old apartment / studio
and move into the new house I'd like to
introduce the broadcast console on a
budget
you know what I'm going to head over the
dreamhost calm get me a website or i can
use the coupon code hak5 to get me
twenty five dollars off yeah now the
first step on our road to 1080i is
looking at the requirements we've got to
take four independent video sources may
they be cameras or output from computers
and mix them into one signal now we
could of course go and purchase a
all-in-one solution from new tech for a
couple thousand dollars or with some
ingenuity hack one together with
off-the-shelf parts and a lot of
patience now the brains behind this live
video editing behemoths is the edirol v1
video mixer this is our inexpensive for
channel video mixer it can take inputs
from four different video signals
whether it's a camera or PC with it we
can do wipes fades picture and picture
and King out or CG elements which comes
in handy for when we're doing lower
thirds turn like live events and the
output of this goes to our main BTR
which we can either broadcast out to the
internet or a card straight hard disk
this is our audio technica am 200 stereo
mixer allows us to take audio from the
guys on set and the caller's from the
internet and the video from the BTR
machines that play our Clips we use it a
pretty standard format where we just
pipe all the audio into it and goes out
to be TRS for recording but uh in order
to prevent a feedback loop we don't feed
the audio that we communicate with the
skype callers into the machine instead
we feed it to the skype computer via
this boom mic that we attached to the
top camera here our preview monitors
they're just plain old overscan
televisions that we use to see what we
have before we put out to the program
monitor the difference between needs and
what you would see in the professional
setup is that these are overscan the
professional setup is under scanned and
it has a price difference of sixty
dollars to eight hundred dollars but
since we don't need to see the safe area
that they use in traditional television
that gives you that a smaller image even
though there's more on the actual cap of
camera for instance where you don't
really need to worry about that too much
and with that big of a price difference
we don't really care so what we have
here is two for the camera one for like
laptop on set and then a fourth one
which is kind of an all-purpose one for
VT ours the skype callers and for
playing back video clips from that been
pre-recorded for innocence and then it
all gets output through the video mixer
and onto the program which is what you'd
see for instance during a live show or
what would be recorded to the hard drive
so now that we've got our video signals
coming into our video mixer we've got
our audio signals coming into it we've
got a huge wall of preview monitors so
we can see what we're doing it's time to
glue it all up and there are three
essential components that make this
happen and those are the VTR s or video
tape recorders essentially it's just any
electronic device that will record a
video signal or play one back and there
are three ones with three distinct jobs
the first one is the main VTR and that's
used to accept the video signal coming
out of the program of the video mixer
and either record it to disk using Sony
Vegas 6 or broadcasted to the internet
using icecast that's our video mixer
sorry VTR 72 and it's just an athlon 64
box with a radeon 7500 all-in-wonder and
it just accepts it through the s-video
now the second VTR is used for playback
of pre-recorded clips whether they be
bumpers rejoin errs sketches or ads and
that's this machine right here now it
also doubles as the character generator
now that's used to actually put text on
the screen you know the lower thirds
that you see when there's a caller or
when we were explaining something
there's URL that's all entered in
in Sony Vegas and then the output of
this laptop it's just using the s-video
that comes out of it as if you were
going to like a projector or television
as an extended desktop and that displays
the program of say Sony Vegas six or
seven one of those now the other thing
that this does actually acts as our call
queuing machine we use Skype to bring in
live collars and we'll take the video
signal from skype and actually export it
into its own little window and just drag
that over to the to the program I'm
sorry to the preview monitor of this VTR
and that's how we can actually see the
sky callers get them in a
picture-in-picture so that's basically
what this VTR does and the third VTR is
the one that will do the archiving so if
we're doing a live show we're using the
main vhr to do the broadcast to the
internet we're using this one to bring
in the callers to bring in CG elements
and to play the bumpers rejoin errs and
adds and sketches and we need something
to actually archive this to tape so that
if you miss the live show you can still
see it later on the website so for that
we're actually using the only VTR that
is actually a videotape recorder and
that's just this little this is camera
three unfortunately had a little
accident we've guess this is the third
camera we've killed on the show now its
focus motor died so it's not very good
at recording you know any video that's
in focus through its lens but in VTR
mode we can still accept a video signal
s video record it to disk or I'm sorry
record it to tape and then later after
the show we'll just dump the footage off
the DV tape into the into our main VTR
and code it and send it out so you can
watch it if you miss the live show so
those are the be TRS you don't think
real exciting or interesting about these
is is the naming conventions the main
BTR 72 our CG elements one the one that
does the skype colors and the pre-record
material is 71 and the one that had that
actually archive is the only one that
takes tape is 73 those numbers
I kind of an homage to call for help
that's a Leo's show on g4 tech TV and
we've been very thankful to be regular
guests on that show and really before we
did that we had no idea how real
television was produced it was a real
our first experience doing real
television and they do live to tape and
it's kind of what's inspired us to do
live to tape here live to the internet
with the ice cast so we're very thankful
to have had that experience and we've
become fast friends with all the people
in the control room and it's kind of
been one of the things that have
inspired us to build this thing so they
actually use VTR 71 72 and 73 for
playing pre-recorded clips or their CG
elements are actually recording no other
show so we thought it would be fun to
kind of use the same naming convention
here in house so anyway those are the
VTR s that make it happen that and the
Paul which we need more of I had no
symptoms at all the physician who was
doing my flight physical found what he
thought was a small lump on my prostate
don't fly in today he treated this
afternoon and fly back tomorrow morning
it's pretty scary everyone else has
cancer not him not people that you care
about or no okay folks so there you have
it that is the video production
monstrosity the con yes the con Paul
take the helm set a course for hak5
studio 2 point 0 coming februari fifth
Wow somebody beating him up yeah whoa I
am a massive door today yeah you are
you're full of it so that's true all
right baby that's it i hope you guys
really enjoyed it I thought it was
really informative sorry I couldn't be
there but a I'm worthless hey don't
don't be silly that in the show me you
would not believe what this man has in
store for the new house I mean talk
about geek my crib this is going to be
excellent I'm very excited about the
stuff coming into the future with in
2007 hak5 version 2.5 2.6 2.27 to
whatever whatever we're not windows yeah
um look we have to give huge shout-outs
to the community the hak5 rainbow tables
are done yes the they have been
completed the LM hashes like like almost
like like throw any LMS you've got at it
and this thing will crunch it and like
probably an hour or less and we can even
get to the crackpot in IRC you get I
received on org and it's been found
rainbow tables there's actually a
crackpot you can just send it your your
hash and it'll take care of it oh nice
yeah automation or you can download the
whole set now you can yeah you can do
the 120 gig torrent file and download
the set yourself or it's my
understanding am little hazy on the
details but if you so desired you could
buy a hard drive and ship it off to the
rainbow table people yeah and they will
put the rainbow tables on there for you
and ship it back to you you covering
shipping fees yeah it's a hack 5
sponsored project so please don't email
us about it because we're not really
responsible for the OS our legal mumbo
jumbo hear about money
hard drives and stuff but I think it's a
very cool project gotta get behind it
gonna spawn definitely on our wiki yeah
so you can hit up the forms or the IRC
and those guys will be able to sylveon
or any of the people and anybody that
was involved in that talk to them
they'll help you out props everybody for
donating CPU cycles I can't wait to see
the next one I'm not here if it's gonna
be md5 hashes or ntlm hash I know he's
like up in the air like yeah I'm
actually kind of written for ntlm but I
really hope that doesn't play any weight
in the decision making because it is
community project right yeah our opinion
doesn't really matter for ntlm vista hey
there i'm going to be using LMK hash is
only for backwards compatibility i'm not
sure if it's a default setting anyway
I'm rambling you rambled so we digress
yes so what else dig dig dig dig dig dig
dig be so forever yeah i forgot about
that yeah the new dig stay new dig
things pretty cool it's like a it's a
dig listing of podcasts video podcast so
you know instead of heck five just
appearing in the technology forms every
time we release there's actually like
the hak5 podcast dig thing and you can
watch it right on the dig site you can
you can dig your favorite episode so the
top 10 best episodes of hak5 show up in
a little list when you choose our thing
i think we're at the top of the second
page right now but they were like we're
second from the top on the second page
but as dig the mess out of it get us on
the first page yeah first page yeah it's
almost like first post yeah that would
be are moving in gift since you guys
can't send us like liquor potted plants
or potted plants doused and liquor maybe
yeah that's pretty much it though yeah I
think that's pretty much what once again
we really apologize for the short
episode but hey time constraints we
promise we'll have a really really good
episode with liver for you on februari
fifth yes with the new studio going
logic tape is
really what's going to enable us to
bring so much more techno us in two
thousand right continue because in the
lack of production time that means it's
more time we can spend in writing the
segments and bringing you good for live
shows dude I guys are we haven't like
set down from dates right we need and
need a tune to hack pop down to work
throughout the month because I know is
we're moving in there will probably be
some funny clips that end up making the
way to go eh so with all that said
without further ado I'm Wes I'm Darren
trust your technol us
and it's using an all in wonder card a
I'm going really fast and forgetting to
breathe and breathing is very important
when you're trying to do till the peel k
love you kiddo revision is happy are you
zooming you're zooming in on me stop it
I don't like that I hadn't shaved I have
no fingers oh yeah go ahead punch it
