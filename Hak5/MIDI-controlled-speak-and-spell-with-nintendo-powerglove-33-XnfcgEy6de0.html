book is it not itself ok nan that's been
plugged into your little mini hackaday
device yep there it is right there and
that's been ran through the synthesizer
over here and through the computer
everything else that's MIDI if I'd and
we can now control musical notes with
this correct so how is it held it's
working here what are we looking at like
basically we got this is the sensor
array from the power glove of so what
happens is the the sensor array and the
glove work together to determine the
gloves position in 3d just in the case
of this demo we're only we're only
measuring in the x axis which means left
to right in this case so this is gonna
be making a musical note pitch of which
is determined by data but alright a
position of the plug in front of the in
front of the sensor array okay let's go
ahead and take a listen
so right now we're hearing a constant
note so there's the glove kind of coming
into the field and
and you actually bring it all the way
down the ladder yep
has a pretty cool sound to it now it
does it actually is a really cool sign
it kind of like it's like the whole like
demonic fairy like 1950s
organ music of I am the death dealer of
doom yeah
no you are only you know using the xx's
to modify the sound now can we take like
the y-axis or Zed as you say in Canada
and change of different things yeah yeah
for sure the interface actually measures
all of those parameters including finger
parameter enroll of the glove so you
could theoretically map those controls
to anything you wanted in the MIDI data
stream you could send you could have one
synthesizer or being controlled by the
x-axis something else vertically you
could make volume expression control any
kind of performance parameter that you
want to send over the MIDI link you can
do nice and now we're using the high-res
version right now
yep you said so this is all this is
taking three-dimensional movement plus
roll of your hand and yep actual making
a fist so you can sit here and like
actually start boxing and do something
completely ridiculous if that had been
all mapped ahead of time that'd be kind
of complicated but maybe theoretically
possible it would certainly sound cool
anyway yeah you know you like sit there
like a punch of drama yep you know so we
know that makes music we know the Speak
&amp;amp; Spell makes sound but can we make the
power glove make the Speak and Spell
make sense let's do it man
wait all right so we've got everything
hooked up I'm actually wearing the glove
this time hi and the glove took to the
speaking speaking spell book to the
stereo system so once Andrew turns it on
your just gonna hear like this huge loud
speaking spell racket right yep and
you're gonna be changing the racket a
little bit as you moved okay so I'm
gonna like have to rock the glove out
like like The Wiz did or something like
it look if you can rock it out that much
yeah
all right let's let's go
I'm gonna plug in the middie and you
should be ready to roll along and there
now as I move my hand back and forth
basically this is the same demo as we
were running with the stringed
instrument earlier it's just a note
repeated over and over again and you're
changing the pitch of the note as you
move the glove around so if you hold it
we're not actually changing the pitch
we're running through the wrong exactly
exactly so if I can hold my hand really
still you should be playing the same
sound fragment over and over again and
then as you move it around you can
garble ate it as you look up some other
sound fragments so I can sit here just
feel like whoa and that's actually
pretty awesome
the turntable robot death noise
interpretive dance yeah yeah scratch
with that but I'm not actually
scratching so it's just like random
random random sound effect that is
frigging clue and then since it's all
MIDI you can interface with any other
MIDI device start acting like that and
do what you want to do assuming you
would programmed
ya program the interface correctly we
can do take with all the functionality
of the blow just go ahead and turn that
off so if people want to find any more
about you where they where can they go
we'll have a website barrow dynamics
comm you can find that in the show notes
ok the Speak &amp;amp; Spell MIDI kit is made by
highly liquid comm and I suggest
everyone goes to check that out it's
pretty awesome site they have some other
sound hacks on there as well and yeah
got a Speak &amp;amp; Spell get the kit hook it
up mess around to have some fun we had
actually a whole lot of fun making it
and trying it out so you guys should
check it out ok we definitely will
definitely thank you so much for my
shaky with awesome and go back to
playing with MIDI so let's find out
what's next
yeah yeah like spin it up what are you
doing tonight man
this is some fine dancing skills
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
