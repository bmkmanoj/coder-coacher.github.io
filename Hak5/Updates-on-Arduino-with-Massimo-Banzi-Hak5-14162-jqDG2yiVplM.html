by Podio from Maker Faire
2013 I'm here with one of my favorite
people in the world Massimo Banzi from
Arduino he is the CEO of the company and
I'm super excited to talk to you today
how are you doing I'm pretty good
actually
good now I know we've never gotten you
on the show before so I wanted to get a
little bit of the history of Arduino for
anybody who isn't familiar with the
company
well Abdul we all started off in 2004 v
essentially as a way to provide by
students who are designers a way to
prototype with electronics without
becoming without needing to become an
electronics engineer so you know these
are creative people but they don't know
how to program they don't know about
electronics so we needed something that
could get them working very quickly so
the we know is the product of a research
we have been doing for a number of years
and so it turned out that what worked
very well with my design students
actually became very popular with you
know makers in general because it helps
beginner get started very quickly I
totally agree everyone that I've talked
to you about Arduino loves it and they
as soon as they get their hands on it it
seems like a light appears and they know
exactly what to do it's a beautiful
thing now I did have a question for you
this today he actually did a speech
about what's up and coming in Arduino
you have you talked about robots you
talked about Linux give me a little bit
of information about what's what's
happening in the robot field well what
happened is that we always wanted to
make a small Arduino robot for education
mostly and then we actually found these
kids in Spain who have been making
robots with Arduino in competing in this
thing called the RoboCup Junior so they
became world champion of Robocop junior
for 33 years so we partnered with them
and we asked them you know what how did
you do your robots and so we basically
built this one out of the experience of
these kids learning with our doing and
making their own robots and winning
competitions with it so you know it took
us quite a bit to get it right but we
think we made something that kind of
simple to approach just works out of the
box it's actually nicely designed in my
opinion which is attach that so it's
good
and so yeah we think it's gonna be a
good platform for people to learn about
robotics learn about because with
robotics you learn about mechanics
electronics software you also learn
about physics so it's a great way to
kind of learn about a lot of disciplines
in one package so what is your target
market for this is it children yeah I
think it's mostly like yeah children
teenagers schools even people who just
want to learn how to you know program a
robot they can also be adults it doesn't
have to be killed but I think the target
market is probably mostly children and
teenagers it's definitely an education
system and I also was wondering when is
this going to be released and when can I
get one because I would love to play
with this so you can play with one right
now at the Maker Faire
now we it's gonna be available at the
end of the month of June uh but we have
a small batch of the robots we brought
here to make FS so the people here at
big V can bite now and then everybody
asks us to wait at the end of June is
this going to be open source or anything
do you expect any kind of development
with this or is this going to be
basically you just you buy it and you
play with it well so like everything
else in Arduino this is open source so
the moment it goes on sale at the end of
June every single file needed to make
this thing is going to go online that's
it that's always what we do and
obviously that the whole thing is
designed to be expandable so it's not
like it doesn't have a plastic box so
you see the electronic so you're
encouraged to so do your own stuff on it
connect we also make an expansion pack
that contains a bunch of sensors and the
website that we created for it has
actually 11x projects that you can build
of increasing complexity so you you are
guided step-by-step to from zero to
expert robot developer oh that's
excellent I'm so excited I can't wait to
play with one of these and you also
talked about Linux development tell me a
little bit about that yeah we've been
working for a while on you know what do
we know that connect to the internet
there's a lot of interest from people to
do you know Internet of Things projects
but one of the limitation of Arduino was
always that you know the processor is
very limited it's very little ram so the
moment you connect to a web service and
you're trying to do a transaction you
completely feels up so we wanted
something that where we could just you
know balance the load with something
else so we started to look at this very
cheap Wi-Fi routers that you can find on
the market so we basically embedded a
Wi-Fi router into the Arduino itself so
it has Wi-Fi Ethernet it's running open
wrt Linux so but we also add that the
Arduino user experience so you can
manage most of the Linux ID through a
web interface so you don't need to be I
mean you don't need to become a Linux
expert immediately you can actually easy
into it and we prepare the piece of
software that runs on your do we you
know that actually makes stuff happen on
the Linux side so again you don't have
to learn how to do SSH into the Linux
again it's a lab window power you plug
it in you turn it on it works when can I
get one of those end of June I love that
you're coming out with everything so
soon this is so exciting for me
so tell me also what do you see in the
future of Arduino there's so many
projects out there I'm so excited to
hear what else is coming out
well actually this project this product
we made is called Arduino UHN
and it because in Chinese it means cloud
so we like this idea of you know paying
homage to China you know so this is the
first Arduino made in China but the idea
is that we're going to be doing more and
more of these devices that are connected
to the Internet and also we're
partnering with different companies that
provide the software that makes it very
easy to connect to a lot of different
services we work with this company
called tembu in new york that made the
system that from a single point you can
access more than 100 different api so
from an arduino you'll be able to
connect the Facebook download data then
go to Foursquare go to PayPal you can
connect to all this API so there will be
a lot more of these Internet of Things
stuff and we're there's gonna be more
arduino products there's gonna be more
and more end-user product more like
Prada see you might when they buy it
Best Buy but you can hack them in with
Arduinos I'm so excited to hear about
all of this I can't wait to see
everything on the market and that's
gonna be excellent if I can find this
stuff at Best Buy that's right around
the corner from where I live so is there
anything else that you want to mention
before we go ahead and head on over to
see what else is going on
well you know so we're organizing we're
helping organize a maker faire in Europe
so if you're in happen to wanna travel
to Italy the first weekend of October so
15 sixth of October we're organizing a
Maker Faire Roma but it's the Maker
Faire design to actually get a sample of
the maker movement from all over Europe
so it's not just an Italian mega
fighters from all over Europe I'm so
excited to hear about that so can you
tell me I'm where can people find out
more information yes it's gonna it's at
Maker Faire Rome dot EU you can find
information about the Maker Faire you
can submit your project through the call
for maker so in July we're going to be
selecting a bunch of makers that we
really invite to come over so but you
can also just come as a visitor and
sample the best of the European maker
seam and then it's wrong you know see
more you definitely don't being Italian
of course it's one of my favorite
countries as well as yours yes I totally
agree and where can people find out more
information about you and Arduino well
Arduino dot cc
that's the website and I don't know
sometimes I post on Twitter at M Banzi M
Banzi I got it great thank you so much
Massimo it was wonderful to meet you
thank you thank you
ciao and for hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
from Maker Faire 2013 I want to take a
quick moment to show you behind the
scenes of some of ways that I'm able to
do hack across America I'm very excited
about this because I'm using all these
cool technologies that let me work the
way I want and let me tell you before
these guys came to me I mean you guys
know I'm a huge fan of the Citrix stuff
but they acquired podio and let me tell
you this stuff rocks it totally changed
the workflow you know I'm all about
automation all I'm all about the process
and things of that nature and so
basically before we were using a whole
ton of different within hack 5 and hack
shop and whatnot who are using a ton of
different like spreadsheets and emails
and you know how it is you just get
daunted with all of that stuff
and I showed you guys last week how I'm
using Podio within a hack across America
to kind of like pull data in from the
webform and then export that into a
Google map where I can see like where
everybody's signed up well I hope this
isn't too much inside baseball but I
want to show you how I use this to
actually manage projects within you know
hak5 so so get this right I'm here and
I'm looking at my PO do
app see that's the other really cool
thing that I love is not only is it like
having your own I don't know like social
network within your company but the app
makes it so intuitive if you're already
used to using stuff like that you skip
the notifications you can do the you
know real-time messaging but it's nice
because it's like your work messaging
and all of that so I'm in here and I'm
taking a look at my work spaces I'm
going to choose pack shop and go over to
tasks and I'm gonna create a new task
and I'm just gonna say hey ship the hack
five
banner to a DEFCON we got that DEFCON
conference coming up I just choose we're
going to assign that task to get Shannon
on that one as well
boom and there we go I can add a due
date if I want and it's saved and I've
created a task and I can look in here at
the tasks that I've completed you can
look at the you know check out like
we've got our entire inventory on here
and all of our inquiries where you know
people ask us questions and things of
that nature it's so great just to be
able to you know take a look at all of
the like you know we get technical
questions in here everything is no
longer just a million different emails
it really allows me to work the way I
want and this is so cool too when we
want to bring in like you know clients
from outside we can allow them in our
own I mean it's like having an intranet
I did sis have been for ten years we've
tried I've seen so many different really
bad implementations of like intranet
stuff and this is the only one that I
would even consider using because I must
say the app changes everything because
you're already used to using the same
kind of paradigms I have a feed here I
can post a status update of what I'm
working on so it's really cool stuff and
it's allowed me to work however I want
wait I won't work is hey I just I just
took care of what I needed to do on my
phone right now just a sigh just
delegated so that's what it's all about
that's you know to be honest between
this and all of the people back at the
hak5 studio you you know I'm constantly
telling you guys you know to tweet at
podium to tweet at all people that are
supporting us you know tweet at Shannon
and Paul and Sarah and everybody back at
the hak5 studio that's allowing me to do
this and podio to tie it all together
this is so cool I'm so impressed that
we're you know month into this trip now
and it's all working so beautifully
because of this so I thought that I'd
mentioned that to you guys because I'm a
process geek this is a cool thing that
might work for your business if you're
into you know streamlining processes
instead of remains million spreadsheets
and emails so I encourage you guys to
check it out they are sponsoring AK 5
and we appreciate them for supporting us
and of course
supporting hack across America so all
you have to do is go over to PO do comm
sign up today it's free invite all your
friends create a workspace try it out I
think you might really like it and with
that I'll see you guys on the road this
week's technology of the week comes from
John and it's actually a series of tech
no less photos of the week and they are
wicked cool so check these out I mean
are they a museum or an army base he
didn't really send any kind of
description but I did look it up
apparently this is the Hat green secret
nuclear bunker it's a former
government-owned nuclear bunker located
at hack Green in England that's super
cool and now it's a museum so you can go
check it out yourself I kind of want to
go there now thank you so much John for
sending your photos over to us and you
can always send your pictures to
feedback at hack 5 org with the subject
line type in the list
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
