5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip this is the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus in IT
ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and today I'm
making netcat talked to other processes
we have learned how to use netcat to
chat with another computer and how to
push a file transfer so today I'm going
to show you how to use netcat to make
two processes talk to each other on a
network now I want to send all of my
files in one directory on my Linux
machine over to my Windows 8 computer so
first off on my Linux computer which the
IP address is 10.7 3.30 1.1 4 5
keep that in mind I am going to send a
directory to my W 8 machine my Windows 8
machine so on the sender computer the
Linux machine I'm going to type in tar
Tech CF tak or - pictures which is a
specific folder pipe - NC Tech L Tech
p133 7 all right
press ENTER ok now on my Windows 8
machine now this is where the IP address
comes in handy for the Linux box on my
Windows machine I go into startup netcat
so NC 1070 3.31 dot what did I say 1 4 5
and then I'm going to put in port 1 3 3
7 the same port and pipe that to tar tak
XF Tech enter BAM so after a couple of
seconds it automatically goes back to my
regular command prompt so I'm gonna go
into here ok so now we have a pictures
window right here so if I click on that
tada you can see both of the pictures
that I had recently transferred from my
Linux machine over to my Windows machine
it's like magic yay so now my new
pictures and directory have been
transferred so easy now after the break
I'm going to show you another way to
transfer files really
and really easy stay tuned the hack shop
is hack fives premier store for all of
your pen testing needs at all including
one of my favorites the USB rubber ducky
which looks like a flash drive but it
actually quacks in types like a keyboard
it can type scripts into a computer
ridiculously fast like this week's
favorite pick from the ghanoush in the
forums so this script will automatically
eject all of the CD trays of the target
system at the beginning of every hour
just think about that for a second it's
so funny he calls it the CD tray
poultrygeist
I love this it's so hilarious and you
guys are so creative I'm having so much
fun checking out all of these amazing
pranks and I can't wait to do these to
everybody in the office you didn't hear
that Paul we wanted to do the show
without your support we seriously
couldn't so we would like to thank you
with something special you can use the
coupon code snubz with any order for
your very own signed hack tip stickers
and anybody can sign those really Darren
I mean who knows we'll see thank you
again for supporting the show and now
we're back with processes now I can only
also copy just one file which we did
similarly in a past hack tips so with
this one on the sender computer my Linux
machine again I'm going to type in cat
and then whatever the JPEG is called web
jpg for this example I'm gonna pipe that
to NC Tech L Tech p133 7 when I press
ENTER you don't see anything on the
screen quite yet but we're going to move
over to my windows 8 machine where I'm
trying to transfer the file and I'm
gonna type in the actual IP address of
my Linux machine so on the windows box I
type in NC space and then 10 dot 70 3.30
1.1 4 5 which is the IP address 1 337
greater than symbol web dot jpg so what
am I doing here I'm basically telling
net cat to look at the IP address for my
Linux machine and then use the port 1
through 37 and
basically take the file web JPEG from
that Linux box so when I press enter on
here and it's going to take a few
moments fresh it actually to transfer
the file but once it's done we should
see it over in the directory so if I
look back at my Windows machine again
down here on my actual GUI I see web dot
JPEG and that is a JPEG I know that's
the icon for JPEGs so if I click on it I
don't see it quite yet
because it's still basically trying to
transfer so I'll click back into my
desktop I'm gonna go ahead and click
ctrl C to cancel out of both of these
and then double click on it again there
it is
snubs that's exactly what the JPEG was
supposed to look like
cool now another thing you can do that's
kind of interesting with netcat and well
it might not be recommendable is copying
over the whole freakin hard disk drive
so you can do that as well with the cat
command and I'll have that in the show
notes and you can move the entire hard
disk drive to another computer now with
with that said I would not necessarily
recommend using that cat to transfer
your entire disk if there are any errors
during the transfer it's not going to
tell you what those errors are so you
could miss a completely different packet
you can lose something in the transfer
process so you can choose to use DD to
duplicate your disk with netcat but even
so make sure that you know what you were
doing and I should probably do a segment
on DD as well because that's a pretty
interesting program so it doesn't end up
standing for destroyer of disks get it
dd destroy your disks I know that was a
terrible joke anyway I'm pretty much
done here I will be wrapping up my
netcat series in the next week or so so
if you do have questions feel free to
send them over to me you can either
comment below or you can email us over

org and be sure to check out our sister
show hack 5 for more great stuff just
like this we're doing SDR radio stuff
it's really really fun you should check
