fair 2011 and I'm ready the beetle oh
yeah yeah come on go he's a little slow
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by go to assist Express domain com and
Windows Azure Oh welcome back five my
name is Darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
of course your weekly dose of technol us
attack five it's not even your weekly
dose of tension less because we now have
three doses of technol us every week
that's like an overdose of technol
assess kind of is yeah yeah if you guys
haven't tuned in hack tip on Mondays and
Fridays little bite-sized snippets of
goodness talk about it later but um but
for all those two asking like why man
wearing a hat so you don't have to do
you try to kill your hair off the green
sky think we've got it all on lockdown
now Paul found the most amazing feature
for chroma key real anyway it's gonna
make the yeah I'm so excited oh cool I'm
excited about this episode were like
cracking hashes we've got like password
recovery stuff fair dude Maker Faire so
much fun did you did you see those like
ridiculous walking like chariot thanks
guy oh that was freaky and like the
gigantic ax what was it at Concord yeah
oh and then and then not to mention they
had this amazing like kind of rave thing
going with Tesla coil that was really
really fun apparently they had one of
the Mythbusters in the cage on Sunday oh
nice yeah I was like oh that's awesome I
wish we could have seen that but
yeah good times all around yeah very
Burning Man ish there's some elements of
that outside going on for sure yeah
here's cool you knows you go every year
what's a burning man oh yeah she's a
huge huge burner of course they probably
turned me for the hacker headlines
though so let's get it started off
hecka headlines it seems that the Sony
Fiasco is never ending and here is the
latest news so net a subsidiary of Sony
and a large Japanese internet service
provider was hacked and customer emails
were stolen as well as customer rewards
points that stinks they say of course
that it is unknown whether or not the
breach has anything to do with the sony
hacks but i'd put my money on it 10
bucks right there luckily there is no
evidence that the customer data other
than email addresses were compromised
and on goes all of the sodium packing
actually including so no wonder the
grease in asia now Japan sony ericsson
it's ready for the sony you want to make
a new TV show know what we call tony
hacks Jack it's Tony unpack of the
disown you end of the day anyway you
want to hear about some other owning
newegg might be joining the wall of
sheep that is plain text offenders calm
a new a good customer Jerry Asha writes
in his blog about an experience with
customer service that ended with the
representative giving him his password
what sex how do they have his password
well hacker news is actually reporting
that or pointing out that the password
could have been may be stored in
reversible encryption come on the pegs
why even bother at that point seriously
like why even use broke encrypted like
md5 what's what's the funniest salt
people they're not just for margaritas
new work you got to find out you gotta
check out the plaintext offenders it's
sad so all the people it's not just them
it's like jetblue and it's it's a real
it's so sick Wow yes just mmm you know
for some reason I'm not as surprised as
I should be so here's some happy news
you mean that we do need happy news a
hacking group called joinable decided to
create a service called joinable to
bring voicemail texting and email access
to those unconnected bulks for free they
threw the program together over the
weekend and they really want to hand it
off to a homeless shelter to use the
service would be really too easy easy to
set up and run and it could connect
prisoners for the ability to hunt for
jobs or it can connect homeless people
in need of health care to their health
care
writers good deeds are always a really
nice thing to mention in this very
technology driven world and that's a
good thing i think yes i'm texting Paul
oh wait that's right our producer netted
RuPaul's in a real person cards don't
really get a hold of her well hey to use
this there's this free service called
joinable that will connect you to
anybody that you need to be kissin good
get us in code someone simple so thank
you might have to live in a homeless
shelter to get it salright want to break
encryption on an iOS four device yes got
80 bucks no well elcomsoft the Russian
password recovery company is just the
software to sell you if you did it's
called phone password breaker and it
cracks the aes 256-bit hardware
encryption dumping the iPhone iPad or
iPod Touch file system and then goes
after the keys with well up to 32 CPUs
eight GPUs and they're claiming that
typical brute force x is somewhere
around 40 minutes so couple that with
like n case and you've got a killer
combo for like forensics investigators
law enforcement governments the bad guys
yeah you know good stuff ah and here's
something for the kiddies not kiddies ok
kid tease no you know kids ok so bright
shirts okay well you know nerds are an
animal lovers and who doesn't like to
play with their kitty or their doggy I
do this video by dino shows his creation
of a cat and mouse game literally though
it seems that his dog is a little bit
more interested in the fake Mouse pin
his cat because that just kind of sits
there the video is 11 minutes long so
we'll have a link in the show notes but
we wanted to give you a short little
taste of the ensuing hilarity that is a
dog chasing a little cotton mouth I
thought when you you're writing this
stuff you're researching like hacker
headlights I'm you're just watching
kitten videos aren't you I might be
admit it how can a man i was researching
now it's time for our own kitten video
that's right this time for Kirby's
binary
the week which one will it be
do you have what it takes to compete in
our crack the code challenge and brought
to you by go to assist Express test your
skills in our private lab network and
bid for the title supreme leet hacks or
winners will be featured in a future
episode of hak5 our next event will be
sunday june 19th at ten a.m. pacific
visit hak5 org slash challenge for all
of the details will be live streaming at
hak5 org slash live throughout the day
so I'll see you there in just a bit
we'll have a walkthrough / latest
challenge but first we'd like to take a
moment to thank one of our wonderful
sponsors go to assist Express for making
this possible if you provide technical
support for clients colleagues friends
or family have you found an easy
cost-effective way without being there
in person well the best way for me to
provide technical support is to do it
online with go to assist express it lets
you view and control another computer on
the internet so you can quickly and
easily resolve technical issues I've
been able to help friends family learn
how to use new software or fix family
computer problems without being there in
person try go to assist express free for
30 days for this special offer visit go
to assist calm / hak5 again let's go to
assist a calm / hak5 for a free trial
you know how you can store and save all
your login credentials and Firefox
Chrome as well as other browsers well
maybe that's not such a great idea yeah
there's several portable yeah portable
tools that can instantly recover login
credentials stored by Firefox Chrome and
others browser store your username and
your password for every single website
that you visit as long as you give them
consent in the settings the credentials
are saved by Firefox Chrome and all the
other browsers in a sign on database
that is securely encrypted today I'm
going to be focusing on Firefox fire
password the tool in question today can
instantly decrypt and recover the data
even if there's a master password
protecting it not only this but fire
password can even recover sign-on
passwords for other profiles on the same
exact system in all the info from other
os's like Linux and Mac this can
obviously be used for malicious intent
or it can be used for the greater good
of forensic investigators who need to
transmit data from the target PC to
another machine without disrupting the
target machine in the first place fire
password portable works from Windows XP
all the way up to 7 and it loads DLLs
from the Firefox executable location
automatically dll's aren't package with
the tool and the newest version / dead
let me do that again fire password
portable works from Whitney fire
password portable works from Windows XP
all the way up to 7 and it loads dll's
from the Firefox executable location
automatically dll's aren't packaged with
the tool and the newest version presents
this really easy to use color based
display so that you can clearly view
password details so let's go ahead and
get started cracking my firefox
passwords whoo all right to install
follow the on-screen instructions over
at security exploded com they're really
really nice and detailed down at around
the middle of the page or so so your
installation should be pretty easy
process and you shouldn't have any
problems they also go through the
process of how to actually start it up
as well so once your installed you open
up your Camille
prompt and you change the directory of
your fire password exe folder it's
probably somewhere in your program files
so I'm going to go ahead and find mine
open up CMD command prompt change
directory and I think it's somewhere in
my program files and let's see ya
security exploded that's what I'm
looking for a change directories
security exploded fire password ok so to
make this work all I have to do is type
in fire password Exe and then hit enter
and I should see some kind of screen
with a whole bunch of different
passwords and usernames on here so fire
password Exe a hit enter all right there
we go so it shows me a saved host list
with all the usernames and passwords
myself i only have saved twitter and
facebook so you can see my username
right there and the password as well the
Kirby one two three four five six or
whatever your password might be it
doesn't even have to be something super
crazy long or a super short it's is
still going to figure it out whether or
not it will list every single website
username and password you have saved it
also lists all the old passwords that
you never deleted out of your firefox
settings so if you've been using the
same password for several different
sites might be a good time to change
those also if you have a master password
set on firefox you will need that
password to be able to see your other
passwords for example i'm going to set
up a password of master password on my
firefox browser so i'll go to tools
options use a master password and i'm
just going to make it really easy for
the sake of the snubs report Kirby
successfully change okay and okay so now
to make it work I'm going to have to
type in fire password EFC space tech em
and then type in kirby and press enter
okay so it gives me a little bit more
information since i put in a master
password that time and it also still
gives me the same user names and regular
passwords that i have for several
different websites so if i just happen
to type that in and i had the wrong
master password so i'll just put in
kirby with three eyes it's going to give
me a big error code it's going to tell
me that it's not going to work I have to
have by actual master password you can
also copy the Firefox profiles from
different operating systems such as
Linux or Mac over to the windows system
locally and then specify that path with
fire password to recover passwords from
all of the offline profiles it's pretty
surprising to me how easy this really is
for anybody to discover and how simple
it is to set it up to protect yourself
and do what I do and don't save your
passwords in Firefox make sure your
machine logs off every time you close it
or you leave it idle for more than a
minute anything but really just just
don't save your passwords and I already
changed those so don't even try it's
also worth mentioning the web browser
pass view tool from nurse off it's a
password recovery tool for internet
explorer firefox chrome and opera now if
you've got some kind of other tool for
me to check out make sure to email me at
feedback at hak5 org and now Darren's
here to give us a little bit of
information about our hack tips
if you haven't heard by now we're really
excited to announce that we've launched
a new show from back 5 and you've
already seen it throughout this season
it's been our very own hack tip and it's
rocking its own solo gig over at
revision 3.com hak5 org YouTube tune in
this week because Shannon and I are
breaking down standard streams and
pipelines and Linux we're using john the
ripper and aircrack-ng to crack wpa
encrypted wireless networks and by the
way the same technique would work
against firefox master passwords just as
Shannon had just demonstrated anyway
she's also covering virtual desktops for
Windows and I'm all over promiscuous
mode and packet sniffing for wireless so
check it out every Monday and Friday
it's like consolidated technol lets you
just add water no that doesn't sound
right at all how about this pack tips
sure cans for IT ninjas will be back
after a brief word from our sponsor dot
TV is the best domain name for websites
with video if you want to build a video
site or if your website has a play
button I recommend getting a dot TV
domain a dot TV website lets you
showcase your original content and
create a unique site not just another
youtube channel just go to domain calm
and search for the perfect TV domain for
your new idea then use coupon code hak5
that's hak5 at checkout to save an extra
fifteen percent if you need to host your
dot TV website don't forget about domain
coms web hosting plans they're less than
six bucks a month and they have
everything you need to build maintain
and promote your website remember when
you think domain names think domain.com
got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain com
spinnin Anna
fennekin soul
the legs been around since nineteen
nineteen ninety-eight so 12 13 years
we've got about 250 members now half of
them are kids and the other half big
they are okay so poor the the Lego guys
and I'm sure this you've heard this
story the Lego guys that are maybe their
adult Lego you know players and and and
they don't know that there is like a
thriving community of Lego enthusiasts
out there how do you find a you know if
you're not in the Bay Area how do you
find a lego user group okay there's a
website called lugnut Lu gnet niggas org
wavy.com I don't remember but there's
nothing to have a map that shows where
all the lugs are the country actually
around the world
when I was finishing my doctorate I took
up kite surfing and I was building all
my own years let's retake a giant night
and a board I dragged you out the ocean
in the infancy the sport the gear wasn't
Magister that good so I was actually
building all my own here and then
document to get on my personal website
it's taking just as long to write a web
page about making a kite board as it was
to build the type work around 2000 so it
was clear to me I needed a better way to
document the projects then share them
another
start a design firm and we've built the
framework of instructables and movies
I can show you know what I'm talking
about right yeah I mean that's the
problem at all of these things that the
the driver level with the technology
isn't quite ready yet but I think that's
actually getting really good now does
the Sketchup make that any easier so
Sketchup exports eps files which are
great for laser cutting exports dxf
files which are great for CNC cutting
sometimes those used interchangeably and
then colada turns out is a pretty good
pretty good format to get 3d models out
for printing now do you have to use like
intermediary software to then send it to
those those devices or can you do that's
great it straight from when didn't
Sketchup now yeah what it turns out is
it depends on what kind of printer
you're going to but if you're looking at
something like a MakerBot the front end
for their device is a program called rep
G and there's an experimental branch of
that now that except colada is the input
file so we can export right from
Sketchup into a file that will read
last week's trivia question was
including icons for snowman octopuses
and alien faces the specification is the
japanese term for emoticons and the
answer was emoji emoji this week's
question is the cinematic sound cliche
most notably featured in George Lucas's
films has been included in over 200
movies television shows and video games
since 1954 I know that one answer at
hak5 org slash trivia to win some sweet
swag and now a word from our sponsor
Windows Azure is the cloud platform for
developers that lets you focus on
building and running apps not
infrastructure it has scalable
pay-as-you-go capacity meaning
developers don't have to wait to develop
get faster speed to market and generate
and meet immediate demand only rent what
you need when you need it it's a rich
platform with built-in connectivity and
development tools meaning you can focus
on business logic and get a head start
on time to market flexible development
gives you the ability to run on Windows
Azure on your own system with Windows
Azure burst capacity you can deploy with
confidence run your apps where and when
it makes sense without worrying about
overwhelming systems to learn more about
everything you need to start developing
with windows azure check out microsoft
com / cloud / windows azure
that just about wraps up this episode of
hak5 no it doesn't i'm joking we got the
crack the cook challenge how you
complete it here technol s photo of the
week first sound good to me we have we
gonna switch it up a little bit yeah I
like it Michael break time allows photo
Louise cassette from bill God he sends
in three really cool photos of dinosaurs
made out of old computer parts that his
12-year old daughter made her that's so
creative I need a boy she is a genius
mmm the Stegosaurus super cool I know
right yeah dude like the mother good day
miss you so cool yeah totally awesome
cool yeah I was always like thinking
that about them too yeah me too I want
one in my room oh yeah with the salad
animatronics all I'm gonna eat your face
off so cracked a code challenge only
thank the participants everybody that
like tuned in watched up signed up to
play did you is awesome Leo was the
first to complete the challenge I was
actually you know on oh is this yeah
this guy like the back enjoys it was
just crazy like a tennis match yeah so
leah was the first one to complete the
challenge and actually I didn't even
notice him doing it because it was too
busy watching what's going on between
net shroud and zachary better I'd
actually completed the challenge while
Zachary put forth a valiant effort and
I'm going to just go ahead and break
down the steps and how you would
complete this challenge and uh well
recover all three checkpoints because as
you know crack the code challenge it's
all about the Kirby photos the JPEGs of
Kirby and the first step is to come in
to the actual recycle bin na there's a
wee b.jpg I know is that you put a
picture in the recycle bin I put a patch
and recycle bin you know this well you
know it's so easy oh I'm sure a lot of
people are just like oh yeah typically
the correct code challenges we've had
like some really really difficult stuff
yeah first and so people are thinking
like Oh sniff the network oh listen on
ports those different things and
actually a lot of people got hung up on
this because it was just that easy and I
thought that since there are three
checkpoints I would kind of make the
first one really easy turns out by
making it super simple super difficult
so I gave it a head
the hint I was like they're trashing our
rights man trashing hahaha um so if you
just open the readme there is it what is
this once a number one hand sleep get it
checkpoint code yeah so you got your
first check one code and you know it's
all ticket Ripper be in the box from the
old hack house that's just cute well I
also provide you with everything that
you need to complete the cracks code
challenge of course and one of the tools
here is the exit toll GUI so we fire up
the ex of tool GUI right here and go
ahead and actually drag in our image
oops that was the X cable the image just
open that you'll see that oops there is
a bunch of additional information exif
data as the metadata stored by the
camera when you take a photograph so it
typically has like to make the model the
camera and when you took photo what the
aperture was what the shutter speed was
all that sorts of stuff and we're using
this to hide a little bit of data no
this isn't eggnog raphy well I guess you
could kind of consider somewhat
steganography in the sense that we're
hiding something in plain sight but
we're not like using that you're not
changing you're not changing the file
itself you're changing them well yeah I
guess I am changing something in the
file but really it's just the metadata
yeah and what I've added here is the
model of the camera is a IP address 1073
3114 / cece cf-29 JR justin / 14 the
make is cracked the code challenge and
the image description here a lot of
people didn't realize this this right
here if I go and actually edit this is
this is a hash yeah and it is a LM hash
that we can use to break into the
winners box Oh giving them a IP address
I've given them a hash and really at
this point let me just copy this
information here wrote a note pad so we
paste it into notepad and if you're used
to looking at a hash like this you'll
notice the colon in the center there
that's actually what's separating this
because this is an LM Hatcher
and man hat it's really old one nobody's
be using this kind of stuff anymore
we've talked about breaking these
numerous times in the past you you let
you like that tool off crack yes right
yes well you could you know fire up off
crack and try that in fact Zachary did
or what I like to do is use one of the
numerous online just cracking tools so
i'm gonna select everything for that
purse colon and i'm just gonna pop it
into you know there's md5 decrypter
dakota UK there's online hash crack this
one you're pretty good just hash cracked
com so I pop in hash hit submit and it
says hey that results to password uh huh
password is password that's funny so now
you have an IP address you have a
password if you actually say pull up
exercise bike / 1073 dot 31 to 14 you're
asked for the username well there's a
user name that's on most every window
system it's administrator ah and in this
case password which has actually changed
get to that in a second and there we go
I've got a ccc for for folder like I
expect and hey it's another jpg digging
kitty bit oh look at her face Kirby got
into all the baking just who makes
cookies to bake some cookies anyway so
you got your second checkpoint jpg now a
lot of people then took that JPEG back
into the exit to like Oh what else is
what patented isn't there actually if
you do that you're gonna find the make
and model it's like the canon TI 2 or x
SI or something like that so there
really no hidden data in this one per se
but right next to it is fine to kirby
dot pcap wonder what's in there ok well
you could just go ahead and open this up
with save Wireshark
you'll see you have a bunch of TCP
traffic in here okay well if you're used
to these practical challenges you
understand that all of these checkpoints
are JPEGs of Kirby so we just fire up a
little now what am I ready yeah I have
that's something I have network minor my
tools folder and I'm just going to point
it at this pcap file and what network
minor is going to do is it's going to
make it a lot easier to to raid this
pcap files packet capture file then then
it would be to say go through every
packet by hand in wireshark now poor
poor netra actually wasn't able to
because his um o Network minor was
broken so he actually was going through
him by hand in wireshark what you can do
with some filters it's not that bad and
if I just come over here to images I see
there are a ton of images and one of the
allows it near the bottom there we go
it's called him complete jpg so I'm
gonna go ahead and extract this open
image and there you got you has
completed to the challenge and you have
your final checkpoint code and that's it
Wow I know but it was a lot of fun I
gotta say you know um nette trout he
gets to like the second checkpoint by
remotely actually uh instead of just
going in through samba he ended up just
remotely exploiting the server using
metasploit which was installed on his vm
and and then he cracked to the LM hash
but his network minor was broken as i
mentioned on his vm so Zachary well he's
like on checkpoint one and he's
downloading rainbow tables for the LM
hashes cuz he's going to go about it
that way and said he's in like an online
tool well so while he's downloading
those net shrouds downloading a new
version of network minor still doesn't
work he's gotten like dll errors so so
he's a curry well Zachary cracks the
password using the rainbow tables that
he downloaded for off track and he
attempts to reboot the server using an
IP scanning tool that he had downloaded
remotely reboot the server that was
hosting the shutdown the server that was
hosting the pcap file but it was so
exciting because you know net trout had
already made it in with that with
metasploit so he just changed the
password to Zach Oh were letters I know
right oh the sporting his reboot attempt
and then he continued to just like combs
through in wireshark using a couple of
filters by hand trying to find the JPEG
like where I actually got it from I
think I like hosted on Twitter Fisher
Commerce like that um but then Zach
broke the password and shuts down server
ah it's too late because because Metroid
had remoted back home with metasploit
downloaded the pcap ran through tools at
home and then he uploads and we're like
what is he up loading and boom Wow he
has the JPEG and net trad had completed
the crack the code challenge despite all
of Zachary's efforts and it was really
really cool it's exciting yeah it was so
cool so thank you guys all for
participating that was like a lot of fun
and yeah definitely head over to hack
five Deaderick / challenge because
that's where you can find all of the
ways that you can get involved in the
next one you can watch videos about the
previous ones that we've done and get
the old files you can get the old files
and cracking the home a lot of some of
them you know well anyway just just head
over there you'll find all the good
stuff mmm deliciousness yes ah well I
think we're about done here we got a few
things to yeah we've got over but any
episodes but yeah remember you can
always support the show free and very
simple by subscribing on itunes or
youtube i download the show and itunes

facebook to get all the most up-to-date
news on hak5 i just twitter a lot just
join the Facebook thing did you yeah
converted a friend Paige public person
thing and now I have a yeah oh I totally
sent you a friend request
and you can always sign up for our next
crack the code challenge with go to
assist Express water let's see june
twelfth yeah it's gonna be exciting yeah
I'm super excited I got some good stuff
anyway until next week I'm Darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse trust your
technol list
vibrates when you touch it it's a haptic
when you touch it it vibrates each
throw this at you no that's not it
