threads
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus in IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today on getting into
some more terminal 101 as I've been
learning the Linux terminal I've been
sharing what I found throughout the hack
tips and I don't know why but I find it
pretty exciting yeah I guess I'm I'm a
nerd
yeah there's no way getting around that
one yeah this week let's check out a few
more interesting topics wildcards hard
links and symbolic links now wildcards
are a group of these really special
characters that you can use to specify a
big group of file names instead of
having to type out each and every single
one using wildcards is also called
globbing seriously it's called glopping
I don't know why now let's check out a
few of these different wildcards first
off there is the asterisk which looks
like these the asterisk will match any
characters with your query a question
mark
tamal will match any single character
now any kind of characters that you
stick inside of a couple of brackets
such as these so I can put ABC like that
will choose a set character and carry
any set of characters like ABC will
match up with any character that is not
in it if it has an exclamation mark at
the beginning like that sticking some
characters inside a couple of brackets
with a couple of colons
like so we'll match with any character
that is a member of a specified class
now a class can be a number a letter a
lowercase letter or an uppercase letter
just to name a few of the different
classes now some examples I want to copy
this pic file so I could type in C P P
asterisk for any file that starts with a
P and then I'm going to copy it into
folder 1 which is right here press ENTER
and if I go into folder 1
I'll see there's pic 1 loading and there
we go ha ha and it works if I want to
move a file for example I want to move
my upgrade dot bin file over here I can
move it with MV space and then you
because upgrade op it starts with au
dots bin and then I'm going to move it
into folder 1 and if I press ENTER it
disappears
oops let's put that down and if I go in
folder 1 there it is upgrade dot bin ha
it works awesome I can also move files
with the question mark wildcard now to
do that for example if I wanted to move
my pick file I would type in MV space P
and then two question marks to move that
pick file the two question marks mean
that any file that starts with P and has
two characters after it will be moved I
could move my photo and my text file by
typing in MV like this would be like
this and then using the brackets and
typing in C I'll do the upgrade dot bin
and the pick bracket asterisk for any
anything that starts with those two
letters which means any file that starts
with the U or the P will be moved or
will be copied or whatever you want it
to do the list goes on and on the cool
thing about wildcards is they also work
in the GUI and you've probably noticed
that they work in a lot of other
programs now after the break all be
touching on creating links whatever
those are but first here's a word from
our sponsor if you love alternative

leave the house and we're back now onto
those links that I was talking about the
Ln command lets you create hard and
symbolic links now you can use it by
either typing Ln file links OLN and then
the file and whatever I want the link to
be called or you can type in Ln tak s
and whatever you want the link to be
called again short cup cut because
apparently I can't type right basically
a hard link is the original way of
creating links every file has one and
that is what gives the file its name a
hard link creates an additional
directory entry for a file but it can't
work outside of its own file system and
it can't reference a directory they
exist and you may run across them from
time to time and wonder what the heck is
this so just know that they are their
symbolic links are more modern and more
favorable version of the link idea one
way of thinking of a symbolic link is to
think of it as a window shortcut
basically if you remove a symbolic link
only the link is removed not the
original file now I found this short
article that explains it really well and
I'll give the link in the show notes and
it gives some really good examples if
you're still a little confused about
symbolic and hard links alright that
about wraps it up for this week's
episode of hack tip but I want to know
what did you guys learn about the
terminal if you guys are learning along
with me tell me what websites you guys
are using
because I could totally use them tell me
about in the comments below or you can
email me tips at hack 5 org and be sure
to check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this I'll be
there reminding you to trust your
