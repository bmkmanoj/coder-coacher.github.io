by Toyota with act 5 I'm Shannon Morse
from CES 2014 and i'm here with diego
and you're from d's maker now i have
heard of you guys because i know about
this awesome 3d printer behind me called
the bushido this guy started out on was
it kickstarter is that correct
yes last year we did a Kickstarter for
the buco bottom a the big one and
earlier this year we did or actually
last last year it's 2014 already time
flies
yes but basically 2012 we did the buco
bot and 2013 we did Abu Quito
congratulations first of all on the
Kickstarter I'm super excited to see you
know one of the smaller 3d printers
getting out there and see them at CES
this is amazing so congratulations on
that I know you have a new 3d printer
this year I would like to talk about
that a little bit if that's okay okay
that would be the book you doing
so tell me a little bit about it how
does it work and what makes this guy
special well the book II thought came
along because we sold a lot of the buco
bots we start seeing the users kind of
carry them with them and show them to
friends and wanting to print out stuff
at work and then at home so we decided
to try to aim for very portable and
small printer and that's where the book
etho came from and it's a very you know
rugged machine it's low cost and it's
very kind of user a little more user
friendly as far as you know these type
of open source type of 3d printers
that's really cool first off open source
awesome thank you for so much for that
second all you said this guy is portable
if I move my 3d printer around I will
basically have to put it all back
together and calibrate it again and it
will it's so tiresome it's a whole day
appeal it's it's a whole problem there
but so how you can move this it won't
break yeah we actually flew it on hex
they're an octocopter before while I was
printing and yeah I could show you
really quick
so I have to see this oh my god he's
moving the 3d printer oh my gosh this
makes me nervous and it's totally fine
it's still printing oh that's incredible
I love it that is so cool
I haven't seen a 3d printer do that yet
that is so cool
I could seriously put this thing in my
backpack and take it with me to the next
convention I go to well my partner the
one that designed this rich Cameron and
he basically is his dream is to have a
3d printer as this car all the time so
this was kind of like the answer to that
that's perfect I love it how much does
it cost it's during that $7.99 and as a
kid it's gonna be a partially assembled
so it's not super hard to put together
that's really cool and where can people
find more if they want to buy their own
right now we're taking pre-orders online
we're about to ship off the first batch
of Kickstarter rewards that we got so
after those we catch up pretty fast
we'll start the pre-order delivery
what's the website DS maker.com so it's
Dez ma ke our dot-com perfect thank you
so much Diego this is awesome and I know
you guys have integrated with Leo
Polycom which is by Leonardo who we
interviewed last year so I'm gonna grab
your affiliate over here and chat with
him a little bit about Leo Polly thank
you so much it was great to speak to you
come on over sir hi and you are Renault
Rowland hi how are you doing today all
right good how are you I'm doing very
well so you are the creator of Leo Polly
and you're involved with Leonardo is
that correct right absolutely yes now
tell me a little bit about Leo Polly I
know from Leonardo that was based
towards towards you know college
students it was brought into classrooms
to teach people how to use 3d software
and how to make models what does this do
look around everything is about 3d
creation here right but people don't
really have the tool to start 3d
creation we have the printers but there
are no tools with leo paulo we wanted to
make it super easy to anyone to start
any kind of 3d creation so you just get
online
Leigha Polycom you can browse among
today around 50,000 models all of them
designed by the users and you can pick
any of them shape them further color
them and we just one click away 3d print
them that is so cool is this free to use
because I want to sign up it is free to
use this is a 3d scan model you can
import it and if you don't like yourself
you can modify very easily so the idea
is to very easily personalize or create
things in 3d and if you want we just
print it out
it's a freemium based model which means
that most of the things are free to use
but if you want to launch your own
community site you want to invite your
friends or a classroom or a company you
can do so and you have to pay a monthly
or a yearly subscription so this is free
I can just hop on there and start
creating things let me know I have to
know right now when is this available it
is available so if you go home or if you
try now you save it and you continue at
home and what 3d printers is this
compatible with any any 3d printer so
all of the objects are printable some of
them on the smaller printers need some
kind of adjustment otherwise most of
them are easily printable you can also
print it with your own printer if you
have if not there is a 3d print service
built in it and you can just order your
3d print that's wonderful thank you so
much is there anything else that you
wanted to add before I finish up here I
think it's it's we design it to the new
generation of makers and we like to
invite as many people especially young
people and students to enjoy and learn
3d creation I love seeing that yeah
let's get this out there this is so
exciting thank you so much Roland it was
a pleasure to speak to you today and if
you want more coverage of all sorts of
3d printers go to revision three.com
slash CES 2014 thanks once again to
