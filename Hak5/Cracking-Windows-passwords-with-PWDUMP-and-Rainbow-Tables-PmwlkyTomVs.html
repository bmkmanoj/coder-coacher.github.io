password what's the easiest way to crack
it short answer
rainbow tables because I lose my
password all the time
long answer couple of steps involved
first thing we're gonna need to do is
get his hash yes we're not talking about
the illicit substance oh hey how's it
going Harrison I see you helped yourself
to the fridge hello Darren how are ya
I'm alright so joining us here is
Harrison Holland from the infamous
sploit cast calm where you can find out
anything you want to know about security
loopholes all sorts of fun stuff like
that yes for those of you who don't know
my name is Harrison Holland from sploit
cast that's probably the only place we'd
have ever seen me yeah if you have heard
of me anyhow I was in the neighborhood
and decided to stop by and get a beer
from my good old friend Darren yeah
sometimes I wake up I check the fridge
all the beers gone and I'm like yeah I
must van arason so I'm gonna want your
keys soon yeah okay okay so hey do you
think we use the back door oh yeah I
want to so bad but I'm not going to and
the directors telling me to keep going
so you know whatever the guys in the
control room one can you help Bobby he's
ulema
Bobby man Bobby my boy you and I are
actually not too different and by that I
mean we're actually quite similar that
would be not too different very
frequently I as a matter of fact just
this morning I had a password of my own
hmm that I've been using for two months
would you what do you know I just I just
forgot it I mean I committed the muscle
memory I'd written it down but for some
reason it couldn't find it no this isn't
the first time this happened ever
remembered Ayers has called me before
all the time I said Aaron I think my
password that I can give you need you to
help me get it back twice in one day he
forgot his own past
twice in one day would you believe that
memory Madame's I'm surprised you know
who you are so you know being that I
also forget the password to my own
computer
yeah hobby of course not your teachers
computer oh no definitely is it that
definitely my own computer we're gonna
go ahead run through the steps to
recover that okay but before we start we
should probably explain how we're all
windows yeah exactly how Windows stores
the password so you've got an operating
system and you have a password that
operating system has to store it
somewhere in order to be able to
authenticate when you look try to log in
so it stores in what's called you know a
hash value basically there's a
mathematical algorithm that your
password is run through and it creates a
jar bold yeah that's like garbage it
looks like garbage it really does it
well it looks like it looks exactly like
over five lowercase F h1 okay yeah so
basically it stores it and do you know a
bunch of junk and it uses what's called
a one-way hash to recursively you know
authenticate that I not recursively it
uses it to be able to authenticate that
your password now that hash has to be
stored somewhere on your computer in
Windows is stored in the the Sam
the Sam dot ini file which the location
yes at the bottom of the house yeah okay
now assuming that you don't have access
to your computer all right we're gonna
we're gonna go ahead and assume that you
don't have access to here yeah then it's
very hard for you to login and and run
some of the programs that are used to
extract your hash for example PW dump is
a great one
yeah PW dump can be used if you have
administrator access to your computer to
extract all the hashes for the user
accounts on that computer and I've gone
ahead and run that right here and we can
take a look we see the hashes and you
notice this colon here and that's
because these passwords are split in two
and now it's using what's called DES and
that's the one-way hash that's going to
use to the block cipher block cipher to
create a hash of two seven character
passwords so whatever your parasail aqui
ten character password right it's gonna
split that into a seven character hash
and a three character no value no value
so so and that's for backwards
compatibility because the LM hash is
therefore you know windows 95 98 now me
exactly but we've moved on to 2000 and
XP but we're still retaining that LM
hash for about its compatibility yeah
that works unfortunately if your
password is less is less than 15
characters there's 14 characters or less
there will be a land manager of pass
value stored for that password and
that's a great exploit and that's that's
a great vector for for breaking into
your own system in the event that she
needs a break into your own system yeah
of course aromatics will fall from the
ceiling yeah so so what happens is yeah
like like Darren said you have a 14
character password at the most it's
split into seven character passwords
this is much easier to compute than a
full 14 character password now we could
go and use something like a brute-force
attack and do like a dictionary attack
or brute force by computes and password
that was the old-school way of doing it
like dictionary attacks like you know
all that all that sort of thing but
brute force attacks take an incredible
amount of processing power and
oftentimes the only successful
brute-force attacks are on very weak
passwords right hash words that are used
in a war you know by a word that can be
found in the dictionary or a science
fiction one two three some could be
easily brute-force right we don't all
have access to the earth simulator or
other you know super computers so so
awesome people have pre computed this
for us exactly there's a there was a his
name I'm gonna butcher though I
apologize ahead of time
I think it's filly Pasha long AUSA Lin
something like that he wrote a paper
called you know faster time memory
trade-off to cracking hashes and what
he's basically doing is instead of doing
a brute force attack your pre computing
all the possible hash outputs and their
corresponding password values so you
have an enormous amount of now how big
would this be say like we were just
talking about cracking alphanumeric you
know lowercase uppercase new American
and
skee symbols right that I mean that you
can go up to 40 60 100 gigabytes Wow
right so you definitely want to have
those are called rainbow tape rainbow
tables yep and there's a man who
develops Berg a program called rainbow
crack which you can use to generate your
rainbow tables of course you don't want
to do this unless you have a super super
computers instead of generating your own
tables it's probably just faster bit
torrents of them yourself if torn as a
matter of fact the smooth group released
menteur for different types of hashes
one of which being the land manager hash
and I think it's it's somewhere around
40 gigabytes okay so if you want if you
want to go on and the land management
hash is the one that we're gonna be
attacking right now because that is the
one that that Bobby's been having the
problem with right so let's go ahead and
talk about some of the tools that we can
use we've already talked about PW dump
too and that's a great way to find out
our hash so what other tools are
available to go ahead and crack that
password once we have the hash right
well you have you either gonna have
access to rainbow tables which you can
download or there are several online
sources that you can you can refer to
right you like with this one in
particular well this is this is my
favorite it's called plain text dot info
it's actually playing plai n - text txt
dot info no what's this I told up
basically it's a site that you can
simply access in a web browser submit a
hash and in a set amount of time
depending on you know the waiting time
oftentimes it's this this side is very
backed up and you're gonna have like a
day or two waiting for it to crack your
hash bikini you can simply enter a land
manager hash and it will it will crack
it so how long does it take well it
depends like I said depends upon the
amount of traffic this website is
getting now you're assuming that the
website is not you know it experienced a
high experience in a high traffic load
then you can get your cash back rather
quickly right now we also talked about
another site in particular that we we
just had an interview
and that is rainbowcrack online and this
group is offers online offers a service
where they will crack whatever password
you throw at it for a fee right and it's
significantly faster unfortunately
there's a subscription fee that you have
to pay per month and I really don't see
you know if it works for him great I
don't see the point in paying for
something I think you pay for
convenience it's also integrated with
Cain and Abel so yeah if your timing is
what's your time worth yeah if I'm a
security analyst and you know I'm
getting paid by the hour by some client
anyway whatever so if you're getting
paid by the hour by some client you
probably have a spare hard drive to
download that that's true as well
but okay okay so one of the other ones
that I also like is if you're looking
for a quick and easy way to do this is
this great Linux live CD called off
crack live CD or I'm sorry
yeah off flap OPH crack and okay this is
this is a great Linux live CD they've
both got a CD and a DVD Linux live
distro is where you boot them up and
they go right into using rainbow crack
they've got excuse me they've got the
the rainbow table stored right on them
and they will go ahead and start
cracking your windows passwords it's
actually it's actually a good thing that
you mentioned the whole live CD thing
because like Bobbie mentioned before
he's locked out of his own computer so
this would be exact way for him to find
out his password assuming he long Ieyasu
means log of his computer there's no way
for him to really log into his computer
and send us an email with a question
like did it outside we got a I'm sure so
yeah you go down to your friend's house
go to off crack that sourceforge.net and
then try the live CD and then you know
just boot off of that and what it'll do
is start immediately right when you boot
it start cracking your your windows LM
hashes and you know the the CD version
has like a 400 some megabyte rainbow
table which has got like lower case a
certain amount of it yeah you know and
like numbers passwords yeah a few
symbols it was ever crack some of my
weaker ones pretty instantly now if you
have a stronger password though a good
solution would be to boot off of
something like Knoppix yeah
not because my favorite because it
automatically it automatically boots or
loads now the partition this partition
for your hard drive and ice you can put
in topics open that partition and
navigate to the directory that's at the
bottom of the screen that's holding your
LM hat right so right copy that my used
to the whole IPTV thing right I this I
don't know it works you know yeah but uh
so yeah you navigate to the right
directory where your Sam that ini file
which is the file that holds that hash
but all the hashes for your user
accounts and their passwords and then
you can simply copy that onto like a USB
fly USB Drive or or FTP almost have
software this USB floppy drive or an FTP
is somewhere and then use another
computer to rainbow crackit so if the
password is too strong for something
like off crack then you can use a
knoppix to pull that file off take it to
another file and then do some real real
hardcore cracking with like rainbow
tables right or some full tables or
submit it to plain text or rambo crack
coverage and something that i use all
the time in my job where it's not just i
don't really need to know what the
password is i just need to be able to
get in it's okay if I just reset the
password what I really love is this
program called the offline NT password
and registry editor bootable CD and if
it's mouthful and so is the or oh so do
you say that again I missed it missed
the offline NT password and registry
editor bootable CD uh that's different
from the offline password and registry
uh something else yeah okay so the URL
is at bottom screen this is an awesome
tool where basically you can make
yourself a bootable CD where it's not
going to recover your password it's not
gonna crack your password however it
will let you overwrite the password so
like if I forgot my administrator
password on an exchange 2003 server I
could pop this in the server boot it up
and and reset the password so they can
log in you know why didn't we just
mention this first because this would
have avoided the whole legality issue
into stance really I mean there's no
legality issues if he wants to create
maybe maybe wants to recover that you
know act had an exact message
change it no he wants to know what it
was yeah so that he can and I'm sure if
you use a variation you know if he goes
to the ours it tastes download and burn
and and crack or whatever method he
decides to choose to find out his
password he's gonna remember the
experience and never forget that
password again yeah you're exactly right
there yes so thank you so much Harrison
for drinking all of my beer and
answering
Bobby's question I'm sure he's excited
about going and then doing some rainbow
cracking of his own okay and so where
did we find out more about your shadow
auspice point cast display cast calm and
as a matter of fact gentleman who did a
presentation in smoo con named by the
name of Dan moon is did he did a whole
presentation on breaking the land man
forever and he has agreed to be on
display cast unfortunately is my fault
because I've like it's been like two
months now since I've last chorus bonded
with him and eventually I'm hoping we
will get him on so great if you check
the site we might be able to talk about
I'm looking forward to that interview
that's gonna be great so keep your eye
on split cast calm and we look forward
to drinking some more beers and cracking
some why is why is always play cast so
funny
I don't know it's something about this
boy ting that's 14-year we're casting
sploit right thanks so much
Joey I hope you have fun crack now Bobby
Bobby Joey one of you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
