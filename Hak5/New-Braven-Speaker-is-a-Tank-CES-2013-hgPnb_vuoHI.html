go further hi all I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from revision 3 2013 on
location at another convention oh my
gosh I am so tired but I found braven
with Tracy Smith and you got some sweet
little ruggedized speakers that look
very cool and I love you guys you always
have the awesomest speakers and they're
so colorful they're so cute so tell me a
little bit about these and Whitey's are
so cool thanks of course you love these
things are awesome aren't they made in
school we've had some really fun
development with great speakers portable
audio they're cool they I come to
different color lava and glacier but the
cool thing about these is you got the
same great audio of our other baton
speakers but they actually waterproof
and they've got a two meter drop rating
which means if you drop them off of your
bed off of your couch off of your desk
they're surviving it is this little
screw on thing back there what is that
this right here is the port all the
buttons are sealed the drivers are
sealed and this little cap on here is an
ingenious way to hide all the ports and
all the buttons make everything
waterproof so that when you're finished
splashing in the water and you want to
plug your phone in and recharge your
phone from the braven we can do it and
obviously the ports aren't waterproof
correct no the ports are not waterproof
and it's this rubber on the outside
how's that made yeah so rubberized
housing makes it more durable make some
more waterproof it's a complicated
molding process it makes it bounce makes
it bounce very fun sticks to things you
can actually stay on an angle you can
sit on your dash better so it's very
cool now i'm i'm assuming it has a
rechargeable battery in it so how long
does that last it doesn't rechargeable
battery this will play for 12 hours and
because it has such a massive battery in
it that's how you can recharge your
phone by plugging into the USB port
without having point in anything
middle of Timbuktu and recharge your
phone from your braven that's cool i
like the fact that it's actually a
rechargeable speaker and it can charge
your battery at the same time now how
long does it take to actually charge it
up for couple hours yeah not bad that's
sweet now how much does this cost when
can I find it on the market because I'm
pretty excited I want to dunk this thing
in the water that's the best part of it
it's a 169 it's on the market at the end
of January when you can find it on
braven calm at that time awesome perfect
now I just have one more question for
you can i dunk this in the water and let
my like Sharky friends listen to it or
do I have to like make it float or
something most of our customers done
listen to music underwater but if you
own a shark we don't recommend dunking
it underwater it's actually waited say
it's a waterproof ipx 5 rating which
means that it's not rated for submersion
but it can float on water and keep
playing it can handle whatever hardest
rain you can throw at it it's really
quite durable for water oh that's good I
like the fact that it can float that's
gonna be really fun when we go to Lake
Tahoe don't you agree soon yeah alright
we're going thank you so much Tracy it
was excellent talking to you about the
braven and let's have a little bit of
fun with this shall we you can find all
of our extra coverage over at revision
3.com I'm here at the Ford booth at CES
2013 with ed how are you doing at Aaron
how's it going and we're checking out
the TDK what is a TD k i'm just doing
sdk we're ready to DK TDK is a
technology development kit that
developers can get for you know appling
and nailing their abs instead of you
know buying a vehicle or if they
when they can use an existing one so
this is a TDK you basically have all the
same interfaces as you would a normal
vehicle you got the screen you got a
center stack with all the different
buttons pretty seibon scored back as
well as some car simulation toggles so
you can turn the car off open doors set
it to go forward and reverse haven't
parked or not part so what kind of
partners have you guys teamed up with to
enable apps to come to port right so I
mean everybody knows you know a lot of
the music streaming apps like pandora
our radio slacker and PR we also did
some navigation base f scout from
TeleNav we have our own sink
destinations and i'll be at that i'm a
whole slew of more coming out you know
every every few months awesome work in
our hackers find a developer network to
start coding up some awesome stuff cuz
it's pretty easy just like everything
else developer for calm there we go all
right and with all of that i want to
thank once again ford for powering our
