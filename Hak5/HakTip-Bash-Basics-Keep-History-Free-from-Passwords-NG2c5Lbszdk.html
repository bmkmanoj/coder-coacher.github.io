hostgator hello welcome to hack tip the
show where we break down the concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas i'm your host Aaron
kitchen and today we're going to do a
nice little tip about downloading files
from HT access protected web directories
without storing that password in our
bash history you don't like plaintext
passwords alright now we're going to go
ahead and begin by issuing history this
command is such a useful tool for
reusing previously issued commands and
in its default form it's going to simply
display the last commands used the same
could actually be achieved if I do cat
and then it's my tilde / my home
directory and it's the dot bash
underscore history a file and there we
go it's kind of like the same thing
you'll notice though that that the
history here it record like everything
used now we could actually use history
control commands to limit what goes in
but I actually find it easier to specify
passwords into temporary valuables when
or variables when I'm going to go ahead
and use you know plaintext passwords now
for example if I'm trying to download
let's say clear this I'm trying to
download secret dodge it pegged from
Twitter Fisher calms / hidden stuff I
could issue w get and then tak tak user
Darren and then tak tak password lame
password and then the address
and if I could type password correctly
it would totally work and voila I have
my jpeg wonderful except for the fact
that if I now go ahead and issue history
again well there's a lame password all
right now you're probably thinking to
yourself wait a second you just
downloaded from HTTP rather than HTTPS
so it doesn't really matter either way
because there's always plaintext and
transit and you're right so you know
stop pestering me with the
technicalities and enjoy the technique
of storing passwords and temporary
variables ah now to substitute our
plaintext password with our variable
we're first going to need to define it
so for that what we're going to need to
do is run read I'm going to clear this
we're going to run read tacky tak s tak
p and we're going to give it quote
password or just pass right quote and
there we go and we're going to say a
password all right now the important bit
here is actually the tack p which tells
read to give us an interactive prompt
and you'll see it saying pass ? so for
that i'll say lame password and there we
go now ingested that we're going to put
it together but first let's take a quick

and enter the code hak5 revision3 that's
a
JK 5 revision3 all one word at checkout
to get your discount now with our
variable newly created and for
illustrative purposes we're going to go
ahead and test to see whether it
actually can store the value and with
our echo command we're going to just go
ahead and say echo dollar password not
like we'd ever want to do that but there
we go we can see you know our string now
to string it together with W get what we
need to do is issue w get and then again
our user darren and then this time tak
tak password and we'll put in quotation
marks dollar sign password and end those
quotation marks and then our address
again so Twitter Fisher calm / hidden
stuff / secret dot jpg and then if i hit
enter here you'll see that it has
downloaded it and because it has
obtained the the password from that
variable and if i type history again you
can see that those most recent one it
just has the dollar sign password nice
don't have to keep my lame password in
my history anymore now it should
probably be noted though that actually
with double you get version 1.1 to and
beyond the tack tack ask password option
was added so you know that does
basically the same thing but if you're
on a system with an older version of W
get I hope this comes in handy and it's
you know obvious that this can be
adapted to more than just W yet so I'm
interested in hearing about how you deal
with this sort of issue and that lends
me to ask of course what program
commands and scripts are rocking your
world hit us up tips at hak5 org or
