by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen this is your
weekly dose of technol us and i'm very
excited to be coming to you guys of
course from the hack wagon the hack van
whatever you guys may call it and this
is the first leg of hack across America
a weird kind of right turn over to
Flagstaff Arizona for the Overland Expo
before heading up the Pacific Northwest
for the first leg so excited we've got
such cool stuff happening I can't even
predict so we'll see what happens but
one thing that has happened here on
highway 58 going through California is
I'm taking the opportunity to see all of
those things that if I were otherwise in
a rush I never would have stopped to see
and so I'm in the Mojave Desert now at a
little air force base known as Edwards
that's right let me open the back doors
here there we go chance to adjust and
what you're seeing right here this is so
exciting this is a b-52 bomber b-52
Stratofortress or whatever you want to
call it this is a very particular b-52
however this is the triple zero eight
it's nasa's b-52 and it was used for 106
x 15 missions those are the the first
you know supersonic suborbital really
spacecraft that that in the 60s proved
so many technologies that would later be
used in things like the sts for this the
space transport system that we all know
it as a the space shuttle this guy
actually tested this particular one
tested the solid rocket boosters that
were you know Jetta that jettison from
the Space Shuttle as it leaves the earth
and and parachutes back down and so
tested it right here in the Mojave
Desert and at one of these lake beds and
it's really just an awesome thing to see
in person because it has so much
character in fact if you're any bit
interested in project management or
craft or any of that geeky stuff
whatsoever this is a fantastic story of
the development of such aircraft because
it's really one of those designed by
committee during a time when technology
is changing so quickly when this was
originally commissioned in 1946 it was
to be a will to be a nuclear bomber I'm
not a fan of that however this
particular one here at Dryden as a you
know NASA testbed to drop different test
vehicles and things of that nature that
is really innovative and cool and over
the course of this this you know
aircrafts over 50 your heritage here
it's well it's it went through several
changes in the development so
interesting to see that it was
originally going to be a or the original
proposal that was proved by Boeing was
for a six propeller plane than later
turned into the jet aircraft that we
know with that awesome swept wing as
requirements change as technology
changes and it's so cool because it was
in such a golden era of air travel and
and well in spaceflight to be developed
things we're changing so rapidly that it
is a pretty rich story you should check
it out and I think that there's so many
lessons to be learned there as we in our
own industry look at technology and how
rapidly and quickly that changes anybody
that's done you know big IT projects
know that that requirements document
never stays the same so anyway this one
in particular dear to my heart because I
have a love for all things space travel
and so that's why I'm here in the Mojave
Desert checking it out and i thought i
would share that guys with you so we'll
take it away and see where it goes
