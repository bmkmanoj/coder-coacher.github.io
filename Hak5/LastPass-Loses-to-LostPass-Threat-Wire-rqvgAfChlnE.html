the FDA wants medical devices to be safe
and Americans should be more private
with their information all that coming
up now on threat wire hello world I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for january twentieth 2016 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom real quick if you
haven't checked out a patreon page over
at patreon com / threat wire we are
going to be introducing something new
this month it's going to be an extra
monthly video from darren kitchen to
share his personal guidelines for
security for our patrons as an early
access video just for you guys i want to
get an RSS feed out to you that's our
next goal so consider becoming a patron
to keep the show going in to help us
keep these lights on on to the stories
and the first being from shmoocon so sad
i missed mooc on again this year it's a
hacker convention in DC that happened
this past weekend a researcher named
Shaun Cassidy introduced a phishing
attack that he created called last lost
pass Cuse me which would use a redirect
approach or a cross-site scripting
attack which is usually written as x SS
scripting attack to deploy a javascript
file called loss past jeaious on a
vulnerable site that would tell the user
their login expired it turned out last
pass is vulnerable to a CSRF flaw which
stands for a cross-site request forgery
flaw which lets an attacker log the real
user out of the service basically this
means that an attacker could redirect a
user to a website that looks and acts
like a login page for last pass but
instead an evil twin of the real deal so
this page this evil twin would collect
the users username and password and give
that information over to the attacker
you would think that two-factor
authentication would help because
luckily LastPass does have to fa but
this would also make its way into the
hands of the attacker to and the
attacker will gain access to the account
and do pretty much whatever they want so
to mitigate this attack which has been
released on github you should ignore
notifications that pop up in the browser
and just pay attention to notifications
in the extension instead in chrome
enable IP restrictions disable mobile
logins and check any and all login
attempt
and failures now LastPass had added
email confirmation for login attempts
for new IPS including those with
two-factor authentication in response to
this attack Cassidy mentions on his
website that browsers could also help
with prevention if they don't allow
spoofing of domains for extensions so
originally LastPass considered this
attack to just be a phishing attack
which happens all the time which many
companies just don't consider to be a
vulnerability in their product Cassidy
chose to go public with his talk at
shmoocon a few months after he had
privately discussed this with LastPass
it wasn't until he went public with the
information that last pass chose to look
into the vulnerability and treat it as
such Las Vegas is in just the sight of
the biggest hacker conventions it's also
a site of many serious security
operations casinos are a large target
for hackers and a casino operator called
affinity gaming found a breach in their
networks where credit card data was
stolen over two years ago Trustwave a
notable security forensics firm was
hired to investigate report and mitigate
the breach in October of 2013 a year
after Trustwave disclosed their report
to affinity and said that they contained
the malware the casino op was again hit
with a credit card breach affinity
discussed the breach with a second
security firm called mandiant who
claimed the malware was never fully
removed and found trust waves work to be
quote woefully inadequate oh that's sad
Trustwave denies the claims and has
promised to defend themselves in court
affinity gaming is now paying for banks
to reissue credit cards and they had to
collect a PCI forensics report from
mandiant as well the amount affinity is
suing for is to be determined during the
trial but will exceed one hundred
thousand dollars along with damages fees
and costs according to court documents
the food and drug administration is
taking a head-on approach to
cybersecurity for medical device
manufacturers on Friday they released
new guidelines and recommendations for
manufacturers to detail ways to monitor
identify and address any kind of
cybersecurity issues a medical device
could be vulnerable to the FDA hopes
this guideline will help manufacturers
protect their devices throughout the
lifespan of the product not just when it
is delivered to a customer they also
urged manufacturers to participate in
the infamy
sharing analysis organization or isao
for short it's a group where public and
private sector members share information
on cybersecurity this is a very
proactive approach to devices that are
becoming more and more connected and
potentially vulnerable and honestly I
think it is needed to protect the
individuals who need to use these
devices from having more serious health
consequences or even death due to a
vulnerability in a Pew Research Center
study of 461 US adults and several
online focus groups Americans were found
to be okay with sharing some personal
information for the right price
generally Americans are cool with giving
away some of their personal information
in exchange for discounts loyalty cards
coupons and freebies but are not cool
with what happens with their data after
they give it away or what companies have
collected their information each
scenario given to respondents had mixed
results when the benefits way on the
user's favor they are more likely to
give away more personal information if
the benefits are more so for the company
collecting information more Americans
consider the collection unacceptable
it's kind of a go figure moment now the
entire research report is very long but
it's an interesting read on the current
thoughts of Americans in a data-rich age
thanks again for supporting throughout
wire on patreon at patreon.com / threat
wire seriously it's because of you guys
we are making some changes to the show
first off Darren will now be joining us
once a month for his security tutorials
and Patrick and I will continue the main
show every week Darren's video will be
an early access patreon only video we're
also sharing more behind-the-scenes
photos and early access to potential
stories for the week and taking your
recommendations just for patrons we
welcome fur babies from our patrons as
well so if you're at that perk level
send me a picture they're so freaking
adorable I want to take them all home
and create a nice little zoo at my house
even though my husband would probably
kick me out if I had that many animals
at her house he would think I was crazy
I am NOT a crazy cat lady okay just
putting that out there help us get to
our second big milestone goal for two
episodes a week and an RSS feed by
sharing our patreon page with your
friends social networks all that jazz
threat wire will always be
free and always be independent and you
can find all of our episodes links to
our social networks other ways to
contribute over at threat wire net and
with that I am shanna morris and i will
see you on the Internet I'm not a crazy
cat lady really
really I'm not a crazy cat lady really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
