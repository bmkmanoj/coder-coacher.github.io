tablet playing mods USB Drive Encryption
that's even easier than TrueCrypt 13
inch notebook fix for the
budget-conscious
and tons more I'm Jen cutter you're
watching happy
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by the national fight against drunk
driving over the limit under arrest
because who wants to spend the holidays
in jail Nokia and domain.com got a great
idea
it all starts with a great domain hello
and welcome to 5 my name is darren
kitchen i'm jenn cutter and we are
coming to you from Toronto Ontario we
are you can see hopefully you've figured
it out with the CN tower in the
background is actually the first episode
ever being shot not in the United States
well not entirely in the United States
right technically I've called in sure
and we've shot a little bit of stuff
here and there up here but never entire
this is awesome this is a trip that I
had planned for Christmas and as you
guys know from the last episode and in
the hospital pulled through yeah I
really worried about this thinking he's
just getting out of the hospital why is
he getting on a plane this can't be
right I'm glad you're here like don't
get me wrong I'm not trying to kick him
out stay in bed alone but yes it's very
nice that you're able to make it
watching on Twitter and all your videos
on YouTube which everybody else is
probably seen by now I don't know happy
episode from the hospital which is great
thank you yeah
I've learned that on my droid it's made
doing videos on YouTube so much easier
so I started hack 5 Darren's vlog on
YouTube instead to say anyway it was the
best endorsement for the Droid ever I
have the Canadian version coming in a
couple of weeks action oh definitely
hundred percent
nice replacing my iPhone with it that's
kind of weird but so cool I love that
you're going that way you know you're
here a reverse switch here
well like Timmy fair I have the the
first generation iPod like literally the
first one the one that was not available
in Canada a friend of mine upgraded to
the 3G when that came out and just sent
me his old one so I had a jailbroken and
I'm on this fake New Zealand data plan
so that Rodgers didn't know that I had
an iPhone so they think I want to know
Kia right now so now I'm actually giving
the money and I'm getting a data plan
and I get to
is that the way it should be used
excellent we have a bangin show for you
guys this week and let's just get right
into it with a couple of your questions
because we got some good ones so we have
thanks for showing how to tether droid
with Ubuntu I use them both quite often
I was wondering if tethering the droid
is against the Terms of Service for the
Verizon contract and this is from Bryce
Bryce that is a good question and it
really depends on your plan but I can
tell you from my experience and I've
been tethering phones with with laptops
since 2001
with like you know ever since a serial
cable a null modem adapter and a pocket
PC with a sanyo piece of crap and
getting 9600 baud so I could tell them
that like like I'm just because you you
wanted to write it wasn't actually
useful well I had a pocket PC but it
didn't have Wi-Fi and yeah that's it was
yes because I wanted to of course
because I'm a dork come on I don't have
to explain this this isn't a surprise to
people but uh and I'm so thankful for
the 3G we have now but for the longest
time it was just a matter of like the
carrier's didn't really have things set
up for tethering so they just kind of
turned a blind eye to it then you never
really get a right answer about even
just getting a USB cable for your phone
now a smartphone's USB cable it's just
ubiquitous it's it's actually part of
the Verizon plan I know because we've
done it for our corporate accounts at
work is that you pay an extra and I
believe it's something like thirty
dollars you have the privilege to
connect your phone which has data to
your computer and there are obviously
ways around this PDA net or PDA net is
probably the most popular piece of
software that how I've been using it
even on my Pocket PC ears back and on
and just about any platform to do this
where basically as far as the carrier is
concerned it's your phone using the data
so they don't charge you extra for the
privilege of the ring you know I don't
think you're gonna run into any problems
as long as you're not going over the
mythical five gig cap but your mileage
may vary
it's probably
it is against the term service but so
how was it mythical is it just like it's
like an unlimited plan where you know if
you go over this limit you start getting
throttles or is it they say this is your
cat don't go they say it's okay anything
else yes we have one more great question
I want to use Spotify the new music
service but I keep getting this error
unfortunately due to licensing
restrictions we are not yet available in
your country boy can I relate to that we
understand you are currently in the
United States how do i spoof my IP so it
looks like I'm in Finland and this is
from koroa this is I just love this
because typically I get this question
from people saying hey I want to watch
Hulu and Netflix and all that other
state I'm in Canada I can't do it yes
everywhere else in the world I didn't
realize there was I just checked out the
service seems really cool I didn't think
there was anything I was missing Gio
ip-based other than the BBC iplayer but
now now I'm gonna have to start spoofing
my IP as well it's a question I get a
lot and I think it's something that
needs to be cleared up because there's a
misconception about IP spoofing an IP
address you're the IP address that
you're sending from is just part of the
packet header and the data that you're
sending and there's 20 programs
including like nmap and HP and stuff
that allow you to like modify those
packets however you want put a different
source address it's just like putting a
letter in the mail and putting a
different return address on it but if I
tried to send Jen
piece of mail that had a return address
to nova scotia and you replied to it
well that's not coming back to me so you
can spoof your IP all you want but
you're not gonna get that music on that
service you'll be able to send packets
to them but they're not going to come
back to you typically what people are
talking about when they sing spoofing IP
and in that sense is really along with
the theme that we've been talking about
for the last couple weeks is tunneling
you know just rerouting your traffic
yeah you're using Internet redirection
using SSH tunneling VPN tunneling just
however you want to do it we've been
talking about these technologies get
yourself a shell account a virtual
private server something like that
something cheap I don't know
particularly about Finland but I did a
little research
some places in like Italy I know that
there's some you know shelves to be had
in UK very cheap I mean I found some
stuff good at two pounds a month you
know and so typically these are shells
that are used for like IRC bouncers and
egg-drop pots so you might want to check
with the provider make sure that they
allow tunneling as well but they did say
that they allowed up to ten gigs a month
so yeah streaming service is not gonna
be super high quality so hopefully you
shouldn't hit that depending how much it
you're listening to ten gigs a month in
music I think you might be okay and yeah
you know that's just the price you have
to pay to bounce around the world you
want to pretend that you're finished
it's either that or you get yourself a
botnet and you know own up some windows
98 machines and the Netherlands and
through those but nobody in the
Netherlands uses Windows 98 so you don't
need to worry about it
right I hope so yeah they have really
nice Internet's they do oh okay well we
have some great stuff coming up world of
Gil World of Goo I have a tablet PC and
for games like this it's just perfect
and wonderful and is this really cool
tool to let you do mod also we've got
some encryption going on no it's not
true crypt and it's so much easier for
Linux as well as more of your questions
but we do want to take a quick break and
find out weird for our sponsors and
what's going on
with this month's LAN party oh and one
more thing netbooks very excited
this month land party is left 4 dead 2
and we're gonna be playing Saturday and
Sunday January 2nd and 3rd all weekend
a Gamecock 5 org hope to see you there I
love the freedom that my motorcycle
gives me when I'm riding twisties
through the mountains or chasing sunsets
down the coast but the servers that I
support at work don't seem to have this
idea of paid time off so don't always
get a break that's why I love the Nokia
booklet 3G 12 hours of battery life
Windows 7 Bluetooth and here's the
kicker always on 3G because I don't
always know where I'm gonna be when the
exchange servers have like an MP a
seizure or the boss a new laptop gets
hosed but I get all-day connectivity for
the sexy aluminum ultra portable that's
just under three pounds it slips right
into my tank bag I don't even have to
worry about bringing the power cord
the intro price is two 99.99 with an 18
t data connect plan and two year
activation you can pick one up at best
buy exclusively either in-store online
find out more information at Nokia comm
slashed booklet 3G
then this game is absolutely phenomenal
I'm glad that you finally got into it
and I know you're gonna be absolutely
hooked as soon as you know you get all
my dude World of Goo if you guys haven't
downloaded it and well steam the only
reason I got this is one him he wouldn't
shut up about it so I really had to
break down and get it and two-seam is
having this totally sex Dale it goes on
to January 3rd and every 36 hours are
rotating what's on massive discount so
the other day I picked up torchlight for
a five bucks and that's why I I really
honestly thinks team is doing lost
leaders to you know get themselves
bigger in the marketplace there with the
game buying well people are saying that
this is a test to see how well they can
undercut retailers how their games more
brand loyalty but so yeah for those of
you who aren't against team as a service
definitely check this out and stock up
on what you want right now they have the
pop cap collection on anyway so but but
goo World of Goo I've totally got into
this and I was and it's the only reason
I updated one of my ways to the the
newest system version just so that I
could get that we where and actually
play this and it's a lot of fun on the
with the Wiimote and if you guys don't
know the game take a look at the
screenshots it's like you putting
together goo balls and and and building
bridges and using them balloons and
different types of goo to anyway it's a
great puzzle game very cute the problem
with it is it's short I mean you could
probably beat it in six hours and
afterwards you know unless you're OCD
and want to go through and get the
achievements on every single level
there's not a whole lot of replay other
than just playing trying to minimize
your moves trying to see how fast you
can get through it exactly but let me
say OCD because that's what it's called
in the game you can click on the OCD
button see what your goals are to
achieve that special rank the developers
2d boy have stated that they are not
going to make a sequel and it's like no
it's like you know when you have
community that's true so if you've been
playing World of Goo or you new to it
this is the perfect game for one playing
on tablet or a touch screen it
mentioned we're actually having a
touchscreen being built yeah this is an
opportunity for that but also to expand
it and customize it make it your own in
the community levels so anyway so show
me well let's let's take a look at the
game well the game is very interesting
very straightforward there's demos on
every platform so really you can't lose
anything by testing it out see what you
like play with the mouse play with the
Wii mode play on Linux on Mac on Linux
that is soon
I gotta give them props for developing
for Linux and using open source
technology and the programming - yes
yeah so very very supportive yeah it was
what two guys they spent about 10k their
own money when a buttload of independent
game awards yeah they were like former
or Electronic Arts I think yeah anyway
cool guys way to go 2d boy well yeah so
the level of the level the game has
taught me one very important thing I
should never be an engineer I can't
build a bridge to save my life and or
the goos lives cuz it always like it's
like oh I'm so close yeah you can write
C++ well it's you know varying so
skillset okay see I've decided I
recently picked up first-person shooters
so I figure okay that's where my brain
went you recently picked up well okay I
was addicted to counter-strike for a
while but then I had I just I left PC
gaming was too important to the goo to
the goo so goo is fun it's I'm in the
first world I played for about two hours
now well Canada was beating the crap out
of Latvia in the World Junior
Championships so Canada and yeah I'm
having a lot of fun but of course I had
to look up you know the mods via the
hacking the interesting thing so website
goo fans dot-com your one-stop shop for
everything gu related so they have this
thing called the goo tool which lets you
add in the levels lets you add in the
mods if you want to change the color of
your balls which so there's all cut like
if you wanted Pepsi balls that you could
do that or blue ones blue ones is always
kind of like a front-end letter yes and
so there's all kinds of levels there's a
great Christmas level which will show
off in a bit and also yeah it's about
everything you need but the one thing
you cannot do in the goo tool is build
the levels I wanna I wanna have five
level community group
anyway yeah okay oh and the shownotes
will link to all kinds of tutorials and
stuff to walk you through it
but so what you need after that is the
log editor the World of Goo editor and
this is where you build your levels so
you get that from goo tools as well you
get that from GU tools as well I just
said your one-stop shop go world go goo
fans okay all right oh you can google
any all right so let's take a look at
the longer so this is the blog editor
yes makes the straightforward you've got
everything you need here so what we're
gonna do is we're not gonna build the
level right now you don't have that kind
of time so we are gonna edit one of the
existing levels all you have to do is
point it to where all your files are and
you can just edit whatever you like so
uh go for the first world fit see oh
yeah we gotta go we gotta go fist II
reaches out here cuz hey it's cute and
we've got ears fitzy that's my boy and
so as you can see these are the elements
in abstract CC okay this is solid this
is solid over here this is solid and
here's where your goo balls start so you
can move things around create it you can
see all of the resources here change
what you want and then it's very quick
like you can always just make your edits
save and jump into right away to play
and test nice very nice all from within
the editor all from within the editor it
will launch the game for you so let's
say we've built a level and I'm again
having not built a level I decided to
download the Christmas level from Goo
fans calm which I thought was very very
cute it's called sweet Christmas is cute
it's got great art which really does
count sometimes yeah so how do we load
it well now we're in the world of goo
tool so now we can take a look at
everything here it's got you can see all
the levels I have downloaded and you can
see my very pathetic tower I have 37
other things from which to build with
you see the mods and levels over here
and so you can install new add in the
straight from here check for check for
updates which I haven't had to do yet
and for the options you can create for
widescreen set your resolution when
you're ready to go even save and launch
World of Goo it builds everything for
you jump straight into the game now I'm
in world one so all of these custom
levels that I've picked up I'll just see
in the top right hand top left hand
corner of world one
alright so world one like we're used to
world one we're used to
OCD the helloworld equivalent and so
here are the custom levels that I have
downloaded easy to find doesn't
interfere with anything else which is
great
that's so cool head just kind of like
injects it right into the map and of you
know you know a game built on open
standards and stuff like that is you
know you can just use tiny XML to like
blew right in there oh well that's just
a bit cute it's a great great level so
of course you have your signs you have
the the goo that you can wake up oh it's
a sign painter you can edit your own
sign painters eat your own size and all
kinds of awesome stuff yeah you just
play your own art use the existing
resources in the game put your own
custom backgrounds but your own music
think it like import you know resources
JPEGs of whatever you wanted you could
have a level where you had to build a
gigantic tower over Paul the camera guy
it would be something to see haha now
there is this is for a lot of different
platforms the game what about the editor
and what can i play these edited levels
on well let's see we've got PC for sure
Mac for sure Linux for sure and you can
actually do it on the iPhone so you can
edit levels on the iPhone no okay you
have to have it on your computer for
sure to start with and then with your
iPhone which will have to be jailbroken
which I'm sure anybody watching this
probably broken iPhone and then to need
to SSH and to your own computer and SFTP
and you can transfer the levels that way
and play that way on your iPhone no it's
a sign of you better be really devoted
probably at that point it's a good game
get to it is a good game but of course
we wear a lockdown there are no updates
that we wear there's it's just that's
what you got
but the Weber has the coop so yes which
is fun all right sweet so uh is is there
anything else that we need to know to
get started with this or do you just go
to over today I grab the the GUI editor
and how about it oh yeah good fans calm
everything you need installation is a
breeze it's one click one click to
install the boom on so if you don't want
to mess with your own creations just
download everything there it's all
organized by rating whether you want to
just change music change sound effects
there is I haven't downloaded this but
there is a Goomba that changes the boat
of The Goon something a little more
profane oh we should match how I feel
when playing that's probably something
I'll be testing out later on nice not
quite for this show but on your own time
figure it out anyway thank you so much
Jen where can people find the show notes
and and more about the stuff that you do
because you're always doing this stuff
all right well I recently moved my blog
to open alpha dot TV slash blog you can
also just go open alpha TV and find
things that way nice videos my own show
no it's and of course all of us
information also on high five great you
ready to get into some trivia I do it
okay
last week's trivia question was a philip
k dick novel Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep served as a loose plot
basis for what 1980s science fiction
film starring Harrison Ford and that was
answered correctly by hacker 31 who
writes Blade Runner and he'll be
receiving a copy of - the short owes
awesome DVD hackers are people - check
it out great great DVD anyway this
week's and congratulations actor 31 this
week's trivia aptly is World of Goo
developers shared the same open source
physics engine of what 2007 first-person
shooters of course be sure to answer at
hak5 org slash trivia for your chance to
win a copy of proto bozos album zero
equals one equals everything
can I get one hint for that yeah all
right this particular particular game is
available on Steam right all I want to
say because I don't just you know figure
it oh okay okay all right but let's
think the people that do pay us and
think one of her awesome sponsors far
too many people don't understand alcohol
drugs and driving do not mix the message
is simple drinking and driving
over the limit under arrest don't put
yourself or others in danger law
enforcement officials will be out in
force all over the country December 17th
through the new year cracking down on
drunk drivers beyond just putting your
life or someone else's at risk you can
cost yourself a ton of time and money in
jail time court fees lawyer expenses and
the best
is it's so easy to avoid I have to do is
plan a little ahead still go out and
have fun just designated a driver I know
I'm gonna be going to a Toronto hak5
meetup enjoying a lot of Canadian beers
but I'm gonna be taking the bus or the
subway home two days ago local time
somebody played try to blow up a plane
and that's gonna make things interesting
when I try to go back across the border
because I'm in Canada right now I'm a US
citizen and that always makes customs
interesting and of course you guys know
I am a Linux user now and I'm very happy
with Ubuntu also having a lot of fun
with Mint as well for what that's worth
but I thought we would talk about
encryption of things like USB drives
kind of an important thing to keep in
mind when you're crossing borders maybe
you got some stuff that you don't
necessarily want you know the feds
poking around in on and so rather than
using something like TrueCrypt which
don't get me wrong I love but there's
this built-in system that we can
actually use since the two point six
point four kernel that is so seamless my
my buddy Peter savage showed me it never
since I've been using it just because I
really like how user-friendly it is you
don't have to think anything about it
you just once you set this up it's it's
a breeze so I figured I would go ahead
and show you guys here I'm booted up
into a bun to 9.10 karmak koala now I've
already taken the liberty to go ahead
and simply apt-get install crypt setup
and once we've done that it's just a
matter of actually running crypt setup
and I'll go ahead and do that here and
you can see we've got the regular
arguments and we could really do this in
the command line but honestly I want to
show how user-friendly and easy it is so
let's just head over and do it in the
GUI right so over in system under
administration we're gonna pull up the
Disk Utility and as you can see I've got
my 500 gig drive here partitioned with
Windows 7 so I'll go ahead and plug in
my USB thumb drive my you know fun happy
switchblade great and it has gone ahead
mounted and presented itself on the
desktop including the seat
cd-rom partition that were not that
interested in if I go ahead into the one
gig file system you'll see that actually
do you have a bunch of documents on here
and what I need to do and and this is
something that you need to keep in mind
to set this up once you've gone ahead
and installed crypt setup is you will
need to format whatever drive you are
about to use so I'm gonna lose whatever
data is on here thankfully it's nothing
important so just backup if you need to
so under the the Disk Utility come down
here to your disk and then at the
partition that we are going to format
and we don't have any free space here so
we need to delete this partition and
free some up and yes delete that
partition I'm sorry it is busy that's
where I forgot to mention we do need to
unmount any active partitions first once
that's unmounted we can go ahead and
delete the partition great and now we
have a gig of free unallocated space so
let's go ahead and create a new
partition and we'll call it my secrets
because that's not going to tip the TSA
off and you know we can choose fat ext3
whatever I just typically go ahead and
use fat if it's if it's small thumb
drive because it's just that much easier
and you'll notice a check box that
wasn't there before the encrypt
underlying device that's not going to be
there unless you go ahead and actually
run crypt setup and like I said you can
do this in the command line I just find
it so much easier to just hey check the
box click create and then enter a new
pass phrase so I'm going to give it a
really lame password
and go ahead and create that sucker and
it will go ahead and begin partitioning
and you'll see it's unlocking Lu KS here
that's and it'll start creating the file
system in just a moment we should have
an encrypted drive alright now as you
can see under the SanDisk cruiser we
have our one gig encrypted and then
under that that partition the the fat of
my secrets and you can see we can
actually change the passphrase and
everything here now here's the beautiful
part I'm going to go ahead and close
this and show you what the user
experience actually looks like to you
know you once once you've set this up so
let me unmount the cd-rom partition
unplugged my drive tsa age and plugs it
into their laptop my laptop whatever
this is all that pops up and isn't that
beautiful just simply what is the
password and I'll go ahead and enter
that lame password in here and now on my
desktop there we go I've got my secret
partition I can go ahead and copy files
over to here obviously it's blank
because I did have to format it but I
didn't have to open up TrueCrypt I
didn't have to select file or mount a
volume or anything like that I just
really loved how user-friendly and
seamless this is so if you're using you
know Linux with the two point six point
four kernel or later definitely check
this out for your encryption needs it's
just you know brain-dead simple and I
want to thank Peter savage for you know
hooking me up with this tip I thought it
was very cool of him and I wanted to let
you guys know about his awesome book if
you're into sci-fi
check out emblem divided it's the book
is all on the blog emblem divided calm
and it's all for charity if you want to
support it and I think it's a it's a
great book I got sucked in after like
you know half the first chapter so
anyway good stuff there and if you have
like tips or questions you want to
submit to me or ask about this hit up or
show notes or hit me up directly Darren

Chris wrote in to the show with a
question that I'd like very much I'm not
quite ready to buy one of these but I
don't wait I own them because they're so
cute but here we go he's looking for a
laptop that is lightweight long battery
life 13.3 inch screen with win7 and a
budget of $1,000 what can you do for us
totally do you guys know that I am the
netbook boy whether it's the original
EPC the acer aspire one the the nokia
booklet 3G that I would be using right
now if Shaymin didn't take it to
Missouri
Georgia I really wanted to see that is
super unfortunate because Here I am on a
verizon phone where I just did a segment
on tethering I can tether to my laptop
but I can't use the data plan because
Rogers is going to charge me like a
thousand dollars a kilobyte Canadian
you're cheap your your flight would have
been cheaper look us up no don't look it
up it's okay I'll use my laptop it's
fine but anyway I actually just recently
had the same exact problem I needed and
needed something that I could edit on
and that was pretty much the only
requirement you know I love small
machines and I even think like twelve
inch or Biggers like it's too big but I
did find a 13.3 that I absolutely love
and did a bunch of research that I'll go
ahead hook you up with because there is
some really cool new chips coming out
that I think deserve some attention the
consumer ultra-low voltage tips coming
at it Intel right now that are kind of
across between your typical Core 2 duos
and your like Intel Adams so with a
netbook you're going to get like an
Intel Atom
that's you know run in like 1.3
gigahertz ish and 2
five watts with like you know half a
mega vel to cash and they're really weak
but you know fine for a netbook but if
you're looking for a real machine to
actually get some real work done I'm
gonna say that these chips are totally
worth taking a look at their around 10
watts instead of like 25 to 30 watts on
a regular dual-core chip the one that
I'm using right now is an su 7300 the
the the two lines you want to look at
are the su 7,000 and 9,000 series and
you can only find them for less than
$1000 in fact I just picked up the Asus
I want to say UL 30 a x5 there's a
there's a whole bunch of them but the x5
and this guy is great a little 500 gigs
so nice so it sits for me it feels like
it's still within that netbook category
but it's just bigger you know and it's
got a real processor and four gigs of
ram and I can actually say honestly if
you're watching this episode you know
the power of this machine because this
machine this episode is being edited on
this episode on this machine tonight so
we're full HD video running from the
area run Photoshop right right so I am
actually a little run premiere and well
the reason being right
I particularly wanted like a core i7 or
something cuz I was like whoa I need to
edit HD on the go I'm gonna be in Canada
there's some gonna be situations we're
gonna need to edit not just in my on my
quad core at home so I was looking at
core i7 laptops what you can do for
$1000 you're gonna sacrifice that
battery life like crazy and you're not
gonna easily find a 13-inch I think
13-inch is really the sweet spot as you
get the same resolution on a 13 that you
idiot on the 15 so come on but the
reason that you know I was hesitant and
I got this and I was totally prepared to
that back if it couldn't edit HD but it
couldn't here's why the graphics chip in
here
the it's an Intel GMA but it's actually
a good GNA it's a GMA 4500 M HD and this
chip does is hardware accelerated h.264
a
C + VC 1 so you know your blu-ray codex
you're covered I am and it works in from
here I can actually edit ABC HD footage
from these HD cameras which is insane
for I know we build desktops to do this
kind of job and this little thing is -
yeah so I'm very happy with that I'm
gonna suggest that if you're looking for
a low voltage chip
check out the what is it the Aces ul
series as well as the timeline series
and what's the difference in price with
those the around the same you're looking
about 650 to 800 for something like this
there's a new one that's it's really
sexy that I say has an Nvidia chip in it
it's kind of the same dual chip design
that your newer Mac books have I think
it's like 900 but but you should be able
to find something for under a thousand
easy if you really want to just get you
know something typical like a regular
core to the VAIO sr 51 510 looks really
good it's got a Core 2 66 70 BIOS are
pretty right and the reason and that's
like a 2.2 gigahertz that's one of the
ones I was looking at if this didn't
work out a lot more expensive but like I
was looking at it because it was a real
2.2 gigahertz there's only one point
three gigahertz but I can edit and and I
think maybe the three things of l2 cache
else in that department but the cool
thing is it supports the the intel vt-x
technology the virtualization technology
so your virtual boxes are gonna run so
much faster and that's that's what's
important alright bottom line what is
the battery life on this they claimed 12
hours I'm getting Ronnie I'm not you're
pushing it pretty far yeah it's not like
I mean the nokia booklet 3G the
advertised battery life is pretty damn
close like I you know absolutely love
its battery life for what it is but it
cannot edit HD video and I don't think
anybody's going to try to make that
claim alright well no of course I'm me I
have got this question if you wanted to
game on this no nothing not even World
of Warcraft on like minimum you might be
able I mean I've seen people
people play half-life 2 on an EPC so if
you're one of those people that likes
tweaking you might yeah sure I mean the
the GMA is better than that most of your
Intel graphics chips but it's no you
know it's no GeForce or something it's
not an Nvidia ion but anyway so those
are CU lbs and i think they're worth
checking out if you're looking for a
laptop under three grand under suites
ya know it's a good battery life in a
13-inch and I think 13s the sweet spot I
think you're gonna see a ton more those
at CES here real soon all right you've
got some people to think don't you I do
oh my gosh I need to say thank you to
our cast and our crew for keeping the
everything going while I was in the
