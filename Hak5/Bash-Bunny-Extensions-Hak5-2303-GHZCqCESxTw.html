this time on half five
hello welcome to hug bye my name is
Darren kitchen I love that he walks in
every single time my name is Shannon
Moore it's your weekly dose of Technol s
I'm just gonna look at you instead of
the camera oh that's weird I know right
look at the viewers what if we break the
fourth wall and look at them we always
do that and see oh my gosh look at the
timeline on this video all right I guess
it would be here not like house of cards
over there it would be it would be uh so
confusing I love the old videos on
YouTube that are like comment over here
and click subscribe over there and
you're all like dude none of those
things are anywhere that you're pointing
anywhere well and then annotations
appear you can click up there stop the
card yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no
yeah all right so pick this up we should
probably kick it off in the past few
bash bunnies segments that we have been
covering we basically just been getting
into the basics but we really only have
been scratching the surface so in this
episode we decided that we recover some
of the Nitty Gritty commands and
extensions but first let's do a quick
review we know the basic commands are
attack mode quack and led so attack mode
tells the bunny went USB devices to
emulate like Linux or Windows Ethernet
or serial or read write and read only
storage or hid and combinations thereof
or many more in the future potentially
right exactly and then quack or Q
interprets ducky scripts so this is when
you inject keystrokes when using a hid
or human interface device attack mode
and then of course there's led which
controls obviously the LEDs so you can
specify a color and pattern like LED be
100 or LED are 100 to make it blink red
or blue every 100 milliseconds or you
can do LED em low to make it blink
magenta slowly which is my favorite
because it's like pink because it's like
its color oh I wonder if we can recreate
that actually I like the LED states I
actually have this one blinking red
isn't that example in a how well that Oh
coming up you can see it here why don't
you hold that right there because what
I'm gonna do is show you guys can you do
LEDs set up then it's magenta you could
also do LED fail
and it blinks red oh yeah and LED attack
yeah and it'll blink yellow and LED
clean up and it'll go white and LEDs or
can finish I love this one LED finish
does this really cool like Berber oh
right and then it's green so you know
tag machine and I just wanted to show
you guys those you can just type an LED
to get all of those commands and see
what all the different states are but
essentially I wanted to show you that
there you go
now you can see it all and we recommend
those basically so that all the
developers use of standard States it
makes it really easy and consistent so
that is a user you can look at any
payload and know kind of what it's doing
so anyway for the most part those are
the basic commands but they are actually
a whole bunch of other ones using
extensions so when you update your bash
money either manually or by downloading
from git or simply using the bunny
updater program you will notice an
extensions directory in the payloads
folder now these extensions are
basically new commands that can be used
in any payload and just like the open
source payloads on git again anybody can
contribute so Darin let's go over some
extension oh yeah
so we've used this one in the past and
it's called run and I can just basically
show you but essentially what run does
is allow you to quickly and easily get
into the run dialog which basically
simplifies injecting keystrokes into a
computer's run dialog which is very
common process for any oh yeah attack
mode that uses hid and what it does is
it accepts an argument for the operating
system like Wayne or OS 10 so as an
example here I'll just pull up my blank
payload I could do for instance attack
well actually I do led set up and then
attack mode hit didn't say good uh-huh
so fancy and then I could if I wanted to
like against a Windows target do GUI R
and then I would have to delay 500
milliseconds to wait for that run line
to pop-up right yeah cuz it's got that
cute little arrow fade in action and I
could do string something to phrase like
notepad so nefarious and then enter
right right
or I could reduce the entire thing to
run win notepad
so similarly you could do the same thing
on Sten by doing GUI by specifying run
Mac or sorry not run back run OS X or
four OS 10 and that will bring up
spotlight on a Mac yeah okay yeah and
you know I gotta say when I actually
wrote this I'm doing a little update to
it now I can see if I pull up the the
run Sh payload I've just kind of like
hacked this on at the end of ridge '''l
II I added the option here for unity
which would do an f2 thing but then of
course unity being the Ubuntu file
manager sorry file manager window
manager or formerly at least but I turns
out it doesn't work against just unity
and gnome it it seems to work against a
lot of them yeah so I'm glad you brought
that up
we actually got a really good comment on
episode 23 oh one from Robert Bledsoe so
he said I checked and verified that alt
f2 is a feature that runs on all major
desktop environments and every minor one
I looked into here's the compatible ones
I found so far gnome KDE unity cinnamon
ude Lumina EE de budgie razor QT xfce
LXDE mate Alex QT enlightenment and
Pantheon now in searching these I have
noticed that many of the minor ones have
had bugs with alt f2 not working but in
essence it would appear that alt f2 is a
universal linux GUI shortcut that's
awesome that's awesome
so shadow xfce yes but hey really cool
stuff yeah very cool yeah especially
when you pair it with that X term tacky
that I showed out the other week where
you visibly run in the background go X
terms their next extension because we
got to run through these so we're done
with run let's talk about the ducky Lang
all right I'm gonna paint a scenario
here for you snubs okay Majan you are on
an engagement that takes you all the way
to Germany and you've just landed in
Berlin because it's way cooler than
Frankfurt and you've got this great
payload ready to go on switch position
wanna you're just gonna pop down by the
client site and pull him up a bit
and then grab yourself a doner kebab and
then grab a club mate' and just be off
right I mean your day couldn't get any
better at that point
well I feel like if I was in Germany I
would have to get abroad mmm some
nuremberg errs good stuff maybe if you
get a chance actually you want to go to
munition or InSAR munich because that's
where you get to the halfway house like
the legit one not like that one invade
yes I know I'm not saying it right in
German that's okay see here the is the
problem with the computers in Germany
they're all expecting Germans
specifically German keyboards where
everything is backwards like shift to
instead of making knots on makes
quotation marks and yeah there's like
umlauts everywhere and everything is
dressed up in like a dirndl or later
hosen and for real yeah I'm probably
exaggerating about the last day
regardless if your payload quacks
meaning if it's injecting keystrokes
with that hit attack mode then you need
to specify the language by default it's
us but thankfully it couldn't be easier
than just running literally boop boop in
my test payload here we're gonna take
this nefarious Windows payload and I
would do this in the setup portion I
would do ducky sorry I would yeah ducky
underscore lang space de there you go
and if I was going to France I would do
fr and right you get the idea that's
really cool it actually works really
well alongside this next intention so
similarly there is an awesome extension
from Alcantara highly Kintaro need to AH
that instead of making the bunny type in
the language the computer is expecting
it changes the computer to the language
of the bunny
it's brilliant yeah so you could do set
KB start and it would inject a little
PowerShell that sets the computer to a
u.s. keyboard layout and then at the end
of your payload you could just use set K
be done and it goes back to whatever it
was set to before so it's pretty good
way to troll your friends I love that I
would love to do that too like a
Japanese keyboard just stick this not K
being on there and people would be like
why am i why am i typing out in English
letters I don't understand actually it
there's a nun or not undocumented if you
if you look at the the thankfully these
are all bash scripts and like all
scripts should be it is commented so you
can actually see that if you just set if
you do a set KB with a
with a keyboard layout you can just
override whatever it is so you could
make a load that all it does is you plug
it yeah you don't is such it to a
Japanese can we blow yeah so funny or
Dvorak I don't know if it actually
supports that that would be cool yeah
thank you Alcantara hey you know what
there's also sometimes I like to write
really advanced payloads and and there's
a ton of them out there because the cool
thing about the - money right it's a
full Linux box so you can run all of
these different tools thing you know
you've got like impact and responder I
mean you could put it on a full
Metasploit install we do recommend
everybody install those two slash tools
which is what our tool installer does
essentially so that they're all you know
easily X what is it referenced with an
absolutely yeah path point is if your
tools are in slash tools you can
actually write when writing a payload
you don't know if somebody has this tool
installed you can check for that
prerequisite so you just need to specify
that in a payload using the required
tool extension and if it's not there
it'll gracefully fail instead of like
blurtin bunch of stuff all over okay so
get that work well if I were writing a
payload that required in package I would
just come in here and I would just say
in my setup phase and actually right
after attack mode just best practices I
should do LED attack so everybody knows
that oh yeah this is where the attack is
starting oh yeah and then after that
after that notepad will do a LED finish
so you know like oh yeah we've totally
pwned them but yeah right up in here I
would do a require tool in packet ok or
whatever right it stays in the setup
phase as well yes ok and so what's gonna
happen is it's gonna check to see if
there is a responder directory in slash
tools and if there is it's just gonna
continue and if there's not instead of
continuing on with my nefarious attack
here it's actually going to stop the
payload and blink red oh that's neat
yeah how useful alright let's talk about
get right yeah ok so we've used this in
the past but let's get into yeah what is
that you're doing it's another awesome
extension and it allows you to specify
an argument and it'll give you back
it'll export a similarly named variable
that you can then use
your payload so as an example here I
could do get space target underscore IP
I'll actually pull up that particular
payload let's see where are my
extensions it was in the other folder
there we go so we've got the get
extension and you can see what this is
it's just when I do a get target IP
right it's actually going to give me the
output of this oops not Zee cat I'm just
cattle just cat and I'll just plug this
into it cuz I'm SS aged into my bash
money here so I'll do that and it's Kat
and it's minding me at Kirby right now
so um it's checking the DHCP lease it's
grepping for Lisa talking for that thing
it's sorting it's gonna unique to anyway
gives you the IP address that the victim
got from the bash bunny from its DHCP
server right so if you're using an
Ethernet attack you can then store that
in a dollar sign target underscore IP so
if you wanted to like here I'll give you
a quick example using like I don't know
let's make a simple payload here instead
of doing attack mode we're gonna take
out that we're gonna replace it with R&amp;amp;D
is Ethernet now this is a Windows
centric Network payload and in our
attack function we're gonna run and map
right and we're gonna do end map and
well we need to know its IP address
first
so we'll do n map right tak s capital V
and then we need to know its IP address
so we could just assume it's gonna be 64
one 7.16 64 10 but that's bad practice
to hard-code that right so what we'll do
is do get target underscore IP and then
here we just replace this bit with
dollar sign target underscore IP there
you go right okay well what about if you
want to get the hosts IP instead you
mean the IP address of the bunny it's
sunny
yeah so again talking about hard coded
that there is like a hard-coded IP
address of the bash money I mean if I do
if config here you'll see that it is 172
16 64 1 but again hard coding you're
right is a bad practice so we didn't use
you might want to change this is the
attacker yeah you can make it a ten dot
yeah or 192 dot something or whatever
you want right so if you are if you're
worried that the potential user of your
payload may do that and you require the
IP address of the bash money itself
similarly just you get underscores host
IP ah cool
yeah that's useful yeah and it's just
you know it's best practices so if
somebody changes their IP scheme for
whatever reason there you go so it's
really fun to mess with IPs and find
them with the the different get
variables but what if you have multiple
different targets and you need to be
able to easily navigate which one is
which is there a way to like like if
you're saving the log files or something
yeah exactly yeah so there is actually a
get target underscore hostname I knew it
yeah I know well I think you read ahead
basically that is an extension that's a
part of the extension that will export a
variable with the name of the computer
so for instance exactly so on this
computer right here if I do Who am I
oops Who am I it says that my computer's
name is desktop - s adda RQ right and
yours is probably called snubs PC or
something like that right what do you
know
yeah no I'm not yet but stick around you
you're typically going to get those from
Windows boxes every now and then it will
not give you something either DHCP
funtimes or the computer just doesn't
pass it along to the DHCP server but for
the most part most of the time you're
gonna get this and it's great for naming
log files like you said so if we
actually go back here to our end map
right let's make this payload even
better at the end here so this is just
gonna spit out into the console on the
bash bunny the nmap scan of the victim
computer right it's gonna do a little
port scan if you just do a little Wacka
Wacka to output that to a file we could
name that file say target underscore
host name dot txt that's gonna fail for
one reason why cuz we can get it get
space target underscore host name there
you go
yes right you need to make sure it's
actually calling that host name
beforehand
good point I feel like I should do that
to my husband you should toll you should
definitely throw your husband I mean if
you love your husband
you should troll your husband I'll just
stick a batch money in this computer and
then I'll email him the text file and be
like look what I found this was on the
Internet
he'd be like what I need to set it to FA
yes finally oh hey right there it's
amazing what what what tactic security
right okay finally uh let's let's move
because we're we're gonna long in this
episode I want to talk about the last to
switch position which position yes so
this one exports either switch one
switch two or switch three depending on
the position of the switch so this is
really useful in determining which
folder your payload has run from yeah
okay so this is a little weird because
you kind of like expect like what are
you talking about obviously it's running
from you know I've got this payload here
you would assume it's in the right
switch mode right like this folder that
is this folder right here is d :
backslash for my bash bunnyears is gonna
be different the payloads Direction
slice which one right so when my payload
runs like haha that awesome stuff is
gonna happen but what if I also want to
do like call another script like what if
I have a script in your core cool stuff
SH right well in Linux I would just do
that and then over here I would just put
you know a new text file called a cool
stuff dot Sh right and now it's gonna
run that except it won't because in all
actuality the payload Exe doesn't run
from the mass storage I'm looking at it
right now from from the like a setup
mode where the bash money is showing up
as a thumb drive but that mass storage
switch it yeah it hasn't actually run
the payload exe from there it runs it
from a different working directory so it
when you do dot slash cool stuff that Sh
it's gonna be like sorry there's no
there's it's not here it's not here so
you actually have to specify it now you
can actually specify even if it's on the
mass storage partition because that's
available to the payload when it runs we
have to use the absolute path okay so
this is why we're getting into these
needy greedy because these are the
things that might you know get scurry up
mm-hmm so in this case what we would
actually do you know if we're is it
actually it's in my payload slice which
one I would do
slash route slash you disk because
that's the directory of the USB Drive
slash payloads slash switch one there
you go so that's cool stuff right there
you go okay so that's great but what if
it got moved like what if it's not in
switch one oh so like what if I write if
you don't know mmm yeah so I write this
payload and I hard code it to switch one
then you go and using you put on switch
to yeah exactly yeah there's like a
reoccurring theme here and I think it
has to do with what's like hard coding
things yes so what you actually do is
you can get the switch position and then
you can you just use it as dollar sign
switch position so that would end up
looking like get switch underscore
position and then right here you would
just replace which one with dollar signs
which position underscore position oh
that's so awesome
I love notepad plus plus how great is
that ok we should probably find find out
about my favorite one because it is
lunchtime and I'm hungry let's talk
about cucumber let's talk about some
vegetables right this is actually one of
my favorite extensions here and it's the
cucumber and it controls the CPU it
actually controls the CPU governor which
is quite handy for thermal reasons yeah
so like the bosch bunny I mean in all
actuality is some pretty hardcore box
it's an arm quad-core CPU up to 1.3
gigahertz so it's really fast yeah and
we want it to be discrete we want it to
look like a thumb drive so you know
we're plastic case right well that's a
plastic case is actually high temp
plastics and there's a gel in here it's
a special compound for the thermal stuff
and it keeps everything running smoothly
but you know for the most part payloads
only run for a few minutes so it's like
not that big of deal it's not gonna get
like super hot and actually you can run
this for hours and hours on end as I do
writing payloads and stuff because the
default is to use an on demand
performance yeah it's warm it's not
crazy hotter no no and it shouldn't be
however this is a really good to note
for instance if you wanted to leave
payload plugged in indefinitely say like
as an example what if you plug it in
behind a computer like an old school
tower with like a big fan and there's
like exhaust you know beating down on
this thing
hey you don't want the thing to melt
right that's gonna be bad so you can
actually limit the performance and get
some better thermal properties out of it
get it to run cooler cool as a cucumber
by running cucumber space enable and it
you can literally just in the I would
put this in the before the attack I
don't do the in the setup phase ado
cucumber space enable oh yeah and
actually just realize all of these
should probably be in my setup phase cuz
you know yeah
payload best practices here oh yeah
anyway you get the idea okay that would
make it slower though right it does I
mean for for single core operations
right of course it's for single core
operation it's not gonna change anything
if you've got a multi-threaded app then
yeah but I would assume that most of the
things that you are doing on the batch
money aren't going to be multi-threaded
applications like you're not gonna be
what editing videos it depends you know
yeah exactly they're not gonna be
editing videos I would hope I mean I
don't know maybe you can but now I'm
thinking about all the ways that you
could actually offload video editing to
it but this is probably not what you
typically wanted to do with it a lot of
most of the stuff you're doing a
single-threaded
actually like an exploit uses a bunch of
Python Perl and Ruby scripts and all of
those runs like yeah however if you do
have a multi-threaded application not
video editing you could get all the
horsepower out of it using cucumber
you can skip ludicrous speed and go all
the way to cucumber Platt oh you did not
just good I did see just cucumber enable
nope what's cucumber plaid that's
hilarious
boom puts it into high performance mode
okay so let's say we should probably
talk about config dot txt yeah yeah okay
so all of these things that have been
talking about right now I mean this is a
living breathing bash bunny beast right
and a lot of things things are going to
continuously change right so we're just
showing you the extensions that are
available now you can contribute your
own you should yep github just like you
would any other payload and it's cool
because if you make an extension then
other people can use that extension to
make their payloads better but I do want
to talk about that config dot txt okay
so remember how I said like oh you know
you're gonna you're gonna go on that
mission over to Germany yeah Ryan you
know
totally owned up that client yeah totes
mcgoats and then you get another you get
another client and they're in France and
now you've got to go through and change
all your payloads over to French oh I
see where you're going with that right
so get this at the very root of your
bash money on you not payloads just in
the root directory here you get this
config dot txt and this is where you can
globally change those configurations
right it's just like setting an alias
and Batchelor see it's kind of like a
bash RC for your batch money yeah that's
so cute yeah and you can do any of the
extensions that we talked about in here
so for instance that ducky underscore
Lang you could set it to fr for French
and now all of your payloads are gonna
be French likewise you could do cucumber
enable or disable or plaid and whatever
you want whatever you want because this
is basically it's a batch file that gets
run before all of the other payloads run
ah that's so cool
yeah just keep in mind like any other
command though it can be overwritten you
know you can run you can run ducky
laying multiple times so if you first
set it to us and then somebody else's
has theirs hard-coded to de and so if
you are encoded in the payload it will
overwrite what you have in config dot
txt yeah remember what I said there's a
lot of best practices in this episode
best practice don't hard-code stuff yeah
it's very important a little tip from me
to you that's so useful and if you guys
are wondering about bash RC files and
how you can edit those check out my hack
tips I've gone over those in much detail
mmm good stuff I think that's it for now
I know this was super long but we both
wanted to make sure that we covered all
the awesome extensions that add
functionality to the bash bunny because
there's so much that you can do with it
it's and you know it's like a great
learning tool for like getting into
Linux I know that for instance the Wi-Fi
pineapple for me was actually a gateway
drug into like a lot more Linux yeah
then I was used to and it was a
fantastic experience Amir yeah and and I
don't know I just want to lay that
groundwork cuz this is an episode of we
can always reference and be like boom
get your bash bunny on learn all of the
ins and outs of extensions with this one
episode and carry on I'm looking forward
to what you guys think would make cool
extension so let us know in the comments
and make sure to contribute to the
github - and we might feature yours on
the show right in fact I have a couple
of payloads that we're going to be
featuring here real soon and
everybody up with $100 gift certificates
for their contributions in fact we
should do that 4l Kintaro whoo I agree
did a who did a extension yes so boom
just on the fly figured that one out
that makes sense
Thank You Alcantara Thank You L Quintero
here's a gift certificate and for
everybody else there you can always
contribute over at a chase shop calm
that's where you can find all of our
hak5 gear to pick up including Wi-Fi
pineapples Bosch bunnies USB rubber
duckies oh and if you're interested in
the shows you can also check out a check
a5 org that's where we put all of our
different YouTube shows and make sure to
subscribe it really does actually help
us a lot when you ever use subscribe to
those videos and that way you can keep
up to date with everything that is going
on over here at the hack 5 studios
yes oh and you know if you're a hack 5
org look for some event information if
you're available on October 13th and
named you're in the Bay Area you may
want to RSVP just saying cool stuff
common that sounds exciting
yeah tentatively tentatively hope
something changes ok we'll put up the
event page right after we record you
know thing that could change this is
like things get held in customs but
anyway we should do a backstage podcast
of all the ridiculous fun that we have
here well we're we're here throughout
October so it'll be sometime enough it's
gonna be a good time so excited about
that yeah yeah ok cool well with all of
that setup so we'll go ahead and wrap it
up but take your montage oh hey before
we get going I just Shannon I actually
need to apologize to you and I guess the
whole audience last week or was it the
week before I made that stupid xkcd joke
about sudo make me a sandwich and I kind
of feel bad about this because I didn't
realize I was actually perpetuating a
stereotype I'm sorry she's for that the
sudo make me a sandwich thing I didn't
realize it was actually a sexist and I
kind of consider myself an ally yeah I
really appreciate you saying guys we got
to make I mean I thought it was funny
but that's because I've known you for so
long so I know you were making a joke
but if you were a stranger I'd just be
like okay yeah well I always thought
that it was like from the perspective of
the computer making the sandwich but
it's like no dude that's a sexist joke
and we should stop saying
those because we want this community to
flourish sometimes I say it to my
husband
well that's because your husband's a
little hey with that my name is darren
kitchen trusted Technol us you can
follow snubz hover on twitter you've got
a great idea you should do what shannon
and i do and head over to domain.com and
register your domain bring it over to
the internet using this super awesome
discovery system that brings domains
from your mind onto the web over at
domain.com they've got a quick and easy
checkout process and they've been
