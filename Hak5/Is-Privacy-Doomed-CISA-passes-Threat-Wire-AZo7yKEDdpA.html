heats up and strong crypto apps just
dropped in the nick of time are we
doomed or empowered through technology
all that coming up today on threat wire
grates internet i'm darren kitchen and
this is threat wire for november 4 2015
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and internet freedom
and shout outs to our supporters over at
patreon for keeping us independent and
ab free today we're going to continue
the wonderful story of the internet and
if you haven't been following along it
is an age-old classic it's a government
creates national international network
companies turn internet into mega media
commerce platform government illegally
spies on citizens using the internet
whistleblowers expose government with
their pants down citizens get mad
companies get sad and government seeks
to make spying legal so we're going to
pick it up in 2012 when they stop cyber
spying week and the subsequent internet
blackout day of 2012 data ton then to
thwart sis pas and evil Cyber
Intelligence and sharing bill that was
2012 though since then we have seen the
likes of target breaches and Sony hacks
and Office of Personnel Management
Fiasco's that could go on and on and on
headline after headline pressuring those
to do something and in political terms
that means pass an overbearing law
that'll likely violate your privacy and
do dick all for protecting cyber
infrastructure but hey seesaw it just
passed in the Senate now it's heading to
the house and if it indeed passes expect
your private data to go from internet
companies funneled straight through the
DHS and on to the FBI and the NSA and as
65 security experts put it in an open
letter to the Senate quote sharing users
private information creates new security
risks this excess sharing would not aid
cyber security and would significantly
harm privacy and could actually
undermine you our ability to effectively
respond to threats that's right instead
of your data just belonging to the
twitters of Facebook
so the world it would actually be in the
hands of the governing power that can't
even seem to keep personnel records of
21 million citizens away from hackers
and the limited liability that are
actually offered to the corporations
that do cooperate in this proposed law
may actually deter them from improving
their security we're more likely people
like you and I would be much more
hesitant to use an online service if
they knew that their data was being
funneled straight to the government
which is a big concern for the likes of
Apple and Google who rely on consumer
trust so when unfettered data sharing
between corporations and government
becomes the status quo who are you going
to trust with your private info speaking
of proposed legislation from 2012 to
come back from the dead rear its ugly
head yes our UK neighbors this week
moved forward a similar bill to the 2012
draft communications data bill which you
may have heard of as the snoopers
charter and this revised bill the
investigatory powers bill or I pay bill
will force Internet service providers to
keep records of the websites of their
subscribers access for up to 12 months
that would allow law enforcement
agencies and intelligence agencies to be
able to request your data you know for
the children or something this would
actually complement the counterterrorism
and security act of 2015 which requires
ISPs to retain data linking specific
devices to IP addresses but not web logs
you know because the UK government can't
figure out how to reverse resolve an IP
address to a domain name or something
insert WTF face here this by the way the
way it's currently written is not the
complete URL snarf kind of thing you
would expect it's actually rather
truncated so instead of think Web MD
boots com not WebMD boots our coms / is
it supposed to be purple and enlarged
that just I don't know what to do with
this I think it's time to start
considering an offshore VPN what do you
think and finally we cast off the fears
from our data snooping overlords and
take back our privacy with strong crypto
that's right this week we have seen some
much-needed advances for Team screw you
g-man in the way of secure messaging
apps which neither proposed US or UK
bill could actually do a damned
about as we're I'm talking about the
open source textsecure and red phone
apps from Moxie Marlinspike open whisper
systems that have merged into slick new
user friendly app called signal it's
been out for a while on iphone and now
it is hitting Google Play Store for
Android and that is a big deal because
this may be the first pki loving secure
text and voice app that even your mom
can use so if you're going home for the
holidays you should really switch them
all over to the encrypted text messaging
service used by Edward Snowden and
hackers abound and while you're at it
while we're on this topic do check out
the beta of tour messenger it is a
simple open source instant messenger app
which incorporates the off-the-record
encryption protocol and it puts it over
the Tor network it's by the folks over
at the Tor project that actually brought
us the tor browser and it is just one of
those things that just kind of works
which I love the toward PR person summed
it up nicely for Wired when they said
quote with tor messenger your chat is
encrypted and anonymous so it's hidden
from snoops whether they're a government
or a foreign country or a company trying
to tell you boots speaking of boots look
at the pause on Charlie our internet pup
from patreon that's right the show is
supported from the parents of cats and
dogs everywhere through our crowdfunding
