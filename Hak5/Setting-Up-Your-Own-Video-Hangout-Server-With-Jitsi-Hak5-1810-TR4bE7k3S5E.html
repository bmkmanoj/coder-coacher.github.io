by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5
konichiwa ohgenkee deskah
wait what sorry is that the wrong thing
they don't remember that means hello how
are you how do we start the show I'm
actually full of energy right now hey
and welcome to this episode of high five
my name is Shannon Morse oh that's how
we do it my name is Darren kitchen it's
your weekly dose of technolon other
caffeinated adventure in techno town
that's right it is and I really like
what you have done with your computer
over here thank you
not the same finally I thought no it's
it well actually yet this is my windows
box and I'm using it because Zen Center
only works for Windows we'll get to that
there's some fun html5 alternatives that
would be cross-platform but for today's
segment we're going to actually skip the
virtualization part and come back to
that a little later as you guys know
that we're building out the network here
at the hack 5 warehouse and one of the
first fun things that I want to
implement is a little bit of web RTC JIT
Sifu that's going to allow us all to
videoconference similar to hangouts but
more on that in a bit
there's first and foremost Shannon are
you a My Little Pony I'm my hope what's
going on here like when did that happen
this weekend it was awesome I was just
like what happens when you go to the
cherry but you ate too many grapes at
the cherry blossom master yeah you know
I decided I wanted to fit in whenever I
cosplay and whenever I go to Japan it
sounds like that so I just decided to
dye my hair purple are you going to
Comic Con this year no but I am going to
drag icon uh-huh house play a Dragon Con
I couldn't my costume was purple I feel
like I feel like the set is finally
coming together little by little this is
so cool
so I have all these I have a sticker
wall so if anybody has stickers from
like your hackerspace or whatever send
them our way
yep we can put them up here there yet I
think this one's my favorite anyway 5 4
8 Market Street number 3 9 3 7 1 san
francisco california 9 4 104 and yeah
send us your stickers hey can I show you
something really cool that I was reading
about and I thought it was kind kind of
but not about InfoSec but not really so
this is my new bike I got it in the mail
this weekend yeah
I was riding it around and I asked on
Twitter for recommendations about
different bike locks and helmets that
you can get so thank you for your
recommendation although I need to figure
out my size
but a lot of people linked me to this
really interesting blog over at the
sweet home and it's all about bike locks
and these people actually interviewed
different thieves who work and they
actually like run around stealing bikes
all day about what kind of bike locks
kind of keep them away and what kind of
bike locks actually keep them you know
going for the bikes so they have
pictures of this guy like it's a
faceless dude but he's you know he's
testing out all these different looks so
I was like oh it's like penetration
testing for my rocks I love that no I
mean that's the thing is you need to
find out how secure it is but yeah I
really interesting he's seriously he
took a pipe to this lock in this picture
and he twisted it around until it broke
a freaking pipe that's cool I've also
seen some really rad ones where you
basically take a like a coke can and you
can create a shim to get a lot of
Kryptonite locks whoa you can search
YouTube for those they're all over crazy
yeah so if anybody has a recommendation
for a good bike lock let me know mmm cuz
I'm gonna start writing my bike to work
hey you know where you could ride your
bike where right here
this place is epic I found it I found
the Lost Coast that right there is
Shelter Cove it is in this a beautiful
place where California has this epic
very famous highway called the Pacific
Coast Highway the PCH or it's highway
one here in California and it goes all
the way up from essentially Los Angeles
to Eureka and all you mean you can take
it to Portland right so it's a really
epic highway it's beautiful it cuts
inland north of Fort Bragg slash glass
beach and then it we joined the coast at
Eureka
it does that for a reason that is
because there are some really
treacherous mountains that are just epic
and so because of this the population in
that county of you know it's Humboldt
County and southern Humboldt counties
like the population density is like mail
it is just untouched beautiful
California coastline wilderness good
stuff oh cool there's a tiny community
of like 800 people living in this like
they're all like
yawns and surfers and retirees and
they've got a freakin sweet airstrip
which is where I accidentally almost got
hit by an airplane I mean it's good
stuff
did it really yeah you standing in front
of like the tarmac yeah there's a
baseball field right in front and the
18th hole there's an 18 hole golf course
and anyway I just discovered the most
epic beauty and we'll be talking about
that a little bit later because I yes
wilderness yes
so what else is going on I mean uh
tracking pineapples tracking pineapples
oh that's legal actual fruit pineapple
wiggle net if you haven't been to it
check this out they just got a facelift
and wiggle is really beautiful okay it's
basically if you're into war driving you
know when you scan for wireless networks
they have a collection of what is a one
hundred eighty eight million wireless
networks now this is crazy this is the
kind of stuff that skyhook or other
commercial services Google has their own
basically combine the Geo locations of
people's Wi-Fi access points to aid with
navigation so you know when you turn on
your phone and you're doing like the
navigation stuff and it wants you to
turn on Wi-Fi because it can get your
position better what it's doing is using
as many sensor inputs as it can
primarily the GPS overhead but also by
using the uniqueness of networks around
you
since everybody with an Android phone is
most likely anonymously sending those
statistics back to Google saying hey
here's all the exit points I'm seeing in
the Google Street View car and then
there's commercial services like skyhook
a mention that do this wiggle is like
the open source alternative and
basically if you are a ward driver this
is where you can dump your log files and
say hey check it out I was rocking some
kismet it got my GPS going and I found
all these access points and now it's
plotted beautifully on this Google map
and I mean it always has been but
they've really done a great job of
cataloging this stuff and one of the
things that I was having fun with was I
realized hey we could do a search based
on lui and since the Wi-Fi pineapple
mark 5 uses a no UI of leet 0 0 13
37 it's a it's not real it's
administered by us I'll say and then I
begin the SSID with pineapple okay so
it's going to save search failed I
actually sometimes it crashes or doesn't
work but I do have the results from a
saved session and we can see these are
actually all the pineapple fives and I'm
like oh wow maybe we should just like
this is a good reason guys why Mack
changer is actually built in because you
can just have it randomized a password
on boot or not password randomized a MAC
address on boot or a bssid so that your
uniqueness is not presented to the world
so what I found really fun about this
though is you get this nice little table
and with a little bit of set in Ock grep
foo you can plot it on a map
this is hamster map calm it is a very
simple place where you can basically
take latitude longitude because mind you
that's part of this we've got say this
guy's pineapple e versus MAC address
here's his network name here's the
latitude and longitude where it was last
seen by war drivers right so take that
information plot it onto the hamster map
and now we get an awesome epic view of
all of the pineapples and we'll not all
of the pineapples in the world some of
the wipe advanced March bugs that have
been seen randomly as people drive by or
Ward Drive which is rather interesting
and such a person well it's creepy but
it's fun cuz look at this I don't know
people know where my pineapple is yeah
but do you leave your pineapple on all
the time no except Sarah Sarah uses a
pineapple letter house as her wireless
access point but we set it up to do mac
changer so it's got uniquely
identifiable but yeah this is Las Vegas
oh my gosh wait that's West Flamingo
Road
this the Rio that's a real that's the
Rio
so it's DEFCON those DEFCON OH not all
of them but of course you know we're
drivers DEFCON hackers Wi-Fi pineapple
purchasers though said I just thought
that was just like so cool just stop
that on there
I just thought it so that means that
this year we're gonna see a whole bunch
at the Bellagio uh I think they know
they moved it to Paris Paris
yes yes but not France look Paris hotel
it's not it oh that is funny yes wow
that's just thought that was fun you
should play with wiggle there's really
cool stuff that you can do it that we'll
get into more later I want to get into
doing hangout like stuff with open
source alternatives okay so we'll do
that but first you know we should check
in with Patrick and see what's coming up
on your show tech things
hey everybody patty join you from tech
things she had another show where she's
going to get hands on using the Amazon
echo to do home automation and control
gadgets all around the house I'm going
to talk about memory versus processor
for upgrading your system and you know
what there's a whole bunch more but
you're only going to find it if you go
to technique calm or youtube.com slash
tech thing so I really like to do Google
Hangouts like all the time but Google
Hangouts also has some issues with it
for example like I want to do multiple
people unlimited like more than ten
people in a video video conference with
me I want to have a chat client that
integrates with IRC so I don't have to
have this completely separate thing but
I want it to be integrated all into the
same platform so it's not a completely
separate program and I also don't want
to have to sign up for an account with
like Gmail or something like that in
order to be able to use a hangout
feature so what do I do
well turns out Google Hangouts is really
is based on this awesome technology
called WebRTC oh yeah there's some open
source alternatives did I mention is
that this one will even allow you to
record which is huge for you yeah we
could actually use it to podcast and it
reports great to disk that means I want
to have to have like a separate hardware
you want it to be able to press record
on oh my gosh so there's this thing it's
really cool it's called jitsi meet you
can find it over at Jesse org slash
project slash jitsi meet and this is
basically why it comes into play so
jitsi is coined from i like this
it's a bulgarian word for wires because
it's helping people communicate over the
wires in that cute okay but why a
bulgarian word I mean why not call a
wire
cuz cuz it's funny cuz Bulgaria rocks
and you know what Bulgaria doesn't get
enough credit for how awesome it really
is I am going to retire there and Jar
pickles for the rest of my life it's
gonna be epic I'll see you there pickles
huh
maybe beets okay beets interesting
anyway so jitsi meat is open-source it's
a free web RTC javascript application it
includes encryption in it so it's really
nice about that and it also includes all
those useful bits that I mentioned that
you don't really get with Google
Hangouts which is why I've been kind of
interested in getting hands on with it
so this works via the jitsi video bridge
which basically relays everyone's video
to everyone else in a call without
turning them into a composite video
stream that's important yes it's very
important because that saves overhead a
ton when you can just push bits you like
oh I got your bits okay go there your
bits over here yep it's so so cool so a
lot of different video conferencing apps
they use that composite videos so they
you know throw it all together then it
all gets streamed out straight but this
keeps everything separate so you're
getting everyone's video kind of at the
same time so this video too it takes a
lot of bandwidth but it doesn't take a
lot of CPU usage which is pretty nice no
web RTC that's the backend for it it's
free it's open source it simply provides
applications like gypsy meat like a
whole bunch of other software
applications for video conferencing with
RTC which means real-time communications
abilities yes it's part of that
newfangled web internet stuff with html5
businesses and stuff web internet stuff
mmm so web RTC allows you to use your
browser for browser to browser VoIP for
chat for p2p file sharing Google
released this as an open-source project
back in 2011's which i thought was kind
of interesting that google released web
RTC what makes their products better it
does so I mean if you can drive you've
used it if you hang out two views do it
I mean Dropbox uses that there's a lot
of services that use this underlying
technology web RTC includes components
that allow the browser to access your
camera and your microphone so you can
actually you know use VoIP or you can
set up video and audio calls you can
share your data peer-to-peer and you can
collect stats on the different sessions
so it's kind of which I assume is just
to make it better so it's like Skype but
without
to install them yeah exactly and I love
that you don't have to install any you
don't have to open any crazy port words
you don't have to worry about NAT
traversal it just cuz it's all just
built in so web RTC can be disabled in
Firefox but not in Chrome and this is
the reason why I bring this up so I was
doing some research on web RTC and
apparently back in January of this year
there was a big security flaw found in
web RTC for VPN users where it actually
showed the real IP addresses there
locally not the one that's you know
brackets it out to everybody you know I
see that and I actually get more
concerned not even just the VPN users
and my new VPN users are either you know
corporate customers or people that are
concerned about their privacy so they
should have you know legitimate concerns
about their public IP address which
gives away your geolocation and all
sorts of other bad things that same
thing would probably apply to tor or The
Onion Router probably so something to
keep in mind yeah it is something to
keep in mind luckily this article did
link to some content from a github where
you can actually test out and see if you
are secure whenever you're using web RTC
and you can check out this over at
github I'll include this link as well
and you can also disable it in Firefox
but you can't disable it in chrome but
there is an application it's called web
RTC block and this will work somewhat
Tucket okay so there's a good be bad
with it but what we're for what we're
trying to do for our purposes I think
it's going to be epic part of this is I
really wanted us to have a way to
collaborate within the hak5 warehouse
now that we're all not in basically the
same room anymore and like many other
people I'm sure you probably do this
with your roommate we I am all the time
we're like chatting with each other even
though we're just a few offices down I'm
lazy
yes but having the ability to do
something like a hangout and do you know
screen sharing yeah 7:00 I love this
because it enables us to be able to code
together on the Wi-Fi pineapple and show
each other like hey why is this thing
not working or whatever have you
and so having something internally that
means that we can use that within this
office and not have to go out to the
internet and back in so it saves a lot
of bandwidth especially in our crippled
hak5 warehouse bandwidth period without
I would have gotten out of the dark ages
we excited that we finally fix that so
we can actually use programs like JIT
see now and now we can host stuff which
means that we'll be able to as we're
about to roll this server invite you
guys into the warehouse through the
jitsi and then finally like in that hack
house era when we were using things that
were not even made for that kind of
stuff like embedding multiple you
streams on a page I know now we'll be
able to do that with this because it's
it's open source and it's extensible and
it's modular there's plugins and it
integrates with our IRC and all sorts of
other cool stuff so yes I think we've
sold you on it I think you understand
why the benefits yep we should plug
right along and get going okay with our
server so we're going to building
installing this yeah I'm just going to
install it right now
oh so nothing breaks I'm doing this
through Zen Center right now and we'll
retouch on why Zen and all of that stuff
with the virtualization later but
suffice it to say and I'll fullscreen
that for you Paul
and that did not fullscreen so well
let's say scale and then fullscreen
there we go hope that looks a little bit
better for you guys sorry about the
white taco backgrounds that's weird but
now we can start the process of setting
up our jitsi server you want to make
sure that you have a static IP address
if you're making this public otherwise
you could go dynamic if you're using an
internally but keep in mind that that
could change and essentially it's really
just a matter of adding the jetty repo
into your apt sources if you're on
Debian or in this case Ubuntu and and
then we just do a little apt-get install
foo so here we go I'm going to go ahead
and switch to root and edit my sources
so that's an Etsy apt sources list I'm
going to scroll to the very bottom and
add Deb download jitsi org slash nightly
slash Deb's Deb space unstable slash
there we go save that guy and then I'm
going to go ahead and need to install
the JIT two key so
all of this will work which is good so W
get bring that over here
whoops W get so are you giving the
unstable one I'm doing the nightly
because I get the latest and greatest
version this is one of those things
where yes we're going to put it
production we're going to make it live
but we have the understanding that we
can totally break everything here and
that's fine because what's one of the
wonderful things about having 63 IP
addresses we can do stuff like that and
it won't matter so it works
we'll go with the latest and greatest
scary version of orsk a sui send a VM
flaming oh well all right so let's get
the key here from download jitsi org
nightly Deb unstable and it's the
archive key and we're going to go ahead
and pass that to apt key ad type yes
it's missing stuff missing stuff right
that's what it's missing I'm telling it
that this right here that tack yeah
corresponds to the tack at the end so it
knows what it's actually passing so it's
what it's doing here is it it's W get is
downloading that file and then passing
that file into apt key using the pipe
and that s yeah - is just a little thing
like standard Internet's good stuff so
really at this point it's just a matter
of you know apt-get update since we
added that Deb and then install so have
to get update it's my favorite command
ever except when it takes forever now
that we've got 600 megabits it's not bad
and apt-get tak why install jitsi tak
meat and JIT teammate is its own thing
jitsi meat is the web RTC pretty like a
Google Hangouts like thing as opposed to
jitsi video Bridge which is one of the
underlying components of it but you know
you can if you go over to Jitsu don't
get confuses like they have a bunch of
other awesome sip related stuff XMPP
related stuff if you want to roll your
own peer-to-peer communications
intranet good stuff this is really the
place I love these guys so at this point
we're going to go ahead and I'm going to
call this hangout and okay I hope that
she doesn't get upset here but I like
the term hangout I think the term
released is like conference and to it's
to corporate and especially when you do
hear state yeah I know which is really
weird because we say it's a pleasure to
meet you but but we don't give each
other I should home but I should be
passing you like salami you know I
should be like I should have some meat
in my hand I should be like Patricia we
should thank you so much for the
sandwich yes there should be an RFC for
this for the meat exchange
okay so we're gonna go hang out I don't
want to confuse it with Google stuff but
I do feel like what we're doing here is
appropriate because I don't want to call
it conference stock five because people
think we're putting on a conference and
that's not what we do
so we're going to go with a self-signed
certificate and this is going to throw
errors on most browsers but you will be
able to add an exception it's no big
deal
otherwise if we have a certificate we
can go ahead and install that and that's
something that we're going to be doing
let's put this into production I like
that it lets you do that it makes it
easy and this is using nginx on the
background in the background rather than
using Apache so if you're you know I
think you can replace which one you use
it's a web server they serve webs would
you like some webs today no one wants me
here have some webs with the side of
sandwiches yes sandwiches sandwiches
over IP this has to happen all right so
the other thing that I like to do I
mentioned that it was nginx that's
running in slash USR share nginx oops
and I'm going to go ahead and pop out of
this and hit this up on its local IP
which would be 10 dot 73 to 31.1 22 I
want to say yes and this is welcome to
ass well that's not really that exciting
so what I'm going to do is W get I dot n
gger calm slash 3yp
you cue JPEG please you know feel free
to do this at home
and then I'm going to move it to and I'm
going to nano my index because I need to
move it to the HTML folder so this HTML
folder here continues all the good stuff
for our lips contains all the good stuff
on our web server and you'll notice that
there's not much here and that's because
this is what you would get - if you're
not coming from the right domain so I'm
going to change this get rid of all of
that just say save that out and now let
me go back over to a browser and refresh
the page boom there we go okay curvy
that's very important because we don't
necessarily need everybody to know that
we're running nginx or anything like
that it's a little bit of obfuscation I
always like to do it and also it's my
cat so I should be allowed to do it okay
so the next thing that we're going to do
here is we need to make sure that our
host name is correct and you'll notice
that my prompt says root at Boone - the
name of this server is just who blue -
it's the default when you set up an
ubuntu server and if I type hostname it
should tell me the same thing so let's
real quick edit that it's an Etsy host
name and just replace it with in this
case hang out great and then we also
need to set up our fqdn or a fully
qualified domain name host any good
stuff and this is so that you will
actually be able to about those my
Wireshark segments there you go see how
it all just builds on top of each other
we're going to set this up so that
people on the interwebs are actually
going to be able to hit it up when it
hits like when we do all of our port
forwarding and make it public right so
in that case I'm going to edit the file
under Etsy and hosts
and we basically just want to change
this to say something like hangout hak5
org that's where this is going to reside
so that's where people will go from the
public yep okay and one will be hangout
great and with that all set up we
basically all we have to do is restart
the name services so that is just a
matter of doing service hostname restart
service hostname restart ah stop unknown
instance very confusing not sure that's
weird let's just move on because this
isn't going to matter in a hot second
because I actually Pripet prepped the
turkey as it were I should point out
that this is actually live right now on
a separate server and the reason being
is because I've put forwarded the good
ports over at TCP 80 and 443 those are
going to allow your HTTP and your HTTPS
to go through and that's good stuff and
then the other big thing about git sees
that you're going to need to open up UDP
ports 10,000 through 20,000 so yes just
go ahead and open up 10,000 ports on
your firewall and everything will be
golden and at this point we should have
it configured so what I'm going to do
now is essentially have followed these
same steps except with the proper IP
addresses on another server I'm going to
shut that one down and start this guy up
that's already set up and there we go
all right and you'll see if I do
hostname I get hang out and if I do
hostname tack F I'll get the fully
qualified domain name which is hang out
hack five org and that's actually set up
if you're testing it internally one of
the things that you can do is in Windows
if you're using Windows or you know any
other operating system it's very similar
you would open up a administrative
command prompt in Windows and go to
drivers and then Etsy and you can use
Notepad to edit hosts and you'll notice
this is a very similar file to the other
one and I can actually enter in any IP
address here like I was working on fuzz
peg earlier and so I made fuzz pig
always go to 10:30 yeah you know where
were these names don't know but if I
Pitt if I ping fuzz pig hak5 org it's
going to resolve to ten 370 331 133
which is internal to our network here
yeah it's just a nice way to do some
testing so if you're just rolling
something out locally you do have to
have your your fully qualified domain
name match what engine's is going to be
expecting to see because otherwise
you're just going to see a picture of my
cat and that's not the worst thing in
the world but you probably want to do
some video conferencing so finally with
all of that setup there's really nothing
more to do once we have it installed on
our server now it's just a matter of
going over to hang out dock 5 org and
you'll see that the first thing it does
is forwards over to the HTTP and we were
expecting that yeah and we can check out
the certificate and see that it's
actually self issued so this is exactly
what I was talking about when we first
did that setup it asks us hey if you
actually have a real certificate real
certificate because we want to pay money
to those people that sell the
certificates so that we can say we're
legit then otherwise you can add an
exception and that's what we're going to
have to do so it's just a matter of
hitting advance and then saying proceed
to hang out to hack 5 org and there we
go
and I've already customized this just a
bit normally get like a little jetty
logo and stuff and the reason that I
have is because this is so rad that we
can we can actually do in autumn it's
all just HTML and JavaScript and stuff
so is really easy to configure you'll
find an interface underscore configured
JavaScript that you can just toss in
your logo and stuff but basically we
enter in a name so if you want to do
this as well join me on this and I go to
hangouts or hangout its hangout hak5 org
and then basically enter in a room name
when you get there I'm going to go to
the room name hak5
and hit go ok so I'm going to do this
and my camera so wants to allow my
camera to microphone right Wow and so
you'll see in what's me see in the top
right it asks you if you want to allow
access and you can choose which
microphone to use and which camera to
use my camera is disabled right now so
it's not actually going to show my video
but you can see like as I talk it's
lighting up there and that's me and I
can see you and I've changed the names
to like random hacker you can hit the
chat over here and be like hello I made
myself darren and joined the chat and
say what's up yo and all it totally
works yeah ok so there we go so there's
still some bugs to work out
but essentially Paul and I were doing
this earlier and it was really fantastic
so yeah I just wanted to throw that out
there because this is pretty easy to get
set up and configured and working and
then instantly like boom that was it I
mean that was like you know in 10
minutes you could have your own little
jitsi server running up in your office
and then you don't have to use Google
Hangouts and stuff and waste all the
external bandwidth you can just do it
local and in this case you could
probably I don't know by the time this
airs it probably still be up you can
hammer on a hammer away it's going to be
a hangout hack 5 org that's awesome and
if we actually take a look at the CPU
we're doing one of the calls right now
and I can come over to my Zen Center and
run top and you'll see that I'm using
barely any RAM I'm using barely any
schedule well yeah well that's because
my camera is broken on my laptop but
that's that's a me thing so anyway it's
cross-platform it's good stuff it works
in Chrome chromium if you are using
Firefox again they have to use the
nightly build it works in build 39 and
higher so hopefully that will become the
mainstream branch soon there's a little
bit of a difference of opinion I guess
between the Firefox team and how WebRTC
should be implemented in a couple of fun
interesting ways and I'm sure has
nothing to do with it being a Google
technology or anything like that but
essentially if used the nightly or even
for us so you know opera get some love
today it's a pretty fantastic way to do
a little bit collaboration we'll touch
on this more later as we dive deeper
into it and as we integrate it better
into our network here I have private
because it's pretty awesome I just can't
wait to see like you know squeegee and
everybody like pop in and be like hey
I'm curious what your plans are for this
I don't know we'll see we'll see let us
know what you think in the comments or
hit us up feedback at hak5 org let us
know you want to see more of this stuff
because we can dive deeper into setting
up to say the plugins for screen sharing
and all sorts of other good stuff but
with that we're going to take a quick
break and when we get back it's trivial
it doesn't matter if you're a fan of
WebRTC or active X when you need a
website and a domain name you're going
to want to get it online as fast as
possible you got that killer idea let's
