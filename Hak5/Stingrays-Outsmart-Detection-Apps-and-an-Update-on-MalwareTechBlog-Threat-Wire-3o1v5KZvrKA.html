cellphone towers can outsmart detection
apps and hackers encode malware into DNA
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I am Shannon Morrison this is
threat wire for August 15 2017 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom if you
haven't checked out our patreon yet
please do so we have lots that we want
to do for the show but we can't do it
without your support patreon.com slash
threat wire is the place to support
threat wire and the link is in the show
notes and now on to the news we have got
an update on malware tech blogs case
Marcus Hutchins was arrested right after
Def Con in relation to the banking
malware from 2014 called Chronos for the
full story please see last week's
episode of threat wire I have the link
in the show notes to that as well his
court date was scheduled for last week
but was postponed until Monday August
14th
during the hearing Hutchins pleaded not
guilty to creating Chronos malware
Hutchins lawyer Brian Kline said he was
not guilty of the six charges and they
renegotiated his terms of release
originally after he got out on bail he
would not be allowed internet access he
is now allowed access to continue his
work but he cannot access his wanna cry
sinkhole he also has to be tracked by
GPS and he cannot leave the United
States Hutchins is currently relocating
to Los Angeles which is also where the
company he works for is located at he
will be represented by both Brian Kline
and Marsha Hoffman who was formerly with
the e FF and was interviewed by hack
five several years ago both Kline and
Hoffman are outstanding lawyers and
according to Hoffman's statements to the
press was more evidence comes to light
they believe that he will be fully
vindicated his trial is set for October
23rd and until then we can expect a bit
of snark via his Twitter account now
that he's allowed on the internet again
it's almost like it's 1995 all over
again IMSI catchers also known as
stingray devices are malicious fake cell
phone towers that can act like real
towers allowing your phone to connect to
them once your smart phone connects data
can be compromised and spied on many of
these stingray devices will do so by
dropping your connection
something less secure than LTE be at 2g
3G or 4G connections several different
applications available across androids
Google Playstore have been created to
detect V stingrays but unfortunately
much like antivirus apps on Android they
don't hold up to their promises several
researchers from Oxford University and
the Technical University of Berlin wrote
a research paper on their findings and
how they were able to trick the apps
into thinking a stingray device was a
legit tower the researchers plan to give
a talk on their findings on Monday
during the EU's next workshop on
offensive technologies of the five
applications they studied which were
called snoop snitch self spy catcher GSM
spy finder darshakon a ims ICD all five
were circumvented each of these is
supposed to alert you via notification
whenever a fake cell phone towers
recognized but unfortunately that was
not the case
the researchers built their own stingray
device while keeping it contained in a
Faraday cage so not to intercept any
kind of innocent nearby devices the
device is made up of an embedded PC and
it kind of looks like a Raspberry Pi or
similar device from the photos in a USRP
which stands for universal software
radio peripheral both of which cost
together a few hundred bucks they use
several different modes to get a
smartphone to connect to the device and
as such determine which apps would
notify them of the Stingray while the
apps could see if a fake tower was
recently created if it sent a silent
text or if it dropped the signal using
one downgrade technique the apps did not
notice the Stingray if they used
alternate techniques to connect to the
phone making a silent call instead of a
text to find the IMSI using a different
technique to downgrade the 2g or
imitating real local towers so that the
Stingray doesn't look like a new one
were all successful in their tests they
also used authentication token replay
techniques zero security and location
leaks which successfully connected with
no indication from the apps the full
report is linked below one of these
applications was created by a researcher
and who didn't respond when wired asked
them for comment GSM spy finder disputed
the research findings and self spy
catchers said the most common modes of
stingrays would be discovered
his application unfortunately though
much of the underlying issues rely on
phone manufacturers and chipset
manufacturers coming to their senses
about the problems that stingray devices
have shown most if not all of the issues
cannot be modified or fixed by an
application and applications are used
merely as band-aids for a much larger
problem as I have mentioned before
security is kind of like a tennis match
the ball changes quartz between the
attacker and a developer multiple times
until eventually one of them is going to
win a group of researchers from the
University of Washington is also
presenting findings on Thursday at the
youth next security conference about
being able to encode malicious software
in strains of DNA what apparently this
is a thing when physical strands of DNA
are analyzed using a gene sequence
analyzer a computer is used to turn that
data into bits that can be researched
further to develop cures and further
medicine and stuff like that the
researchers found that they can also
code malicious data into the DNA so that
when the analyzer looks at it the
malicious code attacks the underlying
computer and in sex it the researchers
used ASCII strings of a's t's c's and
g's from the DNA strand to create binary
output from one hundred and seventy six
letters total they took advantage of a
buffer overflow to get the sequence to
read the exploit and use the bash shell
to connect to a remote server now while
I do not fully comprehend the details to
encode malicious data into physical DNA
since I was a total fail at chemistry
I'll just be honest right there they
were able to successfully do so and such
once sequencing in an analyzer happened
the exploit could expand from a digital
subset from their similar techniques
have been used in recent past to encode
automated gifts or just depending on who
you are and text into physical DNA the
attack worked 37 percent of the time and
the researchers used some creative
Liberty to even make that successful
during the process they did find some
other vulnerabilities in software
commonly used for gene sequencing
showing that security was definitely not
the main thought when developing these
products the researchers do not see this
as a viable attack vector at this time
but it
could be used in the near future as more
and more analysis is done by third-party
vendors of DNA or for criminal cases
