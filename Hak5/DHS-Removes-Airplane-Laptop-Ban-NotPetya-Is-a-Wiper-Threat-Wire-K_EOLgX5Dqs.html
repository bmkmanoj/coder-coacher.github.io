airplanes Microsoft 10 is going to block
ransomware and not Petya is a wiper not
ransomware all that coming up now on
threat wired screenings I am Shannon
Morrison this was threat wire for July
4th 2017 this is your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom happy Independence Day

Escher's that would be taken at security
checkpoints for international flights
earlier this year the DHS implemented a
laptop ban for flights in coming to the
u.s. from 10 airports in the Middle East
and North Africa including Turkey
Morocco Jordan Egypt the United Arab
Emirates Qatar Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
the ban ensured passengers could bring
their cell phones on board as carry-ons
but no other devices larger than that
would be admitted and would have to be
checked some viewers of our show wrote
in to explain that they had to check
their laptops but also they had to check
battery's ear eaters and game consoles
such as their Nintendo DF now while some
may say that this is fine it'll give us
a chance to read books instead and yeah
that's cool they will miss the very
clear threat of your devices being
damaged stolen lost or intercepted and
compromised some of you may also say
well if you are worried about your
device being compromised you're in the
wrong business
well I would say tell that to my friends
who do penetration testing and travel
for business and carry very sensitive
information on them and cannot leave
their devices in other hands even if
encryption is included removing the hard
drive or shipping the device also fall
into the same problems the DHS was
considering for a short time extending
this laptop ban to all incoming
international flights but that was very
short-lived according to the homeland
security the band was first implemented
because a threat was discovered of
explosives being hidden
electronic devices now the DHS is
removing the laptop ban but including
new enhanced security measures for
incoming flights this includes enhanced
overall passenger screening heightened
screening of personal electronic devices
increased security around aircraft and
passenger areas and deploying k9
screening advanced technology and
additional preclearance locations now
much of the new measures are very vague
and very broad so specifics of these are
currently unknown no clarity was given
for what heightened screening of
personal electronic devices mean when
homeland security secretary John Kerry
gave a press briefing on the matter
this news surfaced just a week after a
new TSA screening policy was made public
describing increased screening of
reading material which could also be a
privacy concern check the links below
for more information
Microsoft just announced a slew of new
protections for Windows 10 users that
will be built into the operating system
for all users in the meantime these are
available through Windows 10 insider
preview builds 16 to 32 for PC all
security features will be included in
the fall creators update which will
release in October or November of this
year so first off Microsoft is now
implementing exploit protection in the
Windows Defender security center even
with Windows Defender antivirus turned
off this will be available under the
notification icon on the taskbar you
simply click open and search for the
Windows Defender Security Center from
there click app and browser control then
find exploit protection on the list and
second they also introduced something
called controlled folder access which
can be found under the Windows Defender
Security Center as well you click virus
and threat protection settings then
switch controlled folder access to on
this is Windows reply to the growing
threat of ransomware taking advantage of
Windows machines in that it monitors
changes the apps try to make two files
in your protected folders you will have
the ability to blacklist or whitelist
apps that are authorized to have access
to controlled folders and if an app
tries to change files inside that folder
and it's on the blacklist you will get a
notification about it and it will be
blocked from the attempt allowing
applications will be a manual process
unless Microsoft has already
being them as a trusted application your
default folders such as desktop
documents and pictures cannot be removed
from the list but you can also add other
ones to it Network shares or map drives
will also be protected which is awesome
but variables and wildcards are not
supported at this time Microsoft will
also be removing SMB version 1 from the
new update and that is a good thing for
this story there seems to be a little
bit of confusion across outlets about
the name of the malware petia was
ransomware that has been infecting
computers since 2016 this new attack
that everybody's talking about is being
dubbed several different names including
pettiest
not petia Goldeneye and Pesci a rap this
new attack is not petia but it is
similar so for simplicity I will be
referring to it as not petia for the
story so last week another large cyber
attack created havoc across the globe as
it locked down computers and demanded
$300 in Bitcoin for recovery to a
provided email address this ransomware
and I say that in quotes for a reason
dubbed goal and I are not petia infected
thousands of machines worldwide this new
strain of malware with taking advantage
of the eternal blue exploit and the
eternal romance exploit from the NSA
that was leaked by shadow brokers that
takes advantage of the SMB protocol
vulnerability that Microsoft has already
patched not petia uses to exploits along
with mini cats to steal password
credentials from other networked
computers even if they aren't will Nura
Bowl to the SMB issue so by doing so the
malware can take control of command-line
utilities allowing for much more than
just walking down files for ransom
according to many analysts the infection
seems to stem from a ukrainian tax
accounting package called médoc that
updates itself over-the-air Medoc has
not claimed admission at fault at this
time but Microsoft was able to confirm
that some attacks stemmed from an update
from me doc so once the computer is
infected it waits for up to one hour
till the computer reboots and then it
starts the encryption process held for
ransom organizations hit include banks
airports power utility companies media
outlets government offices and a lot
more Chernobyl radiation
during was attacked as well as the
Cadbury chocolate factory which is very
important to my survival as opposed to
previous ransomware techniques not petia
encrypts an entire system instead of
specific files by attacking the Master
Boot Record of the machine though we
have heard this story before time and
time again about ransomware something
odd took place with not petia
since the ransomware specifically asked
victims to email the attacker after
paying bitcoins to get their files
decrypted post Co the email company the
attacker used lock their email accounts
so victims now have no way to contact
the attacker to get decryption access
since posting a chose to block the email
account
this means that victims were not able to
contact the attacker at all so even if
they did pay and even if they could
decrypt them now they have no way well
this was just short-sighted attempt by
post EO to protect their name it also
means victims are being further
penalized by not patching systems by
sending money to an attacker who
couldn't even decrypt them but if this
seems odd to you that's because it is
yeah it gets worse so many security
researchers took the email Fiasco as a
sign that the ransomware was not indeed
ransomware at all but it was actually
for data destruction aka a wiper upon
further analysis this was confirmed as
the case because the attack would not
have any kind of valid decryption
information that they could extract from
the installation ID for each infection
furthermore not petia overwrites the
Master Boot Record instead of encrypting
it and since the MDR is crucial for data
access once it is overwritten that data
is basically gone
now while victims look for ways to get
their data back the original petia
creator going by Janus on Twitter said
he or she may be able to crack the
malware encryption with their private
key for pet yep but this is yet to be
determined so how do you protect
yourself you can update and patch your
machines and if your company is unable
to do so and I know a lot our create
backups about all your digital files
remember three to one which is three
backups to local and one off-site thank
