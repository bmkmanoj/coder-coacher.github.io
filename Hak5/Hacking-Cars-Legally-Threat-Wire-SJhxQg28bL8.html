printer can also be a fake cellphone
tower and did the Murai botnet actually
take down Liberia all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for Tuesday
November 8 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom first off I want to
give a big thanks to our patrons at
patreon.com slash threat wire you fund
the making of this show so thank you for
letting us bring you to security news
every single week our first story to
hack or not to hack that is the question
when it comes to your personal devices
generally you would want to have all of
the manpower that you would need but for
many devices it's been illegal to
reverse engineer their software code or
hack the hardware the DMCA section 1201
gave companies the ability to submit a
lawsuit against any consumer if that
consumer hacked their own devices
devices that they had purchased or items
that they had owned Sony and John Deere
tractors had both sued and threatened to
sue consumers respectively allowing
customers the ability to hack their own
device will have a positive impact it
will allow security researchers to
legally reverse engineer code on
copyrighted devisors and potentially
steer manufacturers towards greater
privacy and security awareness the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act was
updated just last year by the Library of
Congress's Copyright Office to allow for
exemptions on certain types of hardware
and software including forms of security
research and digital repair of vehicles
so yes you can now legally hack your car
the exemptions went into effect late
last week and are on a two-year trial
period just two years security
researchers must use a controlled lab
for their own testing so that it doesn't
endanger other individuals I feel like I
shouldn't have to say that but you know
just don't hack people you're not
allowed to hack if all goes well the ban
against reverse engineering could be
lifted for good after the next two years
trolololololol law in a great example of
the poorest security that we face by
using
cellphone signals Julian Oliver a hacker
and artist in Berlin created a fake
cellphone tower inside a regular office
printer like any printer that you would
find in pretty much any office and he
called it the stealth cell tower
Oliver used a Raspberry Pi ax blade RF
SDR - GSM antennas and an HP LaserJet
1320 to set this up and allowed the
device to man-in-the-middle voice calls
and SMS messages via GSM similarly to
the IMSI catchers called stingrays that
saw their moment in the spotlight when
government documents were released
publicly stealth cell tower sits near
its victims in a regular office printer
and spoofs cell towers kind of duh so
when a cell phone connects to it it can
send the phone a text it can read a text
and it can even print the text messages
out on a piece of paper since it's
inside a printer the device can also
call a user and play mp3s over the
speaker in a person's phone Oliver
wanted to demonstrate the privacy flaws
that we deal with on a day-to-day on
cell connections and suggested using
encryption apps like signal which is
encrypted end-to-end so even if a phone
does accidentally connect to a spoof
tower it'll still be encrypted he also
mentions that this could be illegal
depending on your country so just don't
try this at home but if you do the code
is on his website everybody freaked out
last week tons of media outlets reported
that the Mirai botnet which uses
insecure Internet of Things devices to
send tons of garbage data at a victim in
an attempt to make their servers
basically puke was used to take down an
entire country that being liberia in
western Africa a tldr version and
actually didn't take down the entire
country clickbait WTF the claim was that
a DDoS attack was maintained against a
telecom that owns the one submarine
internet cable that goes into Liberia
and that the attack was of more than 500
gigabits per second now while Akamai
does report a lower traffic level in
Liberia during the day of the attack
this could also be because that was a
national holiday in Liberia the
submarine cable monitoring system showed
no
downtime for that day and multiple
sources did confirm that Mirai was used
against a telecom provider but no data
shows that it took the entire country
offline so moral of the story look for
multiple sources that can provide actual
data to a claim and be skeptical of what
you read on the Internet
don't click on those clickbait titles
now we do have a comment of the week
this week last week I asked should
counter hacking be legal and our comment
of the week comes from Sarah Dee who
writes in the real world you have a
moral and in most places legal right to
defend yourself and others against
unjustified attacks in the UK we have
lost surrounding the concept of
self-defense using reasonable force as I
understand it the US has similar laws
not to mention the whole Second
Amendment thing hacking can certainly be
considered a weapon and in my honest
opinion there's a strong moral argument
that counter hacking is simply a form of
self-defense so long as you're within
the boundaries of reasonable force which
usually boils down to you can use enough
force to stop the attack but any
additional force is considered revenge
rather than self-defense thank you so
much Sarah Dee for your comment of
course you can share your comments on
today's stories below for a chance to be
featured in next week's episode thank
you again for being patrons of threat
wire as well
you can contribute on patreon.com slash
threat wire to get your name on threat
wired net which was just updated for our
November patrons as well as your own for
baby in the shell like these ones I know
one of those personally I know Peter
he's adorable he's such a long cat that
he can actually reach up to an ice
machine and get ice out of a
refrigerator he is so long if everyone
that watches the show donates $1 per
month we would successfully cover all of
our fees like rent we got bills to pay
like electricity plus I want to get a
new camera for the show now of course if
you cannot contribute you can give the
show a thumbs up and you can subscribe
on YouTube comm slash hack 5 definitely
helps and it gets the word out there to
