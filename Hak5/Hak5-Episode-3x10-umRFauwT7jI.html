10 this is the season finale of the
third year of doing the show and man you
guys really stuck with us for a long
time so this is not really a big
fantastic episode I'd like it to be more
of just a thank you for you know
sticking with us and watching us evolve
over the years you know one of the
things that we did in the third year
that was like really big deal for us is
we moved into a big house that we call
the hack house and it's kind of like the
real world because we all live here and
we do the show and you know you can
imagine what fun it is for three sis
admin's to be together in house doing a
doing technol us and you know you guys
have seen us involved from the apartment
seen the set evolved and and the bricks
have been doing this all right I know
some some others are doing as well and
it's rocking but sadly something drastic
happened recently and pretty much that
explains why there is a refrigerator and
a stove in the middle of the set and the
rest of it is gone and that is because
my one tip to you this episode is if
you've got quest Polly be piping in your
house you might want to get rid of it
because like it was in the hack house it
totally just burst and flooded the place
for like six hours while we're all at
work and I came home to basically a pool
so thankfully we've got insurance
covering all that fun stuff contractors
coming in and out of here taking care of
the place but until then we've been a
quote-unquote relocated
I have one camera and Paul and I'm
trying to do an episode so anyway I come
with me I'll give you the the tour of
the hack how so you guys I've always
wanted a little bit more disastrous and
maybe we'll do a part two to this in
season four when it's not so too messed
up so yeah anyway down here you can see
there's just construction and messed up
crap everywhere it was amazing it was
just like seriously just raining and you
walked in and it was like a pole so
anyway this is our network closet it's
pretty empty at the moment but we did
have a little makeshift rack thing we
got the smooth wall in here that's been
rocking since season two late season two
I can't remember when we did the segment
the smooth walls still up doing really
well this is the living room it's pretty
empty at the moment but here's the thing
well right so life hangs in some lemons
and we grab the tequila the salt and
we've taken the opportunity to do some
upgrades mats put in some some cat 5's
going all throughout the house and coax
that we're going to use to be able to do
some foodstuff season four we're
actually expanding the set so the set is
getting twice as large we're adding some
new faces and new sets like all sorts of
fun stuff we think you can really enjoy
it we're gonna have a lot of fun putting
together and that's that's pretty much
it i mean i'd show you the upstairs but
it's just more of the same we didn't
lose any major equipment so that's
that's the good news we will you know
continue doing the show we're going to
take our two months off like we do every
year and use it to rebuild and to tear
down the fake cityscape on the Walters
yeah I know it's fake and it worried
weren't kidding any one more week so I
feel bad giving you know supertech
content this quote-unquote episode so I
figured I'd show you something that's a
little apt and that is that is on
Windows if you're ever in a situation
where there's an emergency and you have
to shut down some servers and computers
kind of like we were real quick what you
want to do is rather than just pull the
plug if you have the time hit ctrl
delete and pull up the windows security
dialogue here tab over to shut down and
if you hold down control when you hit
shut down you get this special dialogue
that says use this as a last resort you
click OK and seriously like two seconds
later your machine is off so it's a lot
faster than using you know the regular
shutdown it's a little bit safer than
just pulling the plug and that is my one
little geek tip while we we deal with
this stuff
I do want to thank the sponsors that
have made this show possible you guys
know the codes dreamhost that tack 54
plenty dollars off Go Daddy hia for 15
or ten percent off your domains and ssl
certificates and we're like to thank a
new sponsor for this episode it's it's a
can be very popular and we've been
riding it frequently and that is the
fail bus so I would like to thank them
go over fail bus calm and you can get a
promotional offer where you're at trips
may take you so anyway there was one
last thing and that was like five
stickers yay you know we got these
printed a while ago and it just been
sitting in a box and we're like you know
what as we rebuild and build the season
for set we think that that you guys
might like some stickers we could really
use some donations so what they look
really good on EPCs on camera bags on
really a lot of stuff and you head over
hak5 org slash stickers with recommend
donation of like five dollars more we'll
send you some stickers it helps us out
immensely as we get the tequila and the
salt make this thing happen so anyway
thanks so much for watching over the
last three years and we hope you guys
tune in for season four it's going to be
an amazing groundbreaking you know she's
bored really seasoned please
like it I'm sure so that was enough
rambling Paul's getting tired of holding
the camera I'll see you guys for XO on
