bitbucket by Atlassian welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today we
are talking about finding things in fact
we are finding all of the things well to
be honest generally I find it's quite
easy to just find files in my file
directory in the graphical user
interface but if I am in a hurry and I
just want to work within the terminal
there are a few different ways to search
for files through the command line so to
search for files programs or directories
that match a word the first command that
I'm going to share with you today is
called locate so for example I can type
locate hak5
and hit enter and this will find all of
my local files that include the word
hak5 in them now keep in mind this is
only going to search directories that
you actually have permission to view so
if you want to locate a file in your
root directory which you will notice I
never run in root you will also need to
be running in root to view those files
also keep in mind searches are case
sensitive so for example with this one I
located lower case pack 5 so using
locate pack 5 with a capital H is going
to give me back a different output so
yeah very important although if you want
to you can also add the tack I option
which looks like this to give you all
upper case and lower case of that same
word now say you are searching for
something that gives you like 2000
different results that's probably too
many that you want to view but you could
pipe it over to less to easily manage
all of the different results so to do
that I would type in locate and I'm
going to use tack I again and then hak5
so it gives me all of those different
cases and I'm going to pipe that over to
less so this is going to let me view
everything in a simple file document and
if there are several pages then you can
scroll up and down with your arrows and
then hit Q to quit out of there so
really simple I can also
locate and view just a very simple
amount of different entries if I want to
with a specific number so I can use tack
I tack n for a number and I only want to
see three different hack five entries so
I could use the tack n output for that
so then we have grep which will allow
you to search inside of a file instead
of just searching via file name so so
far all we've been able to see is
everything that is named hack five if I
want to search inside of that file I
would have to use grep instead so say I
want to find a specific word from some
of the show notes that I wrote for my
previous episodes which have been saved
into a text file so in this case I have
already changed directories over to my
snub stuff test folder which I put a
whole bunch of different show notes text
documents into so if I want to find
let's say for example I want to grep
Shanon which I don't suggest that you do
and I'm going to look inside my text
being short what do I have in here oh
it's capitalized no wonder
capitalization okay so I'm going to grep
Shannon Tech saying short there we go
and then hit enter and it will search
that document for any times that Shannon
is listed in that document so it will
give me the text that's basically
surrounding those two words if you want
to you can also use grep with a wildcard
to search multiple files at once and you
can do that simply by typing and grep
Shannon wildcard and hit enter and
you'll notice here that in purple it
lists the text document names and then
it will give me the output of what
wherever my name shows up in that
document and you'll see several in here
because I always introduce myself in my
show notes ha
all right after the break I am going to
show you a few more tips for easily
searching files and folders in Linux
let's be honest your code is your world
you create it you tweak it you lovingly
obsess over it every single day I know I
do so picking the right repository
management tool is so important only the
best for your code right yes exactly
that's why the team at Atlassian created
bitbucket bitbucket is the git solution
for professional teams helping
over five million developers build with
a purpose the bucket gives teams of all
sizes free yeah that's right
again I said free private repositories
with state-of-the-art features like the
world's best pull request algorithm
built in continuous delivery
integrations with your favorite tools
like docker AWS and usher plus you get
JIRA integration since of course it's
from Atlassian giving your team
everything you need to take your code
from concept to customer we have used
bitbucket to share private code and
collab on it so the code is absolutely
perfect before we release it into the
wild and we love it if I kits for the
code that takes us to Mars it's for the
code that decodes the human genome or
maybe it's going to drive your next car
maybe it's for your next InfoSec tool
who knows
you can visit bitbucket org slash for
the code to start your free account
that's bitbucket org slash for the code
try and get bucket today what will your
code do now since this episode is simply
an overview of the different commands
that you can use to do basic searches
I'm not necessarily going to go into
details of grups different options but
just keep it in mind there are a lot of
different ways that you can use grep so
if you would like to see an episode
dedicated just to grep let me know in
the comments below and I will definitely
do that for you guys alright
other than locate and grep there are
also the find command
now while locate searches just for those
file names and you have to keep in mind
it's case sensitive and unless you use
tech I and those are based on semi
updated databases everyday and grep
searches within those files for specific
terms find will search on the fly and it
can be a little bit slower but it can
also discover files that locate cannot
so if I type in find tech name tech
thing while I'm inside my test folder it
didn't find anything why is that now if
i LS you'll notice that I have some
texting files in here oh but they're
capitalized so let's try that
find tak name tech thing again I don't
find anything it doesn't find anything
because I didn't add any wildcards so
it's only going to output files that are
specifically named texting so it's not
going to tell me
one two three text is one of the files
that it had found because well it's not
just labeled texting it's labeled
texting one two three so to do this I
would use find tak name use quotation
marks texting with wild cards around
texting so it searches for that name in
any files and then hit enter and there
you go it's going to find all those
different files that I have in that test
directory find can also be used to just
list the specific users files now since
I am the only user on this machine other
than root you're not going to see much
of a change but you can use it just like
this I'll type in find tak user and I'm
looking for user subs so this will list
in that directory anything that I have
access to under my username if I want to
I could also type in find exclamation
mark tak user snubs and that is going to
list anything that is not owned by snobs
instead of listing everything that is
owned by me you can also use the same
format for searching for a group with
tak group instead of tak user or you can
also use tax size you can also use the
execute action so you can execute
different actions while using the find
command with tak e x-- ec and that's a
really useful command if you want to
change names so that they're all the
same capitalization for example now all
of these plus examples are found in the
man page for file so I definitely
suggest reading it because it will
totally get you up to date on everything
you can do with the find command now be
