learn C++ with start notes
you John dude what is this I find on my
printer is it go see our sis newspaper i
programmed the other day is it like the
alarm clock yeah it's kinda like the
alarm clock say what it is yeah so how
does this work i mean i see that i got
like RSS feeds in here but how did you
get it to print out like this yeah
actually it just automates a lot of
these things it parses the files grabs
the RSS feed prints it out to HTML and
then you said an order to print so what
am I going to need if I want to do this
what we're gonna need an Apache server
or is server web server to run the
scripts and I use PHP 52 that's awesome
can you show me the code yeah basically
we're going to start off by creating
some variables for the actual tags as
you can see when I pull up the XML it's
got like an RSS the version of the RSS
it's got the channel and then it
traverses through down to the core which
is like the description so we go back up
here I'll show you the variable names
and basically we create an array throw
in those tags in there and it'll know
what to grab what note to grab now we
get into a little bit of the dirty work
I'm not going to go through and explain
the entire process yeah this is a lot
its kind of it's a lot of kid 250 some
laundry yeah it's it's not a whole lot
but yeah it's a lot to explain so it'll
be in the show notes though yeah
definitely so is this like this is a
class or is this yes it is a class it's
actually I labeled my classes RSS news
and it's got some built-in functions so
that it just creates an object so this
is really the engine behind your PHP
script that guards on the XML so what
actually puts it together and makes it
look as beautiful as this well if we
scroll down to the bottom this is all
the preg match where it matches the data
from the array to the node then it grabs
that data on the inside then we'll just
scroll down here this is doing a little
bit of stripping and this is where the
actual RSS feed gets passed into the
actual URL that you enter
once it goes in here it's going to
actually open that file going to go grab
it bring back the data and then want to
scroll down here down to the actual
printing which I built into the function
as well which will actually print all
the data it goes through each little
node and those okay inside of said let's
say description it's going to grab all
the text inside of there mmm so I've got
like this / that feed and I've got this
story about Google that's right there
where it's actually printing the Google
article exactly and in reality there's
actually that description tag right
there okay yeah so it knows which one to
grab all right then should we go back to
the index page which is the actual main
page that you view all the data in and
as you can see at the top we include
some CSS so we're not mess around some
ugly tables and I include once the new
step PHP which is was that cooler class
that was our class and I'm gonna start
off by creating an array of the URLs
okay i see so we've actually got all the
urls of the news feeds us you got
weather from yahoo and that's of my
whether i hear traffic BBC news slashdot
and then you know a personal blog right
so we've got the as you can see we've
got the links in the array and now what
we're actually going to do is we're
going to create those URL objects mmm
since it's a class we have to create an
object for it and it's going to count
for each in every URL so now what we're
going to do is we're going to take that
out I'm familiar with this let's see
body and some devta yeah yeah well right
before that we're actually going to
parse these URLs we're going to feed it
the URL and parse it is going to go
through all right then so we're going to
move on to the actual HTML and as you
can see it's it's really lower down
because of the CSS and I just call my
div tags I've got your RSS header if you
wanted to you can include the data in
there with a simple date function call
through PHP and then we actually call
the function that's in that class called
print rose so we don't actually have to
have the engine code in our PHP index
and that makes actually so much shorter
yeah and the cs because if it was in the
index file you'd have to go like a for
each loop and then print
so instead it just throw it in the class
and then just call it nice so how are we
going to automate this hoof prints every
morning well basically we're in create a
batch file and run a few scripts in it
but before we do that we're going to
have to do is we're going to have to
call a nap file or a cron job on unix to
set the time so that every Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday okay so this
is just scheduling to run the batch file
just like we did just like money alarm
clock exactly it's going to call that
batch file we're going to go ahead and
run that and the jobs created all right
so we're just going to quickly go over
the batch file first we're going to
delete those old files so when we
yesterday's news good idea and then
we'll do a curl connect so that we can
grab the live data and the hot making
this main.css in the newspaper HTML
exactly now it's going to also convert
that to PDF we're going to share our
program called doc to PDF and then it's
going to create an automat automated
print command using Newark and CMD so
we're going to go ahead and run it
whoops go ahead and call a newspaper
stop that run it let's go to auto print
great and I see the pdfs coming up yep
and there it goes great it's coming out
the printer
so nice thank you so much and you know
this can be customized with whatever RSS
feeds you want so you know anybody can
use this code to make their own custom
newspaper in the morning where can they
get more info and all the code and
everything they need to get this done
we're going to post it on the forums on
hi5 org all right so check out the show
notes sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
