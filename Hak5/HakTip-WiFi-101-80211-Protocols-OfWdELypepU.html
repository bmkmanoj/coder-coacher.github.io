threads welcome to hack tip the show
will we break down the concepts tools
and techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Aaron kitchen and
today today we are continuing on our WPA
cracking adventure with a little bit of
knowledge here on some more the
fundamentals of this ubiquitous wireless
protocol we all love Wi-Fi I mean as we
know it it's a standard for wireless
communication but the actual term Wi-Fi
is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance and
they're a trade association that
promotes wireless LAN technologies and
certifies products the actual term Wi-Fi
was adopted in 1999 as a branding term
guys come on it's a bit catcher than I
Tripoli 802 11 and it's kind of
considered an acronym for wireless
fidelity the Alliance actually used the
phrase as an advertising slogan back in
the day but they quit using that pretty
early on so if you've seen the Wi-Fi
certified logo on a device well that
basically means that it's completed the
Wi-Fi Alliance is interoperability
certification of course Wi-Fi for the
most part is synonymous with I Triple E
802 11 which comes in many flavors but
let's take a moment here to understand
where they all came from and how it all
came to be
you see the story of Wi-Fi or I Triple E
802 at 11 actually began well based on
our viewer survey before half of you was
born yeah okay so back in 1985 the FCC
released what is known as the is M ban
for unlicensed use this means anybody
can use these frequencies the is M
stands for industrial scientific and
medical and it's a radio band reserved
all over the world for those purposes
for example a microwave creates a lot of
electromagnetic interference so they've
reserved specific frequencies and well
that's why microwaves interfere with
radios like Wi-Fi array and Bluetooth
okay anyway so those the two ranges that
interests us the most are actually 902
to 900 and 28 megahertz as well as our
beloved 2.4 to 2.5 gigahertz the former
is the
is only unlicensed by what the ITU
considers region 2 so the ITU is the
International Telecommunications Union
they do a whole bunch of fun stuff and
region 2 is basically North America
South America Greenland and the eastern
Pacific Islands so anyway with that
spectrum now available our favourite
Corporation AT&amp;amp;T began working on a
wireless technology in 1991
Waveland it's now known as Waveland
classic and it operated in the 900
megahertz spectrum it was developed in
the Netherlands initially as a
technology for cashier systems and
supported one to two megabits per second
data rates it wasn't actually until 1997
that the first 802 11 protocol made its
debut appropriately named 802 11 TAC
1997 or sometimes referred to as ATO
2.11 legacy it too only supported 1 &amp;amp; 2
megabits per second data rates and is
effectively obsolete of course this
brings us to the lettered protocols that
we know and love today in 1999 two
protocols a do 2.11 a and 802 11 B hit
the scene both a and B offered much
higher data rates than their
predecessors the former clocking in at
54 megabits per second well the latter a
mere 11 megabits per second another
major differentiator are the frequencies
that you were used by the technologies B
took advantage of the commonly used 2.4
gigahertz spectrum
well a avoids congestion in the 5
gigahertz band now
that brings us to a total Evan a also
known as 802 211 a TAC 1999 and it's a
really beefy and kind of robust protocol
it's more resilient to you know poor
channel conditions because it uses
what's known as orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing it's
it's basically the very same method used
today in a DSL lines power line
communications WiMAX digital TV and a
bunch of other cool technologies that we
just take for granted today but due to
the complexities and manufacturing
processes 802 dot 11a products were kind
of considered late to market at the time
and while the technology offers higher
data rates than 802 at 11:00 be the
signal range was kind of much lower just
due to
inherent facts that the wavelengths are
much small in the five gigahertz band
and didn't penetrate walls and stuff
like that as easily now 802 at eleven a
was mostly adopted in enterprises who
needed the higher data rates though
today it's quite common to see dual band
or dual mode access point supporting
both a as well as B and G and whatever
else
alright so 802 211 B or 802 dot 11 BTech
1999 it was widely adopted all over the
world in mid-1999 and is kind of
considered the first mainstream wireless
networking protocol and unlike a B uses
the same media access control method as
802 11 legacy
yikes it's known as CSMA slash CA we'll
get back to that in just second
so while 802 dot 11 B had a maximum data
rate of 11 megabits per second the added
protocol overhead meant that the best
you could achieve with like a normal TCP
stream is just under 6 megabits per
second or if you're using UDP just over
7 megabits per second alright so what's
a csma/ca well it stands for carrier
sense multiple access with collision
avoidance and basically it's a main for
multiple access points and stations to
communicate with each other without
talking all over each other it's nice
but carrier sense multiple access it's
basically a media access control
protocol and it uses what's called a
like a probabilities to kind of make a
best guess at when a radio should talk
so the carrier sensing part that's the
means for the radio to listen in for
other signals from other stations
transmitting and then go ahead and wait
for them to finish before you know it
begins transmitting the multiple access
is well just that it just means that the
protocol is for more than just two
parties and then the collision avoidance
is a modification to it that uses well a
little less of the frequency when it
notices that there's a whole bunch of
other people trying to you know bunch of
traffic congestion so sweet is that okay
let's check this out in just a bit we're
going to go ahead into the next protocol
and this week's giveaway but first let's
take a quick break we all know that most
guys hate shopping for clothes but
luckily now

slash hack 5 and you'll instantly start
saving without even having to leave the
house that brings us to 802 dot 11g
which was ratified in 2003 bringing the
best of both worlds between 802 11 a and
B the new standard it takes advantage of
the 2.4 gigahertz band while using the
more robust orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing
transmission scheme so with the maximum
data rate of 54 megabits per second and
backwards compatibility with a total of
B the G protocol was adopted in droves
by consumers at the start of 2003 before
was even completely ratified I know 802
that 11g isn't without its issues though
as part of backwards compatibility
transmissions from other 802 11 B
stations will actually reduce the
network as a whole down to the older 11
megabit per second rate and the 2.4
gigahertz band is still susceptible to
interference from microwaves Bluetooth
devices baby monitors and other junk in
the spectrum and the protocol while its
high popularity is also a bit of a
problem in densely populated areas as
there's only three channels well lease
in the u.s. that don't overlap but we'll
get into channels later anyway next week
we're going to wrap up the protocols
with our new favorite 802 dot 11 n as
well as going over channels and finally
digging into the actual frames and a
lesson on BS SIDS and ESS IDs with a
practical example in backtrack Linux and
I hope you guys have enjoyed learning a
bit of the back story here I find that
while I could just spend five minutes
telling you what commands to type in to
crack a key it's so much more important
to understand why it is that those
commands do what they do now before I
get going it's time for the giveaway
last week I asked for the manufacturer
of my favorite USB Wi-Fi device based on
the oh you I and YouTube commenter
joking tiger was the first to answer
with real tech semiconductor corporation
so we'll be getting you one
those radios out in just a bit but first
it's time for this week's I'd like to
know now what 802 dot 11 be channel is
only available in Japan be the first to
answer in the comments and we'll get you
one of the radios that I use here on
active and as always we value your
feedback and suggestions so a tip to
share with us email tips a hack 5 org
and be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 for more great stuff just like
this I'll be there reminding you to
trust your tech no lest it fall is it
cool to make up for last week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
