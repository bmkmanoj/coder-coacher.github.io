by jack threads it's time once again to
check port 110 that's right Shannon
we're popping our mail tonight some
feedback emails all right what do we
have
pixelated dwarf that's an adorable name
writes love the short form tips a bunch
of shows ago your move accent' in the
deaaath attack with air crack to
reassociate packets from the capture and
replay those wouldn't that make the
whole brute force a little bit slow and
not really needed anymore
I think we're confusing two different
attacks here the D auth is when we're
trying to get a handshake typically in a
WPA cracking scenario and the replay
attack is typically when we're doing a
WEP crack and honestly the WEP cracking
stuff has become so simple that I'll
link in the sharing some of the tools
where you can just say I want that one
and it'll like hack that one yeah you're
like a crack that's the SSID yeah
everybody else so um but as far as the
WPA cracking and it's part of the series
that I'm currently doing on hack tip so
you have to go and check that out is
concerned like yeah what we talked about
a brute force attacking and really
that's the only way to currently go
ahead and crack a WPA encrypted Wi-Fi
network just because of the you know the
way that the handshake works in
capturing the handshake dictionary
attacks are okay it's been sped up a lot
by people putting together rainbow
tables again we know that WPA hashes
essentially are salted with the SSID so
you know the consideration and that's
why it's going to guess take forever and
I'm sorry unless you're a nation-state
you can afford like a big black box full
of FPGAs it's probably going to take a
while oh but I can show you right here I
mean like I'm looking at I'm oh a
captured a handshake right here from six
cf1 whoever that wasn't it was now
you're actually I checked on the bottom
of your computer you are c8 BC that
you're this one anyway so what I'm going
to do is I just need to grab the SSID
here or the B SSI
of my station my base station that is
and then it's pretty much as simple as
running airplay tak ng and then tax zero
to say do a deaaath I don't know send
like 15 D off packets which will
probably make our mics freak out because
they're Wireless tak a and then the
bssid of the access point that we're
trying to attack in this case it's
called Keroppi which is the hack 5 Wi-Fi
I know and then I'll do the one that's 5
D 4 5 ah 5 da for this guy right here
that's Shannon and then taxi for the
client and then Shannon's and then we'll
just whatever my interface is I'm using
double + 1 which for me is you know my
favorite yes yeah of course now am I
going to see anything on my machine well
I notice anything I guess I should say
actually I haven't started airmon-ng
yeah I thought that I had or maybe I
have it on Mon zero there we go I was on
Mon zero and hopefully that doesn't
sound too crazy to you guys but yeah and
as you can see simplified I'll get the
handshake there in just a second and
yeah that's that's how it works cool you
know do that all day long be a real dick
don't do that I'll be a dick why are we
even thinking about that now but thanks
for sending that email you guys know we
note we love your feedback send it to
feedback at hak5 org maybe we'll take a
question here on the show I live to
clarify things so that's true he does so
and stay tuned because we'll be right
back with this week's tech de les photo
and trivia last week I got our Windows
Azure projects off the ground by putting
a big map on Azure for our hack 5 Wi-Fi
map project so let's go ahead and go
back to the same project we were working
on last week to finish it up inside the
default dot aspx file we have three
controls the first control is the
chooser second control is going to be a
text box to display what our file name
was and the third control is going to be
the submit I'm just specifying you on
click events for these and then I'm
specifying the names and also adding
file Association
but the important part about all these
is the c-sharp behind it in default dot
aspx dot CS so let's go ahead and open
that up in here I'm going to first
concentrate on the onload I need to
declare what I'm where I'm putting these
files I'm putting them in Windows as
your blob storage in blob storage it
allows you to just store a file and then
store the parameters of the file and
then we're treated at a later date it
makes things really easy not have to
worry about permissions and things like
that on a file server
you set all the permissions right here
so in on the on page load function
that's the first function that's called
when the page is loaded as the name
States I'm declaring that I would like
to use blah blah the blob functions and
I'm saying what kind of privacy settings
do I want these are all public files and
then I'm setting up the permissions for
the blob container then I am updating
the KML to load anything that's already
been placed in the blob storage onto the
map because the map doesn't know that
you know the last user had 15km ELLs and
or there are 15km ELLs and somebody
uploaded another one so you have to go
ahead and load into new one so let's go
ahead and look at the update KML
function in the update KML function it's
really simple I'm retrieving a list of
blobs tying those to the list of files
I'm iterating through each one and
getting the URI for each one and passing
that through a JavaScript function that
actually places the KML on the big map
it's a very cool function to be able to
pass back and forth between c-sharp and
JavaScript which is running on the page
in real time so let's go ahead and hit
run and see what this looks like
so we have it up here running you can
see that I've got a file chooser from
the hit choose file Wi-Fi KML go ahead
and open that upload it's going to take
a second this is going to refresh from
the upload then you know as you said the
JavaScript the c-sharp is calling the
JavaScript to load another map and there
we have it the KML file and every KML
that's been loaded into the system since
this
was turned on has been on it was in this
map in our case it's only one because I
just started this so that's it it was
just that easy to get a full project off
the ground and it's in the cloud so you
don't have to worry about it so if you
have a hundred and fifty users or you
have you know ten users the system will
scale as always you can follow me on
Twitter at Applebaum and this source
code will be up in the show notes so I'd
love to see what you guys have you know
to add to it so email me Jason hack five
org I want to take a moment to thank our
wonderful sponsor Windows Azure as you
know they are the cloud platform for
developers that lets you focus on
building and running apps instead of
infrastructure it has scalable
pay-as-you-go capacity meaning
developers don't have to wait to develop
get faster speed to market and to
generate and meet immediate demand only
rent what you need when you need it it's
a rich platform with built in
connectivity and development tools
meaning you can focus on business logic
and get a head start on time to market
flexible development gives you the
ability to run on Windows Azure on your
own systems with Windows Azure burst
capacity you can deploy with confidence
running your apps where and when it
makes sense without have to worry about
overwhelming systems to learn more about
everything you need to start developing
with Windows Azure check out wwm I Chris
Ofcom / cloud / Windows Azure
all right Shannon it's time for
technicals photo of the week we do have
Chris from Denver sends in an awesome
photo of his case rig or case free brick
I guess I should say it's made out of
lasers lit up with lasers and it's built
out of Plexiglas I love places yeah it's
super cool lit up with like all the
bright neon colors wall-mounted so you
guys up you guess it's not grillak and
like a laser cutter that's kind of
expensive oh is it good you can make
some really sexy stuff well if you guys
have photos you can always send them
over to feedback at hak5 org and it's
time for the trivia yes the trivia oh
you are so excited oh it's really good
last week's trivia question was the CCC
was peripherally involved in the first
cyber espionage case to make
international headlines at would year
and the answer 1989 the CCC of course
being the Chaos Computer Club oh yeah
which lung yes they're good and uh yeah
dude I didn't realize this that they've
been around since September of 1981 Wow
it's like two years before I was born
that's like four years before I was born
look at me I can do that yeah
all right this week's question is
Phoenix anthrax and leech we're three
computer viruses written by what author
and you can sir over at hack five dark
slash trivia and win some sweet swag
yeah I wonder what kind of swag we
should give them this week it could be a
network throwing star maybe or it could
be this rubber ducky keychain or some of
the plastic things that we get from
kinder eggs I love toys or gift
certificates do that shop anyway thank
you guys so much we really appreciate
