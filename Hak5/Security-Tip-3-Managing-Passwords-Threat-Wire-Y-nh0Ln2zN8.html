cracked up to be this time on threat
liar last time I talked about why it's
important to have good unique passwords
for every service but honestly how is
that humanly possible let's take a look
at some of the ways to generate good
passwords and remember them and some are
going to be very quick to point out that
if you use say password manager it'll
both generate strong unique passwords
for you and store them so that you don't
need to remember them which is kind of
fantastic I guess I mean some people are
very fond of password managers I may
know a few people around this office in
particular who are quite adamant about
how great they are so I'll toss out a
few LastPass one password roboform the
basic premise is that the password
manager is software that acts as a
database of your passwords making it
convenient to both come up with secure
passwords and also to use them a lot of
times they integrate with your browser
and make it really simple to type them
in and things of that nature and the
idea is that it's encrypted with a
single master password so you still need
a unique and strong password but you
only need to remember one and personally
I am not a fan of these services most of
proprietary and sync with the cloud in
one fashion or another last passed last
year was hacked it's a very popular
password manager and that compromised
email addresses password reminders and
auth hashes and that right there is just
one indication of why I don't trust
third parties with my data but I'm sure
there's nothing wrong with the
encryption implementation of these
proprietary services I mean to my
knowledge they're using industry
standards but the idea of syncing such
valuable data with a third-party just
kind of gives me chills that said there
is a good open-source alternative that
doesn't necessarily have to sync with
the cloud keepass it's an open source
password manager which stores the
encrypted volume locally on your device
and not necessarily up in the cloud it's
primarily for Windows but being open
source there are many cross-platform
ports for other operating systems
everything from Android and iOS to linux
and OS 10 it uses AES as well as to fish
to store the password database and
that's you know there's a really good
industry standard encryption methods and
there's a has a number of conveniences
and other niceties like auto typing and
multi-user support and plugins and stuff
so with all that I'm just saying that
I'm still not completely sold on the
concept of a password manager even one
that locally stores it an open source
however I will admit that I've been
known to keep a few bits of sensitive
data in simple text files encrypting
them with a symmetric key using
something like gpg that's the open
source implementation of PGP it's an
industry standard it's the same crypto
tool that we use for intend email
encryption so I wouldn't really mind if
such a file were synced with a service
like Dropbox for instance up in the
cloud as it were but just me personally
that's the kind of Avenue that I tend to
go towards which is just something
simple little encrypted text file with
the same tools that many eyeballs have
been on for years and years now gpg
being you know quite established but I
guess it really comes down to your
paranoia level and I'm sure that for
most people the conveniences of even a
proprietary cloud syncing password
manager well probably outweighs the
negatives of bad passwords and password
reuse it's just not for me now next time
I am going to share my tips on creating
rememberable unique and good long
passwords without using a database at
all just using the good old-fashioned
noggin and no it's not correct horse
battery staple but i do want to know
what what do you use to use a password
manager do you the old-fashioned noggin
let me know in the comments and with
that i'm darren kitchen i'll see you on
the Internet
