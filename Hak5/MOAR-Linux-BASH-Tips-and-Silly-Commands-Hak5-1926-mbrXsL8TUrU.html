favorite terminal tips this time on hack
5
hello mocha hak5 my name is Darren
kitchen
it's your weekly dose of Technol us and
I am so excited why because as you know
last week yes an act 5 yes we looked at
some of our favorite vash tips we did
and today we're going to follow up on
some of our more fun special terminal
happiness starting with something near
and dear to my heart check this out this
is so exciting ok I am going to show you
ways that we can build on what we've
done before using an amazing website
called virtual hacker which has nothing
to do with hacker typer but that's
amazing - which is actually host to a
paste bin you ever use that any of those
paste bin prep programs like what's your
favorite paste been paste bin there's a
million of them anyway hey the this is
really fun this one you don't access
over the web you access it over netcat
which is cool because you got you know
cats and it's important 9 9 9 9 and
what's really neat about this is that
anything you send to virtual hacker net
on port 9999 will be saved and you'll
get a URL back a very short URL in fact
that you can use to share with your
friends on social media like so that's
where I can type all my passwords to
share with my husband
yes Shannon you can it's all in plain
text so it's so much fun
I'll give you an example here so if I
wanted to I could just echo snobs is
snubs derpy alter-ego as everybody knows
and if I pipe that to netcat to virtual
hacker dotnet on port 9999 check that
out this is what it gives me back and I
can now use this to share it with
Twitter the whole interwebs about how
you're derpy alter-ego works which which
is pretty fantastic
you asked me I think it's pretty good I
think what you don't tell them about the
Smurfs I think Shannon everybody knows
about this nerves nobody was supposed to
know about this nerve how could they not
know they tune in every week who do you
think they're anyway so he's fantastic
that we can get this
but I feel like let's make this example
even better we can do that if we follow
up on like what miss Swann did last week
with the fortune we can take for
instance fortune cow say actually I'll
just do this
to recap fortune cow say ha ha ha you
get a fortune and cow a ski cow speak it
which is fantastic
well if we wanted to we could take that
same thing and pipe it to netcat virtual
hacker net nine nine nine nine okay boom
and now I have a URL I can select that
URL I can copy it I can even open that
link and it'll pop up Chrome and there
we go you are always busy Wow
you know me so well yester a ski cow
this is fantastic so have URL I can
paste every word it's it's happy good
times and this is awesome because you
know I can send this wonderfully
insightful portion over to Shannon
except the only unfortunate part is I
can't in fact see what the link is as
you saw it gives me just the link but it
doesn't show me the fortune can you fix
that I can which well the easiest way
are not easiest way but the silly stupid
way would be to just download it again
and I can actually do that with curl
tack L so that it'll follow forwarding
and then just paste in this URL so the
right-click and say copy link address
paste that boom and it downloads it and
there we go you are always busy okay
okay but you know what would be better
Shannon if we used some tea I love tea
yeah I have some right here
no Shannon the tea command camomile no I
don't want that tea that to his hip and
fancy pink stuff but you really want
some skullcap right before bed but
anyway and some valerian and some
melatonin in some anyway maybe he's not
withstanding I think tea is a fantastic
thing to talk about because it takes
direction it actually do to do to it
doesn't really do much all on its own
okay but it uses the fun
thing of redirection of standard output
into so you know how we like pipe
something yeah so if I pipe echo hello
world to netcat on virtual hacker port
999 what I'm doing is I'm taking the
output of that echo command and it's
going into the input of the netcat
command so this allows you to do that
but also at the same time it's kind of
like up like a thing and though you know
what the trains they're the T in the
traffic yeah and so the train goes both
ways though and part of it goes to
netcat as standard input and then the
other part goes into a file cool so
that's really useful if we want to see
for instance on our regular terminal you
know which is by default showing is the
standard output of all of our commands
and in addition go into a file so for
instance we could do this I could
fortune cow say and then pipe that to T
and I'm gonna specify where to save it
I'm gonna put it in TMP slash cow
because why not and like we talked about
two weeks ago amp amp is very similar to
doing semicolon which is how you string
multiple commands together what this is
saying is all right on the same line I'm
gonna give you another command but don't
run it until this one finishes so once
this command finishes running and it's
successful then it's gonna run the next
thing that I tell it which is going to
be two cat /tmp slash cow what's up with
like Linux commands being named anyway
wine cats T and that cats let us know in
the comments your favorite so I'm gonna
cat that file though which is going to
which if I did this just on its own
would display it on the screen but the
standard output of that I'm gonna pipe
now to netcat virtual hacker net on port
nine nine nine nine okay so now I get to
see it which is a classic is something
that everyone wants to have read but
nobody wants to read well thank you very
arcane yes but I also get the URL in
addition to that which is pretty cool
that's that's that could be so and I
think it is I think it is a fantastic
use of the T command I think it's a good
example
kind of you know building on what we
learned and taking it all together and
so now you know to make this even better
because that's the beauty of Linux is
were always going to make a ring better
right is we're actually going to you
know instead of wasting time typing in
netcat to virtual hacker net all over
those times we're gonna add an alias
which I do believe you yes I thought you
were gonna tell me that you love the
show alias from the 1990s which was
pretty good too
you've done this on active but let me
show you a quick and easy way to add an
alias to your bat batch RC file and
actually I've already added this one so
I'll just do it again and hope that
doesn't break anything so if I echo I'm
gonna put this I'm gonna echo alias and
in this case I'm gonna say well you know
I'm gonna say TN because I've already
done T be equals and then the command so
this is going to be what it's going to
you know reduce this down to so whenever
I type TB n it's actually going to write
T slash temp slash cow amp amp cat slash
temp slash cow pipe to netcat at virtual
hacker net port nine nine nine nine okay
and then end that single quote and what
will happen is I can then actually end
the double quotes then and the single
quote then reader then redirect that
with two walkers by the way make sure
you use two wackos the point of that is
if you only use one Walker
it's gonna overwrite the file and
replace it with this line because to
walk is gonna add it to the end of the
file which we want to do in this case
dot bash RC file is basically your
configuration file for for bash and
we're gonna write that to tilde slash
dot bash RC okay so now all I have to do
is do a source tilde slash dot bash RC
which will reload our bash RC I can
actually see if I do a tail not fail if
I do a tail baylin's probably a command
is paola command no ill is not a command
damn
so tail attack
- tilde slash dot bash RC you can see
these were the last two so I've already
used T B and T n to do the same thing so
what this means now is that if I for
instance do whatever I whatever I pipe
to TB is gonna get replaced with that so
if I do like LS tack la slash and then
now pipe that to TB it's not only going
to show me my directory listing of my
home full of my route that's cool it's
gonna say use netcat which is really
weird because this totally worked before
and TN yes there we go and now I get
that
haha I know at least share that URL you
know I'll be honest though I picked up
what you're putting down over here but
it's what you're really missing is some
legit koi insults your terminal hit me
what you got so if I go into my terminal
and type in sudo LS ask me for my
password I'm gonna type it wrong and it
doesn't do anything just says sorry try
again so I'll do it the right way and
then I get into my LS so then I'm gonna
do sudo vie sudo and I'm gonna add a new
line here that says defaults in souls go
ahead and save that
okay so now I'm going to open up a new
terminal and I'll make this a little bit
bigger for you and I'm gonna do sudo LS
again I'll type in the wrong password
hold it up to the like not a brain
inside I'll type in my password wrong
again let's see if it does the same
thing I think or I think I think I'll go
home alright let's type it in one more
time hey your mind just hasn't been the
same since the electroshock class oh
that's my favorite one oh man that's
terrible this is built-in oh yeah it's
totally built-in all you have to do is
enable it by just going into Vice pseudo
and then saving a new line
without defaults insults we've used vai
pseudo on the show in the past but it's
only been to add users to the pseudo
airs group so they can have root too
that's weird I also love how you have to
do pseudo vie pseudo because yes kind of
meta yeah that is just ridiculous Shin
and you find the the best Linux totally
I know you're trolling and your terminal
winds of berating you for spelling
things wrong well mine already does that
anyway we need what we need is a program
that like if you if you type your
password into if you do too many
misspellings like your other tip about
the misspelling stuff instead of
allowing you to do it just like keep
adding a score and then when your score
gets too high it's like no pseudo for
you you've had enough go to bed you need
to go to sleep now yes
like our monitor with that we're gonna
take a quick break though when we get
back
silly tips in the terminal so stay tuned
when you get that great idea you're
gonna need yourself a great domain and
if you're like Shannon and I you'll love
using domain calm because there's
nothing simpler they have an intuitive
domain discovery system and an easy
checkout process that I get your website
up and online in no time and they've
been supporting hack five for years now
so you can show your support back by
using their coupon code just for us it's
a check a five or hack five drop that in
that check out to save yourself an extra
fifteen percent off or shoot them a
tweet at domain.com and say hey thanks
for supporting hack five when you think
domain names think domain.com are you
being a net cat see that's nerves right
there and that's actually the perfect
lead-in to this next tip which is going
to change your lives no it actually has
nothing to do with net cat but if you
remember from our previous tip or
actually the last command that I sent
over to virtual hacker which was an LS
tech la slash which by the way all that
does is list everything in your root
directory we can make it even fancier
check this out
if you you can pipe anything you want to
this anything at home okay
LS tak la / which you know just gives me
a directory listing boring right if I do
that now and pipe it to lolcat yeah just
makes everything better
that's so cool yes but you know what we
can make even better Wow check this out
I'm gonna do again LS tech la / I'm
gonna pipe it to lolcat but this time
I'm gonna give attack a for anime yes it
does actually here you're right it does
go really slow and they cancel that and
do attack s 100 or attack s 200 oh my
gosh actually with this you can kind of
recreate your your 8086 days but to make
it the most bestest of all sorry I hit
my mic is to do bash piped to lock at
cuz now LS oops whoa LS LS tech l huh no
matter what I do it's going to be in low
although I know that's weird let me
think I think I can break this pretty
easily though trying to think of what
command no of course there wouldn't be
there's a manual for man that was
although that was pretty bad actually it
breaks a lot of things but who cares
cuz it makes them all pretty I don't
care it's canceled yes now that that is
it for today I know we're off the rails
as always but hopefully we brought you
some new fun Linux tips you didn't know
we will be back here real soon doing a
follow up of these with our you know
with our favorite recommendations from
you guys after we do epic drones AG man
which will be so much fun
and then I believe we're also going to
get into some speech-to-text so that's
some fun stuff coming up in season 20
yay I'm going to point that out because
it's very it's just good stuff and you
know who doesn't love a little Linux
everybody actually if you guys hate
Linux and you're like dude get back to
Windows I'll throw up a Windows 98 VM
second edition of course and we'll get
right into it
and of course just a reminder again
we're gonna have rubik's from Metasploit
minute out here as well as sebastian and
darren kitchen obviously they'll be
hosting pen test with hack 5 it's march
through 11th through the 13th
it's totally story-driven hands-on
training so you can get with the
developers and you can learn how to use
all sorts of really cool gadgets pen
test with hak5 dot-com for that seats
are limited yes we can only fit however
many we can actually fit in the
warehouse it's a lot of fun though it's
very story-driven we have a whole lot of
fun with it I hope there are still seats
available by the time this air so that
you can get into it if you want but you
know what if you can't that's cool too
because all of the gear that we provide
in pen test with hack 5 you can grab
yourself including the Wi-Fi pineapple
nano and the tetra and the land turtle
and the USB rubber ducky and all that
other good stuff so we should get more
t-shirts yes I saw that and we have
other I'll tell you about all the fun
apparel that's coming not stop talking
about the coconut I think it's a nuts
though cuz it's got the word nut in it I
mean it's a coconut enough okay anyway
uh-huh I probably was told in the
feedback but we haven't released it yet
so we don't even know we're in the
future sorry but JK shop.com there you
go alright feedback is feedback at hack
5 org that's where you can send us
emails tell us how much we suck or how
much you enjoy the show and you can also
find all of our shows over at hak5 org
and I believe haq5 org slash YouTube
will take you over to the vlogs right it
will take you to a YouTube channel
actually and if you go to our YouTube
channel you scroll down you'll see both
of our vlog e blogs which is lots of fun
because hers has rainbows coming out of
a unicorns but oh and by the way if
you're diggin this show because of
unicorn but statements then you should
definitely give it a like a subscribe a
share and a review on iTunes because it
does go a long way and it's what's been
helping keep the hack
coming for the last ten years be hak5
the hack five it's true
it is thus nurbs knows all about it
okay with no there's no no I make it do
the thing again where's the cat
where's the cat can I can I do you one
last one last favor okay yeah
Oh what I'm try it again
SL yeah that's right you just need to
get yourself an SL TAC L all right with
all of that
one last one just had to make it in
because if you miss type LS you should
know about it I wish that it could go to
200 your office workers know because you
and you set the stupid glove thing with
the spelling stupid chapter anyway we
heard totally off the rails now i'm
darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
trust your techno list I'm gonna make
the train run into you just do your
favourite cat rendition just be silly
