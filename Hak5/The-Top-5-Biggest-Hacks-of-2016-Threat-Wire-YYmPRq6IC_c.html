coming up now on threat wire greetings I
am Shannon Morrison this is threat wire
for Tuesday December 27th 2016 I hope
everyone is enjoying their time off work
if you are still vacationing this is
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
also hope that our patrons over at
patreon.com slash threat wire are
enjoying the perks that we have been
including we will have more in stock for
you in 2017 so thank you for letting us
bring you security news every single
week let's get into our top hacks of
2016 these are rated based on amount of
users effected amount of money stolen or
potential outcomes of the hack number 5
is government agencies during the late
spring the IRS released details on a
hack they believed stole taxpayers
online efile PIN codes from IRS gov a
identity thefts were reported before the
IRS suspended their pen program which
allowed users to login securely to file
their tax paperwork
the attackers successfully stole 100,000
pin codes that they matched up to some
of the previously stolen half a billion
social security numbers with the pin
thieves could target individuals and
further identity theft leading to losses
of funds and major headaches along with
this was the National Security Agency's
loss of several hacking tools that they
used for state-sponsored hacks a group
called shadow brokers released the tools
for sale on the web saying that they
belonged to the NSA's hacking group
called the equation group Edward Snowden
later released documents to the
intercept proving that the documents
were real the NSA also had a mishap with
another contractor who stole internal
documents from the agency and get this
he kept them in his car as well as his
home the contractor was not charged
under the Espionage Act because there
was no proof of him actually sharing the
documents with anyone else
lastly the DNC had several thousand
emails stolen by goose' 42.0 in a story
that is still unfolding some speculate
that this was a Russian sponsored hack
while others say that there is no proof
the evidence is
inconclusive currently so this will be a
story that we continue to follow for the
next year
number four is Adult Friend Finder and
the friend finder Network which was
hacked earlier this year in a breach of
over 400 million email addresses IP
addresses last logins and passwords for
the biggest sex in swinger community
including sites like Adult Friend Finder
com the hack was not the largest for the
year but the release of data from the
network could be disastrous for any
users involved see black mail for
example this hack also showed that
friend finder network was not fully
erasing accounts that were thought to be
deleted as they were still found in the
data the network stored passwords in
plain text or sha-1 both of which are
bad news and 99% of the passwords were
decrypted number three is mute eye and
dine back in September a botnet that
used Internet of Things devices such as
security cameras was the malware behind
a DDoS of a website by Brian Krebs which
was determined to be over 620 gigabits
per second the largest DDoS on record to
hit a site Cribbs account of the attack
swept the news for weeks
afterwards as IOT devices started to be
scrutinized for having default root
logins and terrible terrible security
later another hack using the same botnet
called Mirai targeted a DNS server
company called Dyne in October of 2016
this hack also used IOT devices to
spread and an attack and dine with over
1.2 terabits per second now that one was
the largest on record
deine was able to resolve the DDoS but
not before several popular sites were
taken offline including Twitter Etsy
slack Shopify PayPal Netflix github I
could go on and on and on with this no
one actually knows who started the
attack but this started a discussion
about the future of IOT security number
two is swift banking transactions the
biggest bank heist to happen this year
was through Swift the banking Network
used to enable banking institutions
across the world to send and receive
transactional data securely well it
wasn't as secure as we thought and
attackers were able to use legit Swift
credentials through vulnerabilities in
member banks to send transfers to other
banks that were not
supposed to be the legitimate receiver
the thieves got away with over 81
million USD in this hack which was not
the first time that Swift has been
targeted science pointed to North Korea
and a state-sponsored hackles were not
confirmed and number one on our list
actually changed at the last minute
Yahoo confirmed in mid-december that 1
billion users had their account data
stolen in a hack dating back to 2013 the
data included email addresses names
dates of birth hashed md5 passwords and
more this is the largest hack ever
reported and most likely is compiled of
most if not all accounts with Yahoo
Yahoo is currently trying to be sold to
Verizon for several billion dollars but
with this news Verizon is reviewing
their purchase carefully this is the
second time in 2016 that yahoo has
publicly disclosed a hack the first
being another 500 million accounts back
in October a site I like to check is
have I been pwned calm which shows if
your account was included in any kind of
related hacks as usual make sure that
you don't use the same password across
the Internet
