freedom a new car could cost as little

to fish people using Unicode all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings I
am Shannon Morrison this is throughout
wire for April 25th 2017 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom if you haven't checked
out our patreon yet please do so we have
lots that we want to do for this show
but we can't do it without your support
my next goal is to add a monthly Q&amp;amp;A
exclusively just for our patrons and we
are going to upgrade our threat wire set
super excited about that patreon.com
slash threat wire is the place to
support the show and the link is in the
show notes now first off Internet
freedom we got some news from the
freedom part of our threat wire spectrum
to discuss today first up comes from
Canada it's the Canadian
radio-television and Communications
Commission the CRTC for short they
rolled in favor of net neutrality
stating that quote Internet service
providers should treat data traffic
equally to foster consumer choice
innovation and the free exchange of
ideas that means no preferential
treatment of the big data companies that
can pay the big dollars compared to the
little guys who cannot necessarily
afford it but they have excellent
content like podcasters for example of
Canada's telecom providers tell us in
Bell we're all for preferential
treatment while Rogers was not as
consumers you will receive the same
speeds on all sites that you visit give
or take for server issues in location
obviously as ISPs will not be able to
serve up sites at different speeds
depending on how much they have pocketed
from said sites now down here in the
states we have a little bit of
alternative news we are saying the FCC
get closer and closer to abolishing net
neutrality on April 20th the FCC
approved rolling D regulating business
data services or BDS for short which
allows for affordable access to the
Internet from schools small businesses
libraries Community Program businesses
small gas stations etc etc by
deregulating BDS
price caps on isp service is being
removed to allow for 18 t and verizon to
charge more for these small businesses
yeah they can charge whatever they want
public interest groups such as the
Consumer Federation of America say that
this will drive up costs for consumers
ISP price hike equals more overhead for
a small business which equals higher
consumer end costs for the customer
anything from a library card fee to a
credit card transaction fee could see an
increase with an average increase of
$300 out of consumer pockets per year
according to the Consumer Federation of
America now you may think that's a small
bit why worry although I think $300 is
quite a bit of money when FCC chairman
PI who used to be a Verizon lawyer by
the way argues that price caps aren't
necessarily for markets who have
sufficient competition in which he
includes markets where only one ISP is
at play I don't know how that is
sufficient competition but he thinks it
is a 2016 FCC research studies showed
that 73% of BD s markets are single
broadband provider served a monopoly so
to speak and doun in these monopolies
small businesses pay over charges of 20
billion annually altogether due to no
competition the new elimination of price
caps could increase that by up to 20
billion as well yikes so unless ISPs
choose to use all that new money to
increase their speeds build better
infrastructure and offer better customer
service I really don't see how this is
helping consumers at all researchers at
Chinese firm qihoo 360 and Beijing
created two gadgets that cost $22 total
and make the ability to unlock cars open
their doors and sometimes even drive
away that much easier the new gadgets
dubbed hack key also worked from much
farther away with the researchers who
call themselves Team Unicorn I love your
name by the way claiming to be able to
steal a car from over a thousand feet
away the radius signal gadgets work as a
pair with one researcher holding one
next to a key fob and then the other one
hiding the second one next to the car
the researchers next to the car spoofs
the key signal the car relays a reply
handshake to that radio the radio then
copies it and sends it to the researcher
holding the key fob and the sec
researcher relays that handshake to the
actual keyfob now the key fob replies
with the correct string of digits and
then they bounce that back to the car
and then boom the car unlocks yeah it
sounds simple it looks pretty hard
caveat an attacker wouldn't need to know
which car you are using and where you
are going they would need to be in near
proximity to your key fob so they would
have to follow you to relay the code to
their friends sitting next to your car
the code is d modulated by the two
different devices and it allows for a
long transmission over a much farther
distance the devices work against nxp
key fob ships and the manufacturers
could require a much tighter call in
response between the key fob in the car
to offset the problem and this actually
affects quite a few different cars
alternatively consumers can keep key
fobs in a Faraday bag kind of like I
keep my phone in a bag in a Faraday bag
during DEFCON yeah that's the thing so
they could block any kind of
transmissions going out of the key fob
also don't steal cars
that's really bad karma I don't suggest
it and in case you are wondering no I
have never stolen a car our next story
is about puny code hopefully I'm saying
that correct it is used to represent
Unicode as ASCII characters in host
names whenever you're registering for a
domain name for a new website puny code
also allows you to register with foreign
characters such as kanji for example or
basically anything that is not Latin
since the world is very diverse and
there are foreign characters all over
the place foreign characters do exist
commonly in web domains so popular
browsers leave this as default homograft
attacks can happen whenever ASCII and
Unicode characters are used together in
a domain so for example if somebody used
a Unicode Cyrillic a instead of an ASCII
a window main would be the original
ASCII all ASCII apple.com
which another would be xn - - pppoe 43
decom which browser will then translate
so that it looks like apple calm but the
a is in Cyrillic which is an alphabet
used by Slavic folks which originated
from Greek letters luckily browsers
don't usually fall for these kind of
attacks but if all of the characters are
registered using one languages non-latin
unicode then the browser can get tricked
this flaw was found by researchers
Zutons
apologies for my translation there and
was explained in a detailed blog with a
browser example for Apple in it xn - - a
tak 6 AAA 9 - e dot-com gets translated
to say Apple comm to our human eyeballs
in a different font set by the browser
and it opens up the site obviously it's
not the real Apple comm which means an
attacker could totally fake out even the
most paranoid of users the only way that
I could personally tell difference
between them - was because of the elves
the elves are different in Cyrillic it's
a very simple line while in ASCII the L
has a little tail at the end of it
Jing reported that this bug was reported
to Chrome back in January and it has
been fixed in chrome 58 on March 24th in
Firefox you can enable puny code
translations by going to about colon
config search for puny code and then
change network ID n shope unicode from
false to true so any domains will show
up with the garbled ascii character
translation instead of the originating
pretty unicode others like Safari and
edge don't even support Cyrillic
language flaws so apparently these are
not affected this could be used as a
phishing attack to hide in actual
websites com domain name so if you are
opening a link from your email which of
course I do not recommend at all make
sure you are checking that it's ASCII
not something else thanks again for all
the fine people who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow going completely
independent and totally ad free we now
have an audio-only RSS feed we have
extra content and we have early access
for our patrons we might even feature
your adorable adorbs for babies in an
upcoming episode because they are so
cute I love checking them out every
single time you guys send in pictures
and of course if you cannot donate you
can always hit the subscribe button to
share this episode on your favorite
social media page and use the hashtag
threat wires so that we might see it and
we might even retweet you with that I am
Shannon Morris and I will see you on the
