crashplan well let's see let's see it
let's do some satellite action sure
we'll set up the vegan and give that
over here so this is actually terminal
that the Assad provides and there are
two grades of terminals for megabits or
eight megabits in for making this
consumer grade so you can up uplink for
megabits per second okay and if you go
outside you can actually see the deer
they're all right
yeah pretty big right and you can get HD
signal high quality right away what can
a trooper do you get from that up to 8
megabits we get test two is to begin or
two terminals like this vs our terminals
and you can get 60 minutes for
reliability one wow that's a lot right
so as soon as we plug in the the began
is it just going to show up in the
interface as a new device and that
you're using it again is actually a
network connection with me okay please
begin we actually only one company that
allows you to control begin directly
from the unit so the Inmarsat satellites
in merced satellites usually what people
do is they have to have mac notebook to
connect to the unit and then control
unit or pc notebook what we incorporated
inside the linux via that support will
begin ourselves oh so you're saying that
you don't just take the IP out of the
ethernet coming out of the terminal but
you're actually devising some sort of a
modem for this right so on began the way
began IP rates it's 80 comments it's
like a model yes there's a case like
back in the day right so you have to
actually establish session to the TCP
session to terminal send ad commands
dialog right dial up and you know say if
I register it or not detectives yeah and
then it appears on interface what the
signal strength is sounds we can if you
don't do it
you don't get the signal strength
exactly right right all data and also as
critical is that for many companies it's
a PM base so you have to enter a PM in
order to be right there access point 30
so it's actually very similar to a
cellular network in that case in fact
these big and terminals even take sim
cards correct yeah exactly it's same yes
just a bird in the sky yeah yes that's
the whole concept is so off the began
terminal some have a why wireless
capabilities we just plugged in via the
ethernet you can either come in off a
dog like this to the USB port or you can
you could simply plug this in where we
have the other satellite technology
coming in here just uh through the
ethernet port well they do thi just
connect at all okay so now we're not
using any of the modems and you're only
using the satellites right and I
actually we can build connect on a
second back to see how it works okay so
but right now we have video from this
camera over the satellite right it's
going on so this is the quality of the
video right oh wow yeah I said the
little hider liability so sure but I
mean the frame rate is fine you know is
a standard def uh actually it's then can
a guy 1080i off satellite wow that's
really good yeah dis kinda streaming and
I disconnected all cards all 3g cards on
purpose so we couldn't use vs out only
but we could go back when you're getting
two three yeah Betty outside yeah it's
Anika just depending on weather
conditions okay that's cool yeah I could
push higher but sometimes you want to
kind of be less greedy and give less
bandwidth so it does not affect each
quality much ok but so as soon as we
turn on some additional modems though
just put your all right just get better
right so what we'll do this all the cars
we also have I could get and reconnect
them just
of our test and it should immediately
start crowd wendys to those cards
because they employ latency oh I see one
of these cars is 80 90 100 kilobytes per
second is already 200 this one's about
to mega bet right right and these are
the different you know yes the ECP dry
eppp too so wasted AT&amp;amp;T Verizon it will
show up eventually OIC like to entertain
in here it shows latency on if you had
seven hundred seconds on age 18 nike
milliseconds so it goes that path
because much low latency so whatever so
whatever path as the least latency it's
going to take right so this is kind of
the same idea around this entire box and
this entire camera except you can
implant a an iphone and what is nice
about iphone it could actually bond to
network connections so you can use both
Wi-Fi and the 3g 4g connection so say my
fine AT&amp;amp;T and verizon on there ose we
need to bond bits will bond them
together so since your iphone is rightly
TT right since you're my files on
verizon you now have to know exactly to
bond and the quote of the camera is
really high you know I mean sufficient
right right I mean that's what I use for
my video blog right right and the beauty
of it is again same low latency and hmm
you can share email Facebook Twitter you
can share with your friends right away
and will tell so shows right now we send
him back to green coat with h.264 so now
you can do
any iOS device as well not on and this
video you can put on air right away on
fox news on CNN because if if you
specify sent to CNN they could see it
and they could put it right in there
from my phone right so this is this is
basically taking the power of like the
ustream and they can the consumer grade
live streaming and putting it into the
broadcast standards right and
broadcasters already have accounts to
access the service and proud it on the
air for example remember storm chasers
giga gone but on the iPhones was there
they streaming and click on the arrow
right away cool yeah so and same
technology available on Android as well
so now he pick up directly with our
vacation iphone to iphone so now on your
phone you get same video right so this
is really he's sending over the cloud
and back that's cool so what we have
there is cloud servers in different
countries in yes in australia in japan
in singapore in europe series get a
local connection so yeah so wherever you
are we stream it to close x server and
then you can route it anywhere you want
in this case you're out to his iphone i
could also draw the web streaming
service it is it here too right or you
can get embedded code embed in your web
page and broadcasts same signal from
iphone fame on to see that's cool see so
high is the immediate sharing video
right and now it's on amazon netbook
available multiple countries so
reliability and quality of service
around the globe right now this is so
this rig right here takes advantage of
the mobile application right so the same
mobile application you use here and the
advantage is that you have high-quality
lenses connected so what do you mean
high quality lenses so right you can add
additional lenses or whatever you want
comparing to what's building inside the
camera so it could be fish eye or you
know yeah telephone and did they say you
can add cannon as well
brownies yeah you cannot carry SL dsl
and gears our lives wow really that's
the DSLR lenses on a phone and like this
yeah you could out light and it's much
heavier on purpose so it's actually most
steady when you move that's cool and
here you can add tripod sure so the
entire rig though is the phone like
correct from capture to delivery right
and one divided right that's cool and we
also provides service called ivy you can
connect headphone back and you can talk
with the studio oh wow without cell
connection so it's just only over our
internal network that's cool so so as it
can person you already you're right you
know the yeah it's gotta be yeah I am
familiar with that in the studio just
not right side socket so all are you see
it has IV iPhones cuz I be Android as I
be secretive talk back using your beards
yeah that's cool your backup should be
private like really private none of
those bogus we store your private key in
the cloud or and that nonsense recently
with like oh yeah we just put it in a
backdoor for all the unencrypted stuff
for the fun guys yeah I'm sorry no thank
you what I'm talking about you know and
we've been talking about a hack 5 for a
while now is you know securing your
stuff before it hits the cloud I'm
personally a huge fan and a customer of
our newest sponsor crashplan and I love
it because they get it you see they've
got a free client for Windows Mac Linux
even Solaris and get this you can bring
your very own blowfish key you know the
open-source cypher from bruce schneier
so you none of your stuff ever touches
the network without first being
encrypted and not only can you use the
free client to back up to your own
external hard drive for free but there's
you know off-site storage stuff is truly
unlimited i know because i have like
terabytes up there and so as hackers and
as geeks his eyes IT professionals we
know the importance of off-site backups
and as a hack five you or get this we
are getting a huge hook up a very
special hook up from now until July
thirty-first 2013 to get this is huge a
one-year on
limited plan normally starts at 59 99 a
year but get this the special page over
at crashplan calm / hack it up I'm going
to get twenty percent off that's like
unlimited backups for a year for less
than four bucks a month it's huge so
it's never too soon to back it up so I
highly encourage you guys to take
advantage of this July only offer head
over to crash clang calm / hack it up
this week's technol s photo of the week
is from neo who sends us a couple of
photos of his setup he hooked up a whole
bunch of monitors via displaylink
converters to an old XPS 15 laptop and
it worked so you can send over your
photos to feedback hak5 org feedback at
hak5 org with the subject line technol
us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
