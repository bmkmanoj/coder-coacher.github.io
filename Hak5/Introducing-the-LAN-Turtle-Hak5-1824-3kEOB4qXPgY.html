site-to-site VPN with Open VPN access
server all that and more this time on
hack 5 this episode of hack 5 is brought
to you by domain.com hello welcome to
hack 5 my name is darren kitchen hey
y'all I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose techno last
welcome I'm so excited to be back this
is going to be an epic show
I am super super excited a welcome back
welcome back I'm hoping that you are
well rested from your little vacation in
North Carolina I believe I am still on
vacation but I'm here and I'm ready to
work all right well I'm excited because
we're gonna do two really fun things
today first of all we're going to debut
the latest addition to the hak5 family
of pen test insisted men gear the land
turtle and we're also going to be doing
some really cool things with openvpn to
bridge discrete networks and what's
called a site-to-site VPN oh yeah I
watched your episode last week and that
was pretty cool where you did one from
external
so now that we have an open VPN server
set up in the cloud let's go a step
further this is really cool let's just
check out the demo ok so I have set up
essentially here a remote access kind of
demo in that I'm not here it looks like
I'm here at the warehouse now your other
where you're really on vacation in
Tahiti right so being on vacation in
Tahiti I want to have access to all of
the wonderful things that we have here
on the hak5 warehouse land like our
Synology Nass and all of the other you
know interesting things I want to be
able to print to the network printers
and all of that stuff right well to do
that we're going to do a little site to
site and actually here if I check out my
laptop right here and do an if config
wlan0 I'm actually not on the hack 5 LAN
here I'm on a 10-1 10 something network
I've got this IP address here and the
reason being you'll see I'm I'm
connected to pen test with hack 5 okay
we have a couple of lands here right ok
so that's your external network and if
that one's also secure right yeah the
idea being uh since we have four
different cable modems because of
esoteric reasons I can simulate this
quite easily otherwise I would tether to
my phone but essentially I am NOT on the
same land as
little friend of ours that we'll see
here in a moment but I want to have
access to all the things normally on the
hak5
land which is a 1070 3.31 okay 73 31
being leaked back so you have to be able
to log in somehow well usually I would
just use SSH or something like that
right right but I don't say pretend I
don't have access to I don't know port
forward port 22 to something inside the
land okay
right it's really easy to get out of a
network it's hard to come in yeah so
what we're going to do is actually come
in through a client that's also on the
land you'll see here I'm just a sec
basically I'm going to what happens if
you're peeing our network in here right
now
okay so yeah so as you can see all right
ping 70 1070 331 1 that's our router and
I'm not getting any ping replies right
ok ok and I can see that because if I
issue route I don't have let me make
this a little bit there I don't have a
route to anywhere on a 1070 331 Network
right so let's get one so remember we
have an open VPN server up in the cloud
so I'm now going to dial into that open
VPN server we've talked about ways to do
it in Windows I'm now going to show you
in Linux it's really simple you download
your VPN file and then you just issue
this command so sudo Open VPN give it -
- config and then in this case I named
it frog that would be a VPN because
frogs feelin froggy today so go ahead
and dial in and it'll say initialization
sequence completed there's also
something else interesting here look at
this route add 10 73 31 what if I run
that route command again you see I have
a lot a tons more routes and at 10 73 31
route which is going through the VPN so
wait a second let's see let's run that
ping command again and your boom replace
ok so I am now in Tahiti but you're
really in our network through a client
through client that's the interesting
thing because I haven't actually set up
the Open VPN server here at the
warehouse I set it up on a virtual
serve her up in the cloud that's weird
yeah how does that work well essentially
we have a client that is acting as
what's called a VPN gateway and I'll
show you what that looks like in the
config here let me minimize this and
just as before we come over here to this
is our the Open VPN access server
administration interface that we should
be familiar with by now and just as
before we've created user but this user
your turtle I've added a few extra
things namely this check mark right here
configure VPN gateway I did that to
allow the client to act as a VPN gateway
for these client subnets and in this
case the hak5 warehouse 1070 331 ok so
now the land turtle is acting as a
gateway even though it's only a client
to this server again it's easy to get
out hard to get back in but with the
land turtle setup in this configuration
I now get access to so so it's kind of
like you're really friendly roommate who
ends up bringing everybody over to the
party and allows them in your house I
think I know the story that you're
referencing and you're giving this this
wonderful person a lot more credit than
they argue yes it's like that
promiscuous roommate you had so there we
go in fact actually here it is this is
actually it total total and here we go
we can totally see right there this
right here is the land turtle well but
it just looks like a little Ethernet
adapter well it is it even says USB
Ethernet adapter and actually works just
like one you can we had in the pen test
with act 5 class that we did and and we
debuted this kind of like in beta
getting amazing feedback wave people
going around rotating from you know
doing the the Wi-Fi pineapple class was
sub and doing the Metasploit class with
mu bik's and then i were just doing
social engineering with USB rubber ducky
and land turtle right students were
coming by and I'd be like ok so and we
gave them a big hacker satchel full of
our gear right and I was like ok so
break out your land turtle and people in
this guy's like looking through his
values like what's the land turtle
I hadn't told anyone I'm like the thing
plugged into your computer and he's like
what I'm like you know and he's like you
mean the USB Ethernet adapter you guys
provided us cuz he's like aw honey he's
like one on these one of these newer
laptops that doesn't have Ethernet
built-in anymore so he's like yeah I was
totally just using it in muak sis class
I didn't get the same ip address as
everybody else but I was able to ping
all the networks and stuff I needed so I
didn't think anything of it I'm like
have you tried SSA Ching and tear USB
yeah so it's really similar to the Wi-Fi
pineapple in the USB rubber ducky and
that it's very inconspicuous that's the
whole idea I think it really nicely
complements some of the other pen tests
and system and gear notably the Wi-Fi
pineapple the USB rubber ducky
it actually borrows from both their
playbooks because the the USB rubber
ducky if you're familiar the little
keystroke injection guy looks just like
a regular thumb drive so it's
inconspicuous and it's also really easy
to write and deploy payloads for it has
already just written a note pad yeah so
it's kind of like that same ease of use
in covert nests and then also just the
ridiculous power and versatility of the
Wi-Fi pineapple and like I said it's
actually it is a USB Ethernet adapter
you can use in fact you can find one
that looks exactly like this off the
shelf so you know if anybody looked at
this you know smells like USB Ethernet
adapter yeah it tastes like a to him see
they're stopped there you go oh no but
we are selling them at hack shop calm
right now as well as at the booth at
DEFCON so I can't wait to see you guys
and really dig into this it's not just
about the case and how its competitive
and inconspicuous it looks no it's also
because it's really powerful on the
inside - right right it's running Linux
because we love Linux and it's got this
distribution packed with some awesome
software for penetration testers systems
administrators you know tech enthusiasts
you want to just have access to your
house um in essence it is a tool a
covert tool for remote access network
scanning and man-in-the-middle so do
something like a DNS spoof you could do
DNS poof URL so for all the other in
fact it physically becomes the man in
the middle in that case that's so cool
kind of ridiculous um alright so how
does it work
okay so let's here I'm gonna go ahead
and get this guy booting up
with your handy-dandy USB adapter there
we go
so I'm going to plug that into my
machine and we'll we'll take a look at
the admin interface but essentially like
I said similar to the USB rubber ducky
they program with ducky scripts this is
all about and actually very similar to
Wi-Fi pineapple with what we call the
infusions the land turtle is all about
these open-source turtle modules and
they do a number of things you know
mainly it excels at remote access men in
the middle and network reconnaissance it
can do so much more people could write
their own right because it's open source
there you go it's up on github actually
so you can go ahead and create modules
and then share those with community
that's really what our emphasis has
always been USB switchblade USB rubber
ducky Wi-Fi pineapple it's about
creating a platform that people can
collaborate on and fruit and get
creative with right there's I've alive
written 17 modules for this but I'm sure
there'll be many more written here soon
I'm sure and the idea is that it's set
and forget the idea is that you you
configure it to your liking to do things
like open VPN or Auto SSH so that you
always have a shell if you can do with
netcat if you really want and then you
just leave it on whatever network you
want and you can just walk away and is
it whatever you need yeah one of my
favorite things to do since I've been
really getting into Metasploit you know
especially with Moo bik's is epic show
Metasploit minute
I love meterpreter now so the idea that
I can configure the meterpreter module
in here and then just like OOP drop it
on a land somewhere pretty awesome and
have it integrate with Metasploit
wherever I am that's kind of epic
alright so since it is set and forget
one of the things we did was to keep it
simple as simple as possible but no
simpler we created this little thing
that we like to call the turtle shell so
managing the entire thing is done over
SSH so I'll just go ahead and SSH into
my land turtle and this is the turtle
shell it's adorable I know the cute
check this out okay so how does this
work well basically it's a little gooey
its graphical user interface and it
should be very familiar in fact if
anybody's installed Linux yeah in fact
as just two weeks ago we were installing
Ubuntu
it's basically and actually the
XenServer use the same install it it's
this front end for what's called M
curses it allows you to make graphical
things in the shell it's pretty cool and
and check it out you can just you know
navigate it like this I'm going to go to
modules because this is where the real
turtle power lies in these open source
modules now on this one I only have two
modules right now the OpenVPN module and
module manager I'm going to go ahead and
open up module manager and check out the
directory which connects to LAN
turtlecom and these are all just a shift
button is your friend right so I'm just
going to check the boxes next to all of
these all of those epoch modules and go
ahead and hit OK and it's going to
download them over-the-air right over to
the land turtle pool its installed those
so now I can just go back and go back
and if I look at my module listing now
check this out Auto SSH DNS spoofing I
can do meterpreter netcat and maps
OpenVPN ping tunnel you know I can set
up scripts to do you know to run scripts
and give you the output by email or HTTP
sshfs and URL snarf just to name a few
and so this is pretty cool because you
can you can just drop this on the land
you've pre-configured it over SSH and
now whenever you drop it is going to run
whatever you want you enable the SSH
service it's going to run on boot it's
really exciting it's super super super
simple so explain how it is networked
and how it's being powered I guess I
would say ok so this one right now that
I'm logged into is powered over my
laptop and I'm connected to it and I got
an IP address from it in the 172 1684
range and as you can see here it's also
plugged into Ethernet internet and that
means that it has access to the land so
this side its power but it also gives
the computer an IP address so if you
plug this into a Windows machine it's
going to install the drivers and show up
as you generic USB Ethernet adapter and
it's going to give that computer an IP
address likewise if you then unplug the
ethernet cable that's going into that
box and plug it into here
this side is going to obtain an IP
address from the network you plugged
into thus making it a man-in-the-middle
ah that's really cool so what about like
if you have to set a static IP okay
under config same thing you go to change
your way in IP address and you can go
ahead and set up static I'll show you
the little MAC address changing as well
awesome okay so if I have a whole bunch
of Dell computers or something I could
just set it up to look like it oh that's
a good point yeah so if you're like if
you walk into a shop and you're like hi
everybody here's got Lenovo you can make
it look like annalen elbow to be a lot
of fun we are really only scratching the
surface and I want to point out that we
have a ton of these over video tutorials
in fact that we've just done over at
lanter ttle comm check this out where
I'm very excited about this as you can
tell great chess I've been website bio
thank you
yeah can you can you tell who's whose
heels those are anyway that's the idea
actually I love this photo just because
it really emphasizes yes um and I really
want to point out that I've done a lot
of work we've been working on this since
probably before February at least and
pulling ridiculous hours to make this
happen because similar to Wi-Fi
pineapple and the and the USB rubber
ducky which have you know out of they'd
have what you know articles and and
videos and all of that stuff I've done
that and those have naturally evolved
this is like out of the gate all that
information is here there are there's
land turtle basics from 101 to 107
everything between DNS spoofing and URL
snarfing ssh file systems and setting up
as auto SSA to meterpreter and said and
all of the modules on how to get this
thing going so I'm just very excited I'm
excited to well I have to say thank you
to you personally Darren for teaching us
how to use this at the pen test with
hack 5 training seminars cuz that was a
lot of fun and we solved a whole bunch
of questions that I had about the land
turtle and it's just such an interesting
experience to have our own hardware well
I have to actually fail congratulate
well thank you but I actually have to
thank a lot of people that came to pen
test with hack 5 saw it and gave us some
amazing
feedbacks I'm like oh well what if you
could do this and then those became
features and that's why this is really
exciting to be launching a new
open-source project like this with the
open source turtle modules where anyone
can you know write them and see there's
only four functions the API is that
simple you can write them in bash Python
PHP whatever and I mean you need to
start a stop at status and a configure
that did so anyway we're just scratching
the surface but very simple to write for
I can't wait to see the community
contributions over on the forums over on
the github over on the wiki yeah it's a
really exciting time to be and it's a
take a shop comm if you want to grab
your own and we're also going to be at
Def Con yes we have lots of fun
happening at Def Con yes I um well come
by and get the get the book a lot of
work into the book too yes very exciting
um yeah let's take a quick break and
then we'll talk about some Def Con good
stuff cuz I hear that there might be
cake domain.com and dock club came to
hack five with a great idea build a club
all about learning stuff making things
and having fun and so we did just that
and man what a brilliant idea we
recently hosted our very first ever open
house at the hak5 warehouse and with the
help of domain.com and dot club we put
on a mini LAN party micro drone obstacle
course 3d print fest quadcopter race and
killer barbecue and I must say these
guys get it the internet and hacker
culture in particular it's all about
fostering community from BBS's to phyto
net to IRC it's all about coming
together and having fun and what better
domain to do it than a doc club it's
perfect because the doc club is
universally and globally understood not
just here in the United States so if
you're building a new business or naming
your startup consider a da club as the
ultimate social domain join us in the
San Francisco Bay Area for workshops and
projects and crazy indoor quadcopter
races at our very own club hack house
club then head over to domain.com slash
club to register your club today there
are only $9.99 a year and there are
thousands of awesome options still
available make
to use the coupon code hak5 to save 15%
and let the guys over at domain.com know
we sent you so when you think domain
names think domain.com so I hear there's
going to be cake yes the cake is indeed
not a lie if you're going to be at
DEFCON in fact right before DEFCON
there's another amazing conference and
no I'm not talking about blackhat I'm
actually talking about besides Las Vegas
yes you've never been to a besides you
absolutely should go they're affordable
they're fun they're ridiculously crazy
mayhem is happening and this August 5th
ah just so happens to be the same date
as actually I talked that Sebastian and
I are giving on Whitechapel food not to
get arrested on the Golden Gate Bridge
but that's a different story
and and and her birthday that's 5 10
year celebration years so we contacted
banshee they're having a pool party
we're going to be they're having so much
fun and she invited us to have bring
cake so we've got like cake for like 500
peoples come on down I yeah it's it's at
the Tuscany it's like I can't stress how
affordable and awesome it is so get out
a day early come out to this it's going
to be so much fun so many great talks
and just pull bite of a ham and our hack
five ten year anniversary birthday thank
you so much besides guys for hosting us
we're so so so excited to be part of
this community I can't tell you how
blessed I am personally I wrote a little
not a foreword or whatever anyway just I
don't get sappy now I'm just so happy
and so proud um so thank you thank you
for your feedback as well feedback at
hak5 org that's where you can let us
know and also all the comments cuz we
have some great discussions last week
amazing discussion how your people love
some PF sense maybe we should start
getting into some some open source
router configs and things yes that's a
great idea we shine machines and routers
yeah go well together that's a great
idea yes and of course hak5 dot org
slash follow is the last site that I'm
gonna pimp today and that's because
that's where you can go to find out what
events were going to wear you can follow
us on social me
and stuff and stuff like yes you can
find out about the booths that we're
gonna have at DEFCON you won't miss a
giant pineapple anyway with all of that
said H a K shop comm is where you can
find the land turtle as well as land
turtlecom I can't wait to see you guys
feedback we are so excited to be
bringing this to you in fact a few days
early this week with all of that I'm
Darrin kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
trust your techno list bye
we can see the show you made a little
turtle cowabunga I liked it Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
