5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are checking
out mal Tico's graphing options yeah you
fun now there are many ways to choose to
see your new graphs so say you've
already created one so far I've only
shown you one way to display a graph and
then multigo GUI but you can change it
if you want
yay you can make it look pretty so so
far we've only shown you one way to show
your graph and honestly it's good kind
of janky so we have other options each
and every single graph that you create
will be listed in the main window
selected on top and when you say that
name is obviously going to change to
your brand new name instead of just
being new graph or whatever it says at
the beginning now my free version that I
have downloaded of melty go I also have
several different ways to view the same
graph I have my main view bubble and
entity list I really like bubble because
it's a fun word to say the main view is
the one that we have been using
previously so this one shows you
basically a drop-down so it's kind of
look like a tree if you want to the
bubble view lets you view a graph with a
whole bunch of little round bubbles
instead of the normal icons it'll also
be kind of circular so if we take a look
at my screen first I have up here the
main view so this one has a whole bunch
of different trees I like to call them
trees because that's what they look like
and then we have bubble view so this one
is a little bit crazy it's kind of out
there but I can also change the views a
little bit so you can see them each one
has a little bubble and I can make it
very circular if I want to and then last
off we have this one called the entity
list which basically lists all of your
different entities that are in your
graph very very easy to use and you can
sort that one depending on the name of
the node the type the value etc etc now
each of the views lets you change the
way the graph is displayed as well as
different layouts so for example the
main and bubble view show
much the same views if I go back to the
main view I have a couple of different
options on your hair I have the first
one which we've seen already I have the
graph tree which looks more like a tree
and then I have the pyramid which more
looks more like a genealogical family
type tree thing going on so you have all
those different options you have also
have these circular versions as well now
you will notice with a lot of these that
it's very hard to see what in the world
is going on with this so what I would do
is go back to my investigate tab and
either zoom to vit zoom 100% or whatever
I feel is best for the nature of that
graph so for this one I would probably
choose this version of the graph and
then zoom into whatever section I choose
to look at and I'm most interested in
this section so I'll just keep it up
there for now so very easy to use now in
the bubble view and I'll click on that
one I have all of the same different
graph layouts so I can do the regular
tree the more genealogical pyramid one I
also have the circular one now for this
one in particular I really like the
circular version of it but I also have
these options over at the end as well so
I can make the bubbles a little bit
bigger if I want to so it's a little bit
easier to see each one and I can make
them smaller or larger depending on if
they are parents or children so I prefer
this one with the really big bubbles in
the center and then I prefer to zoom in
on whatever section that I'm looking at
again and it's going to show you
everything in different colors depending
on what kind of transform you had
created for that specific thing
now last off of course is the entity
list so for this one I also want you to
mention you can right-click on each one
and you can still run all the different
transforms that you want but it's not
gonna give you that nice graph unless
you go back to you your main view
obviously so I'm gonna have a little bit
more about each of these right after the
break so stay tuned the hack shop is
hack 5s premier store for all your pen
testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky it looks
like a flash drive and it types like a
keyboard in a king
scripts into a computer crazy fast like
this week's favorite from clips and this
is so cute I'm sorry but I just love
this one it's a script that pulls up his
wife's favorite song on YouTube
minimizes it and then it opens up a
notepad doc to write out I love you and
it makes an ASCII picture of her because
that's freaking adorable
of course we couldn't do the show
without your support so we would like to
thank you with something special use the
coupon code snubz with any order for
your very own signed hacked tip stickers
and of course thank you so much for
supporting the show okay now that you've
got your graph looking the way that you
want making it look all pretty and stuff
I wanted to get back over to those
windows on the side over there so first
off you want to open your properties tab
this is one that I want to check out
first now we've already gone over the
detail view down there but if I
highlight properties for you I can click
on this and I can actually edit anything
that I went through here so I can change
the type I can change the site etc I can
change the website if I want to whether
it's SNL SSL enabled or not what port
that it's being redirected through and I
can also check out URLs and change
information under the graph info so
actually what it looks like on the graph
now if you bookmark a node this is kind
of interesting so I'm gonna click on
this and I'm gonna choose a green star
so under bookmark when I do that and
then I go ahead and close it you're
gonna see a little green star up here on
your node hah I like little green stars
how cute and of course I already went
through the detailed view in my past
pack tip if you haven't watched that yet
definitely check it out and lastly I
also wanted to mention searching so this
is kind of cool you can search for a
specific term located in a node with the
search bar in the detailed view let's
check that out so if I click on detail
and I'm gonna choose two different ones
with shift let's pull up detail now I
have hak5 org and hak5 org as in the
website and the server
I'm also gonna choose Darrin now reopen
this and now we see Darrin located on
here as well now with the search view I
can either search through each and every
transform which can be very useful again
if you have a very very long list that
you need to look through I can also add
an exclamation mark at the beginning to
exclude any sort of words so see I don't
I don't care about Darrin so I'm gonna
remove him from my list BAM hit enter he
disappears from the list now if I click
remove the exclamation mark and hit
enter it's just gonna include Darrin
because he's not located on the
information for hak5 org the website or
the server that's kind of interesting
and you can also hit ctrl F to do a
little bit more of detailed search BAM
so many options because who doesn't like
options now of course let me know what
you think send me a comment below or
email us tips at hak5 org
and be sure to check out our sister show
hak5 for more great stuff just like this
and I'll be there as always reminding
you to trust your technolo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
