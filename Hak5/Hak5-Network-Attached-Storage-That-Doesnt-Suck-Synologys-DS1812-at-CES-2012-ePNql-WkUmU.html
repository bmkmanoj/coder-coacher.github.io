coverage for hak5 I'm deer and kitchen
here at CES 2012 and I've got something
for you sis admin's in the crowd that's
right a little bit of networking love
because who doesn't who doesn't need an
ass that just like punch some drives in
that thing and plug it into ethernet and
just have it not suck unfortunately
there's so many devices that kind of
can't get that last part right but this
isn't one of them we're over here at the
synology booth and i'm checking out this
sweet new sexy piece of hardware this
right here is the d/s 1812 plus it is a
8 base sportin guy that has dual
ethernet gigabit ports in the back as
well as two USB 3 ports it'll also plug
into two additional five Bay dummy guys
so for a total of like 18 drives on this
guy and he's expected to come out here
in q1 for just under a thousand dollars
so you know if you're a kind of Soho
kind of guy this might be the perfect
thing for you I having a good authority
that it really doesn't suck and what's
really neat about the way the synology
does stuff is you know it's not just the
hardware they have some really slick
software and what's beautiful is it's
all web based so right here what we're
looking at is a signal synology
diskstation and really it's kind of like
a imagined like if NT 4 were cool or
anyway you know what I'm saying it's it
looks like a GUI but we're actually
right here in a web browser and we can
go eat in here and take a look at like
packages and we can run applications and
there are plenty of apps already in here
we got like anti viruses for your for
your drives here as well as stats
through webalizer this thing has an
audio station so that you can hook it up
with your mp3 player whether that's an
Android or an iPhone on the more geeky
side ldap you know how I feel about ldap
it does it active directory woohoo a
little bit easier it will run as a deal
DLNA server if you've got you know some
good fun stuff on your TV you want to
stream to it as well as get this it'll
do IP surveillance so if you have like
when based IP cameras you'll actually be
able to get those over
the internet to connect to this guy and
then there's an app to go ahead and
manage all of that how cool right in
addition mail server so I mean this guy
is really shaping up to be basically
that Soho box he put in the closet the
admin logs in through the web interface
and then suddenly everything is taken
care of but it's not just the
administration is built for users as
well so you can create accounts and they
can you know change the wallpaper and
how make customized to their own things
single even do torrents I know right
imagine that geek house with you and
your for other geek roommates I want to
get torrent server going I'm just saying
this thing is pretty sick and with ext4
just pop in some drives and you're ready
to go and basically the thing will shove
data down the pipe as as as big as it
will go i mean like dual gigabit and it
will saturate so that's that's what you
want anyway I'm really stoked about this
and I'm so glad that we found an ass
that doesn't suck for a continued
coverage of all things revision3 head
over to revision 3.com / CES and that's
what you'll find continued coverage of
all things CES on revision3 you got it
anyway we're going to once again thank
our wonderful sponsor Ford for powering
our CES coverage so I'm a little bit
familiar with the sync technology but
but I know you guys have been doing a
whole lot of new stuff with it this week
so tell me about that so as you know
sink is a connectivity system connecting
your phone your mp3 player to the car
one of the products are looking at is
allergy alert which gives you the pollen
level at your location along with the
asthma cough cold newbie indices let's
say it knows you're driving into a high
pollen area it could turn the
recirculation air mode on keeping that
pollen from getting into the car that's
incredible for more CES coverage so you
can go over to revision 3.com / CES
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
