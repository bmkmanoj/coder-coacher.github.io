rubber ducky part 3 this time on hack 5
hello welcome to hack by my name is
Gerren kitchen hello everybody my name
is in Italy I believe the lamb a
ding dong
but the herps and the derp sit the
December episode which means we are
mostly some of the race slob yes oh hey
I have an announcement to make
stay tuned until the end of the show to
find out about our huge hack shop and
giveaway this month we're giving away
stuff every single day right this is the
thing where we got to somehow make
playing video games work yes yes exactly
and also I wanted to mention checkout
threat wire which is on our hack 5
youtube channel we don't have an RSS for
it quite yet for the video but it is the
source for security privacy and Internet
freedom news I talked about the news
that is happening every single week the
stuff that actually changes policies and
things of that nature that can actually
affect you
whenever you're interested in security
and privacy we just released an audio
RSS feed for our patreon backers which
you can find over at patreon.com slash
threat wire I know a lot of people
really wanted an audio RSS feed so I'm
super excited I was finally able to
bring you one but definitely check it
out and subscribe if you can good stuff
yay all right so today we are finishing
up our three-part series about stealing
documents so no we're calling it
exfiltration excellent well stealing
sounds like it sounds it's added
clickbait I like involuntary backups you
know this could be useful as a systems
administrator if you're just trying to
get like configuration files off of each
machine you have to physically go to
them one by one I mean there's good
point actually there's a million reasons
why the ducky can be that it's the Swiss
Army knife it's what you can do at a
computer except faster yeah yeah a
definite amazing humans I know plenty of
people that actually use it for like
they work at schools or they work at
college universities and they have to
update multiple computers so just
plugging in a ducky it's way easier than
going to each and every computer right
and in fact
one of the most recent ones that I've
seen was basically a payload that
provisions Chromebooks because there
isn't a kind of enterprise provisioning
system for those for education and so
yeah to be able to just grab a bunch of
that k12 people that are awesome
so way to go that's not on the forums
please share it yeah I believe it is
there's a couple of good blog post about
s that's the fun thing about the USB
rubber ducky is it's been around for
quite a while and so there's a lot of
awesome active community development and
it's and it's sort of I would say all
over the place there's like cool blog
posts there's like wiki stuff there's
stuff on the forums there's stuff in the
github thankfully there are some new
centralized repositories and we'll get
into that now as we finish up this
payload which will allow you to take an
ordinary-looking
USB stick and kar USB rubber ducky plug
it into a machine and in seconds have it
copied documents from that computer
however you'd like on to it so in order
to do that I grabbed a symptom packaging
I'm sorry it's okay we're not selling
this one anyway so essentially why don't
you go ahead and get that back started
yeah the unboxing oh yes of course as
always thank you I would say unboxing
but I like I prefer the Eco envelopes
anyway let's go ahead and turn what
we've done so far into a ducky script
and then we'll get to the flashing to
turn the duck into more than meets the
eye so first of all i'm here in my i
don't know in just some directory and
we're gonna go ahead and create that
that payload so as you know a ducky
script payload can be written in any
text editor g edit or use bio or then or
i'm just gonna be awesome and use nano
and I'm gonna call payload yeah right no
I told you that well I'm using nano cuz
it's the best
okay so we're gonna start with a remark
at the top and say USB disk
exfiltration payload we're gonna say the
target is Windows XP and it needs a
service pack 3 or higher because it
requires what is it called requires
PowerShell ah
put the author and we're gonna say that
tack five Darren and then I'm gonna do
bad props to digster and I don't know
best with I guess we'll just say cheese
by midnight you got to make sure that
you get those props out there right
because it's important that you give you
know credit where credit is due
all right so delay 1000 all of it
payloads begin with that it gives the
machine enough time to enumerate the USB
rubber ducky as a human interface device
keyboard after that we're gonna hit GUI
our which on a Windows box is going to
put up the run line as we have been
doing this entire time if I switch over
to this other machine here you'll see
that we've got this I'll hit Windows key
are you see you get a run line so we're
gonna follow along as we do this great
we've got a run line now we're gonna
delay a hundred milliseconds this is the
thing where people don't really think
about the fact that whenever a GUI
element changes and you're automating
tasks as USB rubber ducky you have to
put in those delays because while as a
human we don't think about it like oh
well step one is do this step one is do
that because we run at human speeds yeah
when we're talking about a computer
speaking to another computer that's
running it like you know 60,000 times
per second please remember your delays
so important yeah so we changed that GUI
element if we don't delay for honor and
I'm just like you know I mean 10
milliseconds might be enough but I'll be
conservative and put a hundred
milliseconds if we don't do that and we
start typing in our payload as soon as
we hit Windows key are ya then were
we've you've missed the first few
letters in your next command because
it's already going to start typing it
even though the GUI is still trying to
update to the next thing which is why
the best payloads changed the GUI
elements as as infrequently as possible
right the less times you can change the
GUI the better because then you don't
have to worry about those delays which
is why we love those little one-liners
out of the run yes if you're interested
in seeing the one-liner that we did last
week hit up our show notes at the bottom
or you can see the previous episode 21
12 21 13 are the ones to follow along
with if you just jump in in alright so
with that we're now in our run line and
we're going to type in our PowerShell so
in that case we'll do a string command
which will type whatever we'd like and
in this case it's simply
or she'll and I'll just paste my first
stage there and this is the bit here
from digster that it's awesome as GW mi
and when 32 volume looking for a USB
Drive with the label underscore and then
execute d CMD right off the route there
and then lastly we press enter because
string inherently just types it doesn't
rewrite you know do a new line at the
very end it's not like a printf command
with like a backslash N or something
anyway that said let's just go ahead and
write that file out and now we're ready
to encode this because as you know USB
rubber ducky itself doesn't actually
process those text files as human
readable files it processes a binary
file called inject Ben and so to convert
that into and inject up in we have to
use an encoder the ducky encoder a ducky
encoder so let's go ahead and take a
look at a couple of those okay so I'm in
my encoder directory and I've got a few
encoders here and the quick and simple
way to do this would be a java attack
jar ducking code and then tack I for the
input file you weren't sure you could
just run this and it would give you you
know the usage right so I do tack I and
in this case it's under slurp pay load
txt Tech OH
inject bin and there we go now I have LS
injected up Ben and I have new injected
up in and there we go I'm ready to copy
that over to the SD card easy I want to
show another option here actually
because there's a really cool duck
toolkit that's out now that has that's a
I actually like a little bit better than
the Java one so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you what that looks like so it's
duck Tools up P Y if you just run duck
Tools py you'll get the usage and this
is really cool because it can both taxi
frame and tech d-4d code and yeah
languages are important the reason being
the USB rubber ducky is sending PC 105
scan codes and a u.s. keyboard has
different profiles on the operating
system then say a UK keyboard right and
so if you for instance go to the United
Kingdom and use a computer there even if
you plug in a USB board the computer if
it's like if it's set up to accept UK
keys when you go to hit on a shift for
for the dollar sign as we
know it here in the US it'll give you
like the pound sign or something and
actually I'd be chef 3 for the octave
throat or the hashtag is to get to call
it you will get yes you'll get GE a
british pound sterling
yeah so all I can say is you know aside
from the Enter key being the wrong shape
just across the board UK keyboards are
wrong
Oh and broken oh you're so good you're
older than I am so trolling though
that's ok I'll gr so what we're gonna do
is specify our language because it's
going to be important if we're you know
if we've been contracted to infiltrate a
nuclear power facility in France right
we're gonna make sure that we encode it
for a French keyboard layout yeah yes
makes complete sense we do so let's do
that
alright so in this case what we'll do is
I'm going to just go ahead and run duck
tools up py tak en for in code and in
this case what you do is you pass it the
input file and then the output file so
my input file will be 2 over here under
slurp and its payload txt and then we're
going to go ahead and give it the output
which will be injected in and I forgot
to give it the tak l4 language so here
we go tak tak el and I'm gonna do us
write us is there it's in the middle
right there
ok great oh oops it's tacky not again
there we go
and it has now written an injected bin
great
so with this I can go ahead and copy my
payload over to my USB rubber ducky and
it'll be ready to go so you've already
involved it's gonna CP that exactly okay
yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and pull the
micro SD card out of the duct I'm gonna
grab the handy USB SD card reader
because I don't have a micro SD card
reader in this lab right you like no
reader that comes with the USB rubber
ducky we've gotten questions about what
it is it's a card reader there we go
alright so I'm just gonna unplug that in
I now see I get you know a new 126 mag
boolean that already hasn't inject up in
on there all this inject up in does
is open Notepad and type hello world
it's kind of it's the one that comes
with it so I'm just gonna delete that
and now I can copy it over however I
want I could do it with Nautilus I don't
know what Explorer this is but go away
but I'm just gonna use the CP command to
copy inject it up into slash media
what's my username DK and then in my
case this is the name of my card right
right that's important okay so now I've
copied it over there it and there you go
it's now it's on the root right
interesting okay we'll come back to that
because that's kind of important but at
this point I'm ready to now safely eject
this I'm just gonna hit this otherwise
you can use this command right here
other like bins that they wanted to use
or a different text files I guess to
they could totally just stick a folder
on there with all the extra ones so they
could carry it with them right oh yeah
just replace the inject up and whenever
they want to use different one yeah if i
LS dot slash payloads you'll see I have
a bunch of payloads that I carry around
depending on what I'm trying to do and
in fact I will say there's even a
version of the firmware which will
execute inject one inject two and inject
three bin well depending on the status
of caps lock scroll lock or num lock so
there's cool ways that you can carry
multiple payloads in that regard nice
we're gonna be covering a version of the
firmware that does different stuff but
let's go ahead and just like execute
this and see what happens
okay all right so I've gone ahead and
safely ejected my micro SD card which is
really important because micro SD cards
love to go read-only if you don't safely
eject them always safely eject them so
I'll go ahead and put the SD card in the
duct let's go over to our Windows
machine over here slide that guy over
yay and I'm gonna go ahead and just plug
that guy in and there you go OOP now
notice hey what was that that was an
error now unfortunately it's a nut bread
yeah this payload isn't written for
debugging it's you know if it were then
we wouldn't have it closed the window
when it's finished we wouldn't be able
to see like what went wrong yeah it's
kind of obvious what went wrong
our payload is trying to execute DC MD
off of the root of the drive with the
label underscore and if we come back
over here to explore you'll see that I
only have two drives one's called USB
and one's called Windows so I'm gonna go
ahead and unplug the USB rubber ducky
and I'm actually gonna take the
opportunity since I'm in Windows here to
go ahead and rename the SD card remember
it was like what was it called a 97
something whatever it was boring it was
boring we need it to be called
underscore so I'm gonna go ahead and put
it in the reader and then just plug that
into the boring windows box and take a
look and there we go and it pops up as
the eid rive and we see we've got our
inject up in and it is not labeled
if you press f2 you can go ahead and
give it a label whatever you want so I'm
just gonna call it underscore hit enter
and there you go I've now renamed the
drive and creator hadn't eject it that
is the easy way to do it yeah I mention
that in Windows because in Windows it's
selecting the drive and hitting f2 in
Linux that's called gparted and I like
doing that right now so we now have our
our micro SD card we have our micro SD
card for the most part loaded the way
that we're gonna need it okay but our
USB rubber ducky is only numerating as a
keyboard currently right we need it to
be both keyboard and mass storage since
you want it to be able to collect docks
exactly involuntarily back up yes so
let's go ahead and flash a community
version of the firmware from a good
friend midnight snake
we called well colloquial known as the
twin duck this is both a keyboard and
storage cool so I'm gonna go over here
and I'm gonna CD over to a couple of
directories here and actually you can
grab this stuff over on the github so
github comm so I hacked by Darren slash
USB rubber ducky or if you go to USB
rubber ducky comm you'll find under
resources there are plenty of links to
all of the good stuff but essentially
we're going to grab I'm gonna grab this
ducky flasher here I already have it
installed on my machine but this is a
very simple flashing tool which will
allow you to get into the bootloader and
change the firmware on the USB rubber
ducky
I'm going to show you the hard way just
so you know what
looks like first and then we're gonna go
into the you know the easy way because I
think it's important to understand what
we're doing first okay so all devices
have for the most part for those for all
devices have boot loaders yeah boot
loader on your computer that you're used
to booting up right now watching perhaps
on your you know Windows Linux whatever
box has a BIOS or UEFI layers to and
it's the first thing that executes when
the silicon gets power and then it gives
instructions to the processor on how to
how to actually like boot an operating
system right you know and it says hey
here's the code I want you to execute
and how to do that so nothing new there
nothing new there that exists for the
most part on any computer and this is a
computer is a microcontroller what is a
computer right so for example the Wi-Fi
pineapple has a bootloader it's called
you boot you know your computer has a
BIOS and this one has a bootloader
called DFU right and so you're gonna
change DFU we're gonna use DFU to
program the firmware on the rubber ducky
got it so in order to get it into DFU
programming mode what we'll do is on the
rubber ducky we have this little button
here so you hold down the button while
plugging it into the computer and then
it goes into DFU programming mode it
won't start typing the inject up in that
you have on the root of the card instead
it'll just be waiting for you to program
it much like an Arduino would be if you
know you put it into programming mode so
that's what we're gonna go ahead and do
I'm just gonna hold the button down and
plug it into the computer and if we do
LS USB we notice instead of keyboard we
have this at Mille Corp device and that
is because that's the chip from the USB
rubber ducky and it's in DFU bootloader
mode now we can program it with the DFU
- programmer tool if you don't already
have that installed a sudo apt-get
install you know whatever have you I
already have it installed so I'm just
gonna use it right now DFU - programmer
and we're going to go ahead and dump the
firmware that's currently on it off so
that we can always reset back to the
original firmware before we ever wanted
to by doing a DFU programmer specify the
chip in this case a t32 uc3 be one two
five six and we'll say dump it the same
for all Ducky's it
is and I didn't want it to be dumped
straight to the command line but that's
just what it did that's fine actually
have a copy of it so that's no big deal
what I really want to show you is how to
program it so in this case what we'll do
is we'll say flash and do suppress
bootloader
suppressing then boot learners uh-huh -
mmm and we'll specify the path to our
firmware so let me go ahead and put that
command right there I actually have all
of the firmware loaded right here pulled
off the github and you'll see that there
are plenty of them to play with the one
that we're interested in is the C duct
version 2.1 that is the composite duct
so that's the one that's is the quint
twin duct if you will so i'll go ahead
and specify c underscore duct v 2.1 and
there we go it validates and it's like
oh it didn't work because i didn't erase
it first because i know how to do this
sorry guys you need to specify erase all
right now we have a dead duck don't
unplug it and now flash it validating
and there we go we've only used 13% of
the onboard memory so we're you know
there's lots of opportunities in fact
there are sources here not not in here
but over on the github if you want to
get into it there are sources for all of
the different firmware where if you want
to start playing with these and you're
good with C it's all here so good stuff
all around and now our USB rubber ducky
is in twin duck mode that's awesome
before we leave this though I want to
show you the easy way that wasn't too
bad but check this out ducky flasher did
that's actually uh that's actually a
command I did you know that we did a
segment on that command so like you
flash here okay this is an awesome
little tool I'll just show you the
readme basically it has the firmware
built in and it's a very simple way to
flash you duck so I'll just walk you
through it basically you run ducky
flasher and you get this cute little
antsy and it's like which firmware would
you like and you're like
well I want number four the twin duck
and then it'll be like Oh which version
of it and so then you're like I want the
original number one and then it will
flash your duck so cool right validates
image and boom scroll up and see that it
no it's actually typing in because it
finished as soon as much as flashing its
gonna start trying to run whatever
inject uh pins on the root so maybe the
SD card out maybe you don't either way
you're having trouble with it going to
DFU bootloader mode when you're holding
it down plugging it just make sure
you're holding it down real firm plug it
in and hold it there for like five
seconds before you let go and that
should get it into its appropriate space
cool cool not hard at all okay so we can
do twin duck now almost so when we plug
it in it's gonna run the inject up in on
the root of the sdcard the SDA part has
been renamed to underscore yeah and it's
now a twin duck so it'll show up as both
mass-storage
and n-type our payload right what else
with last what are we missing
well we need to switch it to the other
drive right we need to put all the
goodies on it oh right right put the
goodies on it gotta put the goodies on
its home pull the SD card out one last
thing pop it in the SD card reader and
let's go ahead and get our goodies I
have all of these in the show notes so
you can just pop them on your duck over
and slurp and you'll notice that I have
aha
II got CMD D CMD + I VBS those are the
ones that need to be on the root and
we've covered those in the last two
episodes so I'm just going to copy D CMD
I'm going to be weird and not be all
leet and stuff with my copy command and
we're gonna copy it to media DK and come
on tab complete tab complete there it is
under score right so now if i LS media
DK underscore you'll see haha I have my
inject up in I have my DC CMD my east
needle my IV BS I am good to go
cool so let me go ahead and now safely
eject that there we go so now I can just
pull that without any risk of damaging
it and I didn't create the slurp folder
but I think the make directory command
automatically creates the slurp folder
maybe I don't remember my bad from last
week I'm pretty sure it does you know
I'll make it just in case because I
don't want demo fail okay I just
remember that that did need a slurp
slurp folder so we'll see the over to
media DK pump and we'll do a make
directory slurp actually I'm really
curious now does ECM D make it let's
let's les it and to to do to to yeah it
doesn't make directory for whatever that
is it should but just to be sure okay
cool
and once again let's eject that okay all
right all right now now we can do it now
we're ready to put it all together so SD
card goes on the duck the duck now goes
in its ducky case so you can look all
lead right no no no I do I do
Shannon it's important I know that this
is a ducky no we've been working on this
script for three weeks now making the
ultimate exfiltration payload and I feel
like this ducky deserves its debut to be
in its shiny happy pretty case in fact
let's go ahead and pop on the decals
because oh what's up
we'll put a we'll put a little decal of
a cute little rubber ducky on it or a
little secret
I feel like Bob Ross right now so I'm
gonna put the cute little ducky on it oh
goodness
there we go except for the sticker on
the back that literally says mm-hm USB
rubber ducky now now they know but it's
okay you can just tell them like hey no
no it's okay I'm from IT we're doing
backups of all the all the pcs in the
organization you know it's important to
backup data yeah all right so with all
that said let's go ahead to our target
test machine any windows box and go
ahead and just plug in the duck
there we go now as you see on my
particular computer I have it set up
that whenever a mass storage drive is
plugged in that it'll just go ahead and
open that that's not the typical
behavior but I set up my windows box
that way so I can actually go ahead and
see okay I see all the documents on
there
I see slurp and haha created the thing
and there's the w9 and all the payload
stuff and unhappy and lost documents and
everything is good that's so cool I'm
excited yeah I'm so happy that it worked
so we're gonna talk a little bit more
about some advanced usage of this in
just a moment as well as getting into
cool stuff dance to talk to sent us and
why video games are important to hacking
all that and more after this quick
you've been watching this hack 5 USB
rubber ducky series you know that great
ideas start with delay 1000 and they
also start with great domains which is
why we recommend heading over to
domain.com it is the source where
Shannon on whenever we're having our
brilliant ideas and what I'm bringing to
the Internet we get ourselves a sweet
liberal domain comm domain name because
they have this domain discovery system
that makes it super intuitive and sweet
to get the perfect I mean just for you
and their checkout process is a breeze
so your website will be up in no time
flat and the guys over domain.com huge
fans of hack 5 huge fans you guys they
have a coupon code just for us it's
called hack 5 hak5 saves you get this
20% off so you should do that you should
go over to domain comm and type in a
check a five and yes you'll find out
that hack 5 dot org is already taken but
if you plug it into the coupon code
field you'll save 20% which is brilliant
yeah they've also you know they've been
supporting us for years so you should
probably even just tweet at them at
domain.com say hey thanks guys for like
hooking up AK 5 for the longest time we
think you guys are cool I think bill a
1000 yes so when you think domain names
think domain.com we're back in it snail
time for the technolo Spoto of the week
every single week we are asking what
tickles you our techno lest we want you
to send us your photos and you can enter
our giveaway every single week by just
simply using the hashtag hack 5 that's
hak5 hopefully you know how to spell the
name of the show if you don't I'd be I'd
be curious why are you watching and you
don't know how to spell it but this week
there's a winner there's no point act 5
there is no point in hack 5 this week
our winner is going to be winning the
USB rubber ducky which we've been
talking about all this week as well as
the brand new hack 5 field kit which is
awesome
Darren you wrote this oh yes this was a
lot of fun it has fantastic chapters
like Duquette and the ducking workflow
I'm not proud of it so I hope you really
enjoy it and our winner this week yes is
Richard Brook in leet-speak
and I love all this cute act my family
we kind of joke around about this
internally about how adorable
got a little tropical pond going it's
dude there's like sand in the background
I'm gonna imagine that there's an ocean
back oh we should go that we should
little paradise we should dad we sort

this is not our only contest that is
currently going in fact all throughout
the month of December we have been
celebrating the premiere interestingly
we did this kind of a surprise to us of
our very own Wi-Fi pineapple in the
Ubisoft video game watchdogs to say hey
like thanks souls right I don't know if
you've played watchdogs it's basically
like it's kind of like a open-world GTA
stuff you knew about this
but I actually was a guest host on a
show by matpat called game lab game
theory in LA earlier this year so we
were doing like a real versus gaming
thing about penetration testing and
hacking so I did that earlier this year
I think it's a YouTube bred video though
so you have to have YouTube right yeah
it keeps getting linked to us because
the producer miss attributes' you is the
inventor of the Wi-Fi pineapple and also
says that the Wi-Fi pineapple was
inspired by the video game watch dogs
even though it predates it by like five
years like no that's fine
welcome to the wonderful world of
television yeah checking comes late
anyway it doesn't matter
so anyway moving on we are doing this
huge giveaway it's the watchdog's to
giveaway since the Wi-Fi pineapple is
all over watchdog that's pretty cool
people yeah like here it is in the very
intro kind of like menu and you can see
it right there with their kind of like
slightly altered version of Wi-Fi
pineapple logos so they don't have to
you know pay royalties or get our
permission for the trademark which is
which is cool it's an homage I like it
and here it is actually in the video
game whoops if I yeah and this is
actually courtesy watch on Twitter yeah
you found this over on Alcatraz the
video game takes place in San Francisco

while to develop a video game so yeah
