threads Georgia I'm so delighted to see
you again last time we were talking it
was at shmoocon and you gave an
excellent presentation about botnet
command and control taken over Android
phones what's changed since we last
spoke well since we last spoke I've
actually added a lot more from not just
botnet command and control but just
spying on people on their phones you
know people keep everything on their
phone probably taking over their
computer it's a pretty bad thing but
taking over their phone would be even
worse oh absolutely I find that the
private information that I keep on my
phone versus my computer absolutely
leaps and bounds different yeah right so
the same way that I was able to do
command and control at the base
operating system for smartphones I can
steal their information again the trust
model really just breaks down there
whereas applications are in a jail down
at the base operating system of the
phone as traffic's going in and out
going to the modem it's kind of broken
down and the security model and you're
able as route to get anything you want
now that but still like is it still
iPhone or I'm sorry so Android specific
or or is it iPhone as well no I started
to work on the iPhone yes I finally got
one nice the same sort of deal now
recently there's been a lot of just a
few incidents of like apps in the
marketplace that that like Google
finally has to use like that kill switch
where you know uninstall the app and and
you know remove applications from the
marketplace is that still the best
vector of attack that you found I
definitely think that is the best way to
get people originally infected with any
sort of malware cuz really you see where
as in the computer world we're getting a
lot of user awareness if people knowing
they shouldn't go up the internet and
down
everything that looks cool it might be
infected but that's the way smartphones
are marketed by our phones because we
have better ABS yeah so everyone goes
out and buys whatever they want from me
App Store that's what they're told to do
they're never told that this is going to
harm them and they really can but if
you've got a you know Android live
wallpaper of Super Mario Brothers I mean
it's it's going to need access to your
text messages login your phone calls
right yes definitely and there's no way
that I've seen to just go ahead and
prevent each of those like oh and stall
the app anyway but don't give it access
to X Y or Z there has been some research
in that area but I haven't really seen
anything that is definitely full really
you have the choice of don't just all
the app I've seen things like that with
apps that I just want and it needs
access to phone calls or something and
I'm like well but I really yeah we
definitely know what could happen
it just becomes a really hard trade-off
nice and as far as the
command-and-control you're still using
SMS I am and then why again is that well
originally it was because I was doing a
project to stop myself from drunk
texting we can we get that gonna get
that code for that so I was trying to I
was already working with SMS and then
just in the research I had done for that
it occurred to me but this would be a
really good vector for it it uh you know
since it queues instead of I've seen
stuff that's triggered by a phone call
but since this if it fails it'll come
back and say you're in the tunnel but I
go over the gsm-r CDMA modem because
whereas IP for your phone it really runs
down the battery particularly on your
Android
okay so like just one ping keepalive
could take down like 3% and users might
notice that because it's already a
problem with the batteries that last
thing you want to do is you know install
a rootkit that's gonna kill the phone's
battery because then you know no good
now as far as the rootkit is concerned
is this like a framework that people can
go and download and start playing with
yes I actually I haven't been able to
put it out for all platforms because a
base operating system-level things are
kind of platform specific but every kind
of phone I have I try and put out some
perfect concept for it they can go to my
website German news com it's there all
