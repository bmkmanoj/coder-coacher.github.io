I'm here at the Ford booth at CES 2013
with Ed how you doing a Darren house
young and we're checking out the TDK
what is it TDK I'm just doing SDK was
ready to DK TDK is a technology
development kit that developers can get
for you know AppLink enabling their abs
instead of you know buying a vehicle or
if they already have when they can use
an existing one so this is a CD k you
basically have all the same interfaces
as you would a normal vehicle we got the
screen you got a center stack with all
the different funds priests I bonds for
bag as well as some Moss car simulation
toggles so you can turn the car off open
doors set it to go forward and reverse
at a park or not part so what kind of
partners have you guys I teamed up with
to enable apps to come to 40 right so I
mean everybody knows you know a lot of
the music streaming apps like pandora
our radio the slacker and PR we also did
some navigation base apps scout from
TeleNav we have our own sink
destinations and will be a bad I'm a
whole slew of more coming out you know
every every few months awesome working
our hackers find a developer Network to
start coding up some awesome stuff cuz
it is pretty easy just like everything
else developer da for calm there we go
all right and with all of that I want to
thank once again Ford for powering our
CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
