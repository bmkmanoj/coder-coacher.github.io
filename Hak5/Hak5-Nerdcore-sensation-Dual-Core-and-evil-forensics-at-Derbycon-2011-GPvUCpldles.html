by the Ben Heck show
sure I mean I could ask the easy
question what is new with a half-naked
Armitage lady what's new with the
half-naked Armitage lady well you don't
mind shift a little bit a lot of people
are asking me to complete the picture
and you know hire my artists and
actually you know fill that out but
probably won't do that what I'm actually
doing is I try to focus on one big
project with it at a time so something
I've been focusing on great lately is
reporting and not that I want to make it
generate PDF files because I mean I
can't tell you not what I really want to
do what what we're not going to do
crystal reports no we're not because I
don't want this to feel like a corporate
tool I wanted to feel like something
that's fun that's that's what we're
talking about that's the difference is
the hacker tool and the security
professional tool but why can't I mean
anyway yeah I feel you so reports though
that's that's a security tool thing
right it is but people actually I'm
finding out I didn't know this until I
recently did a survey people actually
using arm teaching their job a lot of
people i mean people in government like
I thought the Air Force Academy is
teaching armitage in a summer program
they've got I also saw on a news channel
last night um I saw it online idaho
national labs using arm things like you
know is kind of fun today mention Idaho
National Labs because we might know a
little bit about them using some of our
tools as well but you know what it is
though is it it's what people want is
something that's effective and easy and
you've taken something that's very
effective and then like Armas just makes
it easy so reporting that's if that's
one of the features they want that's
great that you're implementing that what
kind of really running into trying to
put that together oh well it's the
hardest part was actually just figuring
out what people want cuz im Welling
people I self roll all my own tools and
a lot of the tools inspired just by my
own needs and I I'm used to writing a
narrative I mean I worked on grammar
checking software before so i can write
all day long so I'm like okay what do
you need from this tool cuz I mean I
know how to you know just copy and paste
tables and write a script to parse
things and so put myself in my user
shoes I think that's the hardest part
now this is coming off the heels of the
latest release which implements teaming
right
right so I've had teaming and armed
agents been stable since April i started
working on that around februari 2011 and
yeah April's when I finally had it
nailed it really was a painful process
to get it there but like that's my pride
and joy in the tool because if you get
into a computer and I get and I can see
it pop up at the same time and both of
us can interact with that compromise
host simultaneously without like
stepping on each other at all it's
fantastic and I love the kind of the
route you've gone for collaboration and
it's very hacker and it's so simple it's
like oh we need to be able to
communicate and you just like okay IRC
server right well it's not really an IRC
server but looks like it because you get
like a little chat room in the in the
software along with everything popping
up but actually I'm an old-school IRC
guy man grew up on IRC I learned unix on
IRC and that was why were you on the f
serves on f net so I was found ! where's
or whatever it was doesn't palm floods
let's go where I hung out yeah so that's
where I learned and ultimately I just
wanted to have a lot of fun with this
tool and I think that's what really
drives it is because I wanted to have
fun I was just it's I got a lot of
passion in it and I think that passion
is what makes it me keep going with it
it's definitely shining through and so
what has been the relationship between
Armitage now like metasploit um
fantastic as you know I'm Armitage is
distributed with the metasploit
framework HD is like really responsive
which is something that really impresses
me because at 1am I sent him a message
on IRC I'm like hey HD I can't commit
something's wrong he SAT there eee
troubleshoot like went through
troubleshooting it with me as midnight
in Austin where he was at and he made
sure everything was working and you know
he helped me out he's just like right
there gee that is so cool so what's next
well I only have so many ideas right and
there's a lot of people they really i
think have a lot of good ideas and ways
they want to see the sorriest I want to
make Armitage scriptable like an IRC
client Oh what would like would like
pearl or TTL or something like that or
or or used to talking about like putting
together something custom something
custom so years ago I wrote an IRC
client called jrc to it's really cool
didn't get pop
but it attracted a great scripting
community mean scripts from tens aligns
to thousands of lines about 70 on the
home page you don't have to tell me
about scripts I mean we just came out
with the rubber ducky with scripting and
who doesn't love it because it's like
when you take something complicated and
you make it easy like like what you've
done with Armitage metasploit
complicated Armitage easy so you do the
same thing with that framework you're
going to get tons of developers
interested in doing cool stuff with it
well my goal is I want people be able in
a decorative way so they don't have to
you know have a lot of boilerplate just
extend Armitage make it easy to
implement other tools and even cooler
make it possible for like a script a bot
externally to join your team and to be
able to work with everything and work
with metasploit in an incredibly
user-friendly novice programmer friendly
way so do you guys have a wiki or where
do you get like ideas from the community
and stuff like that um it's pretty so on
Facebook strangely enough I wanted it
had nothing wanting to do is starting
this up this guy named Balaam he's gonna
love that game a shout out he emailed me
so like I want to set a facebook fan
page like really who's gonna sign up for
that but it's like over 600 people on
there and it's an active community like
he'll post something like you know 10
people comment I'm like really okay so
there's a lot of back and forth their
twitters really great and people just
email me too and I love coming to cons
and just having conversations with folks
and I found bribing people works really
well I put out the user survey I mean
we're pretty much just doing this
interview because he gave me the sticker
as a half naked lady yeah well hey I'm
telling you if Armitage didn't have a
half naked lady probably no one would
notice so marketing tip for everybody
else put half naked anime girls on
everything and that is the path or or
make it cute when just I think ok so my
humorous side have fun with it no no I
totally feeling and that's what I love
because you know you've definitely in
the vein of in the hacker spirit I think
if we're going to end on anything it's
just that I am fascinated to find out
and again with a hacker spirit here
software has a theme song yes it does
not that many people know it but when i
launched it last day of november thanks
to musics actually tweeting it out he
was the first person to start it off i
was afraid to launch it muaks is my hype
man
he's got no no I think that's a t-shirt
that needs to be made and everyone can
wear it I'm totally gonna wear that we
can do it together we'll that we need to
have that why do we don't have that oh
absolutely muaks we're getting that
shirt next con mis con no so okay yeah
the theme song okay so when I launch
this I wanted a good website to show
people I take the work seriously
documentation something functionally
complete a remember a memorable domain
and logo and I was just experimenting
and I decided commissioned a theme song
for the YouTube video you had like
branding and marketing and all that in
mind from the get go see that I think
that's where like a lot of hackers kind
of don't complete the whole package in
that you may have something
awesome and no way to really communicate
no absolutely so I am that guy i mean i
mentioned i wrote an IRC client i was
terrible getting the word out i wrote a
programming language the one that's
gonna make our I did armed with what is
it so wait you wrote Armitage in your
own programming like what is it called
its called sleep and do you get much of
it um sometimes no actually I'm like
I've been really fortunate even was in
the military I was still able to like
sleep all night and get up whenever and
can't roll into work people just put up
with my personality i guess i don't know
why but they're like okay yay you gotta
you're you're an interesting character
and i had no idea that i think to add so
much to it just now knowing like wow you
were at your own programming language
that's so cool what was wrong with the
insert any language here see oh well
cease not like okay okay i'm sorry
that's a horrible example let python
yeah everybody loves python so I want to
make my IRC client jrc to scriptable
right and I wanted to make it decorative
I want feel like mirc like something a
novice could just pick up and you're
right yeah I wonder how many people
watching this now got into programming
because they were on mirc and they're
like oh egg drop pots and all that other
fun stuff adds me to a tee I'm almost
sometimes embarrassed to admit it but I
I can't hide it that's exactly what I
mean that in like qbasic on back in the
BBS day absolutely so i wanted something
that felt like that right with a little
bit more power and not some of the
ugliness of mirc i guess so i wrote this
language looks a lot like pearl on top
of java got rid of the warts and things
that made no sense to me
and my goal that when I wrote it was to
make it really extensible so you could
add new keywords and constructs so the
application was embedded with feels like
a first-class citizen of the language so
people approaching it aren't having
learned the application like the
programmer does they're having to learn
it in a simple way that a script are
approaching it would so when you say you
want to make armitage extensible is that
what you're going to do is like you're
gonna up you know how people make
scripts for Armitage in sleep yes
absolutely and I'm going to add like
keywords and AD like a very simple
abstraction to work with metasploit and
make it easy to work with the teeming
stuff and it's going to be really cool
like it's gonna be something that just
an absolute novice like my goal I'll
concert successful if this is how people
learned how to program if like more pen
testers like I'm afraid to program but
this looks easy so I'm going to start
extending arm pitch and make that my
Center that's what it's all about is
making these armitage she's so easy you
can sleep with her right now that
doesn't sound right fantastic fascia
problem if they wrap this up but it is
of course a pleasure talking to you as
always what can people find on armitage
they can find out about to jet fast and
easy hacking calm or follow me on

from his show leo submitted this little
bash nibble he writes do you ever find
yourself tailing a live log file that
doesn't include proper time stamps I
knew I have at least not with message do
you message maybe anyway doc to the
rescue get this tail tak F our log file
in this case I actually have a ping dot
log we're going to pipe that to gawk
this is so cool so now with a single
quotation mark and a squiggly open
whatever we can do print space and then
in this case we can use a function s trf
time and then open paren quote and now
we just give it however we want to
format our time stamp in this case / % y
tack % m tack % d will do year-month-day
i'm going to give it a space and then %
capital h for our colon % m four-minute
colon % s for second closer quotation
and our parentheses and then give it a
comma dollar 0 for our variable in this
case the first line of our log file or
every subsequent line semicolon because
we're done with it close our squiggly
paren and close that oh that single
quotation mark and now there we go I've
got my ping log with a whole bunch of
wonderful time stamps on it go ahead and
