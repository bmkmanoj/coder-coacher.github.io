you by domain.com got a great idea it
all starts with a great domain domain
com for hak5 I'm Jen cutter at CES 2011
we're here at the optima booth and this
is Walter Walter tell us what's new for
2011 well we've got a lot of new
products coming out this year especially
with our pico technology which is a
combination of LED and dlp technology
that allows you to create large very
excellent images from a small projector
very cool now we want to talk about this
this you want to hold that for us there
it is so tiny and this is a real working
projector it is it is this is our PK 301
and this has been a real successful
projector for us it sells for 399 it's
also a 50 lumen projector so you get
basically the image quality that you see
here it has a rechargeable battery so
you can play up to 90 minutes with a
nice bright image from this projector
alright and so what are the hookups in
there so we have basically a full suite
of inputs including hdmi vga composite
video we also have a microSD slot that
allows you to expand the internal memory
to 32 gigabytes so that you can
basically store PowerPoint presentations
videos and still images internally on
the projector all right now for the SD
card can you just take the SD card in is
there some sort of conversion that you
have to do we at depends on what file
you're trying to play back most image
files it handles just fine right off the
back if you're playing a video file we
offer a software that comes with the
unit that you can put on your laptop it
just convert files very easily to
playback internally the same goes for
PowerPoint
well so let's say you want to talk up
your game consoles of that would that be
permissible oh yeah sure you've got an
HDMI input which would probably be the
most likely way that you'd hook up your
game console but also you can just hook
up composite video or a component video
as well we have an adapter for that all
right and what's the price point this is
399 mm-hmm no where can you pick up
these new items well as I was saying the
Neo I will be out later in january early
februar a in major etail and retail the
PK 301 is available online as well and
