casino fish tank got hacked and wTF is
GE PR all that coming up now on threat
wired greetings I am Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for April 24th 2018
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
our patreon is over at patreon.com slash
threat wire and that is always the best
way to support the show and will help us
reach our next goal so if you want
access to exclusives check out the
patreon link in the show notes below and
now on to the news the first story is
all about Russians targeting routers of
all things on April 16th a joint US and
UK report was posted by the national
cybersecurity center of the GCHQ
explaining that hackers who were working
as state-sponsored actors of the russian
government were working to compromise
government business infrastructure and
home routers switches in other similar
networking devices the report was issued
by the NCSC which is the UK's national
cybersecurity Center the FBI and the DHS
affected systems include generic routing
encapsulation or GRE enabled devices
Cisco smart install or SMI devices and
simple network management protocol or
SNMP network devices the targets also
included ISPs who support government and
private sectors so why would Russian
state-sponsored attackers target these
kind of devices well alternative to a
user's computer owning an entire router
would mean that they owned all the
traffic on the network as well so they
make ideal targets routers and
networking devices are rarely updated as
well and assets are likely easy targets
to the actors used man-in-the-middle
attacks for espionage to extract
intellectual property like passwords and
other sensitive information maintain
persistent access and to help
potentially plan for future attacks the
national protection and programs
Directorate assistant secretary
explained a need for responsible nations
to use diplomatic law enforcement and
technical means to address the threat by
the Russian actors now the data intact
analysis came from several different
sources that were confronted with these
attacks in which the cyber actors were
able to identify vulnerable devices
extract device info map and pivot around
those networks steal login creds and
login as stolen users modified the
device's firmware operating system and
configurations and even redirect victims
to russian own infrastructure in the
report the agencies explained that the
hackers had a multi-stage campaign
including recon weaponization and
delivery of malicious files exploitation
installation and command and control now
unsurprisingly the devices that they
gained access to were old devices using
legacy unencrypted protocols or non
authenticated services devices that
weren't set up properly before being
installed or devices that just didn't
support security patches and were
end-of-life of course now if you work at
a company being attacked there are
several different solutions that you can
take with the whole section related to
navigating the different protocols in
determining if you are a target to
mitigate these attacks don't allow
unencrypted protocols or internet access
to the management interface obviously
disable legacy protocols and change
default passwords manufacturers should
design products that do not include
unencrypted protocols and forced
password changes from the default
credentials you know that we have been
hit with the darkest IOT depths when
someone's able to hack a casino through
a hotel lobby fish tank thermometer
during a talk on Thursday Nicole Egan
the CEO of the cyber security company
dart trace explained that an unnamed
casino was hacked by an Internet of
Things device it was a thermometer
inside a hotel lobby fish tank the
hackers were able to pivot to other
parts of the network find a database of
high rollers and steal those credentials
right out of the fish tank
now all exact information was not
disclosed about the casino in question
dark trace did release a report last
year where they detailed a compromised
connected fish tank in it they explained
that a North American casino had a new
attraction so anybody going to Vegas
just look out for a brand new fish tank
with high-tech sensors
that regulate temperature salinity and
feeding schedules the casino used a
configured individual VPN isolated from
the rest of the casinos data dark trace
was able to identify odd activity with
data transfers of 10 gigabytes from the
fishtank to the cloud via a protocol
used usually for audio and video the
data was transferred to an address in
Finland for data exfiltration now in
this case the attackers took advantage
of the new device since it wasn't being
scrutinized to the level that other
devices were in the casino in this case
dark trace did help to mitigate the
issue but a rise of Internet of Things
hacks similar to this only increase
concern of ongoing issues with
connecting all of our devices let's talk
about gdpr which Lawrence shared on our
patreon community tab the general data
protection regulation or gdpr for short
is set to go into effect on May 25th
2018 so it's probably a good idea to
learn about this new privacy protection
regulation and how it will affect you
even if you don't live in Europe now
while this is a European regulation
which is taking over from the last data
protection regulation from get this the
1990s it does affect folks across the
pond as well like me this new law will
oversee how personal data is handled and
stored by private and public sector
businesses and gives more rights to
individuals over their data personal
data as well as sensitive information
are covered so it includes things like
your name your address your information
about your political or religious views
your sexual orientation basically
everything that Facebook already
generates about you in stores so the GD
P R was in negotiations for four years
before being passed by the European
Parliament and European Council in April
of 2016
giving the law two years as a
preparation period for businesses
it'll be enforced by the Information
Commissioner's Office and if businesses
do not enact new data protection under
GD P are such as making it much more
clear whenever asking for consent about
collecting information then they can be
fine by the ICO companies will need to
report any breaches within 72 hours of
discovery and it needs to be disclosed
you all affected users now large
companies of over 250 employees will
need to have detailed information about
why they are collecting data how it is
processed and for how long as for those
finds they will have to pay up to 10
million euros or up to 2 percent of
their profits whichever is greater for
small offenses larger offenses will
carry a fine of 20 million euros or 4%
users will also have the power to access
data which is collected about them for
free within one month of making a
request according to the GDP are luckily
businesses have a 12 step guide that
they can follow to get prepared for the
GDP are changes it does list procedures
and policies outlined in the GDP are and
a walkthrough of each of these changes
as well American companies like Google
and Facebook will also have to abide by
these new rules as previously discussed
on threat wire Facebook will be creating
clearer communication in regards to
security features they're offering
quicker data removal and increasing
protection for children under the age of
18 apple also introduced new privacy
protections that include a data and
privacy screen during setup and new
devices Apple will also allow users to
get a copy of their data and deactivate
their accounts or delete an entire Apple
ID more companies are likely to release
their new privacy policy changes within
the coming weeks if you are a patreon
patron you can send in your favorite
stories on the community tab to get
featured in the show every Friday I'll
pick 3 or more top stories for a voting
poll that patrons can vote on to be
included in next week's show everyone
