linksys won't block all the open wrt
flash and zero days perfect together all
that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Patrick Norton this is a
threat wire form a 17 2016 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom a big thanks to all
the folks that make the show happen by
contributing the patreon.com the
National Telecommunications and
Information Administration that's part
of the US Department of Commerce just
dropped a thrilling report lack of trust
and internet privacy and security may
deter economic and other online
activities not exactly an earth
shattering revelation but the size of
the problem might be based on data
gathered for the ntia by the US Census
Bureau in July 2015 the report pretty
much says people are afraid of getting
hacked or in the words of the ntia
Americans are increasingly concerned
about online security and privacy at a
time with data breaches cyber security
incidents and controversies over the
privacy of online services have become
more prominent okay survey is pretty
huge actually included more than 41,000
households with at least one Internet
user and frankly they're nervous
seriously nervous sixty-three percent
have quote major concerns about identity
theft forty-five percent are worried
about credit card or banking fraud and
data collection by the private sector or
government worries less than a quarter
of those surveyed but still that's one
in every four at least for data
collection by the private sector data
collection by the government like one in
five I was actually shocked by the
number of households that claimed they
had been affected by an online security
breach identity theft or similar
malicious activity during the last 12
months it raised as high as thirty one
percent nearly one in every three that's
for households with five or more types
of devices which frankly seems
ridiculously high or things are even
more ridiculously bad than I thought
they were the sections on online
activities avoided you to privacy or
security concerns are particularly
interesting literally a third of online
households are avoiding conducting
financial transactions online more than
a quarter or avoiding online commerce of
any kind and that number spikes gets
huge like up to forty percent if they've
reported a breach in their household
trust ladies and gentlemen not just an
issue in relationships and I'd be very
interested to see these results broken
down by age location and other factors
are older people more paranoid or
younger people more paranoid does it
vary by region a lot of interesting data
there and I hope to see more of it being
broken down by the ntia we're big fans
of open source router operating systems
around here mostly because all too many
routers rarely are well pretty much
never get any kind of security updates I
find it difficult to believe there's
nothing to patch or make better and
frankly the success of open source
router operating systems like open wrt
suggests that there's a lot that can be
made better on most routers just simply
making existing features easier to
implement our customized gee whiz which
is why the FCC's new rules to router
operating systems were pretty scary when
they were dropped a while back the short
version is if you turn off DFS that's
dynamic frequency selection in a five
gigahertz router you can interfere with
the FAA stopler weather radar systems
panic let's block the thing well okay so
it only happens if you live close to the
Doppler weather radar systems which is
several locations in the US so the FCC
said ah no router OS could be capable of
changing those settings what's the
reaction well back in March tp-link said
they'd simply block the loading of any
third-party firmware forever that's the
easy route linksys when a very different
paths which ARS technica documents and
linksys wrt routers won't block open
source firmware despite FCC rules wow
that's a long title basically doing the
work to make sure third-party firmware
will still work with the router linksys
told ARs quote the hardware design of
the wrt platform allows us to isolate
the RF parameter data and secure it
outside of the hosts firmware separately
which is great but not all linksys
routers are going to get open source
support basically the legacy and Mac
stream routers will have the full host
firmware lock down because hey they're
not marketed as the open source
champions like the wrt it's a bummer
open wrt developers the people that
actually make the open source firmware
say that linksys is the only
manufacturer that stepped up to keep
open source running on their hardware
and that the open wrt team is right
to work with other hardware
manufacturers hopefully some of them
will show up for the party because hey
you're not doing a very good job of
supporting most your router's i'll link
to linksys wrt routers won't block open
source firmware despite FCC rules right
downstairs in the show notes I got a
flash Death Watch update for you and a
great quote at the risk of sounding like
a gramophone record that is stuck in a
groove writes naked securities Paul
Ducklin for the third month in a row
adobe has pushed out a flash update that
patches a zero-day hole which means for
the third month in a row flash has
discovered an open gaping security flaw
that it had to smooth a little spackle
over and that's one more reason to
uninstall flash from your PC and one
more reason why Chrome's continuing to
minimize flashes footprint in the
browser by the way if you have a
disabled Chrome's flash plug-in manually
it might be time now when I say chrome
is minimizing I pretty much mean
blocking it by default ventureBeat
reports that by the end of the year
Google's Chrome browser will quote only
serve flash by default for the top ten
domains that still depend on the plug-in
chrome will default to html5 video
playback in most places and users will
be asked if flash is allowed to come out
and play before it's turned on of course
if you dig into the chromium dev website
you'll see those ten sites include
pretty much the biggest sites on the
internet like YouTube Facebook Yahoo
twitch amazon and Yandex okay and dot
mail.ru so expect plenty of flash hell
to keep rolling out on the internet for
a while yet couple last thoughts before
I go ARS technica reports that Missouri
politicians have again failed to block
municipal broadband the latest attempt
was snuck into a bill that prohibits
traffic ticket quotas and it was another
scumbag II effort to slip in just a
little bit of text there to prevent well
small towns and cities from providing
decent broadband service in Bloomberg
text says the switch message system has
been used for another online banking
theft the bank is yet to be named back
in February hackers attempted to steal
close to a billion dollars using the
Swift messaging system around 80
millions made it to the Philippines from
Bangladesh's account at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York almost all the
rest of the transactions were blocked
before they could get anywhere
our featured comment today comes from
stall Curtis who in response to ATM
skimming up five hundred forty-six
percent says it's not surprising that
only this many developers think that
security is a top priority because
actually most developers from larger
companies don't even have to concern
themselves with placing security
measures those things are taken care of
by separate security teams that provide
developers with a bubble they can work
in this way developers can spend more
time developing than trying to make sure
their code is ultra safe most of the
time their code will operate in the
bubble and nowhere else anyway that's
mentioning the development part of
course things like random USB sticks or
another story developers should not
compromise security in any way thanks
for the comments if you got any thoughts
on today's stories leave them down below
