console an arcade emulator ever all day
and more this time on hack 5
hello and welcome to hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen my name is shannon moory
it's your weekly dose of technical us
welcome everybody to our awesome episode
very I'm feeling very technologist show
we're doing video games right I don't
know how I feel about you feel it all
technology over there I love me the
video games whatever I'll do the show
solo check this out
heck no you won't oh did you know by the
way that the arcade buttons over on her
side of the set are snubs overrides oh
that could be your hackers movie name
Snow's override that's alright terrible
terrible so if you guys have been
keeping up with our main series as of
late you'll know that we are working on
collaboration with our sister show tech
thing which I'm on with Patrick Norton
we are building an arcade cabinet
specifically it's a sit-down cocktail
cab which is going to be super cool I'm
I'm super excited I've never built
anything yes as far as Hardware goes
like to buffers or prefers hammer to
those I don't know I can build a PC all
day but you put a hammer in my hand and
I'm just like well it's reason to tune
in to tech Fang alright
our task is sort of the software on the
hak5 side and previously we talked about
some of the emulation options for
playing old arcade games and Linux but
today yeah taking it a step further
we're going to our choice of the
software Locka yes salaka is a Linux
based operating system based on retro
arch and the libreta Rose ecosystem and
it's beautiful so I think that we should
go ahead and take a look at some one
that we have built out so people can see
how it plays a video game right so check
that out ok so this is the system menu
and we're just I'm gonna go over here
and you can see we have tons of games
I'm gonna go over to Super Mario Kart
and go ahead and enter into that click
run and let's see if we can view it yes
I'm gonna do awesome oh one player yeah
let's do two players there you go 50cc
on your hundreds oh yeah okay are you
gonna be towed
of course I'm towed man what you always
picked oh this so very okay I'm you know
she yep to play okay won't play okay
yep yay oh I'm so excited I haven't
played this game since it came out and
well it was last week ha ha ha all right
so I'm top your bottom that was awkward
are you gonna leave that in totally okay
well anyway they kind of get the idea
that I'm obviously owning her right now
that's it but your mom actually in
second that doesn't make any sense so
anyway you gotta get the idea this is
awesome and here's how much beautiful
thing about this I mean you can
obviously tell at this point that Locka
is more than just a main machine I mean
sure don't get me wrong we can play
Galaga and defender and asteroids and
Robotron all of the classics but it'll
also emulate classic consoles like 3do
Atari DOS almost everything in Tendo has
ever made SNK the scummvm so you know
what what - Monkey Island basically
everything se has ever ever made the
Sony Playstation and the PSP just to
name a few so mind just blown because
one emulator to rule them all I
shouldn't make references to movies that
I have never seen you like oh yeah
that's that's what's happening next so
originally though interesting little
tidbit here laka was made for the
Raspberry Pi
hence the fruit-based name I didn't know
that that was well that is laka means
cloudberry in Finnish what is cloudberry
it's a Pokemon item and Pokemon go
assuming I'm not really sure maybe heals
your Pikachu anyway it's really simple
it installs by USB because this is 2016
so we don't use CDs and DVDs obviously
it doesn't support virtual machines
because this is an arcade machine yeah
give it real Hardware real actual harm
you know actual hardware so feature wise
it's actually quite complete the best
that I've seen so far with emulators in
fact in addition to emulating all of
those platforms with a beautiful menu
it supports multiplayer which you saw
savestate which is really great I love
the multiplayer hang on because that
requires like the layers awesome
multiplayer means net
I yeah you could be at home and I can be
at home and we could be playing Mario
Kart together throwing some FaceTime or
Hangouts or whatever happened savestates
of course for all those old-school games
I wonder if I could save games that
previously didn't have same things well
no that's the whole idea with the save
state is you're in the middle of a
Galaga run and then like somebody walks
into the room its tracks you you hit the
save state and then like if you die you
can just kind of restart playing netplay
of course Wireless game pads which is
really cool rewind so you can do a
rewind in your game after you exit or
jump off the cliff in Super Mario World
graphics shaders and then get this it
does firmware updates on the go because
that's important we were previously
talking about the difference between OS
based versus having all the separate
components and this one in particular
while it is its own OS with all of the
goodness baked in they support doing for
more updates which means you're not
going to lose all that hard work that
you've done to make it all pretty and
stuff all right so with all of this you
might be wondering at this point what's
it going to take to build all of these
well you will need somewhat decent
hardware for this project it's bets to
do it on an x86 box with some kind of
Intel graphics like for example we are
using this Intel nook and next unit of
computing yeah and then you want to use
a fast faster single board PC like an au
droid xu4 or a Raspberry Pi 3 you can
also do those two if you want to
yeah controller wise it officially
supports a few different options you
have of course the very common game pads
the xbox360 controller you will need the
USB dongle that Microsoft sells to make
at work or the PlayStation 3 controller
specifically the ds3 or any of those ds3
compatible ones that you'll find so
that's just yeah any of those DualShock
3 compatible controllers so you might be
able to save a few bucks there so this
actually you could use the ps4
controller but why spend the extra money
on something you're not going to use
half the features of and I will point
out that in fact it will work with the
boot to do it will work in fact with the
bluetooth SNES controller that we use
here to automate some of our live
production at hack 5 this is the SNES 30
by 8-bit do it's about 30 bucks on
Amazon we'll link to it in the show
notes
but kind of a nice controller in fact
we'll link to the full list in the show
notes because there are a plethora of
controllers that it will support so how
do I get this thing installed yeah to
get install it is very similar to any
other distros so you might be familiar
with the whole rigmarole of you know you
image something over to a USB Drive you
install off that and Bob's your uncle so
if you have done this before with Kali
or a boon to you should be very familiar
with this basically you're going to need
a PC to start with that you'll download
the image from on - preferably Linux
yeah though you can do this on a Mac or
Windows box and you're going to need a
flash drive with like 4 gigs or more for
gigs plus there you go
and that's pretty much it and then so
what we're going to do is when we get
back now that we've shown you what you
will end up with we are going to go
ahead and dive into installing and
setting up lock up on our nook yes a
first quick word from our sponsor come I
owned you in pokemon red blue and yellow
comm is an example of a domain name you
could own and when you have a brilliant
idea to come up with such a thing you
could do what Shannon and I do which is
to head over to domain.com they have a
very simple domain discovery system
that'll help you find the perfect domain
for you and they're simplified checkout
process means your website is going to
be up and online in no time and get this
the guys over at domain comm huge fans
of AK 5 and they have just the hook up
for you that's right 20% off all you
have to do is use the coupon code hak5
at checkout and then you're going to get
instant awesome savings and get this
domain home has been supporting hack 5
for years and years so you should tweet
them some love at domain.com and say hey
thanks for supporting hack 5 and when
you think domain names think domain.com
we are now back and we are gonna get
ready together Daka installed on our
nook alright I can't wait what no I
guess you could actually play that on si
was it on SNES no is on Gameboy but
there was a game boy super Gameboy thing
for SNES we put the Game Boy games now
how'd you send the cartridge ok so
anyway first off you're gonna need that
PC on which you'll be installing Locka
in our case it's the end
knuck and you will need a monitor a
mouse and a keyboard at least initially
and this is just going to basically get
it set up and then you can actually use
your joysticks I will grab you a oh hey
Yammer here we have the yeah we have
however both of them are USB powered so
it's very easy it's not ready
yeah I'm sorry so once it's all set up
you can pretty much command this thing
fully over a gamepad so we have our ps3
Dual Shock ds3 controllers and you can
get these off of Amazon I believe
they're only what they're like
they're super cheap 20 bucks or 30 bucks
yeah so they're pretty cheap it's not a
bad price at all so to get your
operating system Locka you want to grab
a copy of for your operating system over
at la cote v / get so you can find that
over here and it looks like so so I'm
going to use the Linux installation
guide since I'm using Ubuntu 1604 and
you'll notice that it has installations
available for a ton of pcs there's
raspberry three two and one surprisingly
there's the Odroid so you have a lot of
choices I am using the Intel nook which
funnily mouse just so happens to have a
picture of the until nook and then we're
going to download the x64 version unless
you have a 32-bit PC and if you do it
must be extremely old so I'm sorry about
that and pretty much it's as simple as
just following the guide online so I
just unzipped it through the GUI so I
just right clicked on the zip file and I
chose extract here because I'm lame and
I use the GUI sometimes and you end up
with this really long and this long file
that ends in dot IMG for an image file
so all you'll have to do is follow along
with the on-screen instructions it's
basically just downloading the image and
then using our favorite imaging tool
which is DD to copy the Installer over
to your thumb drive and again that's a 4
gigabyte or over that size thumb drive
so I can install so locate your USB
Drive a really quick and easy way to do
that is to go over to your command
prompt so I'm going over here to my
command prompt and I actually have my
USB flash drive not plugged in right now
so I'm going to type in LS tak L
slash dev slash SD star so for wildcards
so this is going to pull up any kind of
drives that are currently installed on
this machine and it's only going to find
my hard drive which is partitioned into
a and B now next I'm going to go ahead
and plug this back in flash drive give
it a moment to register and you'll
notice that it popped up in my GUI of
course but I'm going to go ahead and run
that again and it shows up as SDC with
one and two so you'll notice that it's
SDC and it has a couple of different
partitions so now that we know which
thumb drive we're going to be using we
can actually wipe it and install laka
image onto it which by the way make sure
that you choose the right SD star
whatever it might end up being your USB
so that you're not wiping your PC oh
yeah yeah don't II don't actually type
SD asterisk cuz that could be bad don't
cuz you well because you know if an SD
yeah lock is a really great operating
system for playing fun and games but if
you have a computer for getting work
done it's gonna be a real shame when you
reboot it and find out that all it does
is play video games I've never done that
but I've heard that people have yeah so
of course warning don't yell at us if
you do that on accident so to do this
I'm going to run sudo because I'm not
running in root DD if equals so that's
input file yeah input file equals laka /
/ x86 yeah dot image and then you can
just tab complete of equals or so this
is like an output file yep slash dev
slash and in this case it's going to be
SDC so once you have the thumb drive
imaged you basically just need to boot
your lack of box to be off of the USB
and then you follow the on-screen
installer so let's go ahead and do just
that so here we are
I'll take that Donna Donna and then plug
in the power on the nook just goodbye
llaca that was pre-installed turkey out
of the oven that's right we are
destroying the turkey and creating a new
one also editing or production note here
and that is that because of the way that
this runs as like 640 by 480 or
something like that we can't use
naturally switcher so magically there is
now a monitor on the table and you'll be
wondering what is that it is the menu
that you will receive when you boot off
the USB which point simply says run it
live or install it to disk so we want to
install it to our desk by the way kind
of awesome that you can run this off of
the USB Drive itself you just want to
try it out it's kind of like Kali or
Ubuntu or anything else these days live
is awesome so I'm gonna go ahead and say
random color and we're going to go ahead
and choose the quick install and we'll
choose the drive in our case it is the
250 gig SSD and say ok and it's like do
you want any able the SSH server and
you're like yeah let's do that and then
you'll say ok fine let's confirm all
that let's confirm all that and boom
we're pretty much done at this point all
we need to do is go to reboot will
unplug the USB drive in just a moment
seriously that couldn't been simpler
yeah it was so easy I mean it's very
small os and then it installs and you
can see sis Linux just did its thing and
just a moment we'll be able to switch
over hahaha and actually if I unplug
this VG or this HDMI cable plug in that
HDMI cable and switch to that camera and
no that does not like our scaler however
it does like this monitor so as you can
see we are now presented with if it
boots very quickly though yeah we end up
with this we have a menu now the menu we
can go through with the keyboard is very
easy menu to understand but there's a
few tips that we should probably remind
everybody absolutely so now that this is
up and running the next thing you're
gonna need to do is load it up with some
ROM so you have something to play so a
few quick tips about the networking side
of things DHCP is enabled by default so
guess what that means that your lockup
box is going to be looking for an IP
address from your DHCP server which is
most likely your home router or whatever
you have which means on boot you're
going to want it plugged into your
connection over Ethernet we're going to
cover some of the more esoteric stuff in
a later segment as far as like Wi-Fi or
things of that nature
SSH it is well at least in our set up we
by default which was really nice and
you're probably wondering well how do I
get into this box root password is root
so just make sure you hook up that
ethernet cable to the laka computer and
then from another computer on your
network you're going to go ahead and
browse to the Samba share and go ahead
and start copying over roms and
basically you're going to find a bunch
of folders and one of them is going to
be labeled roms and it should be very
quite obvious now as far as getting the
IP address of this machine on the
network if you go in the main menu down
to information which is right there and
then go down to network information oh I
can find that it has an IP address of
one 27.0 to 0 1 ah obviously it does and
it is it in addition to its IP address
on our network here cool so all I would
do is for instance on a Windows box you
would hit start run type in backslash
backslash that IP address and it would
open up the Samba share and there's no
authentication required you can just
start copying games right over awesome
if you're in Linux it's a little
different but you know it's pretty
simple it's just the same way without
any other network share we also have a
few tips on playing the games first off
if you want to navigate your game list
all you have to do is hit enter and then
play on whatever that game is and I know
from playing with one of these it's
either orange circle or blue X I'm much
more used to Xbox the ps3 wired
controller is officially supported you
just have to press the center button to
get it to turn on and connect to your
Locka emulator and then you can play two
player games that's completely possible
but keep in mind you have to press that
center button on both of them and if you
plug in a second one in the middle of
your game or at the beginning of the
game the second one is ended up ending
up going to take control oh so the
second player is going to end up being
the one that can go through the menus
and everything controller fights just
like when you were a kid exactly yeah oh
man my little siblings they hated me
with my controllers right I was junior
mint I was very another time I was
stickler about that
right and then I do have a couple of
different show notes to add a couple of
links that are really important as
figure as far as like joypad
configurations in case you aren't using
the ps3 or the Xbox one also enabling
Bluetooth which is going to be a little
bit tricky but it looks pretty fun I
think we should try to yeah I think a
follow up which is in order but this is
just the bare bones to get started and
then adding BIOS so there are some newer
video games like for example from
Nintendo that require a BIOS
configuration to make the game run on an
emulator now we're talking about
emulating the BIOS not necessarily
modifying the bios of your pc so don't
get you guys it's not like we're gonna
be flashing over some weird firmware and
lacA does do a really really great
documentation over on their website at
locket TV slash doc slash home so if you
have any questions or concerns or
anything like that they have a huge
community and enterprise and lots of
guides so it's really easy to understand
how to install this and get it up and
running on pretty much anything yes I'm
very happy with it so far
props to these guys this is the just the
slickest setup I've seen yet and I can't
wait to build one of these for my home
because I did say I'll need to get my
contra on I'm gonna steal this up up
down down anyway with all of that oh man
I'm so excited it's been such a
fantastic week did you know we have some
really fun events coming up here in the
very not-too-distant future really what
contest with hack 5 is coming up with
this which is an amazing experience in
information security training unlike
anything else because it is very
immersive very storage driven almost
theatrical one could say where we teach
the ins and outs of the Wi-Fi pineapple
the land turtle the USB rubber ducky as
well as Metasploit to tie it all
together with the likes of myself and mu
bik's and sebastian and it's so much fun
as well as all of the other you know you
and Shannon you are Shannon and he tell
you Matt
ya know we've got you know Sara shows up
and there's an Emily and who knows who
knows we'll just come up with some names
but I don't know where at all with
squirtle will be there charm
and ER I will be making an appearance no
zubats we like where else we will be
going to ten pen test with hak5 calm it
is much more organized than the show
September 16 through 18 place or now
we're also going to be going to Def Con
at the beginning of August I almost said
end of this month beginning of next
month
it's Def Con 24 we are going to be there
like in full force with the whole team
and we're going to be setting up a booth
in the vendor room we do have a special
friend that is joining us
oh that's right yes you may know him
from Shaam shoe or any of the other fun
stuff it is Brian brushwood we'll be
bringing out some of the scam stuffs
things so I can't wait to see what's in
his bag of tricks yeah as well as our
friend dual core with the epic drinking
all the booze and hacking all the things
so it's going to be a fun Def Con I hope
you guys can make it out we may even
have a special event where we all go to
the movies which would be really fun
because hashtag fake Def Con and I'm
gonna leave it at that four and five
yeah it's time thank God I tagged Matt
Damon so um feedback at hak5 org is
where you can send complaints about our
impressions mention as well as comments
below so please keep those coming as
well as a che K shop comm I should
really point this out you guys have been
supporting hack 5 for years and it's
because of your direct contributions to
our efforts here as we develop
penetration testing equipment like the
land turtle USB rubber ducky and Wi-Fi
pineapples so if you want to support us
and get cool gear
HHA shop comm is where you can do that
and lastly hack 5 hak5 org that's where
you can find all of the shows all of the
merch all of the events all of the hosts
it's just a wonderful place ties it all
together thank you it's almost as
wonderful as pokemon go almost we we
need to do another walk around the
warehouse yeah we do yeah with an
infestation yeah yes
zoo back what man okay with all of that
said i'm darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
trust your techno lust
we're gonna have junk pets seriously did
you catch our man no not yet
first jump cut ever on hack five in over
ten years and we have time jump cuts now
I'm gonna play the Sailor Moon game I
found Eevee oh that's right load up
