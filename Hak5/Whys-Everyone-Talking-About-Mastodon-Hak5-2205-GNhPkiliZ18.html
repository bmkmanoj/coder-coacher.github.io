and more this time on hack five hello
everybody welcome to this episode of
hack 5 I am Shannon Morse and this is
your weekly dose of technology you will
notice that there is no Darrin kitchen
here again I am co-host less he is still
on his hack across the planet trip I
don't know which country he's in right
now he's been traveling around a lot I
believe last week he was in Australia
and he did an Australian meet up over in
Sydney so that was super cool let me
know if you guys were able to join in on
that let me know how it went and how
drunk Daron got because I'm indeed very
curious but this week I am taking on
another segment all of my own I wanted
to talk about something else that you
guys might be interested in because it's
been getting a lot of news so let's talk
about social networks again yes we have
talked about this before on hack 5 we
did a segment way back in season 18 it
was episode 18 11 I believe specifically
we were discussing Seneca which was a
distributed decentralized social network
alternative to Facebook as kind of long
formatted but check out that episode if
you have never used a decentralized
social network so you can kind of get
the gist of it basically a decentralized
social network means that it's not just
run on one company server under one
company's rule you know one ring to rule
them all but with a decentralized
distributed network anybody can run an
instance on their own server and
hopefully they are interoperable with
each other so that you can chat with
folks on other instances unless it's
some kind of closed environment for some
reason maybe it's a closed Club or
something like that but in this case it
would be an open format so today I am
checking out Mastodon yes Mastodon dot
social to be exact this is a new social
network scene because it's an
alternative to Twitter and everybody is
really excited about it so I was just
like I was like why why are you guys so
stoked about this so I decided I would
check it out because not only is it free
but it's also open source their source
code is actually available over
github so you can totally check it out
for yourself and here is their open
source information along with a very
nice little detailed explanation of what
Mastodon is in case you want to set up
your own instance and if you do let me
know we haven't set up a hack five
instance yet but it might be in our
future so let me know if you guys want
us to create an instance so why would
you use this exactly
well timelines are chronological it's
not like Instagram where you get
whatever is the most popular whatever
likes that they assume that you're going
to put in based on your algorithm and
there's no ads or anything like that you
can use up to five hundred characters
per post as opposed to Twitter which is
only 140 they also accept videos and
gifts or just depending on who you are
both of those work in the timeline you
can also choose the privacy settings per
post instead of per profile I think this
is really cool if I just want to post
something just for my followers I don't
have to make my whole profile private
which is what you would have to do on
Twitter so I could make one post private
and the rest of them would be public for
anybody there's also no ads like I
mentioned previously and the API is
totally open so you can make your own
instance there's even a ton of apps
already available for mobile all have a
little bit more on that in a bit as well
as my explanation on why I have not
downloaded one of those yet so choosing
an instance this is kind of complicated
there's a lot of instances that you can
choose from it's slightly time-consuming
because you have several options so if
you were to go through all of these and
kind of pick out which Club you want to
be part of it would take you all day so
luckily you can sort this list depending
on your preferences like you can sort it
by do they have HTTP turn on and are
they graded for that well and so on and
so forth so you can choose one like that
several the ones that I clicked on here
weren't in a language that I could read
as far as their explanations like there
are a lot of French ones in here here's
one here's another one so I didn't
choose those I just ended up going with
an English one and then I ended up
choosing mastodons dot network so that
was easy enough for me and Wow BBC you
are just
flooding my timeline thank you so much
for that flood of information really
appreciate it so with this I also made
sure to choose one that is HTTPS because
that is very important to me and it was
somewhat popular so I could get kind of
a quick idea of how it works so if you
are curious I decided to test out masses
on network for this episode the nice
thing about mastodons instances is that
they are federated which means that
whichever instance you want to sign up
on you're going to be able to follow and
read tweets from other instances
including the main one now keep in mind
whenever you sign up you have to verify
your email so I used my public work
email because I wasn't so sure about
what I'm signing up for here just like
any other thing that you're just now
signing up for you're putting some
inherent trust in that company to take
care of your email and not sell it now
looking over their Terms of Service they
say that they're not going to sell
anything any of your data they do log IP
addresses though so it might be
beneficial to use the VPN while using
mastodons so keep that in mind one of
the nice things that they do include
other than HTTP is two-factor
authentication so that's available via a
QR code just scan into your app of
choice whether it's Aussie or Google
Authenticator or whatever you might
choose so in the web browser the well
the time line looks a lot like TweetDeck
so I can definitely see where they got
their idea from so it's really easy to
get a feel for it you start out with a
very clean slate you don't have anything
in your home browser because you're not
following anything yet nobody's
following you so you won't see anything
there and then you can choose your local
time line which is going to be just your
instance or you can go back and choose
the federated time line so that's pretty
self-explanatory federated is all
instances and the other ones local is
just your instance you can also search
for people above your own name so you
could go over here so for example I can
search for Shannon Morse because I'm
logged in as snobs my other one
I definitely signed up for too and then
I can add myself right there how handy
is that now if I want to log out or do
anything like that I can just click that
button right there and then I can log in
with my account by clicking login which
is the small little button right there
all right so now that I'm logged in
under my Shannon Morse name I'll go
ahead and tell you a little bit more
about how to use the service so first
off after searching for somebody and
following a bunch of people you probably
want to start tweeting well it turns out
that in Mastodon tweets are called toots
which honestly just sounds like a fart
joke to me so I don't know have fun with
Tooting I guess so two options I just I
can't see that with a straight face it's
so hard for me I'm such an immature
child I'm such an immature child sorry
guys alright so moving on so we're going
to do some toots so for example you have
a whole bunch of options here so I can
set up a Content warning if I want to
something that is for adults only
I can also toot something publicly or
unlisted private or direct so this is
the thing I was talking about earlier
where you can switch it on a tweet basis
I'm going to just say tweet because it's
way easier for me
and I can also upload media here so I
can just click on that and upload videos
just gifts or photos so another thing
that I wanted to mention is you can add
emojis with that little button right
there which is super cute and all of
them work very similarly to like slack
or any other interface that you use
where it just gives you basically just a
word in the middle of a couple of colons
another thing you can do which you don't
necessarily see online since I already
set up my account is you can set up
desktop notifications and little sound
pop-ups whenever you sign up now if you
do want to turn off the sounds or turn
off desktop notifications you can do all
that through your settings which is
found through your profile now your
profile is found at a very very strange
little link which looks like this so if
I click on my little header right here
not edit profile but just my little
image it'll pull up my profile and this
is what my profile looks like I've only
tweeted a couple of times and then this
is what my profile number is so it's
nine one eight zero and that gives me
direct access to my profile so if I want
to tweet something I can say recording
hak5
and I'll put a little smiley face just
because
I should put a pineapple yes pineapples
and there's my toot so it shows up in
home and it'll also show up on my
profile if I click on my profile again
so there it is
so if you're using Mastodon and you want
to find people you have to log in and
then find at Shannon Morse at Mastodon
dot network to follow me for example you
can also search for me right above my
name look for at Shannon Morris and then
you can hit the little plus icon to
actually friend me so that would be my
first problem with this unless someone
knows your name it's going to be really
hard for them to find you on Mastodon
because either you have to show up in
their timeline somehow either through
the federated one or the local one or
you have to know their profile link
which is a number and does it
necessarily work so you have to know
their name I guess also people on other
instances can use the same name as you
and there is no way to report them for
being a poser or anything like that at
least not that I can tell so that would
be a problem for me as far as banning
goes they don't except neo-nazis racism
sexism and excessive advertising so
those are all banned from Mastodon so it
sounds like they're trying to be very
anti company anti like establishment
type format it there you can report
tweets though so if somebody tweets
something that you seem you think is
against their Terms and policies so
let's say maybe somebody had a problem
with me recording hak5 oh nevermind I
can't report my own tweet ok so BBC
you're my target I'm going to report BBC
and then it will give me an option based
on all the different tweets that they
have done lately and then I can just hit
submit that's about it for reporting so
it's actually pretty easy to do so
another thing you can do is you can
reply to their tweet you can favorite it
or retweet it so this would be called
boosting and mastodons and you can also
favorite it so this will actually add it
to your favorites list now here's
another problem that I noticed while I
was using Mastodon you can't actually
delete your account so far what I've
seen at least at time of recording is
that they don't have an option through
your settings to delete your account and
if you email them they can't really
delete
either because of all the different
instances that your tweets will appear
on so it doesn't seem like an option to
delete it so once you have one set up at
least right now it's set up for good now
mastodons is currently being supported
just through a patreon account and
luckily they're making a little bit of
money on it so that's awesome so support
them if you want to you don't have to
I'm not you know paid to do this or
anything so guard Ron is creating
open-source software and this is the guy
that actually created Mastodon and he's
been doing a lot of development on it
and he's just being supported through
their PayPal and a Bitcoin address for
the Creator along with there's a bunch
of volunteers who are doing their own
work
they're moderating they're setting up
instances and stuff like that now if you
want to set up your own instance with
the source code all you have to do is go
pull it from their webpage and we did do
a recent episode about how to work with
github so definitely check that out if
you never have of course that had to do
with the bash buddy not necessarily
pulling a bunch of dev code from github
to do your own instance but it's similar
in that way now another thing I wanted
to mention is apps so I mentioned this
previously there's currently a few apps
in development which you can see on the
github listing but I'm not super
comfortable with downloading any of them
on my phone until they are confirmed
they're a-okay and they are full
released products there is one here
called tutti-frutti which is on Google
Play so that's a little bit more
comforting but yet this is unreleased
and there haven't been any reviews or of
it or anything like that
so I'm going to wait until I download
one of these in the meantime I've just
been using it in the browser on my brave
browser on my phone till then so you can
set up notifications on your phone
through the browser so that's not a big
loss there I just leave it on in a in
one of my tabs but it will be nice once
an app is finally released on the Play
Store and there is one on iOS so if you
check that out let me know lastly there
is also a Twitter cross poster so you
can use some Python code and simply to
set up a little cross pro ster if you
want to post as well over to Twitter
from your Mastodon account this just
requires a little bit of Python code
then you have to hack it together of
course they do have information
pertaining the docker as well so if you
use the docker software you can update
it and use this through the docker app
which is pretty cool and seems pretty
easy to do I have not done this yet let
me know if you have used this and if it
works so my biggest question to you is
do you think Mastodon is going to live
for very long because there are so many
social networks that come onto the scene
and when it comes to decentralized and
distributed social networks there's not
many but it seems like there's just a
very core audience that uses those kinds
of things this is the first time that
I've seen a decentralized social network
that looks good and it works in the
browser and it works very well and yes I
am aware of gene you social and I'm
aware of you know diaspora and the
friend of cuz servers and stuff like
that so I've checked all very many of
them so so far Mastodon - my favorite I
do like the idea of free and open source
Twitter alternatives especially since
Twitter seems to be full of ads these
days so it's not necessarily my favorite
place to be I'm just not sure yet if
this is going to catch on or if it's
just going to die like every other
social network that has attempted to
come onto the scene and take over and
just hasn't been able to do it
alternatively as the outsiders ourselves
do we want this to catch on or do we
want to keep it to ourselves so I
apologize in advance for doing a segment
about this because I'm sure it's going
to draw in many more people but I don't
know like do we want it to catch on or
do we want it to just be our thing so
let me know what you guys think in the
comments and I'm going to be right back
after this break you've got a great idea
bring it onto the Internet's the way
there and then I do using domain comm
with an awesome domain discovery system
in a quick and easy checkout process you
will have your perfect website up and
running in minutes and the guys over at
domain.com
they're huge hak5 fans and they want to
hook you up with the coupon code hak5
for 20% off and as usual make sure to
send them a tweet at domain.com and let
them know how much you really appreciate
them for supporting hack 5
I know I do every single day so remember
when you think domains think domain.com
all right that about wraps up mastodons
on this episode of hack 5 but of course
Darren's going to be back next week with
another episode
you can definitely look forward to that
in all of his travels I'm sure he's
going to have another awesome vlog for
us
check out hack across the planet calm
for all the meetup updates Darren did
just have a meet-up in Sydney so make
sure to sign up for all of his future
ones because he's going to have plenty
before he's back here in the studio also
I wanted to remind you guys I'm going to
be down in Australia at author next
month in the Gold Coast Australia which
I believe is a city in Queensland
I don't know America we don't really
learn that much about Australia and the
different cities and where they all are
so I have to look everything up on the
Internet's these days but at least I do
my research I think it's Queensland so
let me know if I got that wrong feedback
at hak5 org is where you can email us
and let us know what you want us to
review on future episodes or what kind
of hacks you want to see on the show
because we're always looking for cool
segments to show you guys and hack shop
calm that's a check a shop comm is where
you can support us directly and we've
really appreciate everybody who checks
out the site and just you know browses
the store and find cool things that they
want to check out hack $5 - follow is
where you can find out what we are doing
and I think that's about it so with that
I'm going to say trust your check nos
