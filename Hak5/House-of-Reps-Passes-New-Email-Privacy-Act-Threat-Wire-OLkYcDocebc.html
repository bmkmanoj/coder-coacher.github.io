recovery more secure visio is watching
you and the ECPA sorely needs an update
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings i am Shanna Morrison this is
threat wire for tuesday februari 7 2017
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
this show is now on iTunes as well as
your favorite podcasting app thanks to
our patrons over at patreon.com slashed
throat wire so make sure to subscribe
and now it's on to the news the first
story being all about Facebook again
which is kind of weird they usually
don't go in through out wire two weeks
in a row but forgetting your password
yeah it totally sucks so Facebook is
trying to fix that problem by making the
process more secure and easier right now
we depend on security questions like
what is the name of your childhood pet
to authenticate ourselves and change our
password if we forget it these questions
can be social engineered out of anyone
pretty easily even through their
Facebook profile how ironic if sometimes
they are not encrypted properly on the
site SMS or email one kind tokens for
password recovery also lack end-to-end
encryption and depend on more than just
the sites protocols they also depend on
your carrier your email provider etc so
starting last week Facebook will allow
you to get recovery credentials for your
github account through Facebook this is
not the same as 0 off which you've
probably seen on sites that say login
with Facebook or log in with google or
whatever they might say in this case you
would use HTTPS encrypted links and a
github recovery token which is saved
with your Facebook account if you lose
access to github the recovery token from
Facebook it sent over to github with a
timestamp neither side shares personal
information about the person and the
token is also encrypted Facebook will
use rate-limiting so if someone gains
access to an account they cannot use
this token to get into other sites that
use a service all at once it limits the
rate at which a token can be used to
access sites simultaneously facebook
wants to make this available for more
sites than just github so they have open
source the protocol on their own github
page
they have also included this in their
bug bounty program so if you are a
security researcher and you find a
vulnerability with it you can get pays
you can't trust anyone these days you
can't even trust your TV not to spy on
you although I feel like we kind of
already knew that in a Monday ruling by
the US Federal Trade Commission Vizio
has to pay 2.2 million dollars to the
FTC and the New Jersey Division of
Consumer Affairs for installing software
that collected viewing data on 11
million TVs without user consent or
knowledge now Vizio has to disclose
practices they can no longer
misrepresent the data they collect and
they have to implement a privacy program
plus a biennial review they also have to
delete any data from before march first
2016 this was the outcome of a really
long investigation into Vizio smart
interactivity feature which was
collecting watching data from those TVs
and then selling it to advertisers and
it's not just information on what you
are watching on TV they also knew about
data from set-top boxes from your DVDs
from over-the-air broadcasts and they
had data on your gender age income
education household size the value of
your household and household ownership
and also marital status just to name a
few physio says the software never
paired viewing data with personally
identifiable information such as name or
contact information and the Commission
did not allege or contend otherwise
instead as the complaint notes the
practices challenged by the government
related only to the use of viewing data
in the aggregate to create summary
reports measuring viewing audiences on
behaviors oh by the way the software
also periodically included IP addresses
to the collected information yeah Vizio
is not admitting fault in the settlement
of course the ecpa or the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act is a
thirty-year-old act that has a fun
little loophole allowing for warrantless
collection of US citizens emails that's
right the law considers any emails still
on a server older than 6 months to be
considered abandoned and open for spying
on currently Congress is trying to
update the ECPA with the
House of Representatives passing
unanimously the email Privacy Act which
would require warrants for online
communications that are over 180 days
old this also applies to file stored on
cloud servers like photos on Facebook or
documents that you might share on
dropbox which we highly recommend that
you should be encrypting before storing
on any cloud server anyway but that's
beside the point the house did pass
reform last year too but it expired when
Senator Jeff Sessions and Senator John
Cornyn added surveillance amendments to
the reform secessions is most likely
going to be Attorney General at the time
of recording his confirmation vote was
not complete he will also likely resign
from the Senate on Wednesday after
voting in devos which means a reform
made I'll be possible for the ECPA
before I go I want to give a huge thanks
