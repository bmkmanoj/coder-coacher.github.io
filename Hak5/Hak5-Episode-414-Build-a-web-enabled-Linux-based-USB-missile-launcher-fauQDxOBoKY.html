by go daddy Netflix and the hack house
strategic missile defense program and
coming up on this episode cellphone
emulators the hack House USB missile
defense program easy Linux
administration with webmin and user minh
burning ice owes to thumb drives running
applications in kiosk mode and much more
hello and welcome to hack five this is
your weekly dose of Technol us and we
are your hacker zombies at least tonight
we are yeah most definitely
dare made me try I usually draw berry
margarita mix well the the margaritas he
made the episode before last we're
really good so food why not mix it up
didn't work out so you don't mess with a
good thing they said the same thing
about our show but look at now oh that's
true so we've got some awesome stuff for
you guys this week as always it wouldn't
be an episode unless I said exactly
those words yeah
and let's just go around the room talk
about what's going on what we're doing
starting with you cuz I'm not it thank
you
yeah I think you totally calling it
every time so I I had to work Thursday
that really blows to him yeah so I was
at work upgrading some ESX servers the
International people that would be
Thanksgiving yes Thanksgiving Thursday
and so BIOS updates and ESX updates and
all that happy horse stuff and then I
come today and I find out that the the
VMware converter beta and ESX betas have
just been released
like literally less than 24 hours ago
it's an egg Amol work to do so well I
mean I've got to test them in a lab and
all that other so yay cry me a river
come on you know you know I'm just gonna
beg him for a segment now cool well yeah
I mean it's it's a continuation of we
still haven't gotten into the whole
virtualization great so just when you
thought your segments were golden they
had to go and really some bit is make
everything else you know effing my stuff
up you know I I can't even get my head
on straight so had my wisdom teeth out
yes how did that go well not on vicodin
right now okay that's good that's good
yeah yeah I was think about taking a
trip to like in Atlanta today but all
right now but but yes I am feeling
better hopefully I can eat some bw3
wings after the shoot and but but I mean
yeah I mean I had them on on Tuesday
really didn't have any pain just some
bleeding that first day
and now it's that's what the viewers
tuned in for - it's just you know blood
there you go but but now this week this
episode much like I showed you guys how
to do service control with Windows I'm
gonna show you how to do custom commands
in a GUI that is freely available freely
you know easily installed a webmin and
user min custom Linux console commands
ooh
so web base so I don't have to like drop
to SSH and get my bash on bingo
you know what Batchelor stands for it's
not born again shell it's it's something
that you do with your keyboard in your
face well yeah yeah and you have a habit
of breaking them well anyway on that
note Shannon what's going on over there
girl no much today I'm gonna be talking
about some cell phone emulators for your
computer pretty good thing for the
holidays I think coming up you know try
it before you buy it and Matt I
definitely feel your pain I'm working on
Thanksgiving I used to do that like 4
years in a row pretty much working at a
pizza place so this is my first year
actually off since I started working at
that a unnamed bank so I feel your pain
dude hooray for Petey oh wow I just
don't understand how well I'm okay let
me ask Shannon before we get into what
you're doing or do you want to just
Karen were you crazy busy working at a
pizza place on Thanksgiving yes I don't
why do people order pizza on
Thanksgiving like I can understand going
out to a restaurant and eating turkey at
the restaurant or eating something oh
wait I know I footballs oh that makes
sense
yeah football see I was the smart Cooper
bachelor a couple years ago and and did
the great thing on see I did this before
like most holidays when I didn't have
anywhere to go or anything to do and
didn't have an awesome show living in a
house with hackers so I would the night
before crazy holidays like Christmas and
Thanksgiving where everything closes and
gets crazy just stock up on some pizza
and just throw it in the fridge there
you go
Trey no pie for tonight and a pie for
tomorrow why not yeah so I'm playing
with I'm playing with toys this episode
I'm gonna be doing so many people ooh
where's lytic so then while I'm doing my
next Fi well where's the Wi-Fi stuff and
I'm actually going to be doing some of
that here soon but right now I'm playing
with toys toys that absolutely
frustrated Darrin
this week and last week yeah you
wouldn't talk about the that if you've
been tuning into the hack house you saw
Tuesday night Darrin pulling his hair
out going it has now been eight hours
and I have not made any progress it has
now been ten hours there's no progress
you know how that feels when you're
trying to get a hack it's a lot
different when you have a deadline of
everything has to work on Friday night
because you're shooting it was it was
not a good day to be living in the hack
it really wasn't
while Darrin's getting all that up let
you guys know about hack house comm
that's H a KHOU s e.com it's here in the
lower thirds and we've got pretty much
our entire first floor on on film you
guys can watch it at any time during the
day there's audio chat with everybody
involved inside the the chat room and we
scrolling down here you can actually see
the setup that that we've got we've got
two sony DCR hCAT 5s in USB mode and
we've got a monitor showing us the chat
so we can talk to you I mean
yesterday
I was down here no two days ago I came
down at like 2 o'clock in the morning
because I was like ok I need to go to
bed you know that kind of thing I have
one more cigarette before I go to bed I
ended up coming down and talking with
the internet for another hour and 45
minutes I think that might have been
because of the vicodin but anyway that's
what you can look forward to when you're
doing into hack now's calm you can even
get the Adobe AIR application yes
because jay-z man was awesome enough to
do that so so toys toys this is another
feature that will become part of the
hack house this is the second USB
missile launcher that we purchased now
this one's actually a dud it moves
beautifully as you can see but the
second I try to fire a crash to the
application I've tried several
applications at this point this this one
actually isn't
sending it back to Amazon but we have a
working one that we're going to be
talking about a little bit later in the
show that is web enabled with with a
webcam and a GUI on this website that
you can go to right now and start
panning and zooming around the hack
house and start shooting little phone
missiles at us and it's got a laser so
you can play with the cat she went nuts
over it the other day that I hooked it
up it's definitely one of more
entertaining things that we've ever done
yeah for you guys um aside from this
show well then I mean think about right
the first episode for the for those that
have been sticking with it since the the
pilot one XO one when the premiere
segments was how to control your
household bytes over your cell phone and
this is really just kind of like another
one of those fun home automation things
with a nice twist that is annoying my
cat and anything that we can do to
crowdsource annoying the cat because
there's only four of us here we got
stuff to do
we can't annoy it 24/7 we need your help
so log on the hack house get on the
missile launcher and start we have
designated times that we actually screw
with the cat yes that's thirty seven
thirty seven o'clock you know whenever
we're all here but now you can you know
make sure that she's screwed with all
during the day so obviously we'll have
all that info later on in the show but
now are we releasing all this stuff here
like other source and source yeah
when this release is on Wednesday
everything's gonna be so people could go
buy one of these things and they can set
up their own let's not do the segment
beforehand but yeah basically
Touche yeah there you go I can't wait to
see so let's get this on the roll cool
you know what I can't wait to do what
get my frag on and half-life to
deathmatch yeah tell us about that
Shannon well I think that since we've
gotten on revision3 they haven't been
introduced to Kirby no they really
haven't I mean she's been on the live
cam but she has not actually been on the
show so you too can up with this cat she
doesn't like to be held she hates being
held I'm looking forward to the emails
from PETA yeah definitely but no she
really loves us she's very talkative and
she follows us around we love the kitty
very much
I need to make a quick note about that
because I need to dispel this it's que
ERV why not Kate IRB why because it's
named after Kerberos the authentication
mechanism not the little pink poofy
thing in NES land and you know I'm not a
Nintendo fanboy no no not at all
and Matt doesn't like unicorns exactly
because they're you know better than
ponies
alright so land party yeah let's get
this show on the road uh in just a
couple of weeks we're gonna be playing
half-life 2 deathmatch I gotta say
prepare to get dominating because I'm
I'm alright at this game I'm pretty good
I think my favorite weapon is probably
the crossbow of course I usually miss
really bad anyway it's December 13th
just a couple of weeks and you can play
with us a game at 5 org and I would like
to say thank you to our sponsor Netflix
with Netflix you can rent over 90,000
titles online including lots of blu-ray
titles with free shipping both ways to
your home they now have over 40 shipping
centers so almost all deliveries happen
in just one business day the Netflix
plans start at $4.99 and as a new member
you can get a no-risk two week free
trial membership check it out at WWF
flexkom slash hack 5 and please don't
forget the www next up we're gonna take
a break and I'm gonna go get me some
more of the strawberry crappy margarita
so you're at your office you've thought
about your firewall you've thought about
your fire suppression system now what
about your physical security system well
here to help us with that and show us
the USB missile defense program is
Darren who has been banging his head
against this for the last two weeks
Darren yes well I got this great idea
and that is let's make the hack house
war interact if not just you know
passive viewer and chatting with the
residents right but let's actually give
them something to play with very akin to
some of the stuff that we did in the
first season so when I saw one of these
guys over at like pink cake here you
know the mecca of awesome toys for geeks
like ourselves I was like this is
perfect
I'll throw a webcam webcam on it I'll
you know do like the old PHP Apache cell
phone darren segment and let the let the
internet control it and then when I saw
the striker too had lasers I was like
dude you know yeah frickin lasers so the
idea was let's crowdsource
annoying the cat because Kirby let's be
honest all cast they love lasers and and
you know playing with them is fun but we
got stuff to do so let's get you guys to
play with the cat for us and then you
get the added bonus of shooting a little
yeah okay yeah so we got lasers we've
got missiles yeah and we got our can it
possibly be how hard could it possibly
be so let's check out the you know there
there's a you actually when you when you
get one of these guys you get this
awesome software here oh it's it's so
robust let me let me show you guys here
this software is as you can see the
crappity crap you just get your standard
like arrow keys to move it around your
space to shoot it works in Windows great
right
and then there's actually supposedly an
API played with it and c-sharp actually
two other two people have helped me like
convert the c-sharp app into like the
console app because I was thinking about
tying it together with PHP the hamachi
all Darin style not so much so I looked
at some alternative software for Linux
right right because there's pretty
active commune
behind these sorts of things in a weird
sort of way not in a in a way that
they're all in one place but everybody
had the same idea at once so one place
to look at is here Luke Cole has a place
where he's actually put together USB
missile launcher drivers for a couple of
these and these are just a dime a dozen
out of China there's like three or four
variations of them and this one was nice
except it was not for this particular
unit so I looked at this one it's a Java
software version for what I thought was
the striker to the version I had and
written in Java and again no dice
so how many how many did you actually go
through before you found six success yes
it should probably note David here has
another one for the Mac okay and then of
course there is this Python version
that's pretty sweet here you can get it
over the URL and it's alright except it
didn't work pretty though it doesn't
work right and then there's the idea of
oh hey let's control to the wet over the
web so you know I've got all of these
links in the show notes this one's
another Python implementation with a a
PHP front-end it hasn't work and I'm
like going crazy here until I find
finally find an implication
implementation that works and that is
Alex Suzuki's Linux drivers for the
Stryker two USB missile launch here and
it turns out that the boards were
actually different the instructions are
actually different even though the USB
vendor idea is the same okay when they
added the laser to this unit things got
a little wonky so so this is actually a
C++ app that one of the the hack
stalkers if you will found that that was
a coded ninja okay I know us and were
like oh my gosh this actually works so
fired up you buy a new bunch of box here
and I've got that or maybe I want to
show it off make sure that Paula gets
the Ubuntu queued and and see and you've
got your standard you know your WS ad
controls you can hit space to fire and
all that fun stuff and it works you see
that Paul in that great we got laser
control
and are you seriously doing the cylon
thing alright that's cool that's cool
those are HD cameras and we they're
expensive to replace by the way whatever
alright so we can control it in Linux
great we are almost there right okay
well the thing is we're not gonna write
something where we actually pass WASD to
this application we need to turn it into
a console application yeah we can send
arguments to and that's exactly what we
did and and my C++
I took some in high school so it's been
about eight years I'm a little foggy you
and me both
yes but somebody came to my come to my
aid and I've got to give mad props to
Jason Applebaum we're putting together
not only modifying the C++ application
but also putting together a little job
front-end back-end dealy so that you
guys can totally log into the hack house
and play with USB missile launcher so
let me show you what that looks like
I've got it over here on my laptop and
pull that up and this is actually the
Java code for the client and basically
it it is a Java applet that that has a
whole bunch of buttons for moving it up
down left right whatever and in the
version that will be up soon just takes
your standard wsad keyboard input I got
fired up and clip in Eclipse here and
for you Eclipse Java developers he
actually showed me this really sweet
plugin called swing builder and if I
click over to design here you can
actually see this is right here in
Eclipse I can actually design my GUI
just like I would like visual studio or
something and I can move this around
with the laser button over to here and
now I have a what does that remind you
of anything
harkening back to maybe the NES days oh
you know yeah so I hope to put together
something where you guys can submit
skins so we've like an NES skin and some
other so the other ones to play with so
great we've got a Java applet and then
on the back end we actually have a Java
server you want to first show off the
the the modified C++ program on the
ubuntu box sure okay so the way that
this works is we shut off the first
stryker where you
hit the WASD this one you just see
striker and then the like RL U and D for
left right up down and then how many so
you could just go like left 200 or
something and you see the guys moving
around okay yeah so so we this would be
an efficient to just pass all this to
you know we've got the command line work
and but yeah even this would be
inefficient to try and send multiple
commands over to so well I mean we could
if we wanted to we could run an apache
server on this box with a little bit of
PHP I could put a button together that
when you clicked it it held it told it
the system command to run strike or you
tend to move it up 10 or whatever but
then we'd have to give up the home IP
address and that we have a whole lot of
fun did it no so we can go ahead and so
we've got a Java server okay so this
Java server listens for commands from
the web server which is also running the
applet for the client so if you go ahead
and run that here okay it's not really
too much to it just little boxes telling
us you know what we're listening to and
whatnot
well if I come over here to the client
on my Acer I'm actually you know the the
viewer here I'm gonna go over to hack
house calm and this is just temporary
page so don't hit this it'll be at hack
house comm with a big you know shiny
flashing buttons and whatnot I get a you
stream window here so I can actually see
the webcam that's going on in the
missile launcher and I've got a
beautiful interface here where I can
start telling it stuff you've restarted
the server so I need to refresh the page
that's fine it crashed well hey you know
what happens alright so make sure that
this is running again and it's running
alright and I hit up the applet now it's
a self-signed applet so I'm gonna get a
thing here from Java telling me that
that when I ran eclipse I totally effed
over my java so what's close that oh and
let's try to refresh this page now
okay so I'm going to go ahead and run
this now it's a self-signed application
so you get two standard security prompt
under security one I promise you it's
not gonna do evil stuff okay go ahead
and run it and now and of course my
Ustream as well so I can see those
beautiful hanging lights there in the
kitchen and not so much with the
advertisement there I almost close that
alright so now I can actually point it
around I'm controlling the missile
launcher just like you guys would over
the web for the moment it's just you
know
button clicks go ahead and fire this bad
boy one thing to know here is the power
is actually how many ticks or degrees
not necessarily degrees but I can I can
change it to like 50 so that when I go
right 50 it actually you know moved a
lot more okay so you can get that finite
control you can put it down to two one
and and get the laser exactly where you
want so the cat freaks out yeah and who
hadn't fire the missiles so there you go
we've we've totally web enabled a USB
missile launcher one that actually works
one that actually works we're sending
this bad boy back but I'm gonna get
another one because I have a lot of mean
this guy shows a lot of promise I mean
it'll move 360 which is a lot nicer than
this guy's 270Â° motion basically does no
further
they shoot about 20 feet whereas these
are more or less survived yeah this uses
compressed air these guys use they're
spring loaded okay so I'm looking for
something with kungfu grip this does
have a laser which is very nice maybe we
can do some custom stuff for the
manufacturer who knows but the and then
of course where do we go from here right
right laser range-finding because if we
can shoot a laser I'm gonna take a look
at the image and see how big the dot is
and based on that kind of figure out how
far away things are and then maybe we
could put up like I don't know different
like bull's eyes around the hack house
so login and so there's a whole bunch of
different stuff that we can actually do
around this project not just shooting
lasers and you know missiles at a cat
but we can actually
you know like you said laser
range-finding motion-tracking yeah you
can so drop a wiimote to this guy and
it'll actually find infrared stuff and
track it I'll have a link to that it's
pretty cool so where when do you think
we will be able to well it's online
right now it's it's all mine right now
you can head over to hack ascom and play
with it or if you're interested in the
development if it even if it's just you
want to beta test and submit like your
experience with it if you want to if you
every Java developer and or if you're
Python PHP whatever and want to do some
front-end stuff head over to the hack 5
forms and their projects we have board
for it so that you can get in on the
development of this guy source code
fully available and all that fun stuff
so if you've got one of these you can
also run it at home right protect your
own network a mess with your own cat so
yeah and then you know from here there's
plenty of opportunities of tons of
missile defense mayhem I like it
yes well I'm for the sheer you know
satisfaction of actually not having to
hear you bitch every night that this is
garbage and I hate these applications
I'm glad you finally got it working
there and you know mad props to Jason
Applebaum yeah I got you were talking
like a mucker for forever I mean you
know he's gonna be down here in December
okay I think it's December 18th or 19th
he's down here so we're gonna shoot
something for the episode and and you
guys will see the man behind the is an
awesome CS student that helped me out
the missile defense program yes I'll
throw programmer programmer yeah there
you go yeah
the missile defense programmer behind of
the USB missile defense program program
yes I like it
rock on all right hit us up on hack
house let us know how it goes hit up
performs and now let's find out more
about tasty trivia and
first person shooter stuff first-person
shooters
nice alright last week's trivia was
based on a narrow stream of atomic
clusters of liquid mercury or tungsten
accellerated by high voltage what device
was invented by Nikola Tesla in the
1930s and allegedly stolen by the
Russians thereafter and the correct
answer was Death Ray that was correctly
answered by swfu and Kirby PPC guys
we're gonna be sending you one of dual
cores new CD is called lost reality and
if you're into some nerd corn music
which I personally love you should check
out more of this music at dual corn
music.com and this week our trivia is in
the first technology preview of doom
dubbed doom evil unleashed what do the
secret messages say about Jules and Tom
if you're the first person answer this
right actually you know what I think
we're gonna surprise you this week we're
gonna give you a prize it's gonna be a
surprise here the first one to answer
this right on the hak5 forums i'll PM
you and we'll get the ball rolling and I

I'm gonna be talking about some cell
phone emulators as soon as Darren gets
over to my set
so today as we shoot this show it is
officially Black Friday I know it's
scary and I actually for some reason
left the house it was a mistake I almost
got ran over serious well a lot of
people this holiday season a lot of geek
in particular that are watching are
probably going to be thinking about
mobile operating systems particular one
particularly once so you can put in your
pocket that make phone calls but they're
not just telephones anymore we've got
our palm based phones we've got our
windows mobile based phones we've got
our blackberry phones we've got your
your Nokia is there's so many of them
and how are you gonna decide this
holiday season
well one really really good way to
decide is just try to download a selfie
cell phone emulator there's all sorts of
different ones that you can download and
they're available all so what's the cell
phone emulator what does that do
basically it's a cell phone in your
computer ok you took all of these and
you squish them inside the PC yeah
pretty much
so I have three up right now I have the
Windows one I have a palm Central right
here which I'm familiar was because I
have a palm Central and then I also have
this new one the blackberry storm it's
kind of pretty I kind of like it I'm
rocking the blackberry curve right now
I'm thinking about upgrading this
Christmas and I'm not really sure what I
should do and it's a big big deal
because I mean yeah yeah well I mean a
lot of things it's like a two-year
commitment or something like that so
you're right you should probably figure
out what you're getting into before you
I mean not only is it like what
applications are available but it's also
can I stand this phone can you stand the
interface that comes along with this
phone yeah because it doesn't matter how
great the applications are if you can't
I mean the phone could be adorable it
could be pink but what have you hate the
interface okay so you've got windows
palm and blackberry which would be your
three major platforms here in the US and
I guess overseas everywhere else yeah
you're right I phone
as particularly symbian cross pond what
about those I mean they left out what's
the deal there they're not left out at
all you can find emulators for those as
well of course I didn't download all of
them yeah that would take way too long
to go through okay so what what kind of
thing should be we be aware of when we
go ahead and run a mobile phone emulator
um one of the things that you need to be
aware of is that a lot of people who
make applications for cell phones they
could use these emulators so if you like
to develop your own applications if you
want to develop something for an iPhone
you could try it on one of these
emulators before you actually come out
with it in in the iPhone store or if
before you want to bring it to one of
the major contractors there you go
thought that's great I mean especially
if you know you want to put something
together and like c-sharp for it was a
dotnet C e or you know j2me whatever
yeah you can so you don't have to go
ahead and buy one of these devices and
ferry over an SD card and my favorite
part about this is just playing with the
interface the phone works on the
emulator exactly like it would work in
real life not only do you have the
classic cell phone outline right here
but you can also use it as if you're
using the blackberry or using the palm
the palm right here at the Centro it has
a touchscreen when you get the phone
itself yeah here you you use your mouse
of it as if you're touching the screen
with your finger mm-hmm or with your pen
or whatever it comes with right so you
can go around here and check out
different things I can click on it just
like any other cell phone and we can
load up applications we can browse the
internet we can what all we actually
tried to do a blackberry application but
that well just tried the wrong kind of
did we try jad file it needed to be
something else but yeah well anyway and
this is the new blackberry the what does
it call again like very storm suite so
if that's kind of on your mind like it
is on mine probably want to play with it
before you actually plunk down the 973
dollars this one's kind of cool because
if you ever if you go into one of the
menus say camera is a bad choice if you
go into let's do contacts there we go
you can hold down the right click and it
works just like the
a ball that comes on a blackberry yeah
you hold down the right click on your
mouse and then you click the left left
mouse click yeah
clickety click click on one of the menu
choices and it brings it up so it works
just like any of the old school ones
that you might use there you go now if
if you're interested in checking out
these as well as other emulators where
you go where you can find out more info
well I actually found this on the HACC 5
forums moonlit did this entire review of
like six different ones and that's where
I got the idea so thank you so much and
I'm also gonna do a little bit of an
outline on my own blog so you guys can
check that out I promise to update it
this time there you go awesome
well we are going to I take a quick
break and then see what Matt's up to
Alex
all right so a couple of weeks ago Matt
you showed us a little front-end system
that we could put on a Windows server so
that we could delegate control of our
game servers crowd sourcing I think it's
the theme of the show yeah you want to
tell us how we can do this in Linux
using some fun web stuff yeah I got I
got an email from one of our viewers and
basically asking look I you know I
administer a couple Linux boxes you know
here and there and I need a way to do
some custom stuff and also make it
easier for me so that I don't have to do
because let's face it people who use
Linux not everybody loves the command
line okay No
so okay that being said what I did is I
went on a hunt and actually found some
software that I used way back in the day
and found that it's still actually out
there and is still an active development
the tools called webmin and so this is
what what is webmin for those like is it
like sea piano like no it's it's
basically taking the most you know use
features of what you're gonna use a
server for specific ami stuff the common
stuff your boot up your shut down your
you know disk and network access network
monitoring hardware PHP configuration
all these things that a standard you
know Linux server is gonna do you can
now do in a GUI on the web now cPanel is
mase basically made you know
specifically for hosting okay
well this is not multiple people okay
this I mean how does giver it differs in
you know basically cPanel is installed
is set up an auto does everything you
know set up creation you know this just
gives you a GUI interface to do it
yourself okay
so you know you'd have to go in and you
have to change the HTTP handlers you
know you'd have to go in and do all you
know mime types you know PHP
configurations everything that you would
normally if you were running a single
site on a Linux box but you would have
to do via the command line we can now do
in a GUI great so instead of just giving
SSH access to our individual users and
saying hey have fun have at it with
some bass scripts they can now come into
something a little bit more
user-friendly if you will right yeah I
mean it's it's so pay me a picture
what's our scenario here our scenario is
okay we just don't have you know the
manpower because we've got you know
we'll say 20 servers and we're not using
a control panel software which normally
you have to pay monthly for web this is
free and open source this is free and
open source like it I can create your
own themes you could skin it as you want
you know so on and so forth update at
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
disk quotas you know here's an example
so we've got home user of our home - you
know we can go through and we can
actually see basically everything that
you know you're gonna find on I mean
this is my live box that this is my live
you know web hosting server so these are
all the user quotas that people have set
up okay so you know going through and we
can actually look at running processes
all via the web webmin has a utility
that plugs into webmin which is called
user minh so it's basically like instead
of webmin is the control for the entire
web server user min is control for just
what that user has access to exactly we
can customize it yes we can I think you
know a little bit about web hosting
being you know the guy behind divergent
networks and all that fun stuff so
you've had you know and your clients are
not just your typical I want to host a
web page as much as they are I'm trying
to do something a little bit custom and
need some like one-on-one thing here
yeah so you've used this to do like
custom web interfaces
yeah certain stuff I mean back before
game server you know before I had evil
lands you know before it was called that
I was hosting game servers for friends
and before control panels for game
servers are really prevalent I was
hosting on Linux okay and I built custom
control panels using webmin and use
Ehrman cool let's take a look so what
I'm gonna do is you need to install
webmin and then you need to install user
minh okay there are PMS our p.m. - I
yeah easy easy there's no configuration
beyond that why it's automatically set
up and you login so here we've got the
main webmin
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go into others and we're gonna go to
custom commands so now we can actually
create custom commands okay we're gonna
create a custom command and because I'm
a radio guy we're going to run a start
shoutcast script okay
the command is going to be SC serve and
the ampersand to run in the background
the directory doesn't matter what
directory it's whatever
if you're it's not in a bin folder or
like an S bins which is system-wide
you're gonna have to specify the
directory okay so we're gonna do root
downloads and we're going to run it as
root now you can specify to run it as a
web main user this is great because now
a user can run things as Roo and you
don't have to delegate them to use the
exact where no more no yeah hey run that
sue thing but because because when we
log in they're only gonna see this
command and they can't edit it they
never they never have sort exactly nice
so we're gonna we don't need to hide the
command there's no HTML or anything like
that so we're gonna go ahead and create
that and we're also gonna create another
one which is going to stop the shoutcast
server okay we're just gonna do a kill
all 9 SC serve all right mom and we're
gonna run this as root as well so you
don't have to enter the password here
and create nope no because it's it's
pulling all the user information from
the system we don't have to create users
now you can create separate webmin users
that are not part of the Linux users and
groups okay so they only have access to
the web front-end and you can specify
commands to run as other users what's
its gonna look like as a user so what
this is gonna look like as a user and
we're gonna go into so we're logged in
as root just because I know the password
there you go and we go to hold on we
have to go and set it up and say that
it's available in user man there you go
so making it available my apologies
that's okay so we'll go ahead and work
my Java earlier it happens this is live
so I was fun you can watch a lot of the
custom commands there's a Friday there
you go you've got a star shopkins this
is what it looks like so I so any as you
I log into your system and now I can
certain stuff shoutcast server without
having to know the root password nor do
I have to know anything about this whole
bash thing right yeah nothing but what
we can actually do is make sure that
it's not running okay and it's not
alright so we will go ahead and start
the server and actually just go ahead
goes ahead and prints that to our
console yep we can turn that on and off
just depending on whether or not there's
something I don't know I'm sensitive
exactly yeah and so now you know what
I'm done using it so let's go ahead and
stop it and kill all and let's go ahead
and refresh and see so you can not only
make certain to stop the server you
could say play this playlist or play
that song or you think you could use
something similar like this to I don't
know maybe like web enable or stereo so
the kids at home can I don't know change
the music at our house it's quite
possible yeah we might think about
something like that so you jump
crowd-sourced you know playlist
generation crud let's just crowdsource
everything I like it okay
the one big thing that I did want to
show you guys yes there's a lot in
webmin there's a lot okay like what else
so everything in here this entire list
just give me the highlight reel
the highlight of system you can specify
servers networking what I wanted to show
you was the granular control that you
can give people that log in okay so if I
wanted to I can unselect everything here
and only select custom commands and they
would only have access to the custom
commands field so squid proxy server and
send mail server and pro FTP they would
never see that when they logged into web
been nice so it's really great and if
you guys spend a little time with it you
know you might think to yourself wow wow
why don't I just use Windows no it's
just making your life easier yeah at the
end of the day being assisted mean
that's what it's all about the more time
that you have to do other things you
don't dick around you know trying to
remember what the command was the more
 you're gonna get done so I
recommend you guys go to web mint.com
and check that out
sweet alright and this was based on some
questions that you got
email I think we also have some other
emails Shannon what kind of questions we
get from the users the viewers questions
for you guys this week the first one
comes from my personal friend Jenny
she's a real big fan of like music and
she's creating her own DJ music one of
her friends he's a DJ and her plan for
this is to throw this really big party
and have him DJing at a table with a big
projector screen behind him and then
she's gonna have like this little kiosk
Ian standing back out in the crowd with
her own computer her own home computer
running a bunch of different emulators
different video games that will play on
this projector behind the DJ which I
thought is a really cool idea her
problem with this though is that she
doesn't want to have people getting
access into all of her other
applications she just wants to have it
stuck on this one emulator or this one
or two different emulators so is there a
way for her to keep people in those
emulators instead of letting them out
into any anything else so they could
like put viruses on it um it sounds like
there's really two parts to this one she
doesn't want her machine to get effed up
and two she doesn't want to let people
outside of the application you wouldn't
take that first part there the not
borken of my machine is something that
we talked about a couple weeks ago with
windows steady state
it's absolutely bulletproof once you get
it locked down and set up with your
permissions and what application that
can actually run what parts of the
system they have bulletproof okay once
you create that disk
you know cache you're good to go now the
the question kind of changed when she
read it that last time I wasn't prepared
for the second part which is letting
somebody out of an application do you
have any insight on that
I mean well what I'm thinking here is
basically she needs to run the
application in a kiosk mode I know that
it's possible to actually change what
your shell is in Windows from something
like will obviously explore dot exe to
something else we've we've touched on
things like this in the past as far as
its concerned like with like light step
and different new eyes if memory serves
me right you can actually tell it an app
like
Asian I don't know what kind of
stability or what kind of other things
go into that so I this is where we take
the question and open up to you guys we
could obviously sandbox it was something
like sandbox II we could run it in a VM
from what I understand about Jenny go
her equipment not like so super powerful
I mean because here's the thing right
emulators well it sounds trivial they do
some weird stuff with video yeah that
not a lot of times are going to be very
happy yes with emulate with running in a
VM I mean you're basically running a
machine emulated inside of a machine
emulated it it gets crazy so I'm
wondering what you guys think about not
just sandboxing but also restricting use
I know that there's actually with like
some programs have kiosk modes like you
might RI explore with the - K parameter
it puts it into kiosk mode there are
actually plug-ins for Firefox to do
something similar so that you can't exit
it great for if you go into a trade show
like CES you want to show something off
and not have people yeah yeah up with
your machine so let me know if you guys
have some ideas of how she could get
this done hit us up feedback at hak5 org
or just go ahead and post it up on the
hi-5 forms so yeah it should be good
yeah yeah we also have a second question
from one of our Ustream viewers it's
used to ream to eight five eight nine he
asks I have a recovery CD that I need to
boot from my EPC is there a way to burn
an ISO to a USB Drive yes there is in
fact it is a program that I have as as a
netbook user I you know my second
netbook I'm looking at the third I know
I know Christmas and there are totally
ways to do this
what you want to look for is this
program called unetbootin okay a newborn
know you net Booton I know right but
still way better than ponies I try so
basically what this application does is
it takes a generic ISO file that you'd
normally burn to a CD in action just
right sit to the USB so you can
seriously just boot off of it cuz come
on modern-day machines we can boot off
USB no problem it's even cooler than
that right because this application will
let you not only just you know specify
your ISO but it will automatically
download the live distributions of
several popular Linux distros like
gparted to fix your MBR problems to
backtrack three to get your Wi-Fi
hacking on - you know abun - - just for
generically everything goes debian rules
right yeah anyway unetbootin move it
showed it to me i love it you guys
should check it out as well
I'll have links to all that fun stuff
and it has been my Savior because those
USB cd-rom drives pain in the ass you
got to remember where you put them and
then you know break them out and or if
you think oh I can get by by taking one
of these USB adapters with the IDE
Channel on the other one you know those
cheap ease that we all have from Fry's
or Micro Center or whatever they're
great but not all of them support
booting off of CD ROMs whereas you know
yeah whatever I digress it's very cool
stuff I've been using it a lot lately
just by having like multiple USB keys
with different operating systems so much
fun way easier than going through I know
backtrack three particular has its own
USB version but it's just so nice to
just grab any ISO and make it bootable
yeah so unetbootin I'll show you guys
next episode how to use it more
particularly with a way to offline
update Windows and Office has it how's
that first it sounds like a good idea
yes
anything else you want T's T's not so
much why don't I let you guys know if
you are not currently subscribed to the
AK 5 RSS feeds make sure you get on that
the links are finally fixed so if you go
over to the revision 3 side you get
subscription options iTunes Miro you
know all that happy heavy stuff and also
on the hack 5 site you've got up here in
the upper right it looks a little bored
because I use a map
you know I think that's Darrin that
needs to fix his CSS I'll get on that so
make sure you guys sign up for the RSS
feeds at hack 500 or revision three.com
slash hack 5 there you go yeah because
you don't want some you know day old
techno lesson yeah or if you're really
crazy hack a so come see it as we've
yeah yeah I do want to tease one other
thing and and this will become a new
giveaway if you guys haven't heard of
this this is a awesome documentary I've
got the DVD here it's called hackers are
people too I don't wanna give you too
much because I will be talking to the
director huh Ashley's for two we will
have her on next episode via Skype and I
hope that you guys enjoy that because
it's a really cool documentary about
basically hacker culture so she goes
around to different cons talks about
talks to a lot of people at Def Con and
torqulon's yes places like that about
what it is that hackers are and and I
think the quote that really resonates
with me was at the very end of the film
where she talks about if you were to
really show what hackers lives are it
would be a bunch of geeks just doing
laundry and if you watch the hack house
comm you know that yeah okay which is
laundry dishes yeah you know it's
hacking Apple TV's screwing with Xbox
code and USB missile launchers there you
go girl with the cat crowdsourcing
screwing with the cat yep
so so yeah I think that's uh that's
pretty much I think there was anything
else we had to do if you want stickers
high five double slash stickers oh we
still got a bunch of them got it I got a
new page for that do I've got it in dev
I haven't showed you look at the retina
HTML I haven't haven't implemented in
the WordPress you're gonna love this
because I figured out it I found it real
quick there's a PHP exec I know there's
a little old PHP exec just search that
in in WordPress and you can do PHP
inside of WordPress post or page and
then all of a sudden you can do awesome
dynamic stuff with your content
management system that owns check it out
hack 5 that org slash stickers for more
than just to direct my website a break
your face
next episode tune in for that anyway so
yeah I think that's pretty much it yes
without further ado we hope to see you
guys next week hit up a sub on the
forums follow us on Twitter all that fun
happy social media crap in other words
Oh more little thumb it's not all foam
drink it it's all foam get really
remember what happened last time Mary
