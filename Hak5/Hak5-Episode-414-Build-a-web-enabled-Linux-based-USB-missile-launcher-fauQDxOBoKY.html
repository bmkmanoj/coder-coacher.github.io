by godaddy Netflix and the heck how
strategic missile defense program and
coming up on this episode cell phone
emulators the hack house USB missile
defense program easy Linux
administration with webmin and user Minh
burning isos two thumb drives running
applications in kiosk mode and much more
hello and welcome hak5 this is your
weekly dose of technol us and we are
your hacker zombies at least tonight we
are yeah most definitely Darren made me
try hi Barry margarita mix so the the
margaritas you made the episode before
last we're really good so food why not
mix it up didn't work out so you don't
mess with a good thing they said the
same thing about our show but look at
now oh that's true so we've got some
awesome stuff for you guys this week as
always it wouldn't be an episode unless
I said exactly those words yeah and
let's just go around the room talk about
what's going on what we're doing
starting with you cuz I'm not it thank
you yeah thank you totally call it every
time so I had to work thursday that
really blows didn't yeah so I was at
work upgrading some ESX servers the
International people that would be
Thanksgiving yes thanksgiving thursday
and so BIOS updates and ESX updates and
all that happy horse stuff and then I
come today and I find out that the the
vmware converter beta and ESX betas have
just been released like literally less
than 24 hours ago it's an egg and more
work to do so well I mean I've got a
test them in a lab and all that other so
yay cry me a river come on you know you
know i'm just going to begging for a
segment now cool well yeah i mean it's
it's a continuation of we still haven't
gotten into the whole virtualization
great so just when you thought your
segments were golden they had to go and
release some betas make everything on
your effing my stuff up you know i can't
even get my head on straight so had my
wisdom teeth out yes how did that go um
while i'm not on vicodin right now okay
that's good that's good oh yeah i was
think about taking a trip to bike in
atlanta day but all right now but but
yes i mean i am feeling better hopefully
i can eat some BW three wings after the
shoot and but but I mean yeah I mean I
had them on on Tuesday really didn't
have any pain just some bleeding that
first day
and now it's that's what the viewers
tuned in Porto it's just you know blood
there you go but but now this week this
episode much like I showed you guys how
to do service control with windows I'm
going to show you how to do custom
commands in a GUI that is freely
available freely you know easily
installed a webmin and user min custom
linux console commands who so web base
so i don't have to like drop to ssh to
get my bash on bingo you know what
bachelor stands for it's not born again
shell it's it's something that you do
with your keyboard in your face well
yeah yeah and you have a habit of
breaking them well anyway on that note
shannon what's going on over there girl
not much today i'm going to be talking
about some cell phone emulators for your
computer pretty good thing for the
holidays i think coming up you know try
it before you buy it and mad I
definitely feel your pain i'm working on
thanksgiving i used to do that like four
years in a row pretty much working at a
pizza place so this is my first year
actually off since i started working at
that a unnamed bank so i feel your pain
dude hooray for pto wow i just don't
understand how well how many okay let me
ask shannon before we get into what
you're doing or do you want to just like
i don't care it's no structure were you
crazy busy working at a pizza place on
thanksgiving yes I don't why do people
order pizza on Thanksgiving like I can
understand going out to a restaurant in
eating turkey at the restaurant or
eating something oh wait I know I
footballs oh that makes sense yeah
football see I was the smart goober
bachelor a couple years ago and and did
the great thing on see I did this before
like most holidays when I didn't have
anywhere to go or anything to do and
didn't have an awesome show living in a
house with hackers so I would the night
before crazy holidays like Christmas and
Thanksgiving where everything closes and
gets crazy just stock up on some pizza
and just throw in the fridge there you
go Trey no pie for tonight and a pie for
tomorrow why not yeah so I'm playing
with I'm playing with toys this episode
I'm gonna be doing so many people
where's linux to the while i'm doing
linux Emma where's the Wi-Fi stuff and
I'm actually going to be doing some of
that here soon but right now I'm playing
with toys toys that absolutely
frustrated Darren she killed this week
and last week yeah you want to talk
about the that if you've been tuning
into the house you saw Tuesday night
Darren pulling his hair out going it has
now been eight hours and I have not made
any progress it is now been 10 hours
with no progress you know how that feels
when you're trying to get a hack it's a
lot different when you have a deadline
of everything has to work on Friday
night because you're shooting yeah yeah
it was it was not a good day to be
living in the hack it really wasn't
while Darren's getting all that up let
you guys know about hack house com
that's a che KHOU SE kaam it's here in
the lower thirds and we've got pretty
much our entire first floor on on film
you guys can watch it at any time during
the day there's audio chat with
everybody involved inside the the chat
room and we scrolling down here you can
actually see the setup that that we've
got we've got to sony DCR hCAT fives in
USB mode and we've got a monitor showing
us the chat so we can talk to you I mean
 yesterday I was down here no two
days ago I came down at like two o'clock
in the morning because I was like okay I
need to go to bed you know that kind of
thing I have one more cigarette before I
go to bed I ended up coming down and
talking with the internet for another
hour and 45 minutes I think that might
have been because of the vicodin but
anyway that's what she can look forward
to when you're doing in to hack house
comm you even get the adobe air
application yes because Jay Z man was
awesome enough to do that so so Toys
Toys this is another feature that will
become part of the hack house this is
the second USB missile launcher that we
purchased now this one's actually a dud
it moves beautifully as you can see but
the second I try to fire a crashes the
application I've tried several
applications at this point this this one
actually is
sending it back to amazon but we have a
working one that we're going to be
talking about a little bit later in the
show that is web enabled with with a
webcam and a GUI on this website that
you can go to right now and start
panning and zooming around the hack
house and start shooting a little phone
missiles at us and it's got a laser so
you can play with the cat she went nuts
over it the other guy show the day that
I hooked it up it's definitely one of
the more entertaining things that we've
ever done yeah for you guys aside from
this show well then I mean think about
right the first episode for those that
have been sticking with it since the the
pilot 1 X 01 when the premiere segments
was how to control your household lights
over your cell phone and this is really
just kind of like another one of those
fun home automation things with a nice
twist that is annoying my cat and
anything that we can do to crowdsource
annoying the cat because there's only
four of us here we got stuff to do we
can't annoy it 24-7 we need your help so
log on a hack house get on the missile
launcher and start Stefan would we have
designated times that we actually screw
with the cat yes that's thirty seven
thirty seven o'clock you know whenever
we're all here but now you can you know
make sure that she's screwed with all
during the day so obviously we'll have
all that info later on in the show but
now are we releasing all this stuff here
like other tours getting source yeah
when this releases on Wednesday
everything's gonna be so people could go
buy one of these things and they can set
up their own let's not do the segment
beforehand but yeah basically touche
yeah there you go i can't wait to see so
let's get this on the roll cool you know
what I can't wait to do what get my frag
on in half-life 2 deathmatch yeah it's
we want to tell us about that Shannon
well I think that since we've gone on
revision3 they haven't been introduced
to kirby no they really haven't you I
mean she's been on the live cam but she
has not actually been on the show so you
two can up with this cat she doesn't
like to be held I'll put it on she says
she hates being held I'm looking forward
to the emails from PETA yeah definitely
but no she really loves I she's very
talkative and she follows us around we
love the kitty very much
I need to make a quick note about that
because I need to dispel this it's k ERV
why not Kate IRB why because it's named
after Kerberos the authentication
mechanism not the little pink poofy
thing in NES land no I'm not a Nintendo
fanboy no no not at all and Matt doesn't
like unicorns exactly cuz they're you
know better than ponies all right so LAN
party yeah let's get the show on the
road uh in just a couple of weeks we're
going to be playing half-life two death
match I gotta say prepare to get
dominated because I'm i'm alright at
this game I'm pretty good I think my
favorite weapon is probably the crossbow
of course I usually miss really bad
anyway it's December 13 just a couple of
weeks and you can play with us a game at
five org and I would like to say thank
you to our sponsor Netflix with Netflix
you can rent over 90,000 titles online
including lots of blu-ray titles with
free shipping both ways to your home
they now have over 40 shipping centers
so almost all deliveries happen in just
one business day the netflix plans start
at four dollars and ninety-nine cents
and as a new member you can get a
no-risk two week free trial membership
check it out at WWF flexkom / hak5 and
please don't forget the ww next up we're
going to take a break and I'm going to
go get me some more of the strawberry
crappy margarita
so you're at your office you've thought
about your firewall you've thought about
your fire suppression system now what
about your physical security system well
here to help us with that and show us
the USB missile defense program is a
Darren who has been banging his head
against this for the last two weeks
Darren yes well I got this great idea
and that is let's make the hack house
war interact if not just you know
passive viewer and chatting with the
residents right but let's actually give
them something to play with very akin to
some of the stuff that we did in the
first season so when I saw one of these
guys over at like thinkgeek here you
know mecca of awesome toys for geeks
like ourselves I was like this is
perfect I'll throw a web webcam on it
I'll you know do like the old PHP Apache
cell phone Darren segments and let the
let the internet control it and then
when I saw the striker to had lasers I
was like dude you know yeah frickin
lasers so the idea was let's crowdsource
annoying the cat because Kirby let's be
honest all cats do love lasers and John
and you know playing with them as fun
but we got stuff to do so let's get you
guys to play with the cat for us and
then you get the added bonus of shooting
little missiles at us yeah okay yeah so
we got lasers we've got missiles yeah
and we got no more can it possibly be
how hard could it possibly be so let's
check out the you know there there's a
you actually when you when you get one
of these guys you get this awesome
software here all it's so robust let me
let me show you guys here this software
is as you can see the crappity crap you
just get your standard like arrow keys
to move it around your space to shoot it
works in windows great right and then
there's actually supposedly an API
played with it in c-sharp actually two
other two people have helped me like
convert the c-sharp happen to like the
console app because I was thinking about
tying it together PHP through nochi
aldaran style not so much so I looked at
some alternative software for linux
right right because there's pretty
active commune
behind these sorts of things in a weird
sort of way not in a in a way that
they're all in one place but everybody
had the same idea at once so one place
to look at is here Luke Cole has a place
where he's actually put together USB
missile launcher drivers for a couple of
these and these are just a dime a dozen
out of China there's like three or four
variations of them and this one was nice
except it was not for this particular
unit so I looked at this one it's a Java
software version for what I thought was
the striker to the version I had and
written in Java and again no dice so how
many how many did you actually go
through before you found six sex yes it
should probably note David here has
another one for the Mac ok and then of
course there is this Python version
that's pretty sweet here you can get it
over the URL and it's all right except
it didn't work pretty though doesn't
work right and then there's the idea of
oh hey let's control to the wet over the
web so you know I've got all of these
links in the show notes this one's
another Python implementation with a PHP
front-end doesn't work and I'm like
going crazy here until I find finally
find an implication implementation that
works and that is Alex Suzuki's Linux
drivers for the striker to USB missile
launch here and it turns out that the
boards were actually different the
instructions are actually different even
though the USB vendor idea is the same
ok when they added the laser to this
unit things got a little wonky so so
this is actually a C++ app that one of
the the hack stalkers if you will found
that that was a coded ninja ok then it
doesn't like oh my gosh this actually
works so fired up you buy a new bun to
box here and I've got that I didn't want
to show it off make sure that Paula gets
the Ubuntu cute and antsy and you've got
your standard you know your WS ad
controls you can hit space to fire and
all that fun stuff and it works you see
that Paul and that great we got laser
control
and are you seriously doing the Cylon
thing alright that's cool that's cool
those are HD cameras and we are
expensive to replace by the way whatever
alright so we can control it in Linux
great we are almost there right okay
well the thing is we're not going to
write something where we actually pass
WASD to this application we need to turn
it into a console application that we
can send arguments to and that's exactly
what we did and and my c++ i took some
in high school so it's been about eight
years i'm a little foggy you and me both
yes but somebody came to to my kin to my
aid and I've got to give mad props to
Jason Applebaum for putting together not
only modifying the C++ application but
also putting together a little job
front-end back-end deal e so that you
guys can totally login to the hack house
and play with USB missile launcher so
let me show you what that looks like
I've got it over here on my laptop and
pull that up and this is actually the
Java code for the client and basically
it it is a java applet that that has a
whole bunch of buttons for moving it up
down left right whatever and in the
version that will be up soon just takes
your standard wsad keyboard input I got
fired up and clip in Eclipse here and
for you eclipse Java developers he
actually showed me this really sweet
plug-in called swing builder and if I
click over to design here you can
actually see this is uh right here in
Eclipse I can actually design my GUI
just like I would like visual studio or
something and I can move this around
with the laser button over to here and
now i have a what does that remind you
of anything harkening back to maybe the
nes days oh you know yeah so i hope to
put together something where you guys
can submit skins so when we go like an
nes skin and up some other so the don't
supply with so great we've got a java
applet and then on the back end we
actually have a java server you want to
first show off the the the modified c++
program on the ubuntu box sure okay so
the way that this works is we shut off
the first striker where you
hit the WASD this one you just to
striker and then the like r lu + d 4
left right up down and then how many so
you could just go like left 200 or
something and you see the guys moving
around okay yeah so no this would be an
efficient to just pass all this to you
know we've got the command line work and
but even this would be an efficient to
try and send multiple commands over to
so well I mean we could if we wanted to
we could run an Apache server on this
box with a little bit of PHP I could put
a button together that when you clicked
it it held it told the system command to
run strike or you tend to move it up 10
or whatever but then we'd have to give
up the home IP address and that we had a
whole lot of fun with it no so we can go
ahead and so we've got a Java server ok
so this Java server listens for commands
from the web server which is also
running the applet for the client so if
you go ahead and run that here ok it's
not really too much to it just little
boxes telling us you know what we're
listening to and what not well if I come
over here to the client on my acer i'm
actually you know the the viewer here
i'm going to go over to hack house calm
and this is just temporary page so don't
hit this it'll be at hacc house comm
with big front you know shiny flashing
buttons and whatnot I get a ustream
window here so I can actually see the
webcam that's going on in the missile
launcher and I've got a beautiful
interface here where I can start telling
it stuff you've restarted the server so
i need to refresh the page that's fine
it crashed well hey you know what
happens alright so make sure that this
is running again and it's wrong alright
and i hit up the applet now it's a
self-signed applet so i'm going to get a
thing here from java telling me that
that when i ran a clips i totally effed
over my java so let's close that oak and
let's try to refresh this page now
okay so i'm going to go ahead and run
this now it's a self-signed application
so you get to standard security prompt
under security one I promise you it's
not going to do evil stuff okay go ahead
and run it and now and of course my
ustream as well so I can see those
beautiful hanging lights there in the
kitchen and not so much with the
advertisement there almost closed that
all right so now I can actually point it
around I'm controlling the missile
launcher just like you guys would over
the web for the moment it's just you
know button clicks go ahead and fire
this bad boy one thing to note here is
the power is actually how many tix or
degrees not necessarily degrees but I
can i can change it to like 50 so that
when I go right 50 actually you know
moved a lot more okay so you can get
that finite control you can put it down
to 21 and and get the laser exactly
where you want so the cat freaks out
yeah and who hadn't fire the missiles so
there you know we've we've totally
web-enabled a USB missile launcher one
that actually works one that actually
works we're sending this bad boy back
but I'm going to get another one because
I have a lot of mean this guy shows a
lot of promise I mean it'll move 360
which is a lot nicer than this guy's 270
degrees motion basically does little
farther they shoot about 20 feet wears
these are more or less survive yeah
something um this uses compressed air
these guys use their spring loaded okay
so I'm looking for something with kungfu
grip this does have a laser which is
very nice maybe we can do some custom
stuff for the manufacturer who knows but
the and then of course where do we go
from here right right laser range
finding because if we can shoot a laser
and take a look at the image and see how
big the dot is based on that kind of
figure out how far away things are and
then maybe we could put up like I don't
know different like bull's-eyes around
the hack house so log in and so there's
a whole bunch of different stuff that we
can actually do around this project not
just shooting lasers and you know
missiles at a cat but we can actually
you know like you said laser range
finding a motion tracking yeah you can
so drop a wiimote to this guy and it'll
actually find infra red stuff and then
track it I'll have a link to that it's
pretty cool so where when do you think
we will be able to well it's online
right now ish this it's online right now
you can head over to hack cast calm and
play with it or if you're interested in
the development if it even if it's just
you want to beta test and submit like
your experience with it if you want to
if you every java developer and more if
your Python PHP whatever and want to do
some front-end stuff head over to the
hak5 forms under projects we have board
for it so that you can get in on the
development of this guy source code
fully available and all that fun stuff
so if you've got one of these you can
also run it at home right protect your
own network a mess with your own cat so
yeah and then you know from here there's
plenty of opportunities of tons of
missile defense mayhem I like it yes
well I'm for the sheer you know
satisfaction of actually not having to
hear you bitch every night that this is
garbage and I hate these applications
I'm glad you finally got it working
there and you know mad hops to Jason
Applebaum yeah i got you were talking
like a mucker for forever I mean you
know he's gonna be down here in December
okay I think it's December 18th or 19th
he's down here so we're going to shoot
something for the episode and then you
guys will see the man behind the is an
awesome CS student that helped me out
the missile defense program yes auto
programmer programmer yeah there you go
yeah the missile defense program are
behind the USB missile defense program
program yes I like it rock on all right
put this up on hack house let us know
how it goes hit up performs and now
let's find out more about tasty trivia
and
first person shooter stuff yeah nice all
right last week's trivia was based on a
narrow stream of atomic clusters of
liquid mercury or tungsten a seller
rated by high voltage what device was
invented by Nikola Tesla in the 1930s
and allegedly stolen by the Russians
thereafter and the correct answer was
death ray that was correctly answered by
swf you and Kirby PPC guys we're going
to be sending you one of dual cores new
CD is called loss reality and if you're
into some nerdcore music which i
personally love you should check out
more of this music at dual core
music.com and this week our trivia is in
the first technology preview of doom
dubbed doom evil unleashed what did a
secret messages say about jewels in tomm
if you're the first person answer this
right actually you know what I think
we're going to surprise you this week
we're going to give you a prize it's
going to be a surprise if you're the
first one to answer this right on the
hak5 forums i'll PM you and we'll get
the ball rolling and i want to thank our

up I'm going to be talking about some
cell phone emulators as soon as Darren
gets over to my set
so today as we shoot this show it is
officially black friday i know it's
scary and I actually for some reason
left the house it was a mistake I almost
got ran over serious crime Alice oh well
a lot of people this holiday season a
lot of geek in particular that are
watching are probably going to be
thinking about mobile operating systems
particular one particularly one so you
can put in your pocket that make phone
calls but they're they're not just
telephones anymore we've got our palm
based phones we've got our windows
mobile based phones we've got our
blackberry phones we've got some again
Android your iPhone your your Nokia is
there's so many of them and how are you
going to decide this holiday season one
really really good way to decide is just
try to download a selfie cell phone
emulator there's all sorts of different
ones that you can download and they're
available all so what's a cell phone
emulator what does that do basically
it's a cell phone in your computer okay
you took all of these and you squished
him inside the pc yeah pretty much so I
have three up right now I have the
windows one I have a palm centro right
here which I'm familiar was because i
have a palm centro and then i also have
this new one the blackberry storm ooh
yes okay it's kind of pretty I kind of
like it I'm rocking the blackberry curve
right now I'm thinking about upgrading
this Christmas and I'm not really sure
what I should do and it's a big big deal
because I mean yep yeah well I mean a
lot of times it's like a two-year
commitment or something like that so
you're right you should probably figure
out what you're getting into before you
I mean not only is it like what
applications are available but it's also
can I stand this phone can you stand the
interface that comes along with this
phone yeah because it doesn't matter how
great the applications are if you can't
I mean the phone could be adorable it
could be pink but what if you hate the
interface okay so you've got windows
palm and blackberry which would be your
three major platforms here in the US and
I guess overseas and everywhere else
yeah you're right i phone
as particularly symbian cross pond what
about those I mean they left out what's
the deal there they're not left out at
all you can find emulators for those as
well of course I didn't download all of
them yeah don't take way too long to go
through okay so what kind of thing
should be we be aware of when we go
ahead and run a mobile phone emulator um
one of the things that you need to be
aware of is that a lot of people who
make applications for cell phones they
could use these emulators so if you like
to develop your own applications if you
want to develop something for an iphone
you could try it on one of these
emulators before you actually come out
with it in in the iphone store or if
before you want to bring it to one of
the major contractors there you go
thought that's great i mean especially
if you know you want to put something
together and like c sharp for was an
Etsy e or you know j2me whatever yeah
you can so you don't have to go ahead
and buy one of these devices and ferry
over an SD card and my favorite part
about this is just playing with the
interface the phone works on the
emulator exactly like it would work in
real life not only do you have the
classic cell phone outline right here
but you can also use it as if you're
using the blackberry or using the palm
the palm right here at the centro it has
a touch screen when you get the phone
itself yea all of these are touchscreen
ya hear you you use your mouse of it as
if you're touching the screen with your
finger or with your pen or whatever it
comes with right right so you can go
around here and check out different
things I can click on it just like any
other cell phone and we can load up
applications we can browse the internet
we can what all we actually tried to do
a blackberry application but that Excel
just tried the wrong kind of we tried
jad file it needed to be something else
but yeah well anyway and this is the new
blackberry the UH what does it call it
again blackberry storm sweet so if
that's kind of on your mind like it is
on mine probably want to play with it
before you actually plunk down the 973
dollars this one's kind of cool because
if you have if you go into one of the
menus say camera is a bad choice if you
go into let's do contacts no there we go
you can hold down the right click and it
works just like the little
all that comes on the blackberry you
hold down the right click on your mouse
and then you click the left left mouse
click yeah clickety-click click on one
of the menu choices and it brings it up
so it works just like any of the old
school ones that you might use there you
go now if if you're interested in
checking out these as well as other
emulators where can you go where you can
find out more well I actually found this
on the hak5 forums moonlit did this
entire review of like six different ones
and that's where I got the idea so
moonlit thank you so much and i'm also
going to do a little bit of an outline
on my own blog so you guys can check
that out I promise to update it this
time there you go awesome well we are
going to I take a quick break and then
see what Matt's up to Alex
alright so a couple of weeks ago Matt
you showed us a little front end system
that we could put on a windows server so
that we could delegate control of our
game servers crowdsourcing I think same
of the show yeah you want to tell us how
we can do this in Linux using some fun
web stuff yeah I got I got an email from
one of our viewers and basically asking
look I you know I Minister a couple
linux boxes you know here and there and
I need a way to do some custom stuff and
also make it easier for me so that I
don't have to do because let's face it
people who use linux not everybody loves
the command line okay no so okay that
being said what I did is I went on a
hunt and actually found some software
that I used way back in the day and
found that it's still actually out there
and is still an active development the
tools called webmin and so this is what
what is webmin for those like is it like
cpanel is it like no it's it's basically
taking the most you know use features of
what you're going to use a server for a
specific ami stuff the common stuff your
boot up your shut down your you know
disk and network access network
monitoring hardware PHP configuration
all these things that a standard you
know linux server is going to do you can
now do in a GUI on the web now cpanel is
mace basically made you know
specifically for hosting okay well this
is melter multiple people okay this I
mean how does it give her it differs in
you know basically cpanel is installed
is set up an auto does everything you
know shut up creation you know this just
gives you a GUI interface to do it
yourself okay so you know you have to go
in and you have to change the HTTP
handlers you know you'd have to go in
and do all you know mimetypes you know
PHP configurations everything that you
would normally if you were running a
single site on a linux box that you
would have to do via the command line we
can now do in a GUI great so instead of
just giving SSH access to our individual
users and saying hey have fun have at it
with
some bash scripts they can now come into
something a little bit more
user-friendly if you will right yeah i
mean it's it's so pay me a picture
what's our scenario here our scenario is
ok we just don't have you know the
manpower because we've got you know
we'll say 20 servers and we're not using
your control panel software which
normally you have to pay monthly for web
this is free and open source this is
free and open source like it I can
create your own themes you could skin it
as you want you know so on and so forth
update at blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah disk quotas you know here's an
example so we've got home user of our
home to you know we can go through we
can actually see basically everything
that you know you're going to find on I
mean this is my live box that this is my
life you know web hosting server so
these are all the user quotas that
people have set up okay so you know
going through and we can actually look
at running processes all via the web
webmin has a utility that plugs into
webmin which is called user Minh no it's
basically like instead of webmin is the
control for the entire web server user
min is control for just what that user
has access to exactly we can customize
it yes we can see I think you know a
little bit about web hosting being you
know the guy behind divergent networks
and all that fun stuff so you've had you
know and your clients are not just your
typical I want to host a web page as
much as they are I'm trying to do
something a little bit custom and need
some like one-on-one thing here yeah so
you've used this to do like custom web
interfaces yeah certain stuff I mean
back before game server you know before
I had evil lands you know before it was
called that I was hosting game servers
for friends and before control panels
per game servers are really prevalent I
was hosting on linux okay and I built
custom control panels using webmin and
user men cool let's take a look so what
I'm going to do is you need to install
webmin and then you need to install user
Minh okay there are pms RPM dash I yeah
yeah it's easy easy there's no
configuration beyond that well it's
automatically set up and you login so
here we've got the main webmin
again and what we're going to do is
we're going to go into others and we're
going to go to custom commands so now we
can actually create custom commands okay
we're going to create a custom command
and because I'm a radio guy we're going
to run a start shoutcast script okay the
command is going to be SC serve and the
ampersand to run in the background the
directory does it matter what directory
we run in it's whatever if you're it's
not in a bin folder more like an S bins
which a system-wide you're going to have
to specify the directory okay so we're
going to do root downloads and we're
going to run it as root now you can
specify to run it as a web min user this
is great because now a user can run
things as root and you don't have to
delegate them to use the rig's act where
no more no run that su thing but because
because when we login they're only going
to see this command and they can't edit
it they never data ever have soared
exactly nice so we're gonna we don't
need to hide the command there's no HTML
or anything like that and so we're going
to go ahead and create that and we're
also going to create another one which
is going to stop the shoutcast server
okay we're just going to do a kill all
9sc serve all right we're going to run
this as root as well so you don't have
to enter the password here and create
note because it's autumn it's pulling
all the user information from the system
we don't have to create users now you
can create separate webmin users that
are not part of the Linux users and
groups okay so they only have access to
the web front end and you can specify
commands to run as other users what's is
going to look like as a user so what
this is going to look like as a user and
we're going to go into so we're logged
in as root just because I know the
password there you go and we go to hold
on we have to go and set it up and say
that it's available in user man there
you go so making it available my
apologies that's okay so we'll go ahead
and broke my java earlier
it happens this is live so that is fun
you can watch a lot of the custom
commands your friday there you go you've
got a star shopkins this is what it
looks like so I so me as a user I log
into your system and now I can start and
stop the shoutcast server without having
to know the root password nor do I have
to know anything about this whole bash
thing right yeah nothing well what we
can actually do is make sure that it's
not running okay and it's not all right
so we will go ahead and start the server
and actually just go ahead goes ahead
and prints that to our console yep we
can turn that on and off just depending
on whether or not there's something I
don't know sensitive exactly yeah and
okay discusses so now you know what I'm
done using it so let's go ahead and stop
it and kill all and let's go ahead and
refresh and see so you can not only wake
start and stop the server you could say
play this playlist or buy that song or
you think you could use something
similar like this too I don't know maybe
like web enable our stereo so the kids
at home can I don't know change the
music at our house it's quite possible
yeah we might be thinking about
something like that there you jump
crowd-sourced you know playlist
generation crowd let's just crowdsource
everything I like it okay the one big
thing that I did want to show you guys
yes there's a lot in webmin there is a
lot okay like what else so everything in
here this entire list just give me the
highlight reel the highlight of system
you can specify servers networking what
I wanted to show you was the granular
control that you can give people that
log in okay so if i wanted to i can
unselect everything here and only select
custom commands and they would only have
access to the custom commands field so
squid proxy server and send mail server
and proftpd they would never see that
when they logged into web been nice so
it's really great in if you guys spend a
little time with it you know you might
think to yourself wow wow why don't I
just use windows no it's just making
your life easier at the end of the day
be an assisted mean that's what it's all
about the more time that you have to do
other things you don't dick around you
know trying to remember what
was the more you're going to get
done so i recommend you guys go to web
mint.com and check that out sweet
alright and this was based on some
questions that you got via email and
then we also have some other emails
Shannon what kind of questions we get
from the users the viewers questions for
you guys this week the first one comes
from my personal friend Jenny she's a
real big fan of life music and she's
creating her own DJ music one of her
friends he's a DJ and her plan for this
is to throw this really big party and
have him DJing at a table with a big
projector screen behind him and then
she's going to have like this little
kiosk Ian standing back out in the crowd
with her own computer her own home
computer running a bunch of different
emulators different video games that
will play on this projector behind the
DJ which I thought is a really cool idea
her problem with this though is that she
doesn't want to have people getting
access into all of her other
applications she just wants to have it
stuck on this one emulator or this one
or two different emulators so is there a
way for her to keep people in those
emulators instead of letting them out
into any anything else so they could
like put viruses on it um it sounds like
there's really two parts to this one she
doesn't want her machine to get effed up
and two she doesn't want to let people
outside of the application you want to
take that first part there the not
bourquin a machine is something that we
talked about a couple weeks ago with
windows steady state it's absolutely
bulletproof once you get it lock down
and set up with your permissions and
what application that can actually run
what parts of the system they have
bulletproof okay once you create that
disk you know cash you're good to go now
the the question kind of changed when
she read it that last time I wasn't
prepared for the second part which is
letting somebody out of an application
do you have any insight on that I mean
well what I'm thinking here is basically
she needs to run the application in a
kiosk mode I know that it's possible to
actually change what your shell is in
Windows from something like will
obviously explore dot exe to something
else we've we've
just on things like this in the past as
far as its concerned like with like
light step in different you wise if
memory serves me right you can actually
tell it an application I don't know what
kind of stability or what kind of other
things go into that too I this is where
we take the question and open up to you
guys we could obviously sandbox it was
something like sandbox e we could run it
in a vm from what I understand about
Jenny go her equipment not like so super
powerful I mean because here's the thing
right emulators well it sounds trivial
they do some weird stuff with video yeah
that not a lot of times are going to be
very sad if they're happy yes with
emulate with running in a vm I mean
you're basically running a machine
emulated inside of a machine emulated it
it gets crazy so oh I'm wondering what
you guys think about not just sandboxing
but also restricting use I know that
there's actually would like some
programs have kiosk modes like you might
our I explore with the dash K parameter
it puts it into kiosk mode there are
actually plugins for firefox to do
something similar so that you can't exit
it great for if you go into a trade show
like CES you want to show something off
and not have people yeah F with your
machine so let me know if you guys have
some ideas of how she could get this
done hit us up feedback at hak5 org or
just go ahead and post it up on the high
five forms so yeah should be good yeah
thanks anything else yeah we also have a
second question from one of our ustream
viewers it's used to ream 285 89 he asks
I have a recovery CD that I need to boot
from my eeepc is there a way to burn an
iso to a USB Drive yes there is in fact
it is a program that I have as as a
netbook user I you know my second
netbook I'm looking at the third I know
I know Christmas and there are totally
ways to do this what you want to look
for is this program called unetbootin
okay a newborn no you net boonton I know
right but still way better than ponies
so basically what this application does
is it takes a generic iso file that
you'd normally burn to a CD in action
just writes it to the USB so you can
seriously just boot off of it because
come on modern-day machines we can boot
off USB no problem it's even cooler than
that right because this application will
let you not only just you know specify
your ISO but it will automatically
download the live distributions of
several popular Linux distros like
gparted to fix your MBR problems to
backtrack three to get your Wi-Fi
hacking on to you know Ubuntu to just
for generically everything goes Debian
rules right yeah everything's moving so
anyway unetbootin muaks showed it to me
i love it you guys should check it out
as well I'll have links to all that fun
stuff and it has been my Savior because
those USB cd-rom drives pain in the ass
you got to remember where you put them
and then you know break them out and or
if you think oh I can get by by taking
one of these USB adapters with the IDE
channel on the other you know those
cheapies that we all have from frys or
microcenter or whatever they're great
but not all of them support booting off
of CD ROMs whereas you know yeah
whatever I digress it's very cool stuff
I've been using it a lot lately just by
having like multiple USB keys with
different operating systems so much fun
way easier than going through I know
backtrack three particular has its own
USB version but it's just so nice to
just grab any ISO and make it bootable
yeah so unetbootin I'll show you guys
next episode how to use it more
particularly with a way to offline
update windows and office how's that
first sounds like a good idea yes
anything else you want tease tease not
so much wanted to let you guys know if
you are not currently subscribed to the
act 5 RSS feeds make sure you get on
that the links are finally fixed so if
you go over to the revision 3 side use
subscription options iTunes miro you
know all that happy heavy stuff and also
on the hak5 site you've got up here
in the upper right it looks a little
bored because i use a mac oh you know I
think that's Darren that needs to fix
his CSS I'll get on that so make sure
you guys sign up for the RSS feeds at
hacc 50 or revision 3.com / hak5 there
you go yeah because you don't want some
you know day-old technol are if you're
really crazy Hakam see it as we owe ya
yeah I do want to tease one other thing
and then this will become a new giveaway
if you guys haven't heard of this this
is a awesome documentary I've got the
DVD here it's called hackers are people
too I don't to give you too much because
I will be talking to the director
Ashley's 42 we will have her on next
episode via Skype and I hope that you
guys enjoy that because it's a really
cool documentary about basically hacker
culture so she goes around to different
cons talks about talks to a lot of
people at Def Con and torque lines yes
places like that about what it is that
hackers are and I think the quote that
really resonates with me was at the very
end of the film where she talks about if
you were to really show what hackers
lives are it would be a bunch of geeks
just doing laundry and if you watch the
hack house com you know that yeah
cocaine which is laundry dishes yeah you
know it's hacking Apple TVs screwing
with xbox code and USB missile launchers
there you go girl with the cat
crowdsourcing screwing with the cat yeah
so um so yeah I think that's uh that's
pretty much I think there was anything
else we had to do um if you want
stickers high five double slash stickers
Oh still got a bunch of them got it I
got a new page for that dude oh I've got
it in dev I haven't showed you I've got
the ribbon HTML I haven't haven't
implemented in the WordPress you're
gonna love this because i figured out i
found it real quick there's a PHP exec I
know there's a little old PHP exec just
search that in um in WordPress and you
can do PHP inside of wordpress post or
page and then all of a sudden you can do
awesome dynamic stuff with your content
management system that owns check it out
hak5 that org slash stickers for more
than just stickers break my website a
break a face
next episode tune in for that anyway so
yeah I think that's pretty much it yes
without further ado we hope to you guys
next week hit up sub on the forums
follow us on Twitter all that fun happy
social media crap in other words
do these all no more lies it although
it's not all foam drink it it's all
phone right yeah really remember what
