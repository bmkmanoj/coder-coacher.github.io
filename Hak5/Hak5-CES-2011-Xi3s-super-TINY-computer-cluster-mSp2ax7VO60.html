they're not this CES special of hak5 is
brought to you by domain.com got a great
idea it all starts with a great domain
domain com for hack 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2011 with xi3 checking out
modular computing how are you good how
are you doing well now this is a really
really small what it was the form factor
here was this because this is not a TX
this is not a TX it's an x86 based form
factor but it's called xi3 so whole new
form factor this is our first product
that we're kind of releasing to the
public it's been under development for
the last eight years patent issued 6
issued patents in the United States and
also around the world so so is that a
standard form factor it's a standard
form factor that will allow people to
participate in you know building what we
call back planes so so your entire
motherboard just goes in a kind of a
u-shaped here yeah so it's a it's a
three board motherboard if you will we
house the processor and memory on one
card power supplies and kind of video
options on another card and then all
your i/o connectivity on it on a
separate partner okay so I'm curious
about how much power you can actually
fit in a machine the small and what's
the CPU well most people think it's a
thin client or something of that nature
but it's a full-blown desktop to gigger
dual-core rock with two to four gigs of
ram so it's not an atom chip no atom
chip it's a it's a tool for AMD
processor okay so you've got ati
graphics in there it's got a separate
graphics card with sinus upper side port
memory and that is very well dual
high-definition 1080p monitors does it
was really good on the graphic side as
well and it all runs at about 20 watts
of power now that it itself is really
interesting but the way that you guys
are selling these I find fascinating
this is just one of the components can
you tell me about the the other three
units to come with us so yeah you can
buy up to three additional units with
this to give you three additional
Computers very small units that we call
20 kind of like a zero client if you
will to connect USB to this device and
give you three additional computers at
about one watt apiece so very low energy
consumption they share out the processor
and memory and the operating system as
well so there's no so they're just a
embedded chip inside of those yeah
they're very small little arm processors
that just basically give you the
keyboard and mouse commands and the
video command so you can tap in kind of
like a rdp session remotely accessing a
desktop and how are they powered and how
do they communicate with the network as
I noticed they don't have Ethernet they
communicate through the ethernet of the
modular computer so that you can surf
the web just as if you're on on this
device but you're on a separate device
it actually helps drive the cost of the
device down as well so you're sitting at
about three hundred and fifty dollars
per station instead of the just one
station which would be 850 so you plug
three of the of the 0 units in via USB
USB powers it in addition to
communicating the information correct so
they only use about a watt of energy to
function so they're powered over the USB
and all the connectivity commands are
kind of done now are you limited to just
three on each of these or could i plug a
USB hub and add more zero clients
technically it could you start to lose
some performance but we're working on
some newer backplanes if you will so
we'll come out with some back points it
will allow you to expand that two more
zeros I'd because these are just USB to
right now these are USB to point out but
that's kind of a beauty of the design
it's modular in nature so when new
technologies come out such as USB 3.0
will sell you a very inexpensive car
that you pop into your computer and now
you're upgraded you don't the buy a new
computer now tell me about the RDP
sessions is that using Microsoft's rdp
are these terminal services / proper
it's a separate software okay and is
this some software you've developed
in-house or it's a partner we developed
with the partners so okay and is it just
for windows I believe right now that
it's
windows-based operating systems your
buddy was telling me about some Linux
options here are their linux options now
or in the future for the zeros or just
for the modular computer just for the
wall forever the whole package for the
modular computer there are you can load
any version of Linux UNIX on the device
there's an internal USB Drive where you
could load your linux operating system
internally and then you can obviously
load it on external drives as well all
right so what are the pricing options do
you just buy one and then a la carte or
they come in a can yeah so we pre
configure it basically right now so we
paid 49 as MSRP of the current
configuration if you couple it with the
0 modules you get your price down to
about three hundred fifty dollars
receipt per user basically and the
processors in here you've got a AMD a
dual-core to get her chip what other
processor options we have some lower end
processors still AMD processors one
running about 1 gigahertz and 8 watts of
power and an additional one that's at
about 35 watts two points you get hurt
so 35 watts on the high end 8 watts on
the low end and then each additional 0
unit is only taking what an additional
wat an additional single watt single
loss so you could run this off of what
car battery oh yeah car batteries solar
panel to a car battery very good for
remote location applications things
things that well and parties everywhere
where people need to understand too is
it's a it's a bad note but no 3d you
know 3d graphics for all the clients i'm
sure we got something coming on you guys
something coming on that awesome will be
here next year to find out about that
great thank you so much it's been a
pleasure talking with you Aaron no
problem thank you for more continued
