Shannon Morse
and you are watching hack 5 this week's
episode of hack 5 is brought to you by
the United States Air Force go to assist
Express got a great idea it all starts
with a great domain domain comm hello
and welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen and this is your weekly dose of
Technol us we have a great show for you
today
Shannon's talking about some awesome VPN
stuff in the upcoming snubs report and
we're doing a little bit of wireless no
we're doing overclocking no we're idle
level with yet I first started out
trying to do an awesome Wi-Fi segment
for you guys and it's totally coming we
are going to be taking one of these
little Adam boards here and turning them
into an awesome wireless access point to
go along with our awesome homebrew
wireless or wired router using untangled
or pfSense or what have you but learned
a lot recently as I as I should have
known about Wireless with Linux and as
you guys know in the past when we've
done things with like packet sniffing
with Linux and Wireless it's very
specific as to what hardware you can
actually use and that all has to do with
the chipset and what modes that it can
go into so you guys know my favorite
here the the alpha this is the alpha
networks this it's the G version the aw
us 0:36 H this is the wireless USB
adapter that I use when I want to do a
little bit of packet sniffing and it's
great for that uses a real tech 81 87
chipset which is able to go into monitor
mode and well that's what allows us to
fire up kismet and all these other fun
tools and be able to sniff what's in the
air without associating with an access
point but when it comes to actually
creating an access point we don't care
about setting our card into monitor mode
what we care about is setting it in
master mode so a couple different modes
there's ad hoc which would be if you
know just a bunch of laptops talking to
each other or something and then there's
managed which is what you would use if
you your laptop we're connecting to an
access point and that's what most people
use is managed and then masters if you
were creating an access point
there's repeater there's secondary if
you're creating a mesh and then there's
monitor or again the the sniffing and
the fun stuff there but it all comes
down to what the chipset supports and
unfortunately there's not like an easy
way to tell because while you can just
plug you know say a USB Wi-Fi dongle
into your Linux machine you can run LS
USB and it'll display you know the
chipset all that stuff you can figure it
out right and you can go to a couple of
wiki's and find out what chipsets
support what but then finding an actual
device that has that chipset can prove
very difficult especially when say it's
a I don't know a Linksys or a d-link or
Netgear USB Wi-Fi dongle
you know model number X whatever version
2000 has say a Broadcom version 3000 has
a rolling vision version 4000 may have
an atheros who knows and it can get
really difficult trying to actually buy
something that has the correct chipset
so when you go to a brick-and-mortar
like I made the mistake of doing so
that's my lesson learned there but I
will say that I do have some leads on
some awesome chip so we'll be getting
some in and where you're going to be
building an awesome wireless access
point with that just want to let you
guys know that the chipset is super
important so I'll have those on our
forms and everything all the model
numbers that I'm using and a great place
a great resource to finding out what
chip is in what device is Wireless
kernel.org they've got a great site
there where you can figure it all out so
I just went down to the store thinking
sure I'm just going to pop into you know
Fry's a micro Center or whatever and
pick up a a $50 Wi-Fi dongle come home
and build an awesome wireless access
point that would be awesome
except that didn't happen I was actually
you know I found some sales associates
that were nice enough to actually let me
in a couple of wireless dongles that I
had some you know good feelings about
and unfortunately wasn't able to find
one that works so instead of getting the
fifty dollar USB dongle I ended up
dropping a grand on a new i7 rig but I
totally needed it for editing and this
is what has led me to what we're also
going to do and that is working with the
corsair h 50 as we talked about last
week doing a little bit of water cooling
if that would be awesome to just go
ahead and pop a core i7 920 in here no
per clock it to four gigahertz it
totally is is feasible and if I had
spent a little bit more time doing
research on the motherboard that would
have easily happened so as I said I got
a 920 in here and it's using the e VGA
what is it called the FTW three it's the
x58 motherboard it's the for the win
three and for me it's been full of lose
and then the namely it's not actually
though we're clocking I can do that just
fine I've gotten this thing up to you
know three point eight with air cooling
and haven't even you know unbox the
water cooler yet so that's not the issue
but the issue with this motherboard and
there's an issue with every motherboard
is that it says it drops out ram so I'm
in Windows and hey check that out I've
got six gigs of RAM installed and not
cheap Ram either and you know what spent
the extra to get some horsehair RAM 1600
megahertz with you know caz 7 latency so
some good stuff there but this drops it
out as soon as you start to overclock
and reading piles and piles and piles of
forms and fiddling with every voltage
and timing setting known to man finding
that there is not a real answer if you
go to the EVGA forms you find that lots
of people have this exact problem and
they've all either moved on to a
different motherboard or they all had a
different solution that worked for them
and I'm I'm tired of standing on my left
foot and and trying to tweak a jumper or
something so lesson learned should do a
little bit more research when it comes
to mother words because they all have
issues and I'm probably going to trade
to another motherboard that has a
different issue but losing Ram
an issue that I want to deal with so
anyway I figured that I would let you
guys know that that's my
work-in-progress that's what I'm up to
and when it comes to forms please please
please if you post in a forum hey I'm
having xxx problem somebody else is like
all yeah me too
don't come back a week later and say oh
it's fixed please tell us
oh it's fixed and here's what I did yes
okay so with that rant totally out of
the way we're going to take a quick
break and when we get back Shannon is
going to learn us up on some awesome VPN
stuff using your Google account you're
really going to wear that all night
Colleen really I'm just saying even if
hypothetically cooties were real I don't
have them well you look ridiculous you
know there's an easier way to protect
yourself right head over to Circle
Circle dot dot dot org dots it's amazing
how people believe just about anything
if there's a website for it but what's
even more amazing is how incredibly
inexpensive it is to get a domain these
days I mean look at domain.com they make
it unbelievably easy to get your website
online because they've got all the
fixings and none of what you don't need
see oh whether you're hosting your
resume or starting a website about
make-believe vaccines great ideas start
with great domains and domain coms been
making it easy and affordable for the
last 10 years they're our one-stop shop
for domain names reliable Linux and
Windows hosting and Virtual Private
servers and best of all you can get 15%
off your next order when you use coupon
code
a k5 at checkout that's hacked five for
fifteen percent off at domain.com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com you're here and your
files are there it's an age-old
conundrum with as many solutions as I
have reasons to love York Shire Terrier
puppies I love your keys really what one
what was I talking about oh yeah
so Darren has delved into small office
VPNs like adido and Open VPN last season
and I wanted to delve into something
else that's a little bit more simple
ineffective
so this is G bridge you can download G
Bridge over at G Bridge calm and it has
tons and tons of features first of all
it's a free yes free software only
solution for all versions of Windows and
it uses your Google Account for
verification that's because it's a
extension of the Google gtalk service it
can remotely control pcs sync folders
share files and chat securely and easily
you can share your desktop with your
friends from anywhere in the world and
automatically transfers firewalls and
madding routers without configuration
you can securely share and access files
and let your friends view photos
instantly without any download and well
they don't have to do anything it's
completely remote you can transfer and
sync large files and folders to and from
anywhere with no size restrictions
and you can use the sniffy little tool
called Auto sync which lets you auto
schedule auto resume and do incremental
transfers and you can also do this setup
called Auto recurring backups so you can
backup all your important folders to
either your local machine or my route
remote PC I've gone ahead and connected
to a box on our hack 5 cloud lab so that
I can show you guys exactly how to set
this up and how to share files and what
not so let's go ahead and get into that
ok so I've gotten connected I'm going to
click on the download link and go to the
download page on G bridge comm and start
the download click yes a couple of times
ok so there's going to be a pop-up and
it says that I need to install the VPN
driver so I click OK and then I'm going
to wait for the install to finish it
might actually take a couple of minutes
for it to finish but just leave that
window open if you close it it's not
going to finish for you it actually says
it right there for you
so also click allow if Windows tells you
any warnings about downloading and
installing of course and then click
finish once it's done installing start G
Bridge it's going to ask you for your
Gmail info so I'm going to put in my
user ID and my password and the host
name for my main computer you can also
create a new gmail account or a Google
Apps account if you really don't want to
use your regular Gmail account for this
so I log in and the first thing I see is
my friends list
it automatically includes all of my chat
friends now at the top you can log off
you can invite friends by typing in
their email or you can add friends from
your list of contacts and you can also
create new shares to create a new share
click on the volume you wish to share
and then add any of your friends that
you want to share this folder with I'm
going to add Darrin and then I'm going
to password protect this volume so I'm
going to allow him and there we go
my secure share is now created yeah
to back up your folder onto the main
machine or another machine click the add
ez backup icon and then choose the
secure share choose which machine you
want to backup on and then let the
backup begin to use desktop share I
click on the icon choose configure and
then I change my settings so I'm going
to allow in invitations to friends and
I'm going to allow access from my other
computers with a password I can access
my cute computer using Newbridge from
any of my other computers but I just
need to have my password so that way
type in my password and I can see my
desktop from pretty much anywhere so all
in all I think gee Ridge is lightweight
it's easy and it's free so it's all good
in my book it's not going to replace
your p2p or your IP SEC VPN but it will
be up and running in minutes and it's
going to give you the majority of what
you need so what do you guys think email
