specter and meltdown all that coming up
now on threat wire greetings I am
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for January 17 2018 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom fYI I went to CES last
week and I came down with the con flu
absolutely horribly congested that is
why but I still wanted to get this
episode out to you all about Specter in
meltdown so I hope you enjoy it
fYI also don't forget to check out our
patreon it's patreon.com slash threat
wire our next goal opens up a special
Q&amp;amp;A between me and all of our patrons
plus it helps me upgrade the set so
definitely check it out if you want to
support the show and now on to the news
so let's get right into it for the story
and discuss specter and meltdown
announced on January 3rd just days
before I was heading to CES 2018 over in
Vegas the two vulnerabilities exploit
CPUs made by Intel arm and AMD chipsets
in one way or another meltdown was
discovered by three different firms
Technical University of Graz in Austria
German security firm Cerberus security
and Google project zero and Spectre was
discovered by Google project zero and
Paul kosher there are three different
variants variant three is meltdown
affected every modern Intel chip and two
other variants collectively known as
Spectre are known to affect chips from
Intel AMD and arm at least the very
least both meltdown inspector type
attacks take advantage of an own process
used in CPUs to speed up acts they use
speculative excavation to make educated
guesses about what processes will be
performed next for any kind of given
code so this speeds up the processing
and it does not deter from performance
which is great anytime this execution is
made a small change to the processor is
made and can be measured by other
programs that is not so great the
information can be leaked to different
programs such as malware for
also not a very good thing now with
Spectre this can be sniffed via
JavaScript code to steal data with
meltdown the data is leaked within the
kernel memory operating systems use page
tables that's what they're called to map
processes or kernel memory and
underlying physical memory then memory
is split in half one part for processes
and one part for the kernel the kernel
memory is shared for all different
processes meltdown takes advantage of
the shared table of memory for the
kernel and it finds leaks in the data
exposing it to third-party programs so
the fix is to split up the shared kernel
memory for each of those different
processes Specter versions affect cpus
from the past decade so in this case an
attacker could exploit the specter
vulnerability in a cpu to make it miss
predict and execute the attackers code
instead of the predictive code that it's
supposed to alternatively an attacker
could trick a processor into making the
wrong speculative accesses outside its
boundaries steering it away from a
normal prediction to the one that the
attacker wants it to to fix the two
versions of Specter browsers are
updating against one of the leaks over
boundaries and operating systems and CPU
manufacturers are updating against the
Miss predicting one more on the updates
in just a little bit because of the way
both exploits are performed this means
that they also affect Windows Linux and
Mac OS operating systems and a slew of
devices including mobile phones laptops
servers and more they could allow an
attacker to gain access to data on the
chip including encryption keys and
passwords just to name a few examples
the CPU guesses what information a
computer needs to continue in action
that's the speculative execution action
that it makes and when this happens an
attacker could see data that is
momentarily available outside of the
chip Specter allows an attacker to begin
the speculative execution process the
process can then be detected by a third
party process by measuring how long it
takes to perform the task it could for
example enable buffer overflow attacks
now meltdown the first of the two
exploits is easier to exploit in
Abel's a third-party process to read
lots of data from that Colonel and
meltdown allows the attacker to view the
data through the computer's operating
system hence why you need that upgrade
to your OS these are called side-channel
attacks accessing information while it's
used for a legitimate process it's also
easier to fix but it comes with
performance hits Specter is worrisome
for admins because it also affects
virtualization the problem is with the
design of the chips not any specific
vendor Intel AMD in arm all have patches
on the way or have already started
distributing them according to Intel and
arm the exploits have not been used in
the wild and they were disclosed by a
team of researchers in 2017 not to
surprisingly given the recent Equifax
debacle until CEO Brian krzanich sold
stock in the company soon after Intel
was alerted about Milt a land inspector
sales were scheduled October 30th which
is five months after Intel was notified
while his cell did not net any more than
it would if he sold stocks now it would
be 39 million dollars to be exact
which ensures chump change for a CEO
they still might bring scrutiny from the
Securities and Exchange Commission so
who is impacted exactly
most of Intel's chips are impacted ARM
Cortex a processors are impacted and
these are ones found in mobile devices
networking Hardware in Auto infotainment
displays etc AMD is impacted by one of
the flaws as well and billions of
devices in total are said to be impacted
by all of the flaws altogether this
affects processor company's operating
system companies and cloud providers as
well such as Amazon future chips will be
designed differently in assets they
won't have the flaw so how do you update
your computer to mitigate risk from
meltdown inspector Google is posting
security updates for mobile phones as of
January 5th chrome users should enable
site isolation in the browser until
January 23rd when Chrome 64 will be
released with productions against the
flaw site isolation in chrome makes it
harder for a website to access data from
accounts on other websites to set this
up you go into settings a
Chrome OS check for updates to update
and for Spectre turn on the strict site
isolation option by pasting the link in
the show notes onto your address bar and
choosing enable to turn it on and that
link is directly down in the show notes
Mozilla is updating Firefox 57 to
mitigate the risk IBM is also infected
and has a month long plan to fix data
center equipment on power CPUs which are
vulnerable to both specter and meltdown
updates to power 7 plus power 8 and
power 9 are out now IBM will also
release effects for its operating system
the AIX and IBM iOS is on February 12th
and furthermore Nvidia does not believe
it is affected but they did put out new
drivers anyway for GeForce Quadro NVS
Tesla and grid GPUs for Linux Ubuntu and
Debian are patched for meltdowns so
update ASEP if you can at most you will
see an 8% to 19% hit to performance for
high capacity workloads such as for
servers for virtual machines and other
processes like this users will see a
three to seven percent drop in
performance most other day-to-day usage
will see minimal impact to performance
those that do not receive or cannot
receive updates like for some IOT
devices those should be replaced
unfortunately canonical had to
re-release their patch as the original
patch sent out on Tuesday last week
created a booting problem for users of
ubuntu 16.04 LTS the new patch version
posted on Wednesday fixed this issue a
patch for Spector will come soon Red Hat
released three updates for meltdown
specifically for C V's 2017 57 54 53 and
15 all of which require local access to
exploit Apple's iOS Mac OS and TV OS
11.2 are secured against meltdown with
iOS eleven point two point two being
pushed as a Monday for Spectre Microsoft
is pushing updates to Windows PCs and
Mac computers are secured as of ten
point thirteen point two which was
released on December second all Apple's
iPhones computers Apple TVs and iPads
are
affected Apple watch is not the big ones
though as I mentioned were Intel and
Microsoft so Intel has released updates
newer chips which are five years old or
less have patches out now as of January
13th older ones up to 10 years old will
release in the coming weeks from Intel
Intel Haswell and Broadwell chipsets are
receiving reboot errors so some
customers have been told to hold off on
patching for the time being until that
can be fixed Microsoft's updates have
been a headache
Microsoft halted patch updates after
reports of computers being unable to
boot after the update and E processors
and computers would not reboot after
installing the patch specifically
updates via Windows Update and wsus
would resume as soon as possible
according to the Microsoft blog and
these issues also create a blue screen
of death problems for some users the
vulnerabilities affect older model AMD
CPUs including Opteron Athlon and AMD
turion x2 cpus while meltdown does not
affect AMD CPUs Specter in fact does AMD
Radeon GPUs are not affected by either
of these Microsoft also stated a halt to
security updates until third-party
antivirus confirms no calls to the
kernel memory in Windows some AV
bypasses the built-in kernel patch
protection and is incompatible with the
latest patch affected antivirus vendors
need to add a registry key to the
startup sequence confirming
compatibility with the update there's a
really great write-up by Kevin boom on
twitch is linked in the show notes that
explains that the antivirus bypasses the
kpp by injecting a hypervisor to
intercept sis calls and assume memory
locations which is also sometimes used
by root kits so AV vendors should really
not be doing that at all Kevin created a
whole spreadsheet of av vendors who have
updated and the link is in the show
notes the operating system build should
read one six to nine nine point one to
five under system settings about Windows
specifications in Windows 10 a firmware
update is also recommended from your PC
manufacturer and since it is patchable
no you will not get
recall and a replacement chip which is
unfortunate no free chips this time it
is recommended to install firmware
updates from the PC hardware
manufacturer as well as your operating
system your PC manufacturer might not
have an update available yet though
older devices may need to be replaced
entirely since they won't receive
updates as for the operating system
updates be careful with the patches
though especially if your CPU may have a
blue screen of death or a reboot problem
and all of those have been reported but
not just that malware is also targeting
users looking to patch their systems
malwarebytes warned about smoke loader
malware which is targeting German users
via phishing emails from a purported
Federal Office of information security
and offers info on the two exploits plus
a zip archive which actually has the
malware an updated list of advisories
patches and updates is linked below in
the show notes lastly you have probably
heard rumors about issues with
performance after installing the
firmware or operating system updates the
update can slow a computer by as much as
30 percent but most users will not see a
change of more than two percent decrease
in processing speed unfortunately if you
do patch you will see a hit to
performance no matter what Intel quotes
a slowdown of six percent or less for
its newest chips older chips will be
impacted more by up to eight percent
slowdowns responsiveness which has to do
with launching programs browsing
multi-tab windows encryption etc
diminished by 12% for newer models and
older ones by as much as 21 percent such
as the core i7 6700 K which honestly is
not that old
basically home users doing regular
computing on skylake Abbey Lake and
coffee Lakes CPUs have minor impact
gaming browsing productivity those
things won't see a large hit networking
disk usage stuff like that will this is
kind of an obvious drawback since the
speculative execution of CPUs is done to
speed up processing of noon tasks and
blocking or negating this process will
obviously slow down that execution
lastly google has created their own fix
for specter ver
- the one that does branch target
injection and can affect a
virtualization and is the toughest of
the vulnerabilities to fix their patch
which is called ret Pauline has little
impact to performance and is stable
since initial testing in December the
patch has not received any support
complaints Google hopes that ret Pauline
will be universally deployed by other
platforms to rectify the situation with
minimal impact thank you again to all of
the wonderful people who contribute to
patreon.com slash threat wire you are
the reason that we can keep on bringing
you news every single week we are on the
way to our next goal which is super
exciting we're so close this allows me
to upgrade some of our equipment for the
set which is well needed I'm so excited
to do that and we can open up the live
video Q&amp;amp;A just for patrons every single
month any little bit helps us to grow
the show and in return you get access to
a bunch of extras on patreon I was
posting all sorts of stuff last week so
I hope you check it out and we may even
feature your adorable fur babies in an
upcoming episode just like these ones
and I love checking them out so if
you're at that perk level definitely
send me some pictures again I apologize
for the terribly scratchy throat in the
coughing and the tea on set and all that
stuff but I had to get this video out to
you I realized since I was out at CES
last week you didn't get a video but I
did want to get out one about Spectre
and melt down such since it's such a big
big deal so anyway check out the perk
levels on patreon thanks again for
helping us keep the show coming
completely independent and ad free i'm
totally under the weather but i really
enjoy doing the show for you and i think
it's so so important so i'm gonna keep
on doing it even if i'm sick if you
can't donate hit the subscribe button or
share this episode on your favorite
social media page and with that I'm
