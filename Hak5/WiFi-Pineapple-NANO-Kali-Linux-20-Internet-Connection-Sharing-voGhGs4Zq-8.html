setting up internet connection sharing
with the Wi-Fi pineapple Nano in Kali
Linux 2.0 so let's begin
I'm here in my Kali Linux box I'm in the
terminal and the first thing we need to
do is download the WP 6 connection
script you can get that by issuing
double you get Wi-Fi pineapple comm
slash WP 6 sh by LS I see that's there
we need to make executable so chmod plus
x WP 6 @ sh now connect your Wi-Fi
pineapple to your Kali Linux computer
using the included USB Y cable the blue
LED will blink while the Wi-Fi pineapple
nano boots up when it's completed
booting the light will go solid now on
our computer we go ahead I'm going to
clear the screen and run dot slash WP 6
sh in the directory where we downloaded
the Wi-Fi pineapple connection script
we're presented with the default options
which aren't correct for our particular
network setup so I'll say no to the
first prompt and I'll be asked which is
the Wi-Fi pineapple interface I can tell
it's f11 here because it has that 172
dot 16 dot 42 address so I'll choose 0
and next I'll be asked which is our
internet interface I'm connected to the
internet on this Kali Linux computer
over wireless so it's WLAN 2 so I'll
choose one and then finally I'm asked
for the internet gateway in this case
the only one available it's zero now I'm
going to choose the default IP settings
for 99.9% of people those are going to
be what you'll want to go with and for
convenience I will save these settings
for next time and let's connect now by
saying yes at this point the internet
connection from WLAN to here is shared
with the Wi-Fi pineapple and f11 and I
can browse to this address to manage the
Wi-Fi pineapple I'll log in and I can
test the internet connection by clicking
load bulletins so that's it for setting
up internet connection sharing with Kali
Linux 2.0 and the Wi-Fi pineapple Nano
if you have questions please leave them
in the comments or join us on the Wi-Fi
pineapple forum so you can find links to
that Wi-Fi pineapple comm and I'll see
you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
