5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we're checking
out more of multi host interface
specifically how you add your own
entities because who doesn't want to add
their own entities I know I do it's fun
now say you want to create a brand new
entity on a working chart without the
use of the palette to do so you would go
back to the manage tab now we talked
about this in a previous hack tip
episode if you haven't seen it go back
and look for the one about the manage
tab I'm going to go here and I'm going
to create a new entity type so for this
one specifically I'm going to call it
hmm how about the emails the emails I
can add a description if I want to so
for my description I'll call it my
special email entity and I'm going to
just leave the unique type the same now
under base entity this is pretty useful
because it'll automatically include
whatever script from Lt go that I want
to use let's find one that regards email
oh there we go down under icons I can
include a brand new icon so I can choose
any of these custom ones defaults new
let's say I like this star so I'm going
to choose the star yay hit next now this
is kind of an interesting page this is
going to let you either use the main
properties of the inherited entity type
so that basically means all the
information from the previous page or
you can create a custom mate main
property so I'm just going to use all
the main properties that I already
created hit next and then I can add my
category so for this I'm going to call
it personal and then hit finish now once
you do that you'll find it over in your
listing so if I go under personal
move down a little bit the emails that's
the one I was looking for so what I can
do is drag in the drop us wherever I
want
so I'll click it whoo that's a terrible
place board I'll click and put it right
there and I'm going to change this to
snubz at actually I've already did snub
so I'm going to do Shannon at hack five
org because that one works too yeah so I
can also run a transform just like and
normally do and when I do that let's go
over here we'll choose domain DNS see if
that one runs anything now I'm going to
go ahead and let that run and when it's
finished you'll notice that I have a
brand new node or the same one if it's
already included in a previous transform
that I had run how cool is that
now you can also find all of these over
in the palette as usual and you can
create pretty much as many as you want
and just drag and drop them into your
graph as normal and use it now right
after the break I'm going to check out
something really really cool that one of
our users sent in so I'll be right back
the hex shop is hack fives premier store
for all your pen testing needs including
one of my favorites be USB rubber ducky
it looks like a flash drive and it types
like a keyboard and it can type scripts
into a computer crazy fast like this
week's favorite from to Whovian to hoove
and bustled man you guys have some
really hard forum names now it's a
script that simply downloads a Christmas
wallpaper to your Windows 7 machine or
of course you can obviously change that
link to pretty much whatever wallpaper
that you want just make sure you're not
downloading any crazy stuff to your
friends computers now of course we gonna
do this show without your support so we
would like to thank you with something
special use the coupon code snubz with
any order for your very own signed
hacked tip stickers thank you so much
for supporting the show
we are back and we have something
interesting from a user named James
so James said we need to check out split
ego he basically said instead of using
Peter Bo's data mining services for OS
int sploit ego uses tools on the local
machine to scan and report intelligence
for example it can scan a range of IPs
with nmap checking for vulnerabilities
with necess and exploiting those
vulnerabilities from Metasploit it can
all be accomplished from the sexy and
reasonably easy to use interface that is
melty go now I wanted to run you through
the install of boy T go in case you're
interested in this came out just a few
years ago at apparently at DEFCON 20 so
I was there apparently now to install
sploit ego you need to run a few
commands you can find most of this
information over at github on their
github sploit ego page and I'll have a
link to that in the show notes but there
are a few extra little bits that they
don't list here so I want to run those
through so first off you want to use the
sudo apt-get install command force KP
and map a map in Metasploit so you have
all those transforms a bailable that run
off of those different software
prerequisites this other two necess and
p0f i've never played with those myself
because they're paid so i'm not
downloading them for this example next
up what you want to do is download the
zip from the github page well there goes
and you can find this over at the
download zip which is located right
there on github if you've never used
github before just download that zip on
to your Kali Linux machine for me I just
put it right here on the desktop and
then you want to run a nice little
program to unzip this to do that in your
terminal you type in unzip
oh sorry I should probably go to my
desktop there we go
I've already unzipped this onto my
desktop but if you are running through
the command its unzip and then sploit
ego whatever the name is of it dot zip
you hit run and it automatically turns
it into a nice little folder for you and
then you basically just follow the
on-screen instructions found over at a
different website now this one that you
want to check out is over at setup tools
so this is pi pi pi thon dot org slash
pi PI slash setup tools now this
basically runs you through a different
tool that you need to use to actually
install the rest of split ego so for
this one I ran down to UNIX W get you
basically just have to run this w get
command to install this set up py
scripts this set up Python script and in
case you actually need to get super user
privileges you can also run this version
of it alternatively it may be installed
in the user local path if you prefer to
do that way as well so you have a few
different options here and then you want
to run another command so this one is
pseudo Python setup py that one is
actually found over at their github so
if I scroll down here it's found right
here sudo python set up py / install you
want to do that inside of your Python
folder and it's going to automatically
run and install now from here you can
just reopen multigo run any updates
close it and then run the very very last
command and this one's a little bit
similar to this one canary so canary
instead of install package it package
you want to type in create profile space
sploit ego and then you follow the
on-screen instructions to import your
brand-new transforms force by t go into
mal t go and if that's not a mouthful of
crazy
melty ghost boy t go words let's take it
from there so now let's go back into
melty go let's reopen it and all of your
new transforms will be available via the
GUI so if i look under my palette i can
scroll down
little ways where are they
okay penetration testing so let's go
down there so here we have Metasploit
session necess report and map report
port that's cool so we have a whole
bunch of new entities that we can use
for future transforms that we might want
to run how cool and it's all going to be
locally done on your own machine
he'll need is that now of course let me
know what you think you can always send
me a comment below or you can email us
tips at hack 5 org and be sure to check
out our sister show hack 5 for more
great stuff just like this and I'll be
there reminding you to trust your Tecna
