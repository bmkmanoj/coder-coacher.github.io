health care why you shouldn't roll your
own encryption and oh boy more foreign
hackery goodness all that coming up now
on threat wire happy Monday people i'm
patrick norton and this is threat wire
from a 11 2015 your summary of the
threats to security privacy and internet
freedom I'd like to start with a huge
thanks to everyone who has supported the
relaunch of threat wire we couldn't be
more proud of this awesome community and
if you're new to threat wire on the hak5
channel this is the show we did for a
year on tech feed and now we brought it
back so with that let's get started
first up cost of health insurance
ticking you off then you'll love the
Bloomberg story that says quote rising
cyber attacks costing health system six
billion dollars annually Bloomberg's
info comes from the Panama Institute not
the pokeyman the pond Aman Institute the
article says quote criminal attacks
against healthcare providers have more
than doubled in the past five years with
the average data breach costing a
hospital 2.1 million dollars now pot
Amon is a security research and
consulting firm the the report goes on
to say that quote nearly ninety percent
of healthcare providers were hit by
breaches in the past two years half of
them criminal in nature why well in
least in the case of the criminal
attacks it's probably money Dell
SecureWorks told Bloomberg that medical
records quote sell for as much as 20
times the price of a stolen credit card
number and include such juicy details as
social security numbers addresses and of
course your medical info and hey with
big retailers hardening your credit card
processing systems thanks to
high-profile attacks on chains like
target and home depot poorly secured
medical systems must look like
low-hanging fruit that is ripe for the
taking note to self I got to go check my
credit report and make sure the credit
freeze also known as a credit report
freeze lockdown credit lock or security
freeze is still in place that prevents
my credit report from going out without
my consent which makes it a lot harder
for identity theft to happen you just
have to remember to lift it a few days
before you apply for credit or loan or
whatever legitimate uses for access to
your credit report might be now it might
cost you ten bucks to freeze or unfreeze
your credit report across all three
credit agencies but seriously how much
is dealing with identity theft
going to cost you in comparison
meanwhile google map maker will quote be
temporarily unavailable for editing
starting may 12 2015 and all edits are
now going through a manual review
process thanks to quote escalated
attacks to spam Google Maps the straw
that broke this particular camel's back
well outside of the only problem with
community being community is that well
apparently a strong user in the Google
Maps community chose to go and create a
large-scale prank on the map so until
the Maps team figures out of the way to
quote review edits at roughly the right
they come in well they're shutting them
down taking a pause from all well
community editing of Google Maps by the
way Search Engine Land has a slightly
different perspective on this than
Google's this is why we can't have nice
things response Search Engine Land
points out that the recent public edits
were made to show how easy it is to make
fraudulent edits to businesses and that
quote it took one man's efforts Brian
Seely to expose these loopholes to the
world to force Google to tape down map
maker at least until the loophole is
covered smart grids are cool smart
meters on your power are awesome but
homegrown crypto generally sucks
seriously we're talk about the open
smart grid protocol here Cooper skis
blog hipped us to dumb crypto and smart
grids practical crypt analysis of the
open smart grid protocol which
apparently is open to a whole bunch of
pathetically easy attacks now the OS GP
is preparing an update to add new
security features and on one sense i'm
not sure how were damn about smart
meters being attacked or smart
thermostats at least I was until I
started thinking about board script
kiddies being bored script kiddies and
making my life or bill a tremendous pain
another cheerful news if you're
strapping wireless monitor yourself hey
Apple watch hey cycling computer a
gps-enabled inhaler you might want to
check out the Washington Post story
quote the revolution will be digitized a
not so technical romp through some of
the many social and legal issues created
by all your personal data cataloging and
the New York Times is a pretty good look
at just what's happened as a result of
the Obama administration strategy and
mitigating the theft of us trade secrets
isn't really stopping for Ian hackers
can they be stopped period without say
declaring war go forth and educate
yourself and while you're educating
yourself try reading about how Russia
and China have pledged not to hack each
other that's up on the wall street
journal and links for all the stories
are in the show notes right down below
before I go want to give a huge thing
to everyone who has supported threat
wire so far on Patrian if you find value

threat wire we're hoping to reach our
three times a week milestone goal that's
going to be Darren kitchen Shannon Morse
and myself rotating throughout the week
so throughout the month of May will be
giving you a taste of just what that can
be I hope could contribute to help us
keep coming independent and ad-free and
if you can't donate I like a share and a
