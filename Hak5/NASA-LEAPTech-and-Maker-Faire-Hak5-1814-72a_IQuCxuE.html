upon us Darren reports from NASA
Armstrong plus Maker Faire is all about
Arduino and raspberry pi this year all
that and more this time on hak5 this
episode of high five is brought to you
by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen i like turtles
and this is your weekly dose of tech net
don't tell them about the turtles yet
we're weeks from launch I have a pet
turtle oh you do mmm no my cat light she
eats turtles no wait kidding Shannon you
know she doesn't show caffeine candy
okay what no we are not making it one of
those episodes I swear to you people we
have amazing stuff where do we really do
in fact I have no no no no she sticker
for the wall why does it say drying in
on it because NASA Armstrong Research
Center used to be called Dryden which it
is still like in my heart known as but
then again Edwards Air Force Base which
it is inside of used to be called my
rock or me rock and things change so I
mean of course what we got a purchase
how about next to the aviation pineapple
huh I'm thinking right here oh yeah
looks good lit up nice by the yoader
full red lights actually I noticed some
new ones to goods yeah we do have some
new ones you came back from maker faire
with some I did we ended up with arduino
Maker Faire ones there's Raspberry Pi
what else oh there's iFixit appear
Nicholson what yeah and all sorts of
good stuff yeah so I got to check out
our source all sorts of fun things over
at maker faire and we'll be talking more
about that in just a bit sweet yeah I am
gonna be talking about leap Turk and
electric airplanes and all sorts of cool
new futuristic fun things coming out of
NASA that I just love their new fast and
quick and dirty dev psychol where they
just make things go and airplanes
airplane airplanes be getting hacked yo
I hear that airplanes begin hacked you
want to tell us about that yeah so it's
been a pretty crazy week over on threat
wire if you guys don't know
red wire is our shorty short format show
all about what's threatening security
privacy in our internet freedoms we've
got a bunch of epic stories including
how thousands of different kinds of
routers have been affected with malware
the venom vulnerability is breaking out
of virtual machines which is crazy scary
and what happens when you hack flight
controls while you're on a flight so you
can check out all of those over at hak5
the hak5 channel over on threat wire yes
it is your source for security privacy
Internet freedom and we have been really
like so so I don't seem excited about
that show I love talking about it I love
learning about what's going on with
internet and freedom and you know my own
privacy good it matters to all of us
whether you know it or not yes you know
what elders also matters to all of us
what inexpensive air travel oh yes I
mean come on I think that actually the
economics of it is the only way to move
the four of the World forward because if
you told all the airlines like hey we've
got epic new technology that's like
revolutionizes everything they're gonna
be la how's it revolutionize the bottom
line because that's what really moves
the world sadly I miss those days of in
expects in inexpensive air travel well
you know that could be back because this
leap tech stuff could totally change
everything as far as air travel is
concerned making what is sleep text it
stance so it sounds like leapfrog but
now NASA actually Paul Paul little known
fact used to work with NASA and he knows
all about the acronyms within acronyms
within acronyms you thought the
gnu/linux was like full of acronyms NASA
is leap tech stands for leading-edge
asynchronous propulsion and essentially
what it means is it's tightly integrated
propulsion into the airframe you can
kind of here's an awesome photo of it
you can kind of think of this is I'm
unboxing the wing here and you can kind
of think of it as like a tightly
integrated set of like our we've done an
array of small electric motors that
essentially give you give you five
hundred percent more efficiency than
traditional methods with zero emissions
because they're electric and it's a
pretty cool joint venture
nasa esa arrow or es arrow and Joby
aviation which you may recall Toby that
wave didn't the drone guys from the quad
shot yeah the quite so weird how small
the world is but quad shot if you
remember from season 10 from Def Con
that awesome vertical takeoff and
landing drone works for gob energy Joby
Aviation's another arm but they're all
anyway it's all within the family funny
so these electric planes they already
exist right yeah there is ya know there
are there's already electric planes but
nothing this sort of efficiency and I
think it's because of the tight
integration to have like five times more
power thirty percent lower classes what
NASA is saying again zero emissions and
even 15 DB I lower volume if you will so
there's a lot of benefits of doing this
of putting lots of little motors all
along the wing instead of like what
we're used to which is like you know
Boeing 737 huge wings gigantic motors
right yeah right that makes sense so did
you go down to NASA just to pull a heist
and like steal all their planes I might
have borrowed a rock off the lake bed
but that's not the highest I'm talking
about no um again nasa loves acronyms
high stands for hybrid electric
integrated system test bed it's their
terminology for basically a 35-foot
technical demonstrator it's a wing it's
a wing built out of carbon composite and
it's covered in 18 different electric
motors it as you can see looks freaking
amazing and you got to see this actually
fly well okay so not exactly fly you see
they need to do some testing to see kind
of like how it reacts how this airframe
reacts to the wind and all of those
things and there's no better test than a
real-world test and while it would be
awesome to put everything into a wind
tunnel as I just found out it turns out
wind tunnels are ridiculously expensive
and booked like a year in advance so in
their new like philosophy of like quick
turnaround like they're kind of like
hacking stuff together I mean a lot of
this is totally off the shelf stuff i
mean like these motors right here not
that different than the ones the Jobi is
doing for for this whole leap tech
project so
so they got the idea actually from
Scaled Composites the makers of
spaceship one one of my favorite ever
spaceships yes now mr. pretty spaceship
now being made by the spaceship company
oh my god so cool and you guys know
that's the spaceship from Virgin
Galactic and the whole XPrize and all
the good stuff well they got the idea
from them which was basically like I
love it it's kind of like a Lucas thing
right let's just strap the spaceship on
the back of the pickup truck and drive
real fast because wind tunnels be
expensive and so we got a deal with like
the bumpiness of the road and stuff like
that right well so yeah that that's kind
of the thing is in the project for the
heist they strapped it to a giant semi
and they've come up with a really cool
technology that's actually very similar
to the rubber dampeners inside of my
quad here it's very similar um the way
that it like allows them essentially to
just drive across the Rogers dry lake
bed on edwards air force base at like 70
miles an hour and get that same kind of
wind that we would get in a tunnel
except without the expense of shipping
it over to virginia and popping it in a
very expensive wind tunnel and doing all
that stuff so we saw the wing but this
they're actually going to put this on a
plane though yeah that's the idea is
that by 2017 they plan to develop a 1 to
2 megawatt system and that would be able
to power a plain the size of kind of
like a Cessna you know or lighter
general aviation kind of like a four
seater airplane and from there you know
scale it up yeah so actually like allow
people to buy into this or do you like
commercial type purchasing well that's
the hope right is because if the
commercial airliners adopt technology
like this we're going to see huge
improvements in in just a VA shin in
general right because it's quieter it's
lighter it's you know more redundant
it's cheaper and it's pretty cool to see
that I had no idea of this but the in
the presentation that we're showing us
how it turns out fifty percent of
passenger air market is what they call
the thin hall market which is a really
short range and they gave the example of
Cape air which operates some 750,000
passengers a year across a fleet of a
hundred different like 9 seater
Cessnas and they could they could put
this they could adapt to this technology
like really soon into that and so you
know one to 10 or 12 2 megawatt version
would do your smaller planes but like a
225 we do your little I don't I don't
know exactly what the scale is but yeah
from what I understand with electric
power and I know this from doing drones
is you know you just get a bigger motor
bigger propellers bigger airfoil you
know bigger electricity behind it but it
it's it's not like jet engines where you
hope to maybe get thirty percent
efficiency out of so we could actually
see in the future with like a five to
ten megawatt version right regional jets
that instead of a big wing that has a
lot of drag a really thin wing with lots
of integrated propellers across it that
would be you know quieter and more
efficient and better for the world so I
get that it's you know gonna lower or
it's gonna make efficiency better and
it's gonna lower the emissions and lower
costs hopefully but what about what is
this sound like well that was like this
is something where I was really stunned
so this right here here's a sine wave of
a 500 this is an airplane flying over at
500 feet with a typical 300 horsepower
engine
you
okay so that sounds normal you know
heard that before right that's what
we're used to yeah um this thing is
gonna have a ton of propellers right and
so what's really interesting about this
is and this is a really loud er no no
this is a really crude demonstration so
what we just heard was like what we're
all typically used to hearing you know
general aviation Cessnas and other stuff
like Beechcraft flying overhead and
we've all heard it before and it just
kind of blends in with the background
but it is really loud because you've got
say one or two propellers that are like
six feet long and there's a lot of
amplitude in this one frequency range
well what's cool about this is so here
are two drones quadcopters small
aircraft I have to use the right
terminal in jail i legit model aircraft
so they don't upset everybody at home
they both have 6 inch propellers but
they both sound very different and the
reason is this is what we call a 6020
prop and this is a 6 245 prop they have
a slightly different pitch to them and
there's not just the pitch but there's
like all of these different ways that
you can actually change the sound
signature of these little small
propellers and so what's really cool
when you have an array of say 18
propellers across the wing is there's
little tweaks that you can do to each of
them to make sure that they don't all
fall on the same frequency range because
if they did they would just compound and
you would have like we just saw before
one giant spike in one frequency ray
creating a lot of amplitude and making
it sound really loud yeah so the future
would actually this is a computer
simulation of what the similar engine
again 300 horsepower worth at 500 feet
flying over would sound like it's okay
you can come out but there's aliens
there's no aliens I prob sounded like
aliens well I don't want to come out no
it is it's probably just Lucas Films
doing their thing absolutely magic I
know when the grieving it was so great
it turns out sounds like alien turns out
the Jetsons how to write the whole time
isn't that so the rain
I know it's so weird cross between a
helicopter and what I can only imagine
it's something flying around in the Halo
universe definitely what UFOs sound like
from outer space yeah I know yeah I've
heard that I saw a UFO might have been
an f-35 not have been a bird it was
probably bird but anyway okay uh I could
geek out about this for quite a while
you guys know I'm like kind of like an
aviation geek and I have to thank NASA
for giving me the opportunity to come
out to edwards air force base and to
Dryden and Armstrong totally anyway
awesome opportunity that in fact I have
so much more b-roll and other fun things
about great stuff day I got to see like
the Sun like test craft that Neil
Armstrong got to fly the lunar lander
kind of stuff and some of their other
fun crafts lots of drones oh my gosh the
drone stuff we can talk about this
another time what I know we're running a
little long but I just wanted to bring
you that little presentation because
this does sound so freaking sweet I
can't wait to see this come to fruition
and it's so great to see them adopting
this really quick turnaround cycle of
just kind of hacking stuff together you
know we got the wind tunnels just drive
it across the lake bed i love that so
anyway feedback I hak5 dot org that's
where you can let us know what you guys
think and what you would love to see in
the future and I know in the future we
are going to hear all about maker faire
first gonna take a quick break it
doesn't matter whether you're into
synchronous propulsion or asynchronous
propulsion when you've got that killer
idea you need to snag yourself a domain
name and web hosting fast and with
domain coms quick doline discovery
system and they're easy checkout process
you'll have your website up and running
in no time and I have told you guys
before how much I love domain com family
because they're affordable reliable easy
to use but also because they are so much
fun on social media you can tweet them
at domain.com and see why it's just a
fun place to do business and the guys
over at domain.com huge fans of hak5 so
they want to you up they have this
special coupon code it's called hak5
that spells at five and with that we're
get an extra fifteen percent off so when
you think domain names think domain.com
hey guys I'm Shannon Morse back at maker
faire 2015 in San Mateo California here
with Jason from qubit hi Jason how are
you I'm doing great thank you very much
so you are here with Cuban exactly what
is the Cubist so qubit is a programmable
chip that we made but it uses
drag-and-drop visual programming and
plug-and-play hardware to allow for easy
entry points but we also offer software
flexibility because you can still code
and traditional Lua or you can use a
combination of the visual programming
language and lua within the same
environments same with the hardware
flexibility you have plug and play
electronic connectors that plug into
this controller but at the same time you
can get a GPIO connector to wire into
and specific electronics if you want to
did you hear that guys he said gpio a
technology I know you guys love that
kind of stuff so what kind of ports are
normally on here is that just the
regular ones for your wires yeah so
these are these are jst connectors that
we use and although we only have six on
the controller right now we have a
multiplexer smart where the smart words
is what we call the hardware peripherals
that plug into each connector the
multiplexer smartware splits each port
25 additional ones so you can have 30
smart ports on a single controller yeah
does it work with the Arduino as well we
haven't tested with the Arduino but
using the GPIO smart where you should be
able to insert of a soured we know
shields without any problem that is so
cool ok so I know that you guys are
doing this on Kickstarter's how much is
it going to cost on there so right now
we're just looking for 50,000 additional
dollars to complete our manufacturing
process and it's been day four and we're
about I think where I haven't checked
lately but so if last time I check it
was over seventy percent funded so yeah
we're really excited that's awesome
congratulations so my last question well
a few questions about it is how does the
software work you said that it's more of
a GUI interface so is this to introduce
people to technology in programming
right it's a top-down approach to
introducing someone into programming and
electronics so it's very easy it's a
drag-and-drop visual programming means
you're just dropping visual control
blocks and you're
connecting them together using wires so
it becomes a visual flowchart
essentially which is very easy to
visualize and can I use this on my
computer do I have to use it in a
application for example right you can
use a mac or a pc they both run on mac
and pc and if i want to program actually
in lua if I'm used to that already can I
do that as well through the program yeah
you do it within the same programming
environment which we call the cubed
workshop and you can do straight lua
there you can do visual program there or
you can do a mixture of the boat and as
far as the components that I can add to
it can I do things like Bluetooth Wi-Fi
GPS yeah it comes with built-in
bluetooth on the controller itself
because of the power saving benefits we
are working on Wi-Fi smart where GP GPS
smart where's right now for the first
launch of Kickstarter we have 23
different type of smart words were
offering for the first run this is
really exciting Jason I can't wait to
see more of this coming out here you
know introducing younger kids to
technology helping them understand
programming and I think a GUI interface
really does that Thank You yeah we're
trying to allow that easy entry point
but also removing the ceiling so you can
scale it you can grow it you can expense
his advance as you want and end up as
you know one hundred percent programmer
and wiring your own electronics Jason
where can people find more information
about the qubit you can find it at Q
fusion labs com or you can go to
kickstart Cuba calm and check out all
the information we have on a Kickstarter
page awesome thank you so much it was a
pleasure talking to you Thank You
Shannon appreciated
maker faire 2015 and I am here with liam
kennedy one of my favorite people in the
world who created the ISS above hi Liam
how are you hello Shannon the feeling is
entirely mutual thank you well ever
since we sat down together in our first
interview you know back in May of last
year yeah I think it was only one year
ago it was only one year ago that's
that's it it's just amazing so great to
see you here at the maker faire you too
so you created this thing called the ISS
above which basically tracks the
International Space Station any time it
goes overhead so you can look outdoors
and you can see the station going
overhead when the lights are off yes
that's exactly what in fact this is this
is almost the original version and it
was just a Kickstarter I created it for
my grandkids just because I'm their
grandpa who calls them from the US they
live in London and I'd say hey go out
and see the space station well this
thing I created it using a raspberry pi
and programmed it so it would do that
without me having to be there sort of
sounds like I'm not doing my grandpa
duties now I still call them i promised
i believed you so i know a lot has
changed and a lot you've gotten a lot of
updates in the past year so i just
wanted to get a feel about what is going
on with the ISS above project yeah so
i'll start off just by saying the first
thing that's happened is there was some
new cameras launched to the space
station about a year ago that give live
views of the earth from space and i
started to look at well can i connect
with those using a raspberry pi and oh
my gosh could I yeah so in fact it's
actually down here I'm going to lift it
up so that so the glass can see it but
it's this actually showing the the orbit
right now and the the actual device
again this oh yeah these are the six
astronauts up there right now so we have
a most important to to the u.s. is the
scott Kelly who's up there for a whole
year but the crazy thing is is that this
is something that is just running
through a raspberry pi
it you plug it into your TV and whenever
the space station is in sunlight it
gives you live views at the Earth from
space so it's currently in darkness at
the moment it's on the other side of the
earth yeah so it was I think it's
actually now in in sunlight but it's
just I've I couldn't get the video
running inside this hole but I think you
caught a little snapshot of it earlier
so we should be able to prove it's there
so that's one thing you know got that
little device going the other thing I've
got is I did another successful
Kickstarter for a wearable I asked us
above and this is it which you actually
back I did yeah I back the Kickstarter
I'm so excited about it I can't wait to
get mine in the mail yeah so this is
this is a this is actually an RF do we
know so on the back here it's a
custom-designed RF do we know created by
my electronics partner company called
acrobatic and they're here but they
actually put this together for me it's
got an RF do we know so like an Arduino
it's got bluetooth on it plus it's got a
real time clock and what you purchase
was really what's here it'll come as a
kit so you can attach it to anything but
it will come with this patch and let me
just show you this is unprogrammed at
the moment but if I just plug the
battery in yeah it's gonna hate it's a
little bit bright it's a little bit
right that's right my grandkids when
when they were testing this out when I
was in England they they they they had
to they said oh my gosh I can't see
anything afterwards so anyway it will be
a lot dimmer you'll have options to have
it dinner so what it's going to do once
i get mine in the mail and I set it up
program it with the Arduino it'll light
up every time the ISS passes overhead
yeah sorry yes so so what actually
happens is you've got your ISS above it
comes with a bluetooth dongle this
actually has one in it here and when
this thing switches on it says hey I
need to be programmed and this thing
says okay here are the next 50 passes of
the ISS and then at that point it gets
stored in memory and you can literally
just you could unplug the battery from
this thing
and it will remember it so it remembers
the time so when it comes back on again
it's it's all working and it's just
powered by a little battery that you'd
use for your phone to emergency charge
your phones so so I don't have to have
it connected to my arduino I can just
walk away as long as it's in within
Bluetooth range yes exactly and it only
needs to be programmed in at once every
week or so 50 passes probably five to
seven days so can I see the actual the
website for it the interface so so the
way that you can find out more
information about what's happening with
the ISS is to launch the actual website
that's on here and let's just see this
and this is just so I've got my iPad
here and here it is so this is this is
showing you the web server that's
running on the Raspberry Pi in this
device and that's showing you all of the
future passes so there's actually one at
3am the one at four-thirty 8am is
visible anything with a negative number
is visible and then over here on this
side this is actually a live stream if
you like of the tweets that are done by
the approximately 900 plus ISS above's
that are all around the world so
whenever the space station comes
particularly close the device says my
ISS beat bowl you know waving to you and
people customize the message so it's a
it's there's now been I think nearly
70,000 tweets that's amazing i'm so
excited about the ISS above project i
think it's amazing that you're doing
this and I think it's making people
aware that there are their stations
above us and there are people up there
and they're living out their lives up
there that is the key thing because you
know this is a cool gadget i love i love
the fact that i created this gadget but
it's really not about the gadget at all
what it's really about is having people
get it get a feeling a connection and
experience of being connected to the
astronauts on the station and also
connected to the earth
from the feedback I've had from ISS
above customers it really does make a
difference you know even Bill Nye he
said he's quoted in The Wall Street
Journal of saying he's obsessed with his
ISS above's and in fact he's so obsessed
by it you can get an ISS above by
backing the planetary society's
Kickstarter that just launched last on
Tuesday it's already got nearly five
hundred thousand dollars and the ISS
above there's a special custom version
that will track their light sale it's
called lightsail above that's awesome
thank you so much Liam and is there
anything else that you want to tell our
audience about as far as the ISS above
goes so I wanted to just say we're we're
here actually in front of the NASA stand
and ISS above is not officially
sanctioned by NASA at all but this is
one of the most amazing things I never
expected to have this be an opportunity
for me to go and visit NASA Johnson
Space Center I've been there four times
now all because of the ISS above NASA
loves it in terms of you know what it
does and you know it's just provided
some really unexpected opportunities
because you've just got to think I
whoever's whoever's out there listening
to your to your video I'm just the guy
next door on you I'm just someone who
had a crazy idea because I wanted to
impress my grandkids and it's had me
connect to the astronauts on the space
station I met Scott Kelly in January so
you know I just think this is what's
inspired this sort of what the maker
movement is all about it's about you and
me and just do whatever you're
passionate about so and that's that's
what I've got out of this so I think
that's the best quote for Maker Faires
do what you're passionate about thank
you so much Liam and where can people
find more information oh just go to ISS
above.com
have a great maker faire oh my gosh
Shannon that looks like so much fun I
wish I could be in there this year yeah
you kind of missed some awesomeness I
really like that Maker Faire actually
opened it up to just press and like
field trips on Friday before the actual
Maker Faire started up on Saturday and
Sunday because it wasn't so overcrowded
that I was actually able to get work
done so I actually did for interviews
you'll see the other two next week very
cool stuff oh my gosh so much fun listen
we really have to say like this has been
a fantastic show like just covered in
all sorts of field tripping goodness and
I would love to hear you guys feedback
so if you haven't already left a comment
below you can do that or you can email
us feedback at hak5 org let us know what
you think and what you'd like to see
coming up and of course check out our
merchandise store over at HEK shop.com
that's where you can find all the
goodies all the time yes and you can go
over to hak5 or guess we're going to
find all the shows in fact you know the
metasploit minutes and the threat wires
and the tech things and the hack tips
and the pineapple University and you
leavin you could click follow over there
and find all of the social networks and
all the ways that you can interact with
us is we use be all over the social
stuffs my friends it I think that is
with all of that I'm Darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse trust your techno lust
no I'm leaving no it's so creepy I'm
gonna get nightmares so good so good
