you dear over Twitter one table sea
sprite in fresh wit without his era
one of the scams to do the show wow you
beautiful ready
this episode of fact 5 is brought to you
by gamefly goto assist Express remote
support made easy and domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain hey guys great show this week
Shannon's coming to us with some remote
access Twitter apps and then I'm talking
about sand boxes for malware analysis Oh
some news on the portable studios you
know the Shannons using one out in
missouri right now and i've also just
delivered them to both Jason Appelbaum
and muvek so looking forward to seeing
some segments from them on the show soon
which would be awesome and I do need to
thank you guys for all of the warm
wishes I got a ton of emails since the
last episode of talking about getting
laid off while I was on vacation no less
but but thank you so much all of those
are just warm the soul and have been
encouragement to just go ahead and
pursue this full time so you know I
think we'll make it work and it's just
going to mean a better show for you guys
in the end so I'm staying positive and
that's the idea so to reiterate the plan
it is that I'm selling everything and
then getting my life down to a couple
duffel bags which is going to be
interesting and sweet and stuff like
that and then motorcycling the cross
country where I will rendezvous with
Shannon in San Francisco so if you'd
like to get involved with that project
there will be some information on hak5

hak5 got a great idea it all starts with
a great domain at domain.com last week
we took our monkey frolicking through
the internets famous red light district
intentionally picking up some malware to
see how some consumer sandboxing
solutions held up and we got a lot of
email about our methods so before we go
any further I want to clarify one thing
the purpose of this test was to see how
some consumer sandboxing solutions would
hold up to complete noobs and trust me
only a complete noob would use internet
explorer 6 that said Komodos latest
internet security beta and sandboxie
performed admirably and had i just
opened all of the malware and sandbox
see this would have been smiles across
the board but sandbox you made it really
easy for me to save the files back to
the real file system and double-click
with reckless abandon she's exactly what
noobs do but enough about monkeys and
noobs and whores today we're focusing on
a different kind of sandbox
saturday
in our experiment last week I ran a bit
of malware through virus total calm I
know it's a service that we've talked
about on the show but essentially if
you're new to it you upload your fishy
files to them and they provide you a
report of the findings of about 40
different antivirus engines it's an
invaluable tool for any security
researcher it's really nice to see what
those 40 different antivirus engines all
report the signatures they've seen but
then that asks a question how to
antivirus systems and intrusion
detection systems identify malware
anyway now where itself is a pretty
generic term encompasses viruses worms
trojan horses rootkits by wear whatever
the basic principle is that it's
software designed to hostile intent that
compromises your computer without you
can send malware is also really
difficult to detect traditional
antivirus software looks for
characteristics like byte code sequences
and stuff to identify more to code but
nowadays malware changes its appearance
to avoid detection and there's so much
of this malicious software ping on the
net now that traditional methods of
identifying the bad stuff like reverse
engineering the code just isn't
effective and that's what brings us back
to the sandbox I can dig it in small
banana sundae thank you
a CW sandbox is an automated malware
analysis sandbox it works simply by
running suspected malware through a live
environment simulated Windows OS if you
will and as opposed to trying to break
the actual malware executable and figure
out what the code does we just monitor
everything that it does when it's run in
a live environment so all of the network
traffic it generates all of the DLLs it
loads any changes to the file system or
even the windows registry just watch now
this is all achieved using a technique
called API hooking which basically means
that whenever the malware calls the
windows application programmers
interface to go ahead and do something
like connect to an IP address or modify
a file what it's actually doing is
talking to the CW sandbox monitoring
software that logs all of this and then
it goes ahead and actually perform the
action so you can kind of think of it as
a sort of operating system
man-in-the-middle think I love bananas
more than a monkey mmm so once a
suspected malware sample is run through
the tool it generates a report that
actually shows you everything that the
executable is actually doing which is
really nice because it's machine
readable and it can be then fed into
another system like an antivirus or an
intrusion detection system so that they
can monitor for you know other similar
behavior you can try it out yourself at
MW analysis com they have a page where
you can upload your own files and get an
email to report you can even upload a
zip file of a whole bunch of junk if
you'd like there's even a commercial
edition that you can license at sunbelt
sandbox com it's not going to replace
like a desktop antivirus or anything
like that but if you're curious about
what a process actually does you know
some of the things that we kind of threw
at the I six and boxes last week it's
definitely worth a look
so if you've got any questions about
this stuff go ahead and hit a feedback
at hak5 org and then just a member we're
going to go over to chin and for trivia
but first I'm going to get another

the power of running your own ss8 or VNC
service at home for remote access
wouldn't it be cool if you just simply
text message your computer and say
something like hey what's your external
IP address or you go download this file
or how about sending me a screenshot
well if Robin wood has taught us
anything with creo SI to controlling
your computer over social media or even
a botnet for that matter is totally
possible but now it's time for something
a lot more user-friendly this week
Shannon investigates tweet my pc so
you're leaving from work on a Friday you
get on the highway and crap you forgot
to lock your office computer there's
nobody still at the office to lock it
for you so anybody could go in there and
see any documents or data that's still
on your desktop that's why tweet my PC
is such a good program for this it's a
very simple simple software application
that uses the dotnet framework and vb
net to control and access your computer
from anywhere just by using a twitter
message now usually you need a server
between two computers for them to talk
or you need a static IP and that's
something that most people just don't
have this is why the simplicity of
Twitter is so useful developers can use
Twitter to create any programs and you
can tweet messages from your laptop as
long as you have an internet connection
or a cell phone now of course this isn't
going to replace B and C just like
Darren said but if you just need to send
a quick message to your computer to shut
it down or lock it this program is
perfect so let's check out the set up
there have been plenty of those remote
control your pc over Twitter programs
before but usually there's some kind of
bizarre perl script and you have to know
something about programming in the first
place just to get started not with this
one go over to tweet my pc codeplex com
grab the setup zip from the download
section unzip it double click and click
next next finish bob's your uncle and
then you're done the only tricky part is
configuring it you will need a dedicated
twitter username and password this will
remain private so you can pretty much
name it anything and then you also need
a gmail user name and password if you're
anything like me and you pretty much
live inside gmail you may want to
consider getting a new dedicated
username and password for that gmail
account and it's kind of a security
measure and protection for you alright
let's check out how to use this thing ah
oh alright now that we're all
configured what can you do with it well
all the commands are listed at the tweet
my pc website for example if you tweet
it with IP it'll reply back with the
public IP address which is great if
you're running any kind of servers at
home or you could tweet it with King
followed by an IP address and it will
reply back with the results which is
pretty nice but honestly if you've got
deep into trouble shooting your home
network you might just want to use a
real VNC or ssh client anyway the
download command is very nice as well I
actually got a lot of use out of that
one especially if you want to if you're
out at a pub and you need to download
the new attack 5 episode and you want it
to be ready for when you get home to
watch or you can just subscribe to us on
iTunes do it there's also a lot of very
not very useful commands like a
wallpaper because you obviously need to
know your wallpaper while you're out or
a less you didn't forget what your OS is
while you're on vacation right please
tell me you didn't forget that still
what's what makes this tool really
valuable is the fact that you can create
your own custom commands like you can
fire up BitTorrent and download some
legally very legal files or you could
defrag your hard drive with ultra defrag
from last week's nubs report because
your ultra cool right okay so i have
tweet my pc all set up and i'm going to
type in lock i'm sending this text
message to twitter
now tweet my pc on my computer is going
to check these messages every one minute
and once it sees that I just twittered
lock it'll actually lock my computer and
now we wait for it to lock a lot it
works yes cool ok now I'm going to hit
shut down and send because even though
it's in lock it'll still check my tweets
every minute and it'll eventually shut
it down awesome ok let's face it tweet
my pc is not going to replace ssh or VNC
but it's relatively easy to set up you
don't have to have any programming
knowledge and it relies on social media
like twitter and gmail so as long as the
fail whale doesn't strike you'll be able
to text message your computer while
you're at a bar alone not talking to
