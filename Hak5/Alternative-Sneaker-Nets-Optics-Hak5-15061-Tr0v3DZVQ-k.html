files between two computers without
using USB ethernet Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
that's right we're using optics this
segment of hak5 is brought to you by
domain.com hello welcome back by my name
is darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse it's
your weekly dose of techno us that's
right it is I'm sure my system pride oh
nice dude i'm showing my love foxy prey
there we go no little kissin in little
hearts haha it's very girly I'm sorry
hey what can I say get firefox hey I
just got a new device at home and it's
fine it's a little Roku 3 really yeah
dude I'm so excited about this thing cuz
I haven't upgraded in like four years
but it still just plays video right I
mean yeah okay so you can pull all the
last one you couldn't do actually play
games on it well no but okay but you can
and it has a SD slot for pictures are
you actually going to bridges on it no
okay I'm just gonna watch netflix on it
didn't the last one just watch Netflix
yeah whatever Breaking Bad I don't
understand what you doing this week
stuff hey them making things happen I'm
getting files from oh so we're talking
about this uh you know my fuse enrico
box source code or something right ah
yeah yes Shannon ha ha ha ha actually
the cinema you've got a unique name in
that your Shannon and Morse you ever
saying all my radio people in the crowd
are all like dude you know you got some
theorems up in there um yeah but yeah
I'm basically going to get files back
and forth between this online machine
and this siloed offline machine without
using bluetooth without using Wi-Fi
without using ethernet without using USB
no hardware hey sorry we'll see summit
some hurts ah off the beaten path
hardware just for fun this is the thing
you are playing with earlier yes dude
this thing is so weird I can't wait for
you guys to see it it's me this bread
it's a retro nice thing to know please
just an ashen and give it away I gotta
eat like Bernie s.o one of our friends
has a awesome kick started going on
right now you guys know Dale chase he's
the guy that I sang ssh to your heart
with yeah you also know him from a lot
of the music within hak5 and coder girl
and a bunch of other awesome stuff she's
got a new element our credit gasps yes
so cool yeah so he just came out with a
new CD I've sang with him before I did
the vocals for ssh to your heart till
minutes a game so this is called rap
battle showdown haha it's a Kickstarter
project he just started it it's going on
four til October 17 and he's he's got
quite a bit in there so far but it's
it's basically a android app that he's
going to create with help from friends
oh like graphics people and coders and
whatnot and it's basically like you you
get to create your own verses and sing
to it and it's like rock band for
rappers I love it you can battle with
somebody else during the game now I'm
back to this country your great demo
Mike oh yeah it's so cute check it out
one of our friends was making the
characters and their adorable there's a
dual core character next he did an
update just today and august eighth its
adorbs very cute i love it dual core one
with an all the things she loved it yeah
I'm totally gonna play this game I'm
gonna learn how to rap cool well with
all of that we're gonna a quick break
and then get right into it so stay tuned
budding entrepreneurs startups
innovators they are all turning their
ideas into realities backed by the
strength of a dotnet domain you guys
know it dot nets are globally known they
are one of the most popular domain
extensions the.net injects credibility
instantly into your brand entrepreneurs
and startups are immediately discovering
the advantages of building on a.net so
why don't you go ahead and consider if
you already have a dot-com well then get
the dotnet to go with if you wanna com
that's already taken well the dotnet is
a perfect alternative and you can find
Nets the same place we do over at domain
com I love these guys they are so
affordable domains dotnet there's 899 a
year they're reliable they're easy to
use their social media presence on
Twitter at domain.com and it just makes
it a fun place to do business so get
this the guys over at domain.com are
huge fans they want to hook you up get
fifteen percent off their already
affordable domain names and web hosting
all you have to do is use that coupon
code hak5 at domain coms check out
that's fifteen percent off and big time
savings so don't forget to use that
coupon code hak5 you think domain names
think domain.com
so a couple of weeks ago I did a fun
little segment about setting up PGP unit
you guys know we've been talking about
pretty good privacy and it's pretty good
accepts a lot of the implementations
aren't quite they leave something to be
desired in the sense that there are a
lot of attack vectors as mobis has come
on and demonstrated really protecting
your private key is essential to things
like PGP we've been using our fun
implementation here the open source
stuff open gpg and we've been setting it
up on a netbook that is never connected
to the internet never will connect to
the internet this right here is the air
gap and in the previous segment I set up
you know everything so that we would
transfer files between here i have my
online machine and here i have my
offline machine and i just did with a
simple USB Drive you know hey sneakernet
right it still works and so many YouTube
commenters pointed out and to their
credit that what if the USB gets pwned
you know remember Stuxnet and it's like
no absolutely I do I don't know why
exactly i would carry around a pound USB
key or owned or whatever i don't know
why i would execute you know a binary
off of one but you know okay you're
right to your credit there is you know
potential there for abuse basically with
the air gap what we're doing is limiting
the attack surface and in this case you
know the really only way to attack the
machine would be the you know either
physical access all bets are off
although we're trying to mitigate as
best we can using full disk encryption
and over the transport medium in this
case the USB drive to speak her net our
PGP encrypted messages over to our air
gap we you know unencrypted them we read
the message we write a reply we encrypt
that and then the encrypted message goes
back over to our online machine so we
never have to see her you know cheese or
anything like that in the open i love
this however you're right we've been
having a lot of fun with USB over the
last several years on hak5 in fact some
of the stuff is you know i've heard has
been used in Stuxnet what you guys might
remember the hacksaw and switchblade and
of course my favorite the USB rubber
ducky so okay I
this challenge and I love this challenge
because it allows us to talk about some
esoteric stuff that I just love geeking
out about so we're going to rat hole a
little bit about file transfers and very
untypical ways and the first is going to
be with matrixes matrix bar codes or 2d
barcodes basically a way of storing data
across both the x and y access if you've
seen barcodes on products you know there
are lines across the thing but 2d
barcodes basically allow you to have a
much higher data density there are a
couple of common 2d barcode formats like
data matrix aztec code or QR code the
first who are actually public domain
with data matrix being able to handle
some 2,300 alphanumeric characters an
aztec handling around thirty eight
hundred digits 3,000 letters or 1900
bytes not exactly patent free the QR
code though or a quick response code is
actually really cool it's become a de
facto standard especially among
smartphones was actually originally
developed and patented by a toyota
subsidiary but they've chosen not to
exercise that patent and it's also one
of the higher data densities being able
to handle 1200 ascii characters with a
thirty percent error correction so this
should be sufficient for our messages
and if they are longer messages we can
of course break them up into multiple
chunks and thankfully generating QR
codes is a breeze cross-platform on
Android for example there is the barcode
generator this is an awesome app I love
this it requires no permissions
whatsoever you just type in the contents
it generate and there you go if you're
watching closely at home you can scan
that and you will get a nice little
hello world we'll come back to that in
just a second and being able to generate
and read these on Android or on Linux is
really easy I'm going to show off a
quick demo of how we can create these on
our netbook here in ansi I know we're
really getting esoteric today so check
this out we are going to use QR in code
and with a couple of options here our
tacho is for output I'm going to call it
hello dot QR and then tack T for our
encoding type and in this case
and see
is I'm reminiscent of my BBS days all
right and so we just get a prompt here
where we can type whatever we want and
I'll say hello world and then when
you're done you hit ctrl D saves file if
we LS hello duck you are there it is and
if we cat hello doc you are check that
out that right there is just antsy
characters coming up with the equivalent
of hello world and so we can go ahead
and expand on this quite a bit by you
know since it is just a UNIX program
that except standard input and output we
can kind of you know concatenate
messages and pipe them into this and we
can even use multiple different formats
so I'm going to come over to this
machine I'm going to encode a file we're
going to pass it over to this machine
using a different tool so in that case
i'm going to say LS start ASC i know i
have some files on here there we go
we've got a message for bob text ASC if
I cat that this is my GP g encrypted
message that I'd like to get from this
computer to the other and so to do that
I'm going to cat it once again this time
I will pass it over to QR in code and in
this case I'm going to do tack oh and
i'm going to say message queue or PNG
we're going to make this guy a PNG file
and there we go and with that really
what we need to do now is display it and
so we can use I of Nome or you know if
we're using mate or Monta we can use eom
but ug or display or whatever other
program have you to display messages or
display PNG files
we get that on our screen whoops that's
not the right file but that is okay and
we'll full screen this guy so here we go
that's the entire message so let's come
over to our other machine because we
obviously need to read this in and so to
do that what is ubiquitous on all
laptops all cell phones these days
webcams I'm so excited about doing this
okay so check this out we're going to
use another tool here I'm going to
increase this font just a bit so you can
see a little better here we go and we're
going to go ahead and use a program
known as z bar cam so z bar cam is
really cool we can specify our webcam in
this case it's / dev / video 0 and I'll
just do it with by default and you'll
see what I mean alright so this loads up
my webcam hello the frame rate is really
bad because this is a tiny little adam
pc but you'll see here they hold up my
phone okay but i should have moved this
window over so you can see it writing
into the screen but you'll see it says
QR code hello world go ahead and wait
out of this all right and you'll notice
that it actually prefixes this by saying
hey it's a QR code this is able to
recognize whether it's a QR code or
regular barcode or you know data matrix
or Aztec or any of the other esoteric
ways of encoding these messages in just
you know black and white or even color
actually it's really cool that it's able
to decipher that but we don't
necessarily need QR code colon in our
message because we will eventually want
to use this to take you know this big
message over here and pipe that into a
file so let's go ahead and do this again
and this time we will use the flag tak
tak raw and I will show once again using
my cell phone and move this guy over
and there we go we just get hello world
which is
exactly what we want all right so now
we're just going to put all of this
together by piping it into a file we're
going to call it message one txt okay
and we could if we really wanted to
there's actually a flag for TAC techno
display which will not show the webcam
but we're not going to do that we're
just going to make it a little easier on
ourselves but if you really wanted to
automate this and not have it pop up
extra messages and extra dialogues and
everything I think it's kind of a cool
way to do that so with a single walk
into message txt anything this reads is
going to go into that file so now set
these guys up to look at each other
now it may take a little bit to get
these situated perfectly of course the
more data that you're trying to transmit
the more precise it needs to be here
with the studio lights it can be a
little touchy however we should be able
to go ahead and close this now and cat
that file now there we go and cat
message 1 dot txt and there we go we
have the message and there we go i mean
successful data transmission over
webcams and QR codes we can do this both
ways and i think that this is while not
maybe the most practical now with a
little bit of finessing this could
actually become a really simple solution
with some scripts using like X cut to
take from the clipboard a pgp message
and automate the generation of it and
then maybe even on the receive side if
it notices it go ahead and pipe that
into gpg and automatically decode the
message which could be really cool but
doesn't prove the concept I think this
is really fun I want to hear what you
guys think feedback at hak5 org and when
we get back later in the show we're
going to be doing something very similar
again this time not using by using video
and webcams no no we're going really old
school with some audio but we're going
to be back right after a quick break
so we've been talking about encryption a
lot lately and I wanted to mention one
of my favorite features of of course our
sponsor crashplan I'm a huge fan of
their service have been using it for
years I've got terabytes up in the cloud
and I wanted to show you how you can
properly set it up by importing your own
448 bit Blowfish key you guys know I've
been talking about this this is the
open-source cypher from Bruce Schneier
it's good stuff so let's go ahead and
get started I'm here in mint linux and
i've already gone ahead and downloaded
crashplan it's a free trial 30 days no
credit card and basically to get started
just unpack the file and run the
installer now this guide you through
pretty much everything we're going to go
ahead and do it as root so that we can
have this set up as a service for all of
the users
and most of the defaults will just go
ahead and work for us this is in the
latest version of Linux Mint we'll go
ahead and start the desktop service
and create the account
now this is really cool because we've
got a crash plan plus trial which means
for a month we can use the advanced
features like the 448 bit Blowfish but
even if we don't use the crashplan
central cloud backup we can already use
the friend another computer or a folder
for free which is really cool because
this is a very nice cross-platform
application windows mac linux solaris so
let's go ahead before we even make our
first backup and set up the security the
right way so under settings
go to security and
going to choose 448 bit encryption with
a custom 448 bit key now we could use
this to either set up a pass phrase or
generate our own however we're going to
go ahead and import a key and for this
we're going to need to create that file
so in this case let's go ahead and I
will open up a notepad here and we're
just going to create a file and say this
is a 56 character long pass phrase yes
yes it is period there we go I'm going
to save that in my home folder as
passphrase not key
now we can use openssl to go ahead and
encrypt this base 64 and we're going to
use Blowfish CBC now our input file is
that passphrase key we just created and
our output is as phrase dot base64 it's
going to ask us for again a passphrase
so I'm going to use something really
long and secure and now we have a
resulting file if I cat that passphrase
64 we're going to go ahead and copy all
of this to the clipboard
and come back over into crashplan from
here we can go ahead and paste our
passphrase and save and we're going to
check that we understand all of these
conditions which are basically do not
lose this key we can never lower the
security and if we do lose it we can't
get our files back but with all of that
said we can now go ahead and start our
backup now it's really important at this
point to go ahead and back up that key
and probably put it in say like a
TrueCrypt volume with another pass
phrase that you remember okay I'm really
excited about this I want to hear what
you guys think be back at hak5 org and
of course crashplan calm to find out
more about their service Cheers last
week's trivia question was the key size
used for an aes cipher specifies the
number of repetitions of transformation
rounds that convert the input called the
plain text into the final output called
the cipher text and what are the first
three numbers of cycles of repetitions
and the answer was 10 cycles for
repetitions for 128-bit keys 12 cycles
for 192 and 14 for 256 now if you got
all of that right you can actually win a
prize now this week's question is what
is another name for the region Dale
cipher and i'll spell that out for you
guys if you're listening on audio that's
RI j &amp;amp; d AE l cypher you can answer that
over at hak5 org slash trivia for your
chance to win some awesome hak5 swag
