in the house is rebooting I put the damn
battery out of my phone your mom yeah
try it in there and the still images
what the heck is that man I'm your news
worth of overlord I told you we
shouldn't have plug that thing in Frank
right crank whoa whoa whoa right he said
that was an accident and you guys truly
want her back
you know this is just ridiculous you
can't be stopping the show like this
it's bad enough when he killed Frank but
when we walk back with a madman no
regrets where's Alec truth she's with
you Holly come on hey I'm not yours 17
you know I thought she was with you
you're doing trivia with her yeah but
I'm fine she's just not with me I
haven't seen her I haven't seen her in a
while yeah that's where did your heart I
just don't think we can I know we've got
so you're all right
you guys okay oh then then get my ass
way but kernel panic go get back to you
I'm hungry well uh should I still go get
beer to that celebrate hey yes beer
hey everybody this is season 3 episode 1
of hak5 now I'm kicking this whole thing
off out here why else would I be out in
the middle open water I got a mod for
you that's right and that would be the
underwater camera nothing particularly
fantastic it's not going to win any
beauty awards but this thing is frickin
awesome I found it on instructables and
all it is is an ammo box that i sanded
all the nasty rough rust off of it and
everything used an angle grinder to cut
out the whole back here a little bit of
silicon sealant puts the plexi on nice
and tight nice watertight seal and some
LEDs that I wired in yes yes LEDs but
these have purpose these four LEDs right
here are going to act as a headlight
underneath the water so when we drop our
camera and we can actually see something
we'll go ahead and pop it open for you
now ammo boxes have a tendency to float
so made ourselves some sandbags is
ballast get this anywhere normal lawn
and garden store and some Ziploc bags
toss these out of here we've got our
trusty handycam here it's been good to
us and it will continue to be good to us
not worried about so take the lens cap
off go ahead and power it on let that
lean over there there we go
and we're recording right now hi
everybody just to make sure things line
up okay take one bag play it right down
in the bottom so we've nestled the
camera down in there it's got a nice
seat it's not going to move anywhere add
a little ballast make sure we still have
a clean shot go ahead and power up our
LEDs now there's no switch on this thing
just because you know it's a really
single-use kind of deal so you just take
the battery out of it in and out one
more bag for good measure sealer up we
got some wood rope normal nylon nothing
special lash it on here I think we'll go
with a slip knot make sure we're good
and tight bout Center pick it up so all
there is to it on that night in that
realm so all we have to do now drop it
in the water set it over leave it down
there for a minute or two just to see
what's going on
maybe a bass or something would like to
come up and say hi
alright we're just rolling here a little
bit we don't want to run into the shore
go ahead and pull the camera back up
just a second all right here we go go
ahead and open her up look inside we're
still dry as a bone ok so we've dropped
our Cameron we did our beta test that's
all that really was just a beta test and
headed back to shore now a quick tip for
you is when you drop your camera in make
sure you put it on manual focus and set
your focus on infinity so that way you
can actually look past anything any kind
of artifacts that might be on your lens
on your plexi now something I would have
done a little bit differently is may be
tested a few more times test the box at
different depths because i think i did
have a small leak but the most efficient
way to learn is from your own mistakes
second most efficient way is to learn
from somebody else's mistakes so if you
decide to do this make sure that you do
the same thing tested a few different
depths to make sure that it'll hold up
to the pressure more water on it the
more pressure there is silicon has a
tendency to expand and contract under
pressure so glad you could join me out
here it's been fun look forward to a
whole lot more mods this season I'm I've
been trying to work on a cue and you
have a whole lot more things ready for
you other than that catch out what's on
the rest of the show on hack fat
the real problem with being a geek is
that doesn't really offer the
opportunity to meet new people in real
life outside of your university CS
program it's really hard to find someone
to connect with over the new of the box
set of Star Trek or over the new release
of your favorite tech TV podcasts you
can look at a person to say at all but
you can't look a person to say geek
let's just work that way geek the geek
is an online matchmaking service that
caters specifically the geeks and their
admirers if you're interested for more
information go to gk to gk com that's gk
to gk com okay so last trivia question
was this sequence can be defined
recursively using the operation of
bitwise negation name the sequence and
continue it for 1,000 24 bits bonus
points for writing it in basic I was
correctly answered by Horza who even run
it in Python it's called the thule morse
sequence and it's numbers that are here
on the screen and there are also props
to métier for his basic implementation
way to go man good job both of you
writing it in basic definitely hats off
but I could do it Horza beat you to it
so anyway thank you so much now this
month's trivia question is in Soviet
Russia television watches you'll is an
example of the Russian reversal a type
of joke popularized by comic Yakov
Smirnoff many variations exist
especially throughout slashdot what is
the grammatical term for this formula
based cliche coined by Glenn Whitman in
2004 bonus points for giving an example
as always your submissions can be sent
to trivia at hak5 gonna work thank you
so much enjoy the rest of the show so I
figured we put the second path of the
story at the top of the d-block do you
block I thought way running short oh
yeah we are but we're starting at the B
Block now so you dropped a 4d yeah I
mean I'm kind of partial to the d-block
seem that we share the same initials and
all okay how about this Paul does all
the blocking for this
sold sweet alrighty so uh what are we
gonna do about eeeevil sir well he was
shipped here from newegg and what you
know you do a quelle please are you
kidding me not pink and plug nope damn
it anyway so evil server well he was
shipped here from newegg ass that only
means one thing RMA kids wanna play some
food woot end up hey go what's this
regards your block it's God let's go
so when she's not buried in a Harry
Potter book or catching up on the latest
cop drama you can find her deep within
Photoshop yes I am talking about the one
they only Ally bearing thank you so much
I here today is all about photoshop
brushes yeah I'm gonna be teaching you
and you how to make your own photoshop
brushes and photoshop brush snow so I
love brushes it's it's really quick and
easy once you really get that to it I
mean it's in Photoshop itself you don't
need any other programming to do it I've
always wondered how those are created
because you know being a amateur graphic
design kind of like to tinker around
make hak5 wallpapers kind of guy when it
comes to making something look good
grungy brushes you can never go wrong
and you can make your own know after I
teach you sweet so what do we need to do
to make our own photoshop brush well
first of all you're gonna want to find
images if you're looking for a brush set
save elephants are sunflowers I chose
sunflowers you're gonna want to find
pictures of this online it's easy to
find just go to google images and type
in sunflowers we're having ponies you
can make them pink by slipping color
that's it um anyway you're gonna open up
all these images in photoshop and the
first thing you're gonna want to do when
you're editing these images is you're
gonna select the background mm-hmm and
make sure you delete that okay so you've
got a sunflower hear that yes sunflower
you found sunflower and like google
images or something and we want to take
just that out you want to get the
justice sunflower none of the background
their leaves around it you're gonna
select that you neither select that hit
delete or so yeah shows really we just
do a little bit of it and then show how
you would do that to select the lasso
tool no more clothes okay oh and then
you go back with you really cool or or
rotoscoping it those are we have learned
more advanced yes but in the end it's
going to look like this oh that's gonna
happen that our image out and we want to
turn it into a brush what do we need to
do before we get into the whole brush
making process your Oh since you're
making a brush set you're gonna go into
your edit preset manager you're going to
see that all the basic brushes are open
here so this is all of the brushes that
you find by default when you choose your
brush toilet right click that's selected
right now the one that's selected now
that
is your open palette okay i'm gonna
select all these and just hit this way
don't limit doesn't take it off your
computer it just erases the palette with
what you're working sure and then you're
free to close that okay next so we've
got a color image here and you said
earlier we can't make color brushes no
they only come out in the color that you
have you're all set that makes sense so
if I want that to be a pink flower and
so yellow flower just choose pink and
then clicky clicky but so you can go
either up to the long way go to image
adjustments and desaturate and do that
or you can hit ctrl shift to you if you
want to be a lead control show you right
yes alright and see how it's really gray
here and there's no real definition ya
can go up to image adjustments and
levels and your your highlights are on
the right you can pull those down a
little bit and you can move this aside
to see how you're always going so you're
like changing the contrast yeah you want
you want it to actually see some
definition you wanted to have pure white
and pure black in in the brush so that
you have real definition and graze in
between to give it some you know texture
okay once that's ready you're gonna go
back up to this edit menu you'll see
define brush preset now this is your
saving process you're gonna want to name
it something familiar it doesn't have to
have a dot PSD r dot jpg it's just going
to need to brush the whole sunflower
face so when you actually pull up this
brush preset right click and you see all
the thumbnails of your brushes it will
be oh there it is you can select it yes
and we can make it smaller and so you
can paint the whole picture with it well
alright and so that looks like it's
really good for doing like stamps so if
i wanted to take like the hak5 logo and
stamp it on I don't know picture of
Harrison and Wes and and you all of us
everyone if you want basically want to
make these are great for making
watermarks especially if you're an
artist you want to protect your work you
can make a whole bunch of them in the
set and then just stamp it right on
there without having to go through the
whole thing every time stamp that unless
his face yes okay cool them so we've got
that I've logo that we pulled off the
wiki we're gonna desaturase it same
process before
make it a little bit so that was control
L to get the levels menu that's another
shortcut key you can find all the
shortcuts listed the edits and swords
and again we're going to go to edit
define brush preset and say hack I have
logo now after you've done this it just
saves it into this instance of a
Photoshop you have open right now so the
computer crashes or you reboot and don't
save if you don't save it as a set it's
not gonna come back up well let's save
it as a set so we can put sunflowers on
pictures of Wes and maybe hak5 logo I
think everybody would enjoy that in the
show notes okay as earlier mm-hmm
remember when we cleared out our preset
manager sure now when we go back to a
preset manager I can see the brush it
made now if you just click on one and
say save brush our safe set its gonna go
save that warm breath do you want you're
gonna want to hit ctrl I to select
everything and then save the set as a
Joe test sure and once that's saved we
can close this down and we can open it
back up again so okay so this is the
week where you would choose all of the
other brushes that you have and you can
add it to another set of brushes a load
brushes hmm and their show test right
there and it comes up as okay so it just
adds it to the existing brushes you have
so you're not swapping back and forth
all the time mmm great we make many many
sets there's no limit to how many sets
you can make her what you can do we'll
take this hak5 of me let's go stamp wet
5cyl our I think they want us to sustain
Wes please meet a to wes's for hey let's
tattoo was his forehead with it how do I
logo really usually that your devious I
know and there he is with a kitten with
a kitten even of all the kidding things
so we give the attack by white have fun
and you know what the I think the pink
the kitten would look really good with
some maybe pink flowers and you're just
right clicking with your brush yeah you
just right click to bring it back up and
then what is that that you're making it
to make smaller boat you can use your
brackets to make it larger or smaller so
bracket left bracket right makes them
okay cool apply on having an episode
words just photoshop shortcuts and how
can edit those yourself well when ball
yeah awesome you know what he looks so
pretty go ahead and save that we need to
put in the show notes I guess that
brings us to the end of brushes but I'm
really excited about what we're gonna do
next whether it be rotoscoping or
shortcuts or anything I was really
awesome Allie well thanks so much for
putting a hak5 logo on Wes and the
kitten and the little cute little
flowers I think he's gonna be very happy
makes me go squeak okay so we'll put
those in the show notes and maybe even
offer up that brush and I guess we look
forward to hearing about you and your
brushes so hit us up on the hak5 yeah I

org but after that about an hour after
the show gives us a chance to wind down
will be getting in there and we're going
to own you all you have no chance to
survive make your tell all your base are
belong to us so next up is wireless
hacking Darren stop check it out
okay so last season kicking it off
Darren pretty much scared the entire
world with one of these USB thumb drive
commonly now known as the hacksaw you
all know that well we're kicking this
season off again with another USB hack
but this one involves wireless so Darren
USB wireless I'm assuming maybe some
package sniffing of course I mean what
would you know wireless be without
packet sniffing that's what I figured
yeah so uh what's the hardware going on
here like okay well what we're actually
looking at is I'm going to take the
nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector which is
just a little USB dongle that you can
pick up for say your nintendo DS or your
nintendo wii mm-hmm i guess i should
take a step back and explain that well
the nintendo DS is awesome and fun
especially when you have one of those
lamont chips you can't connect to wpa
encrypted access points like we have
here in the house right so after trying
to force some WEP you know what it was
just no much no fun so twenty
twenty-five dollars went out picked up
this little USB guy and basically what
it does is it's got a CD with some
Nintendo software you plug it into your
computer and it hooks you up your
Nintendo dsl put some Wi-Fi or your your
wii and there you go it just shares the
connection that computer has no okay
that's cool so so what are some of the
caveats about using this hardware for
this particular hack well sure well the
main problem is the hardware is fine the
hard works by buffalo we know buffalo as
the makers of the infamous terry station
with high roller station they terrify
and it's a little too inside but
whatever it basically the problem comes
down to the software the nintendo
software is to suck it's right only for
windows XP i'm not even sure about vista
definitely not for anything before XP if
you're running a mac you're sol and you
can't connect any other device to it
except for your you know we
and your new Nintendo do yes yeah so
what I thought you know was why isn't
this just a regular access point and
thankfully some awesome kid Casey AJ
blue on the after dawn forms has gone
ahead and figured that out and that's
what I'm demonstrating here so I'm
assuming that there's going to be some
some new drivers or some like drives a
calculation so like walking through this
let's see well let's just go ahead and
plug it in and I've already installed
the driver so I'm not going to walk you
through that but if you've seen one
driver install you've seen a million
basically we have a RAR file up on the
site that you can download with the
whole package of all the stuff that you
need to get this going and it includes
the replacement drivers for this so
don't install the Nintendo crappity crap
just go with the the drivers we have
here and once we're once we have those
installed you know you'll see a screen
like this the Buffalo wliu to ya idea
has been installed great so we're just
going to skip that and the next thing we
need to do after that is to actually
install the asus w land configuration
tool ok now the asus w land
configuration tool is actually for a
different piece of aces hardware and the
coolest part about this asus hardware is
it comes with this software that lets
you do soft AP so instead of you know
linksys router netgear router with you
know dd-wrt or an open wrt you can just
use your operating system say it's a
more advanced version of the like ad hoc
windows wireless network sharing exactly
but this way you can do an
infrastructure wireless connection right
yeah it's running it's more advanced
it's just going to the only other one
that I've seen has been for Linux and
BSD this one's super simple and runs on
Windows and we all know that it's the
best hacker operating system ever so
let's just do that because ninety
percent of you are using it anyway it's
all my so okay so we need to set up this
soft ap sure so we install the W land
configuration tool that the ASIS
software and then we have to replace the
WLAN files with these replacement
executables and all we have to do is
just simply
up our go to the directory where we have
our ASIS stuff and copy and just you
know paste that over and just go ahead
and replace all of those I've already
done that and once you've got that
installed you need to replace the RT
2500 USB is file okay that's in the same
place it's in the default installation
of the asus into the asus WLAN card
utility so for me is Program Files asus
WLAN card utilities under drivers XP AP
and then there's the cyst file and we
need to copy that to c colon backslash
windows backslash system32 drivers yes
where all the fun stuff happens right so
go ahead and overwrite i went ahead and
backed up the other one just in case
yeah you never know and then you need to
enable ICS and actually turn on the
software AP so let's go ahead and dive
into the utilities let's go ahead and
just so the utility just gives you you
don't you just fire that up under your
programs menu and once that's all
running you want to run the w land
control center mm-hmm we'll go ahead and
open up the icon that it gives you in
the bottom right and we're going to go
over to the configuration page and under
soft AP we want to change it from
station mode to soft AP mode okay now
you're going to get a list of all of the
available network connections that you
have here so with my local area
connection which is my wired Ethernet
and then you know my VPN connections
everything is in here so what I want to
do is drag the connection that I'll be
using for internet access right to this
so what I've done here is my laptop
setup with wireless access to the
internet so say like I'm at the campus
yeah yeah you're on the coffee shop or
wherever wherever I've got wireless
internet access or maybe i'm tethering
my cell phone and getting internet
access through that and now i want to
share the rest of that internet
with no this could be great in a road
trip we've gotten up in Toronto I've got
the you know the cell phone radio I pop
this in all of a sudden we all have
internet yeah without doing the ad hoc
stuff yeah maybe yeah that's another mod
anyway so though so once that's set oh
and we've got enable ICS checked we want
to go over to basic and this is really
simple all we have to do is give it a a
SSID I don't bother checking the hide
SSID because I want people dey wanted s
connect to this so I mean I call mine
free community wireless you could call
yours I don't know coffee bucks or
something right now something that
sounds inviting cuz you you know why why
why our cash someone when you can just
have them come to you exactly yeah so
once that's all set up you just click
apply say okay and if you go ahead and
pull that up in your Mac now if I come
over here to airport and will you do
that I think I might pull up wireshark
and centrally did this before I've
already connected to your free community
wireless it's a great wireless service I
guess it is they are not notch and just
to prove that this does work sure you
want to fire up your instant messenger
and yeah oh you can chat it up with I'll
open my instant messenger here and i
will go to capture and then interfaces
and it choose my wireless and then i'm
going to filter it by aim so i know that
we're glossing over wireshark here we're
at the real if you're familiar with that
mom and I guess that's something that we
should probably get into more detail in
another future segment right but suffice
it to say here's West he's just logged
on you and a PM someone yeah sure let me
see her I'll send one to your cell phone
okay just so you can see the traffic
sure you can see over here all this
traffic and where did it go it's it's
going so if that send another one send
another one yeah one more i missed it it
went so fast okay so this is still a
test
and there's the message outgoing and we
can pull this slider up and drag down
here and we can see right here this is
still a test now it is and there it is
on my cell phone it's still tough so
that was fun that is that's awesome so
we just like incorporated everything all
to go USB some you know less than white
hat well I mean this has got great white
happy like like all of my fun little
hack segments it's got lots of white hat
potential in fact I think more white hat
potential than the black hat side of
things it is basically this sought the
software that came with the Nintendo
wireless dongle was the crap so I wanted
it to be just a regular USB WEP
encrypted access point I can do that
through the soft AP manager and I think
it makes the product actually valuables
yeah well I'm not sure I was I wasn't
saying it's strictly a black hat use but
yeah but but there's obvious yeah and I
have a feeling that maybe the kids on
the forums will figure out other fun
things like maybe the upside down ternet
I don't know maybe that anyway so I
guess that's gonna pretty much covered
in that covers it for here is the forms
cuz that's where the further development
will be I'm sure and then the show notes
as well you're gonna have everything off
all up in the wiki all up in the wiki so
hak5 org slash wiki show nuts thanks a
lot no problem to keep rolling that you
