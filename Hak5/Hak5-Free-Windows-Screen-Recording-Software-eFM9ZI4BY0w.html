by carbonite all right Shannon as always
we value you guys emails let's see what
we got in the email bag this week
alright so we have two emails to go
through the first one is from Chad Chad
rights hey snubs and Darren I love your
show thank you so much Chad but one
thing always seems to catch my eye I
always notice that you two are very
rarely looking at the camera that is
recording you and I might be a little
OCD I was thinking that if you put a
light on the camera that would turn on
at it as it is being used it might
improve the quality of broadcast or at
the very least settle my mind loll I
kind of agree I would love to have
lights but we record differently yeah we
do like it used to be that we would
record what's called live to tape
whereas Paul would actually switched the
cameras as we're recording but now we
actually record on three cameras all at
the same time and then Paul later in
post production will just go ahead and
make slices so when it do something like
this and then I turned my head over here
he's supposed to switch over to that
camera back to this one but sometimes
sometimes we since MC has to use
different one just for editing purposes
like that we screw up a line or
something like that and you got to refix
it with a different camera yeah there's
all sorts of words like bull I don't
look at what they're looking at they're
not looking at any camera there looking
at each other you don't see what's going
on he's looking behind her she's looking
behind him Kirby's you know her visa I
can't put it but when I supposed to
switch to know it's it's Paul's
discretion really is what it comes down
to I have no idea if there's any method
to it but yeah I guess it can be
discerning cuz maybe Paul just likes to
make us look Don yeah I don't know it's
it's just a stylistic thing so the
lights wouldn't really work I like it
better this way to because we dictate
what Camrys cutting too yeah I kind of
like it yeah it's like whatever i'll
start on now on I'm gonna look at that
camera all right Shane what's the next
email all right so cray turn around
cresta crash oh gosh dude crystalling
dude can you like dude I don't know
something like that okay sorry I totally
like yeah pletely ruined your name but
anyway dude rights hey I have been
looking for a very good free in or open
recorder for my windows laptop do you
have any suggestions also I've seen a
few recent episodes of hak5 and the hack
tip that you have been recording your
screen what do you use you know I don't
remember the open-source one we used to
use but it was no good or at least it
hasn't kept up with the times on Windows
we use this software from blueberry
something it's called BB flashback
Express it's free it's not open source
it does a damn good job we've been using
it for years yeah yeah free which I love
and you can record little segments or a
suggested window on your machine you
don't have to record the entire thing
you can do video and sound which I've
used recently so I can record a youtube
video and send it to my grandma that's
cool yeah and as far as on linux i will
just throw this out there that i love
using ffmpeg and i get this command line
just ffmpeg script that I use all the
time to do an x11 grab it just grabs a
frame and yeah it looks good alright
options well coming up here in just a
bit we're gonna have trivia and our
technology of the week but first let's
take a quick break check in with me
right there and I'll tell you about
something cool computer disasters
eventually happen to everyone but if you
get carbonite online backup before your
disaster then you'll have no need to
worry because your files will be backed
up automatically and safely off-site and
you know it's also really really easy to
get them back plus you can visit them
anytime anywhere you can just be like
check in with them from your smartphone

Carbonite app and with carbonite

just fifty nine dollars a year that's
less than five dollars a month and when

hilarious okay so technol s photo of the
week this week is GCS 8 who sends in a
slew of photos of a server wreck that he
just built which is quite sexy and
pretty it looks very new and shiny and
not dusty like most of the ones that
