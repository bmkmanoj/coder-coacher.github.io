5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show will we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we'll be
covering some troubleshooting options in
nmap this might be useful to know if
your skin doesn't give you the output
that you expected that we've seen
previously or if you don't get any
output at all first off of course we
have the really simple ones like man and
tack H specifically those would look
like nmap tack h which gives you your
output for a help or the man page for
nmap which also gives you plenty of good
information and I'll just cue to quit
out of there
also there is plenty of other good
information in there I definitely
suggest a reading into it if you haven't
checked it out yet because that will
help you with all sorts of
troubleshooting now say you have an
issue that you're running into it might
be easy enough to just update and map
you might need to know the version that
you're running with this which is simply
nmap tech v you'll find out exactly
which version of nmap that you're
running so you might figure out that you
need to update and map to get better
results I found out that I'm running
5.21 it looks like over at Emmett org
there is an updated version out so I
should probably update my and met now
another really good command to know is
for debugging this one is simply tack D
so I would type in M mep tack d and then
whoever my target is so i'll use 7 33 1
. what's your 7 for this time that's a
really good one to check out so this is
going to show you host groups timing how
many packets per second are being used
any kind of timeouts that might happen
and so much more it's extremely helpful
for debugging also if you want to you
can also specify how much debugging you
want to do for example you could use
tech d1 for the lowest through tech d9
for the highest version of debugging
also keep in mind if you
use d9 it might take a lot lot longer
than d1 does another troubleshooting
option to use is reason the reason
option this is going to show you port
state reason codes so a good example of
this would be such as typing an nmap
tactic reason and then your target so
I'll use the same one again seven four
and hit enter we'll wait for this to
complete and you'll get this nice new
section down here that says syn ACK and
you'll also get a whole bunch of ones
that appear say connection refused so
any closed connections are going to say
connection refused open ones should show
syn ACK so acknowledged now if there is
no reason code or the port just doesn't
respond it's probably behind a firewall
now I'll be right back after the break
with some more raisin codes and
debugging techniques but first let's
take a break for our sponsor the hack
shop is hack vice premier store for all
of your pen testing needs including one
of my favorites the USB rubber ducky I
told you it about it before but I'm
gonna tell you again this thing is so
cool it looks like a flash drive but it
types like a keyboard and you can type
scripts into a computer
crazy crazy quickly now this week I
would like to share the coders forum
post where he actually outlines some
really handy hotkeys that you can use
for your USB rubber ducky on an Android
device that's pretty cool and of course
we couldn't do this show without your
support so I would like to thank you
personally with something special you
can use the coupon code snubz with any
order in the hack shop for your own
signed hacked tip sticker looks just
like this one thank you so much for
supporting the show
and we're back with more troubleshooting
options now let's say that you don't
care about all those closed ports you
just want to see the open ones because
there's tons of them in your scan output
for this example you would type in and
map and then simply tack tack open upin
and your target hit enter it'll run and
it'll give you just the open target now
if there were any closed ones in there
we're not gonna see them the next one
looks a little bit cluttered but it is
useful to know to show a nice summary of
the packets that are both sent and
received during a scan it looks kind of
long kind clutter but stick with me real
quick so this one looks like end map and
then you type in tech tech packet or -
tack trace and your target hit enter
you're gonna see a bunch of information
scanning down here so specifically this
is really really long so you might want
to actually put this into a text file
and you can just do that by adding
bracket trace txt to the end of the
output so that this long summary of info
will end up being in a file that you can
read back later so it's very interesting
if you want to look through here but
it's pretty long so I'm just gonna skip
that next up we have if list which will
display the host networking
configurations while you're connected to
the network you can type in and map
tactic if list and let it run and it
will come back pretty quick it's going
to show you the network interfaces and
routes that are configured on your local
network so I can see down here I have
wlan0 and up at the top I have a couple
of different IP mask IP addresses that I
can see right here it's pretty
interesting information and it can
definitely be handy for some of your
debugging that you might have to do and
lastly but definitely not least we have
tak e so this is going to specify which
type of network interface that you would
like to scan on so it's you're always
going to use tacky whether you're you
it's using Ethernet or Wireless so for
this example I would type in n map
tacky and I'm going to use wlan0
since that's the one that we have on our
network and then I'll type in my target
let it run and it should complete just
as it normally would and you're gonna
see the default output as usual you can
also use ETH one or W LAN one or
whatever you end up having on your
network this is a really really easy way
to switch to a different interface very
quickly and do a really simple skin now
what would you like to see next about
nmap we're almost done with our whole
series about network mapper but let me
know in a comment below or you can email
us tips at hack 5 org and be sure to
check out our sister show hack 5 at H
ak5 org for more great stuff just like
this I'll be there reminding you to
trust your Tecna lest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
