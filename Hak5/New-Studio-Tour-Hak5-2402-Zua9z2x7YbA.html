this there's not Channing OSHA start the
episode hey everybody welcome to this
episode of hak5 my name is Shane Awards
today is a tour of the studio I'm Karen
this is Paris
I'm Darren that's Peron it works really
well though yeah we know an errand
esaron a Karen at Aaron you know at
Aaron I know Taryn wanna share Hey
so I think that we should walk them
through the different components of the
new studio what do you say there are
three different components the first one
is going to be your lighting and then
the second one is your video and then
number three of course is the audio
because if you can't hear us talk
there's no point in doing a video show
right right and if you can't plug a
shotgun microphone into your phone to do
a vlog then you must have a pixel - I
know what you're thinking oh gosh as I
fall what was it this place is pretty
lit this place is pretty lit oh gosh I'm
gonna fall I know what you're thinking
this place is pretty lit right so we
have a whole bunch of different lighting
components that go into a set there's
the background lighting that goes on
behind us which is on the wall and
that's what you will see with these
American DJ lights that have different
color combinations depending on which
show we do we also have edge lighting
which is a normal panel light that hits
along the back of our heads that gives
us kind of a nice halo effect and makes
us stand out from the wall you also have
key infill which are the lights that go
in front of us and fill in any kind of
shadows that you would see on our front
sights what does that mean it's that
light right there no no in the camera
this DMX controller will make you lose
your mind and we are able to pre program
this so that it has a whole bunch of
different color combinations based on
what kind of show that we are doing
these are the panel lights that we are
using to give us the fill light in the
key light so you don't see a bunch of
crazy hard shadows on our faces and we
bought all of these from newer and flow
light
and because we are in California on a
fault line and we get tons of
earthquakes we have cable tethers which
enable these to stay where they are as
opposed to falling on our heads
we're using DSLRs as opposed to
traditional video cameras because it
allows us to get aftermarket lenses in
this case we've got these nice lenses
that give us some nice depth of field
they've got a high aperture and we also
get a cleaning HDMI video signal out of
the camera which is nice but that's
pretty much it this one in particular is
our wide camera and the special thing
about it is that we split the HDMI
source so that if anybody is podcasting
in here they can just grab this guy here
and if you don't have one of these if
you're looking for a good solution to
get a nice clean video source into a
computer this by mage well this USB
capture is fantastic it basically takes
an HDMI IN and gives you a USB 3 that
shows up as a webcam in Windows and
Linux I haven't tried in Mac I'm sure it
works as well and it's 1080p and it
looks pretty good and this is by
Blackmagic this is the ATM and this will
accept inputs over HDMI and SDI
and through that we can switch the
camera as it goes to this box right here
which allows us to choose the various
different cameras and whoo fades we
could do star wipes it don't do Star
Trek's
now the last bit of the camera equipment
is how we get the video signals in from
our computers over to the show which is
by using something called a scalar so
these guys right here take in input
sources over anything from VGA to DVI
HDMI and even composite in component
video and it scales them to the 1080i60
signal that our Blackmagic video
switcher is expecting
did you lock yourself out so the last
thing that we have on our podcasting
studio is of course the audio and we
start off with these Sennheiser
transmitters so these basically send a
wireless signal from our person while we
wear them on the studio set over to
these receivers and the receivers of
course are Sennheiser's as well
each of these receivers it separates the
frequency for each of the different
channel channels of audio and those
reach out to the mixer and the mixer of
course is where I can turn up my audio
just a little bit because I tend to talk
a little bit quieter than the dudes do
that gets sent over to a limiter which
keeps us from getting too high and last
we have these two sharks so the Sharks
delay the audio by three to four frames
or so just to make sure that the audio
and the video end up sinking together
and we don't end up out of sync and
that's how you podcast oh my god it
wasn't recording the whole time and
that's how you record a podcast and
that's how you record a podcast you
start by hitting the record button if
you don't it turns out none of it gets
recorded it don't ask us how we know
also we're in Oakland now and if you
want to come to our hack five happy
hours at five door / Oakland and if
you're wanting to get in on that you
might be able to play a very favorite
game capture the cocktail it's a tacky
Stephanie drinking game really
yeah we're no Glenn I'm Darren I'm
Shannon Morse
