20 for all that and more this time on
hack 5 hello welcome hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen my name is shannon moore
get your weekly dose of Technol us and
this is our second episode of all the
things from DEFCON 24 and you know what
else it is wrapping up the season it is
wrapping up season 20 nice
yes that's what 26 episode 26 episode 11
years and they were still here that does
not make any sense I'll just go with it
it does it just does TV show guys yes
hey did you know our 11th our 11 year
anniversary was our last binary number
uh for the next hundred years oh I have
turned three yes it only took 11 years
you're ridiculous I am I am but it's not
no less you gotta go with it I'm very
excited about this show because we have
both dark matter and Alan from semaphore
talking about some like privacy and
reread your Yousef it's like oh my gosh
yeah my heart
excellent excellent talk the we have
some great interviews including Mark
Newland as well he's the guy behind Maus
jack which is a really interesting
vulnerability that he found in a ton of
the Bluetooth alternative oh hey I was
talking out
or should I say Mouse's Mouse's noises
mice is tweet us a c5 and lettuce
electronic Mouse's mices I'm gonna be
we're gonna go with nice and with that
we'll see you on the other side I'm back
here with dark matter who you may recall
from a previous Def Con this is Def Con
24 what's up man how you doing pretty
awesome so awesome so last year you came
here with this amazing device can you
give us a slight little review maybe so
last year I wanted to come to Def Con
and do a little bit of war walking
because uh you know pcap all the things
and you know everyone says this is the
most dangerous most crazy network and I
wanted to see actual truth behind it is
there really stuff we need to be worried
about here you know you never know
unless you have the pcaps so I built
this box it's got a BeagleBone black
we've got alpha antennas in there and I
was just using it in my backpack walking
around for as many hours as I could I'd
get about ten hours out of the battery
life before it
Rush's and then yeah I did that then I
talked at a conference in Utah called
st. Kahn about the results of course we
saw pineapples of course of course we
saw deaaath attacks of course we saw
karma attacks of course we saw people
doing retarded stuff with Python scripts
that just fill the Airways of DDoS of
course and yeah so from there I did a
talk at this conference called state con
in Utah and got in touch with some
pretty awesome people at the minnowboard
foundation that were like hey we like
this idea and let's make it bigger so
they were able to donate me a tons of
stuff this year and we actually have 12
nodes deployed throughout the conference
seriously - okay so you have to tell me
first off what the heck are you planning
to do with these twelve nodes so yeah
there's a lot of things that we can do
so the boards are made up of the Intel
middle board which is a freaking rock
star board it's got a quad core atom in
its superfast USB 3.0 yeah and you can
even hook it up to so many different
devices it's it's amazing board I've
been very happy with it
I mean they sponsored me so they're
awesome but also I truly do love this
board and then from there we hooked up
three alpha or excuse me a th 9k radios
for monitoring and then also I brought
in an 82 11 AC radio the alpha AC 1200 I
couldn't find it took me about a month
to find drivers for it that I could
switch it to monitor mode and in fact
the drivers themselves wouldn't do it I
ended up having to patch some beta
drivers produced by Ray link it's a ray
link 8812 chip had to patch it myself to
be able to get it to stay in monitoring
more into monitoring mode without
crashing and as far as I know I mean I
think I'm one of the first I mean if
somebody's out there they wants to call
first but I'm calling first and this is
my forum so first uh yeah so you stuck
everything into a couple of different
cases right and are you are you sitting
these in different places or are you
literally like walking around with them
yeah luckily originally I have a battery
in the unit and I was going to just do a
dead drops because I didn't know if I
was going to get access or not
and so I was going to see and the batter
I have in there and my prototype is
about ten hours and so then I wanted to
try to see one get support from Def Con
because then maybe I could get real-time
statistics maybe get some real-time data
you know see what I could do reach out
to them didn't expect much I was going
to plan to do it without them they were
fully on board they they're like we want
to support this yes so they sent a team
of goons with me on Thursday to come and
help me deploy nodes we spent about nine
hours it took to deploy twelve notes
throughout the conference and I'm
literally overlapping in every location
in the conference so some of the results
of this is going to be the GP of the
sorry the pcap data you know seeing the
different attacks and stuff and so we've
heard about some pretty interesting
stuff already popping off so hopefully
I'll have proof of these things but in
addition to that there's also the human
tracking element of it so if we can take
device MAC addresses and turn them into
human beings
I can correlate position and probably
triangulate people walking through the
conference so that's a subset of the
things that I'm working on for this so
yeah it's it's it's a freaking awesome
year it's been super exciting we've been
pulling it off the nodes are all
deployed data is being captured
yesterday when I checked my nodes in the
NOC they were already at four gigs of
data so yeah it's this is going to be
crazy so okay so I can fully understand
why tracking human beings around the
Convention Center would be extremely
useful for future conventions and making
you know making Def Con harder better
faster and stronger ah can I just ask
you a question real quick who are these
people that are leaving their wireless
on I know right and and they see the
thing is is everyone's running around
saying we turn everything off turn it
but then people I God know there's
nothing really there's no little threat
but it's like okay well guess what
really I'm gonna have the pcaps so it's
going to be like guess what pcaps or it
didn't happen well I'm going to have the
pcaps
and so I'm going to be like listen we
can defend ourselves we can increase our
privacy by having visibility into this
data we've never had this as far as I
know I talked to people
nobody's collected the data at this
level so that was one of the biggest
things I wanted to do is give back to
the community and say how can we do this
to improve our privacy so I got two more
questions for you first off have you
found any very very pertinent and
interesting information so far at this
convention
I haven't had time to even start diving
into the pcaps so other than going
through some kismet alert logs I've seen
tons of deaaath attacks I've seen some
pineapples and karma attacks and so I
mean that's going to be standard but
there's so much analysis to be done I
think it's awesome that you're doing
this I feel like this is like
volunteering work for Def Con it's very
very cool and awesome that you're being
supported by Intel as well where can
people find more information and are you
going to post these details online for
the wider community base to hear about
it absolutely so this project here
specifically from last year I have a
full write-up on my website it's pals
hack org or pal Shack org if you're a
Fed and you can follow me on Twitter I'm
dark-matter on Twitter but instead of
A's I use fours so of course and yeah
I'm gonna do a full write-up on
everything that's going on this year I
need to talk to maybe e FF about the
pcaps and see if we can release those
I'd love to release those to the public
just like they release like the CTF
stuff I think that'd be rad to put it on
the DEF CON hard drive so yeah well
we'll see to be determined of course and
yeah I'm just super excited about this
project and put it out there and be
involved so sweet thank you so much dark
matter it was much appreciated that you
would join us again for this year I'm
off to drink all the booze and hack all
the things
this once
Oh

we take off the

you know there's gonna be security right
course we drink all the booze then tack

I'm gonna
Oh
every single ring
times are changing and consumers are
getting a lot more privacy focused in
here to talk about all the nerdy details
with that is Alan from the SpiderOak
Alan how are you great glad to be here
it's its third day of Def Con so if we
sound a little froggy that's why of
course yeah it was ten minutes to
recover my voice this morning yeah but
glad to be here breathing the Vegas air
and with our our fellow tech enthusiasts
and respecting our techno lust right and
so you know what's really interesting is
we're living in I don't want to say
post-snowden world because it seems to
buzz wordy but I think it's appropriate
yeah in that like for once
consumers have like at least an inkling
of security it's not just the hackers
here at Def Con and um anyway I just
kind of wanted to pick your brain as you
know an entrepreneur that's running a
company all based on providing security
and privacy focused tools for consumers
and kind of get an idea from you like
you know what are the challenges with
business models and what are the latest
tools that you're developing and then
things of that nature
so I'll just preface this question by
saying that like it's really interesting
to see that kind of shift in power like
similar to how probably was hundreds of
years ago from church to state as now we
have state to corporation in that like
on the internet the currency of the
internet is information and that is the
power that's being held by corporations
and now of course governments want that
and so that's the kind of eye-opening
experiences that we saw with with
Snowden what kind of reaction did you
get from your consumers when all of that
kind of came to light Wow that's I what
a great frame for several questions
first of all post Snowden I think is a
really apt description of the technology
world in the last couple of years
because we've seen so many more like PhD
thesis and grad students doing master's
degrees in crypto and open-source crypto
projects and so on I really think for
better or worse the US government has
done a tremendous amount to advance
cyber security in the last year just by
allowing the Snowden leaks to happen
because the response to it has been
great for our industry you look at
things like signal the protocol you know
formerly tech secure being implemented
in things like whatsapp and even
Facebook now so
I don't know it seems like corporations
are adopting crypto our consumers yes
and there's there's always been a
segment of the marketplace that cared
very enthusiastically but now it's going
mainstream and I think there's two or
three things that are promoting that
there's obviously the the idea of ending
mass surveillance and that the chilling
effects and the you know people just
don't like having their conversations
observed but also the tools are getting
way better products like signal
revolutionized to the UI and the user
experience and and made it enjoyable to
use an end-to-end encrypted product and
we're starting to see you know
business-to-business products coming out
that really put user experience first so
you're probably most known for your
backup solution SpiderOak that's a you
know where you can bring your own crypto
and I'm sure I'm very very poorly
summarizing it but as a kind of a backup
cloud sync solution for files after
those leaks did you get a bunch of like
you know emails from consumers like
concerned about their data and their
privacy we get the gamut of emails
inbound from people from you know all
levels of paranoia and technology
interest and so on and I think one of
the reasons that the spider a backup
product has been successful is that
there's no place that you have to go to
manage keys there's nothing you have to
do like all that happens for you and so
you know the user experience is very
different than something like PGP oh
come on man don't we all love you know
drop it to the command prompt to run in
GPG tak this tak that and signing our
stuff and uploading it to the MIT key
server and then doing it all wrong
anyway well we really have come a long
way yeah and so I'm starting to think
about this very philosophically and you
know if we're if we have this goal of
ending corporate surveillance or
government surveillance or so on then
the only way that works is if the
products that are secure are also viral
and the only the only way a product is
viral is if the people that you convince
to use it also convince their friends to
use it and so on they have to be
recommending it to others just because
they want to demonstrate how good their
own taste is right I find that very
interesting because it is it's like you
know Apple products for instance daily
there's a there's a sexy factor to it
a status factor to it and you kind of
maybe you know for better or worse you
need something like that and you know
I'm just so thankful that signal as a
good example is being adopted because
people may not even know that they're
using that kind of you know the secure
communication um when I think about
secure communication and secure products
the ones that I really gravitate towards
are the ones where there is no possible
way to comply with the court order
technically because you just don't have
the keys I think of a secure product as
one where it is not vulnerable not to
hackers and exploits there always be
hackers and exploits but not vulnerable
to secret court orders where you just
physically can't comply sorry my hands
are tied
I don't have the crypto keys eff off
it's not mine to give you and and I'm
wondering if we're going to continue
seeing that and what your thoughts are
on that
so of course there's all that interest
and you know our goal in building
semaphore was to do you know for
businesses and large group conversations
the same same thing that some signal did
for individual conversations and you
know small group conversations but one
of the things that we were most
surprised by is of course corporations
are worried about data leaks and all
these other things and external threats
like you know I don't want the hosting
provider to have access to my data I
don't want the government to have access
to my data but actually the threat that
they were most concerned about is
internal management has never had a way
to communicate securely that was free
that was free from observation by their
IT staff and IT staff have never had a
way to communicate securely where their
security was not vulnerable to
compromise by other users of the
organization like somebody in the
organization can have bad practices
which gets the email server compromised
or something like that
IT needs a way that like a secure
Enclave a socially secure Enclave for
different groups and so one of the
things that you know we put into
semaphore just kind of by default is
that every channel is in two end
encrypted just to the participants of
that channel and that turned out to be
the thing that businesses were most
excited about okay so you brought up
some before that's your new product at
spider up tell me a bit
about it what does it do for businesses
so semaphore is an end-to-end encrypted
alternative to slack and you know the
idea is that you know slack has this
amazing user experience it's super
friendly it gets everybody away from
their email it lets them contextualize
projects and so on and you know for a
company like us that you know brew up on
IRC for the last 10 years we understand
the benefit of simple real-time informal
conversations but we wanted a way to do
that that's very convenient and is into
insecure and so we built symbol for to
you know solve that need and it turns
out there's a lot of other companies
that are very excited about being able
to adopt a technology like slack that
has the security as well you know I
actually I'm glad that you brought up
IRC because everybody's like oh so the
slack seems to be getting like so much
buzz out I'm like guys you do realize
this is IRC essentially and and are
exactly good bots and stuff like that
and one of the first plugins that we
built for semaphore was just the IRC
integration so people can use like a
local IRC client because there are
kernel hackers out there that will just
never let go of their IRC interface ever
and that's awesome I just it just makes
me want to get on under net and hit
exclamation point F server or something
you know but there are some niceties to
the modern approach like push
notifications and mobile interface and
persistence and attachments that work
when you're not online and it's totally
we were just talking about it's a social
thing right and it's actually really
interesting to see that something is
underground as IRC as becoming a social
phenomenon in mainstream society and so
what you're trying to do is take that
same thing and then make it end-to-end
secure tell me about how the security
works so spider hook has been building
crypto products for a long time and with
this one we were really excited about
how this state of crypto software has
evolved to the extent that we could use
really just one or two well proven
well-established libraries you know the
things the crypto involved in semaphore
comes from s crypt and lib sodium and
that but you know those libraries solve
all of the challenges of whoa which site
which block cipher do you use in this
case or which mac Algar
do you use to authenticate messages like
all of that is already going to happen
using best practices just by using these
libraries so we can focus you know
mostly on not not inventing cryptography
but building a product you know solving
the UX and on all those other things
because the you know the crypto
communities really came together and
produce these these options for applied
cryptographers like us to you know build
a product with and the product is a
desktop app for and of course you have
mobile solution as well yeah so one of
the things that we did that's kind of
controversial is you know there's no
browser interface there's no there's no
web interface and and that's because
never in the history of the world has
there been a secure browser and you know
browsers have all of your interaction
with the rest of the internet in them
that's not a good place to do in the end
encryption so semaphore ships as a
standalone native application on every
platform the way God intended okay I
like that well here's what I'm really
curious about is you you running this as
this business that's privacy focused and
building these applications for
consumers I look at other you know giant
ecosystems be it the googles Facebook's
of the world where people put their
information up there and those
corporations have to monetize it somehow
typically through advertising which
means that they by default for some
reason see the content even though it
may be a message to that I'm sharing
with a small group of friends on Google+
if anyone still uses that or Facebook
but there's not any technical reason why
the platform should actually have the
achieving technical feasibility to read
that message and yet that's not the case
and therefore it is susceptible to the
vulnerability of the government National
Security Letter what are your thoughts
on that
in regards to operating a profitable
business Wow so one of the that we get
this question a lot like why doesn't
everybody do in to end encryption and
you know even in business models where
you don't necessarily need to monetize
the data I mean obviously Facebook and
Google and many other corporations rely
on the economic feedback loop of data
monetization but even for companies that
don't well it's a lot of extra effort
like it's it's go
to probably double or triple your dev
cycle length and you have to have
specialized skills involved in the team
and then review and you know outside
security auditing which is expensive and
hard to schedule and it's a massive
undertaking to build an application that
has end end encryption compared to
building the same application in
plaintext and there are many problem
domains that it just doesn't work for at
all like where you need server-side big
data analysis it's not going to work at
least with the technology that we have
today and you know the state of the art
of those algorithms we are you know
academia is moving the the theory and
some implementations for all those
things forward and I think in 20 years
we'll have a very different story but
most people today they just want to get
a product done and make their customers
happy unless they have a really specific
need they're just going to build the
thing that does what their customers are
directly asking for ok I think of why
don't people apply cryptography it's the
same answer of like well why don't
people you know do really good software
security you know what why are people
still finding routine SQL injections and
it's all the same stuff so when it comes
to the software security what kind of
design decisions do you make to keep
your product from being vulnerable to
the secret court order attack surface oh
wow so there's a few things obviously
the best thing is to not have much data
and issue a transparency report as often
as possible and give as much information
as you can but otherwise there are some
places where it's really important that
the customer can actually run an
on-premises version of the product
themselves and the reason is so that the
court has to come to them and they can't
come to you know a third-party provider
and you know that the customer just has
no idea that there's been a request for
their information and so you know are we
don't have the on-premises support yet
but it's coming very soon that's that's
exciting because a lot of other you know
a lot of like VPN service providers is a
great example or like oh we don't keep
logs it's like cool bro one last thought
on this before we wrap up I really want
to know what your thoughts are on
Canaries oh well we run one it's it's a
surprising amount of effort
- you know organize a group of people
that are preferably in different
countries and continents and so on - I
know keep up with the Canary all the
time and the e FF has actually changed
their recommendations about Canaries you
know they were doing this project about
canary watch and all that stuff but now
the recommendation is just have a
transparency report that you issue you
know quarterly or however often you can
because there's been so many like false
alarms with Canaries where just some
step of the you know necessary sequence
of events didn't happen and people were
worried about it and then you know the
canary is kind of the binary signal you
know it says all things are good or it
says nothing and you're left to
speculate and as a business owner you
really don't want to be in that
situation where your your customers are
just left to speculate well yeah sorts
of terrible things happening we don't
want another TrueCrypt and we definitely
don't want another lava bit so I guess
we'll just wrap up by saying I'm really
thankful that for what you're doing for
the community I'm you know in all have
somebody that's running a business and
making it doing this kind of stuff and
and I think everybody should go and just
check out the product because somebody
that cares this much about it you know
falls within that's in our heart so
where can people find out more about the
product and of course bye to rock at
spider up comm and then slash semaphore
so yeah great to be here and likewise
about hack 5s effort to build a
community over the last 11 years it's
pretty awesome the funny thing is is all
born on IRC so it all comes full circle
alright cool thank you when you've got
that great idea do it Shannon and I do
and take it to the Internet using domain
comm they have a fantastic domain
exploration tool that will help you find
the perfect domain name just for you and
their checkout process is super simple
which means your website will be up and
online in no time flat and get this the
guys over at domain.com are huge fans of
hack 5 so they want to hook you up with
an extra 20% off and all you have to do
is use the coupon code hak5 that spells
hack 5 and you know what you can even
tweet them at domain.com and say hey
thanks guys for supporting hack 5 all
these years so when you think domain
names think domain.com hey everybody I
am back
again here at Def Con 24 with mark
Newlin from best steals so I actually
did a segment on threat wire about
something else that you were into key
sniffer so if you guys watch that
segment this is the guy behind that tool
but you are here talking about something
different about Mouse jacker correct
that's correct so I actually gave a talk
today about both Mouse track and Kista
for covering all these vulnerabilities
and so as a total of 16 keystroke
sniffing and injection vulnerabilities
affecting devices from 16 different
vendors that I've discovered over the
last six or eight months or so that's
really bad that there's so many
vulnerabilities out there so what is the
difference between key sniffer and Mouse
Jack and there's a lot of overlap so in
the case of Mouse Jacky was primarily
doing keystroke injection targeting
wireless mice key sniffer is primarily
keystroke sniffing on unencrypted
keyboards but there are some devices
that fall on both categories and some
additional encrypted keystroke injection
vulnerabilities which we haven't
publicized but I discussed the day of
the talk so can you tell me a little bit
about how you decided to look into this
kind of thing yeah so it kind of started
with a Burning Man project so I was I
was building this big LED cover top out
for Burning Man and I built a wireless
NES controller to talk to my Burning Man
hat I used the same type of transceiver
in the NES controller as Logitech uses
in their mice so for Def Con last year I
set it up so I could actually control
other people's mice and the IOT village
had this wireless water tank mouse for
the presentation clicker so I was
messing with them all day and they had
no idea exactly it was happening so they
left a post-it note Raeleen don't with
me next to the laptop and you know I I
figured at that point it was too much I
did not want to stress them out and
confess that I was the one doing this
and yeah it was it was an adventure okay
so tell me a little bit about what these
vulnerabilities are and how they work
yeah so on a high level you have a lot
of proprietary protocols where the
vendors have implemented their own
security schemes and use these different
transceivers to you know do this
communication in a way that's non
standardized and they've all messed it
up in different ways that it's possible
to both inject keystrokes directly into
USB dongles sniff keystrokes from these
keyboards and it's actually fun
vulnerability with this water tech a
mouse where you can maliciously and
wirelessly program a keystroke macro
into the mouse the next time somebody
using the mouse clicks a button on that
Mouse it will execute that keystroke
macro on their computer
really that's oh my god that's so messed
up but that's amazing that you found
that vulnerability it's it's been fun
stuff and what really gets me is that
none of these skills are too esoteric
I'm sure other people can do this and
maybe have done this and not disclosed
it it's tough to say you just happened
to be the guy who was like oh I wonder
if this works I'm gonna try it it turns
out I'm kind of relentless and I do not
drop a project until I'm done and I my
girlfriend confessed that I spent you
know too many hours working on this but
the results were good so this will work
on like logitech's proprietary devices
not bluetooth though correct that's
correct yeah so it's mom to tooth and it
covers you know water tech Dell Lenovo
Microsoft Amazon gigabyte RadioShack
insignia Kensington Mouse GE Jasco
RadioShack Toshiba a lot of the vendors
all right you don't have to name them
all off it sounds like pretty much all
the vendors out there but yeah more or
less right right more or less so I'm I'm
actually a little bit curious about have
you disclosed this to these vendors and
have they put a fix into place so we had
two rounds of disclosure we disclosed
the mouse Jack round in November and the
key sniff around and associated
vulnerabilities in April Logitech can
update firmware on their mice most of
the other vendors have no ability to
update the devices so Logitech is
released this dongle firmware update
that addresses some of the problems all
of the other vendors are still
vulnerable you know the least they could
do is just like replace them with
something that's not vulnerable and so
kindly anchor is offered to replace
their vulnerable keyboards for Bluetooth
keyboards through the end of August I'm
not aware of any specific replacement
plans with the other vendors but I'm
sure they you know might be able to do
that in some cases so I feel like you're
not going to post the code online
because this is a pretty heavy
vulnerability but are you posting any
kind of information from your talk
online so we've leased open source
firmware that you can actually flash on
to Logitech dongles and use this to do
generic transmission and reception of
packets but then I released a white
paper with my talk data that has full
details on the protocols and packet
formats for these kind of attacks and we
will put the link to the show notes in
that I believe it's on github correct
that's correct so the code is on github
and then the white paper will be on
github today or tomorrow yeah you heard
it here first we'll put it down in the
show notes for you so everybody can
check it out and I would love to see
someone
you guys start implementing some
interesting things when a user it
definitely some smart people look at
this and put together some very neat
code I think most likely most likely
will mark where can people find out more
about you yourself so I'm on twitter at
at mark Nuland my first name and last
name I have a blog mark Doolin lot M Eve
I blogged once a year or so so it's not
very active that's about how much I blog
too I'm more of a podcaster I don't know
it's my thing so for more from Def Con
24 you can check out hack 5 org
youtube.com slash hack 5 you probably
know the place since you're here already
mark thank you so much I'm gonna go
drink some more drink and hack all the
things that just about wraps up this
week's episode of hack 5 but before we
get going I want to let you guys know
that if you're keen on coming out to the
next con and having an awesome beer with
us you can find all the details if we're
doing a meet-up over hak5 org we're
gonna be going to derby cool jingling
we're going to go to Derby Connolly
Hilton Kentucky where they happen to
serve giggling that's so excited and if
you'd like to buy Shannon a English I'm
join us there closed closed beverage oh
yeah that's my rule go to conventions
closed beverage every time or I order it
right from the bartender you just give
me the roofies so with that I am very
excited to get it let you guys know that
hak5 org is the homes all of our
podcasts including that display minute
and threat wire and tech thing and so
find out all about those shows over at
hak5 org it's also where you can find
the links to our social networks if you
want to get in on the tweeting at us and
such and if you're into tweeting tweet
at hack 5 with the with a hash tag pound
techno lust pound pound
techno analyst hash tag pound technolo
because i know how to internet now
hash tag techno last yeah there is from
the old school days of when we used to
say pound I I'm from the old school days
where that meant something on a
telephone keypad yes it did I'm from
dial tone do you remember dial tone no
no sorry I'm gonna stop anyway we're
giving away awesome stuff from our hack
shop so tweet at us and win some Wi-Fi
pineapples and some USB rubber duckies
and some land turtles and we'll feature
those winners on the next show as we
kick off season 21 yeah and
if you want to grab some of those
goodies of yourselves right now you can
support us directly HHA shop comm I also
wanted to announce something else that
is awesome that happened while we were
at Def Con on our YouTube channel so if
you guys are watching this on RSS you
can go over to youtube.com slash hak5
and you can subscribe there too because
sometimes we'll put little tidbits there
that don't belong on the RSS we just hit
250,000 subscribers which is huge 11
years to get a quarter million
subscribers that's natural growth it was
yes that is like it's like you know it's
like slow-cooked right it's like
free-range fair trade right you know
what I'm saying all natural organic GAC
5 are you hungry coming to uni at
lunchtime it is ok we gotta go
anyway we will see you guys next week
and as we wrap up awesome awesome
stickers this week thank you so much for
the caki demon this this is going up
there so many good ones you can find
details on how to send us stickers and
like below and we will see you next week
until then i'm darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse
trust you techno last use our first goal
with semaphore was well actually to make
give those corporations a secure option
because right now they don't have one
and I there's a lot of research on the
side of you know when people know
they're being observed the efficiency of
the team goes down because people can't
you know communicate the things that
people really need to communicate to get
their job done and there's there's not
as much research on this other side but
there's some and it kind of makes sense
that when when people can communicate
securely and freely and can have the
little side conversations and
off-the-record conversations that teams
are more efficient and more effective so
we think of this as like enabling a more
efficient business you know it's kind of
the same message as an alternative to
email that will make you more efficient
but also just that you can say what you
need to say there's definitely things
that I you know wouldn't text I don't
use SMS here at the con but like of
course we're using signal and it's like
well yeah I wouldn't have sent that as a
text yeah I won't
I'll just have that conversation in
person and but yes I think I like the
idea to have like rolling your own
putting in your own infrastructure as a
hosted solution because then you know
you don't have that question of like are
they storing logs you're like no we're
going to set the log rotation to one
hour screw it
yeah exactly and we always ran our own
infrastructure because the backup
industry and so it was a natural fit for
semaphore as well and that's how we were
able to also offer an on-premises
solution because we don't rely on Amazon
or any of those things oh man I could
pick your brain all day this has been a
lot of fun yeah
