you by domain.com hello welcome to hack
five my name is darren kitchen and it is
your weekly dose of Technol s Happy New
Year's everyone Merry new years in fact
we are in at the New Year's Eve barbecue
we're inside or backyard right now we're
in a backyard look at the window there's
a I like the fencing that you guys
bought this is part of a bigger project
but we figured let's do a diggnation
style right yeah that sounds really fun
and this is totally like taking it
old-school and we're just gonna play
some show-and-tell today yes kind of
revamp about this last year 2014 and all
the crazy stuff that we learned and got
to do and some of the things that were
interested in for next year it's been a
fantastic year I would love to do Show
and Tell in fact our audience should do
the same I get involved whether you're
on the forums or IRC or just in the
youtube comments or whatever have you it
has been a fantastic year and so let's
celebrate the techno last as it were and
talk about some of the other projects
that we have going on coming into the
new one this sounds good to me yeah so
this past year I I was able to learn
like so much about Arduinos and all the
different things I learned on hack tip
but a lot of it came down to different
books that I've been reading so I wanted
to introduce you to guys to some
introductory books so in case you're
interested in any of these subjects
because they've really helped me and I'm
a huge bookworm so this is the best way
that I've learned to learn and I know if
you you guys were interested in the
books that I've been reading as well
people are always asking for book
recommendations go ahead okay so the
first two I wanted to introduce you guys
to and I talked about these on hack tip
but not on this show the Linux freeze
book and this was written by Scott
grenman and the Linux command line by
William east shots so both of these are
available on Amazon and I have the links
to these I use these to learn all of the
different commands that I've been able
to use in Linux for like the past couple
of years because they they break them
down for you they explain like exactly
what every single command that you're
using and every single option means so
you're not just typing in
things and memorizing commands you're
actually learning what each and every
one actually means that's very important
you know I love that there's there was
this meme going around Twitter the other
day and it was like you know what what
Hollywood things hackers do you know
hackers think hackers do what hackers
actually do and it was all like the
different command lines stuff and and
what could hack herbs actually do is
like man grep so yeah having a quick
reference back yeah it looks like this
is bash oriented yes that one is this
one is - pretty much but yeah they're
both really excellent tools in case
anybody is interested in buying them I
think they're available on Kindle as
well so you can get on an eBook form so
that's my first ones what about you sir
I did not know that young stood for
yellow dog updater modified yellow dog
updater modified yeah yeah okay I have
been having so much fun well you
mentioned Arduino as you've been doing a
lot with that so I've been playing with
the Wi-Fi pineapple hdk this is the new
hotness for the mark-5
and what's so rad is this is just based
on an open hardware Arduino and
basically it's interfaced over GPIO and
it can also speak SPI with the Wi-Fi
pineapple and so I've been having a lot
of fun playing around with its app and I
have been putting together some sketches
and I got it flashed with some stuff
where basically I can make different
things on that are happening within the
pineapple make like LEDs oh you could
totally put right can you put like a LCD
screen on it and make it safe like all
of the different shields and stuff yeah
what interface with it most of them at
least and then since it can speak to the
pineapple I can say have it you know
when different actions occur like a
client connects to the network make an
LED blink things of that nature soon
this will tie in with the later project
that's currently on a different robotics
platform but we're hoping that to build
kind of a telepresence we're over based
on the pineapple which should be
a rumba pineapple mm-hmm that's cool
okay so my next book is called
penetration testing and this is by one
of our dear friends and somebody who's
in the InfoSec community her name is
giorgia Weidman we've actually
interviewed her on the show and she does
a lot of different talks and a lot of
the conventions we go to so this is her
introductory book to a lot of different
tools that you can use if you're
interested in hacking or if you're just
interested in internet security for
example if I go down here this is how I
first discovered Wireshark and kali
linux she talks about Kali Linux VM
where in here all sorts of things yam LT
goes in here as well I found that this
was a very good like high-level overview
if you don't already know all of the
like it's I don't feel like yeah cuz it
doesn't really go nitty-gritty into any
of the topics I think what did you get
you enough so that you're like oh I
didn't know that that existed now I know
where to look
oh this is the program that I can use to
do that certain thing that I wanted to
learn or whatever so yeah this one is
also available from no starch press same
as the Linux command line those guys are
a starch press is a really good place
that you can go to find a bunch of
different hacker books as well so and
they're also always supporting the
hacker cons which we love it's a good
book I love it Thank You Georgia hey we
are getting we have our own 3d printer
now again our printer bot yeah yeah and
it didn't really like make it so well on
the move we need to reassemble it so I
got lazy and got one preassembled
because I just wanted to get printing
but robot 3d I'm very excited there's a
bunch of cool mods we can do with it and
I just love that just right out of the
box within ten minutes I was printing
and I got my first print done and I have
to give props to Frank in Oslo here for
this USB rubber ducky enclosure and it
actually it's got a button on it that
presses the button and you can pull the
SD card out the back it's a really nice
case I just went ahead and did this in
PLA but you could do it with a nicer
plastic and there we go boom
rubber ducky inside yeah I was super
impressed by just how quick and easy it
was to build that so we'll link of the
show notes to the page on Thingiverse
where you can grab yours and I thought
that was just rad so that's another
project that we're getting more into in
the new year more 3d prints yeah in fact
we'll go ahead and publish on
Thingiverse the STL file for the Wi-Fi
pineapple case because we have that as
well
so I'm looking forward to having like a
PLA read one like kind of
semi-transparent yellowing good so
that'll be fun so fun okay my next ones
these are hardware related the first one
is called the Raspberry Pi user guy and
this guide guy this is by eben Upton yes
are you a user guy so it's it's a pretty
inexpensive book I believe it's under
like 20 bucks or something and it's a
really really good user guide to get you
started with the Raspberry Pi they go
into a lot of explanation here not only
just about the hardware and how to use
that but also how to you know create
your own put your own operating systems
on the Raspberry Pi and things like that
so it's a really really good guide for
that and I also wanted to show you guys
the guide I've been using for the
Arduino so this one was written by
Massimo Banzi
himself and it's called getting started
with Arduino so this is what it looks
like another it's a very small book you
could probably read this in that
afternoon but it's really good to follow
along with if you've never used an
Arduino before so you can get an
introduction to well what all the
different parts are that's a beautiful
thing about the Arduino is it's made to
be an introduction into microcontrollers
an introduction into programming yeah
and so if you already have any of the
other experience around that fields then
this you should be able to pick up quite
quickly and then with this knowledge it
then transcends into all of the other
stuff because they really don't water it
down no he really doesn't and there's
even a whole bunch of online tutorials
too for the Arduino and same with the
Raspberry Pi soo so you can really get
involved with building your own like
components and building out your own
robots and things like that and that's
something that I really want to get into
this next year
speaking of robots we actually have a
robotics platform for you for the
telepresence
but that we are working on because one
of the things that we want to do in the
in the warehouse here is let you
virtually drive around it which should
be so much fun
from our experience in the hack house
live-streaming that and having like
robotic what was it was like we had a
USB what was a rocket launcher shot boom
rockets and shot like laser pointers and
stuff that was really fun until people
started putting the laser pointers
they're not in our eyes yeah well we're
hanging out but you know um I thought
that this would be a lot of fun and so
to jumpstart that I've been toying
around with this because it's very
well-documented it's by a iRobot so the
people that make the robot yeah what
does it Roomba but it's called to create
and so this is the new version is that I
create - and essentially you bought a
vacuum no it doesn't have they took
there's no vacuum parts in it so this is
that is this is so great because you can
tear this apart and like start putting
like all of your other platforms on it
but it just interfaces over a 5-volt
logic serial and there's a very
well-documented set of commands and it's
already got the rest of that stuff
figured out so I figured as a first
robot as a platform to very quickly get
telepresence telepresence going this
will kind of do the trick in that we
don't have to reinvent the wheel when it
comes to that part because it knows how
to like drive home and auto charge and
stuff like that so that was kind of like
our Christmas gift to the warehouse what
you guys should hopefully soon enjoy
when we get the telepresence stuff set
up and then you'll be able to like drive
it around in an oil
doesn't matter whether you're into huh
or uh when you get that killer idea you
need to grab yourself some domain name
hosting website stuff fast you can do
that over at domain.com because they've
got a domain discovery system where you
can put your idea into the universe and
will come back at you with amazing stuff
and you could say hey that's stuff I
want and when you want it you can have
it really quickly because their checkout
process will have your website up and
running in no time it's like boom and
then boom websites domain.com they're
affordable reliable easy to do this but
most of all they're crazy on social
media so you can tweet them at
domain.com and say what is wrong with
hak5 and they will tweet back at you and
say yeah we know that's why we hooked
them up with the coupon code hak5 so
that you guys can use it and get 15% off
at domain.com when you think of those
crazy ideas and that's what you do
because of the blue petite blues and the
depositor dues so when you think domain
names think domain.com and we're back
that's a great break yeah like I did
that I I did thank you I'm a
professional I've been doing this for
almost nine years no over nine years
yeah over nine thousand yeah so I also
wanted to mention before we close up
this episode that you know we've been
doing a ton of great stuff we've moved
from the firehouse we've moved over here
to the warehouse for sticking with us
through that yeah the way the hack shop
has Gregg's are in full force right now
but you know the show has also grown a
lot and I've grown with it and I've
learned a lot this year but next year
I'm hoping that I can learn a lot more
and I want to bring you guys with me on
that entire journey because I feel like
I've been able to gain so much knowledge
just through you guys and what you want
to see you've given me so many creative
ideas so thank you to everybody out
there who's been helping us along on
there I think going forward this is a
really like this is a perfect space for
that kind of like impunity yeah erasing
the fact that we're able to have like
you know land parties and we're going to
be building out we've got 48 new rack
that we're going to be like building out
with virtual servers that you guys will
be able to benefit from and robots
you'll be able to drive around in here
and you know meetups all throughout
Europe and
and so like IV I feel the awesome
epicness of the awesome um I wanted to
kind of throw something out there kind
of in line with this and that's
something that we either need to a
develop perhaps with PHP or ever be find
that that has already been developed
because I think this is something that
can help with a couple of projects that
we're working on as well as the kind of
focus that you've got because for
instance when you said like hey I want
to learn
Wireshark what you do you just I bought
a book and I learned Wireshark that's
what I did okay
now I'm thinking about goat cheese don't
ask why oh I know it'll make me regular
might get if I boost up with IQ cassava
and go make goat cheese wu-tang yeah so
I'm hoping that you're enjoying this
diggnation style the only day that we
had oh yes so the software that I was
just mentioning what I think we need is
okay so it's a cross between a wiki and
a pull and a survey and they kind of do
it pretty well on tea - tea - tea you
have you been to in chat realm you know
yes so like for example at the end of
daily tech news show DTS awesome show
it's totally does what it says on the
tin at the end of daily tech news show
with Tom Merritt like everybody in IRC
like votes on different they case they
submit different like ideas for show
names and then they vote on them and I'm
thinking like let's apply this same
model to like for instance crowdsourcing
ideas when we're about to build out this
network right we've got 600 megabits
coming here we have to utilize these and
one of the ways that I'm hoping that we
can kind of recoup something on the
ridiculous amounts of because we had to
buy before with all of the static IP is
just so that they would run the line
because there's a highway right there
anyway my hope is that we can do cool
things with
you know virtual private servers and
shell accounts and stuff like that and
so I'm thinking like what's the best way
to build this server and I'm like well
you know I know my way to build a server
and you know there's no lagron way right
everybody has an opinion but I'm just
like what if we all got together and
like you know rather than me going on
Twitter like I did with this switch and
say hey what's a good switch and then
get a million replies and they're all
like well yeah that four thousand dollar
Cisco does look pretty good except it's
a land party we don't need a four
thousand dollar Cisco yeah it would be
kind of rad if it wasn't like a one-way
thing it's more like a wiki so bees bees
bees bees are great
what's wrong with bees you're gonna be
really thankful for the bees it's a bee
the bee is having its little bee time
well the bee is wants to be friends with
my coral flower colored shirt and that's
not cool tell them to behave you buzz
off anyway I think I've rambled enough I
think you guys are getting what I'm
saying so let us know in the comments
hit us up feedback at hak5
if you know that a that exists or be an
idea how we could make that because it
would be pretty fantastic to have a sort
of like system where we could all vote
on like what would be the most epic
managed switch for the new network it
would be the most epic like case and the
CPU and motherboard and power supply and
RAM and operating systems and all of the
things because we want to make this for
you and so tell me how to build my next
gaming rig cuz I'm too lazy other
research all that stuff out what I'm
getting up I will research this until
the cows come well I love I love
trolling Newegg and and reading reviews
and researching all of the stuff and
getting nitty gritty on like Tom's
hardware and stuff I mean that's the the
fundus of the technology but I know that
we all love doing that so let's share in
that we're doing are you I'm petting
there's there's dust on it yeah this
award is like 67,000 people make it have
somebody put their fingerprint on the
silver thing so yes from YouTube it's to
hack five congratulations for surpassing
100
and subscribers congratulations hak5
team I love you guys yeah actually we've
doubled in the last year so that's good
we had really good it is so exciting
hopefully we can do that again because I
think there's another one of these that
like a quarter million or something I
don't know I'm gonna like it and we
really need to like I know that they
don't have downloads I know that that
YouTube is Google but I think we need to
focus on that going forward as well cuz
it's like really it's really an
important platform so if you're doing
the RSS thing on iTunes because it's
2005 alright it's 2015 well so you can
also watch us on YouTube we're just know
because I made my momma account on
YouTube and I subscribe
I get all I get concerned about our RSS
feed and stuff be concerned about the
future of the show when it comes to that
aspect of it so anyway that's about it
thank you for coming with us on this
journey
happy new years to everybody if it's
already New Year's wherever you're
living happy hang over there
happy hangover day I'm not coming to
work tomorrow
no until next time i'm darren kitchen
i'm see anymore trust your techno
from the camera it looks like we're in
somebody's backyard yeah it looks like
we're at a barbecue good I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
