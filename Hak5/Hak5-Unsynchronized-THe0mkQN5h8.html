synchronization the EZ wage pulse
metrics and more I'm Shannon Morse and
you're watching this episode of hack 5
is brought to you by Coors Light coming
soon the Coors Lite home draft system
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain.com
and go to assist Express remote support
made easy hello welcome to hak5 my name
is darren kitchen and i'm paul tobias
and this is the show where rock beats
ducky ducky beats computer and control
key forts ducky well yeah I know it's
kind of got in the way of everything
else we ever did whether USB device in
it well I used to be shift yeah if you
haven't been playing along we're talking
about like with the USB switchblade good
insert the USB Drive but if you held
down shift
you were totally protected you know
where to lay out of play right with with
USB ducky from last tweet it just
modifies all the controls right so if
you look down the control key it's still
hitting Windows key R but what it's
doing is hitting control windows key R
and then controls see them has no
intelligence to know that you're doing
no it's a one-way device yeah so there
you go but then it's like are you really
gonna give somebody like a USB key still
and have it do all this and like
not freak the out and pull it out
I mean why why not what are you talking
about like how long split seconds what
seconds to it I had to slowed down 2,800
X for you to even be able to see it just
doing something is I'm Blake renewing my
IP but we're releasing my DNS yeah what
if you're gonna get it like something
serious yeah you gotta tell the person
that's why I'm curious it is checking I
haven't seen any the first thing you do
okay so when is he our CMD right you
pulled the command prompt alt space m4
move hold down the down arrow command
prompt window goes to the bottom of the
screen type you type yelling
you'll see the very top for the blue at
the very bottom you know the taskbar
that's man from those be young because
most people oh that I'm not getting into
this view so payloads for the win
wiki's backup and dev kits are going out
here vishay you've already like max out
your yeah five hundred in four days so
thanks for the registrations sadly we
only have 100 if we had like eight
thousand more dollars to throw at this
project we could make sure that
everybody got one but unfortunately well
eventually trying to sell well
eventually we'll do a kid and something
like that but you know to jump start the
project I figure the best way was just
crowdsource so you know I guess
everybody's got a one in five chance cuz
I cut it off exactly a 500 yeah so there
you go so now I'm speaking a cheap
Internet devices I'm really jealous of
your little micro video camera thing the
movie that we talked about last week and
then you know I got the best comment
ever from YouTube of all places YouTube
because I was making fun of them so he
had to go check them yeah YouTube
comments are some of the most fun to
read
hi there but they pointed out the same
thing you bought while I go to six or
sixty bucks for five you know well five
dollars like sixteen shipping and stuff
so it's essentially like 20 boxes I
actually won one in an auction for $0.50
but I still had to pay sixteen fifty for
shipping and handling Canada is either
that or Hong Kong like what if you had
it shipped to somewhere it doesn't
matter anyway the bottom line is Wow I
okay so but the lesson learned is cool
thanks YouTube comment people and second
the the device only has three hours of
battery life but the SD card will record
for like hours and hours and hours and
hours so well since it's not using
replaceable battery instances Ojin just
replace the whole camera there we go a
lot about the cards and you get it got a
whole bunch of them so now you know as
I'm charged over in the NL ID oh the the
electric car model where you don't need
the car to like survive more
he just needs to survive the next
charging station meeting multiple cars
up yeah I put the extra cars on the back
but you know this is going to pair
there's actual content in this episode
by the way we're just bantering it's
called to a block it's a TV thing but
Shannon's got some some stuff coming up
about I'm gonna shoot her she was doing
it's right there
okay I'm to be honest these these these
last two weeks and these next two weeks
have been so difficult you want to cut
to a picture of the living room okay
yeah yes yes disappoint I didn't know
that is in our house oh you have the
original pictures of like before we like
you I like the hairs like that so there
you go
side by side look at home as ham and I
think I'm gonna be like a little thing
I'm hearing me like oh my god what
happened
like Loic ever happened with that right
there yeah a little caption the lower
captions no I thought you were holding
it are you gonna have like flying bull
you give me a hand
yeah yeah
what's with the rubber duckies oh it's
my latest great idea and what do you
know with all the smoke detectors oh
those are for the americium the
radioactive isotope yeah I did a bunch
of research back in the day during World
War two there's this dude like Glenn
Seaborg or something and it was like
from barding plutonium with these
neutrons and totally discovered this
stuff and now you can get an entire
detective dealies what's that got to do
with the rubber duckies man radioactive
rubber duckies right well they only put
like a third of a microgram in the smoke
detector but I totally found a way to
bind the whole seal and extract this
stuff real easy what are you gonna do
with radioactive rubber ducky what else
man take a bath of gamma radiation that
is the worst idea I've ever heard no
it's the best idea ever and that's why
I've already registered radioactive
rubber duckies mom I hope you didn't
spend a lot of money on that no dude

it all starts with a great domain domain
calm
if you're anything like me you have work
on multiple computers you have your
booklet and your laptop and then you
have your home computer and then you
have your work computer then you have
your work laptop now let's not forget
all those tons of servers that are
sitting in the closet well at least
that's the hack house but nevertheless
you get what I mean
and then while remote access might be
really really good and a great solution
for grabbing files really quickly and by
the way go to assist Express has these
nifty unattended support and fire train
file transfer tools that are awesome
there's nothing actually like getting
all of your tools and your research and
you work synched up and whether you're a
network drive or a thumb drive or an
Amazon s3 kind of guy well I'm a USB
thumb drive person obviously this tool
that I'm going to show you is going to
make sure to keep all that stuff in
check let's check it out always sync is
a Windows folder synchronization tool
that's free for personal use which is
awesome it supports all sorts of seeking
methods target directories and it even
features advanced scheduling options the
syncing methods include a two way
version which basically means that file
changes on one computer will also change
on the other it's like a mirror and you
can also set to have deleted files
included in this or you can have syncing
happen one way or the other so if your
primary rig is your PC upstairs and your
netbook is your secondary rig you can
have all your files going just one way
there are also tons of target
directories to choose to choose from
there's a plethora of options there's
windows folders USB mass storage devices
network folders
there's FTP sites Amazon s3 web dev and
even active sync so I go I've gone ahead
and installed always sync on my hack 5
cloud lab box and I've connected with go
to assist Express so let's go ahead and
check it out
once you have always seek installed and
running you'll notice that while it's
not winning
Beauty Awards it is full-featured and
it's quite functional you don't believe
me pull down the language menu take a
look
we're gonna add a new job so I'll click
on job and then add new job let's
right-click the new job tab and click
rename and call it something useful like
sync tools yeah that's me tools now
let's specify a target for a
synchronization for this demo I'm gonna
point always sync at my oats a favorite
folder Steve :
tools alright this is gonna save me a
lot of frustration the next time that I
go home for putty and the target can be
anything including a USB thumb drive
like this one I've already made a
profile for mine so that every time I
connect it it's going to sink but I'm
gonna add an FTP site to this so select
FTP server from the drop-down and click
configure the URL needs to be something
like FTP colon slash slash the domain so
for me it's MMC com
you should check it out and then the
path so for me that's slash numsy com
slash file slash tools and then enter in
your credentials and click OK now to
test that it works
let's click analyze always sync is going
to connect to my FTP site and get a
directory listing and compare it to what
I have on my C colon backslash tools
photo folder and this report is going to
show me that most of the files don't
exist so I'm gonna go ahead and manually
click synchronize and then I'll copy
them over all right now comes the
awesome part I could have uploaded all
these tools with the FTP client but when
I want to add a tool to my collection
and I want it to be on all of my sheet
machines what do I have to do this is
why we have scheduling so let's check
out scheduling yeah if I right-click on
my job and click properties I get a
spiffing menu where I'll drill down to
automatic synchronization
from here I can select whether I want a
sink to be performed every time a USB
Drive is plugged in every some minutes
after our files changed when the
computer becomes out when the app starts
up like a login before logging out or
even getting way more advanced than with
the windows task scheduler so I'm gonna
go ahead and choose when the system has
been idle for an hour to be my scheduled
time yes there we go all of my tools are
synced I now have s delete and putty and
process Explorer whenever I need them
of course this just scratches the
surface always sync has tons of other
powerful advanced features so I highly
recommend checking out all the different
menus and stuff go poke around have a
good time and what do you think do you
think that our sink in a cron job are
easier than this or do you have a
certain tool that you like to use other
than always think email me feedback at

assist Express you're giving me too much
to do have an editing now I've got a
tiny you might see this
see this no I will do this oh yes a you
also got the yeah yeah okay every
episode of the seventh season has been
edited on this a thirteen inch notebook
night with the Maldive you've also got
like the second there's ago which I got
is like this but it's not bad EP season
relegated to the secondary display oh
right right yeah so this is uh that's
how you take your equipment on the road
on the motorcycle this is a pelican 1890
case and it's cool because I get to look
like Jack Bauer or a terrorist or
something because like everything's cuz
in an apartment I still need to get one
of these because I sitting at work all
day just one sorry YouTube videos if I
can just fit right on here I can say it
like an extra screen and this is all USB
yeah a single USB port powers at
seven-inch display this is the memo s10
tech s I believe 640 no 800 by 480 so
the same resolution of an EPC they just
came out with a new model that's a 10
inch yeah so that's like a little USB
per yeah it's got a little kick out okay
isn't it fold in like that it doesn't
pull to see no I like the s10 because it
it's got this protective plate with this
fancy like five stickers that like
protects the screens so that I can just
you know toss around not have to worry
about it but the the new one I don't
know if it has that but it's got the
little kick out things so it's kind of
like a digital picture frame but yeah a
USB and I would surprise a single USB
didn't you have to go with the Dooleys
to power it and and just runs with a
software thing I actually have a review
up on YouTube where I compare the
performance hit that you take because it
is a USB video drivers so you're gonna
take a hit there but yeah hey come on
stop man seriously but it definitely
jealous of it yeah so what are we doing
we've done this for the this is doing
every single episode of the seventh
season it'll do it'll do the rest of the
season really and we're until I get
settled in SF
with building up to quad-core again but
do you have one interesting problem with
this that okay so we came with our
remedy right so King with a 500 gig 4
gigs of ram 13 inch love it love it
see you LV so it's 1 point 3 gigahertz
he's fun is it it's right here it's
right here yeah oh yeah yeah you
probably get asked good design but it uh
but but the little CoV is the chip that
can but the problem is the hard drive
well I haven't any problems with it what
I would hate to so pick up the spare us
just won't just swap them out I've got
the 7200 rpm replacing it and I'll keep
necessary original this is a 54 and some
of your data so the hope is you know
when it comes to disaster recovery the
you've got a lot of trade-offs and one
of them is is how fast can you restore
yeah and for that there is nothing like
doing an absolute image sector-by-sector
bit for bit of the hard drive this guy
is an absolutely no not gonna rebuild
reinstalled yeah we register whatever
junk that is right so this the idea is
sure idiot the Pelican case can handle a
beating you can get run over by a truck
and tossed in the ocean it'll be fine
but if the hard drive dies I've got a
spare I'll pop it in this guy and it'll
be right back up and running so gonna
talk a little bit about imaging later
today and what was trying it out in this
last two weeks have been hella crazy
that's why I can't even remember what
Shannon's doing and these next two weeks
are gonna be so crazy because we're now
to minus 13 days as of filming or 14 or
15 something where yeah
10 seconds oh there you go it doesn't
matter it's just I'm very well let's try
not to do that but yeah it's about to
get crazy so just you know um I
appreciate everybody being cool with
crazy formats and shorter episodes or
ridiculousness and a lot of our friends
helping us out yes thank you so much to
over 4
have been helping us out so Oh about the
duck you forget to mention that dude
already there's a application to defend
against it there's an application not
just holding control yeah moonlit went
ahead and I love the name of it he wrote
a program called duck hunt through the
windows app which will detect new human
interface devices and block their
keyboard access and stuff like that so
and this is so if like you had is this
just USB plug and like it yeah no no
it's it's an app that run it seems like
there needs to be some sort of failover
I know it's an app that runs in the
background it detects new hits and then
it forts them there you go so so if you
don't have one already like plugged in
or re-register how would you install if
you haven't already on the keyboard I
get to get BNC in or maybe you're not
only touch ok so there might be some
some things to tweak but it's still you
know like if the dev team hasn't even
like fully sunk their teeth into an
already there's you know a defense and I
think that's awesome but we all know
that no corporations are getting running
that so it's still gonna be a lot of fun
for I'm sure quite quite a long time and
that is in the white hat duckies know
are they are so cute aside from just
being cute um somebody asked me about
this is that's actually something that I
did back at my systems administration
job for the last year I left I had two
of these keys in the supply closet so
you know I'd get a call saying hey I
need to get on the network port or
whatever and this was before I had some
fancy you know remote access stuff like
shins I was talking about but I I would
just say hey go to the supply room
closet and find a little USB key this is
ad network printer or find the USB key
that said add you know logistics shared
folder you know and there's ears to just
plug in it's simply out where your
the printers your closeted IT guy but no
I just pull out the printer guy just
pull up the network good so definitely
save some time and then I kind of
realized dawned on me when I was on the
forums talking about this it oh did I
did I seriously replace myself with a
USB key you know that t-shirt that says
shut up or I will replace it with a very
small shell script do that to yourself
oh listen learn that he should have
should have became a coder because my
spaghetti code it kept it employed now
that's a joke uh yeah I think that that
pretty much covers it yeah yeah we'll
see you guys on the other side and if
you're playing along at home that should
be check the wiki our next LAN party
