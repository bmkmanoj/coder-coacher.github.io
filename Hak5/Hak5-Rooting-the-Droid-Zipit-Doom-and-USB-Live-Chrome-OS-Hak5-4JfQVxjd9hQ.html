droid WPA cracking in the cloud USB
booting Chrome OS playing doom on the
Zipit your WordPress picks up in tons
more all that and more on this episode
of hak5
this episode of head 5 is brought to you
by go to assist express Nokia and domain
com got a great idea it all starts with
a great domain welcome to a festive
holiday edition of hak5 my name is
darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse I'm not
gonna wear this for us the show why not
it was so cute actually not just a
little does it does it really match okay
well cuz i'm i'm david today or no you
can see that in the HDR aggressive and
very American thank you alright it just
feels like that kind of a day right yes
tree up we have presents under the tree
just for Darren nobody else the person
talks behind you the porcelain I
mean what more could you want yeah and
it's raining out and one of those just
no where's all the snow no I don't wish
for snow but I like snow you know I have
my snow boots on I'm ready for snow I
kicked the camera that's awesome um no
like like um I'm going up to Toronto and
no Kirby come on every episode down
she's such a gay power now anyway I'm
not hoping for snow cuz I'm gonna be up
in Toronto the day after Christmas 330
I'll have my little meet up in tdot as
long as there's no snow when I'm flying
on my plane because I do not want to be
delayed I'm flying on Christmas Eve no
delays playing on Christmas Day and it's
gonna be awesome Erin pineapple oh no
please don't make the play I'm gonna
bring I'm gonna bring one of the ones
like in a regular case not in kk not in
the plastic because last time I flew
with it you remember yeah that was that
wasn't very good we do have a bangin
show for you guys this week it is so
full that we had to start offloading
some stuff to the next week the wicked
is getting a little crazy there on the
dev but let's cool it just being so
we've got some kickass stuff for the
next couple weeks we do you want to
start let's start it off because we have
a ton of follow-up feedback in tons and
tons of follow-up the first one is moxie
just launched a wpa cloud cracking
service the whole idea beat behind cow
patty was that you could use like
rainbow tables set up specifically for
cracking wpa right and and use this to
it you know crack the hash if you happen
to be sniffing on your wireless and you
end up
picking up a handshake well what's the
difference with this one well it's the
same idea but here's the problem the
limitation with the rainbow tables from
like your places like the church of
Wi-Fi is that the way that WPA is made
it's salted remember that again from
anyway it's salted with the SSID so if
the SS a idea is linksys then it's going
to be salted with that if it's going to
be netgear whatever but and the trish
Wi-Fi has gone through great lengths to
put together wpa key or wpa rainbow
tables based on the most popular million
passwords i believe it is and a thousand
SSIDs so that's nice and all but that's
all that's you know you're not going to
be able to pre-compute everything just
because there are so many possible ssids
if you're trying to crack somebody's
corporate firewall or corporate network
wireless and they've got a bizarre SSID
it's not going to be in those rainbow
tables you're going to sit there
generating them for weeks so he has
access to a beowulf cluster of
Awesomeness it turns out a supercomputer
that can go ahead and crack them in real
time and he says about 20 minutes Wow
yeah that's a lot better than a week
yeah so a lot of very similar with the
services like md5 look up or some of the
other ones where you can submit like
Shaw hashes and stuff and then get you
know or LMK hatches and get it cracked
back he's put together a service the
same way you sent him a packet capture
file just in a standard pcap and and
he'll you know go ahead and throw it on
his cluster and I think it's like
seventeen dollars he's got two different
two different versions is when it's like
seventeen dollars the other ones $34
will get you in about twenty forty
minutes it tries a dictionary file of
135 million words Wow yeah that would
take a regular desktop about five days
but his can do it in about 40 minutes
it's a 400 CPU cluster and it just
sounds awesome so yeah this sounds
pretty cool I can't imagine how many
like ps3 is it is like stacked up or
whatever it is so i guess i can see if
actually we can get him on the program
because i'd love to talk to him about
that
so if you've got like hook up email me
also one of the problems that came up of
not doing your DNS via your socks proxy
is that they can still do a DNS
poisoning and send you off to someplace
bad yeah we didn't talk about that the
other last episode we were talking about
though yeah firefox want to configure it
so that your dns goes through it as well
and it didn't occur to me mm-hmm cuz I
just sometimes I don't think black had
enough you're such a good-hearted person
I don't know Oh ask the TSA but I don't
know it's that's that's an important
important point because somebody could
potentially say oh you're looking for
the DNS of Bank of America com yeah sure
i was ready go anywhere bad but yeah you
know if I wasn't looking carefully
enough how would I know yeah it's not
even that I mean they could like send
you to a site that even is the site
you're going to but also like add
something to it like a little JavaScript
that does a little key logging and sent
it back somewhere I mean was it jubak I
can't remember the name of the
JavaScript framework that does it
somebody emailed me about that cuz oh my
gosh we need to talk about this so I'll
just Mukalla lies here coolest thing
ever javascript man-in-the-middle
keylogging just ok so what else what
else do we have here so what's going on
with um what's it called MDD yeah mobic
see mailed about us about this but and
we have to give em DDI moment of silence
why because they are no longer MDD takes
a bow and you guys remember MDD what is
it a man tax memory dump er or DD that's
basically awesome tool for capturing an
image of what's in RAM on a computer and
unfortunately it is no longer being
supported we talked about it in season
four fun forensic stuff that is sad I
was actually a big fan of this one will
some other people like wind ed the
authors are saying hey well go check out
when dd cuz you know that works as well
ok but they're well also oh sorry as
totally going over your right now no no
I whatever we collided there was a nap
there's a sha-1 collision there you go
so weird I'm so dorky and hyper right
now that's okay it's all that chocolate
you were Ewing what's that chocolate it
was a protein chocolate bar it doesn't
taste like chocolate it wants to be like
I don't even want to get into it okay so
health interesting um WordPress we got
tons and tons of info about different
WordPress programs that you can use to
make your own themes so a couple of them
was page' recommended the turnkey Linux
virtual appliance at turnkey linux org
slash WordPress so that was the first
one and then jetpacks and roller skates
that sounds familiar yeah you know those
cartoon characters you see maybe intro
the show uh-huh yeah wonder why mm-hmm
anyway he points out that starkers theme
naked WordPress that's a good one to use
and then colon Napier recommended
artists tier 3 awesome recommendations
and i gotta say the first one the
virtual linux appliance wasn't it just
like a few weeks ago we were talking
about setting up a virtual appliance
with with dim dim I same ideas now yeah
it was like BAM and so I was talking
about oh yeah install xam PP or w.a.m.p
p to get yourself you know linux PHR not
like a PHP Apache WordPress all the
stuff you need this is just a virtual
machine you just BAM throw on VirtualBox
my done artistic I went to their site
and checked it out for a little bit and
it looks pretty cool and there's a free
demo so I'm thinking maybe do a couple
of reviews of the next episode yeah I
think that's a great idea it looks a
little expensive what did they say here
purchase it's yeah but there's a free
demo stuff fifty dollars for the home
and academic version or 134 in the real
one but the fifty-dollar one will export
what you create into a wordpress theme
so it is it's a nice idea of doing a
little drag and drop with a gooey and
not having to do any code I'm pretty
nice it's like geocities back in the day
we did that site uploader type thing you
can just move stuff around on your site
oh and a moment of silence for geocities
very well wait brings me back to my days
angelfire baby that's where it was oh
you
yet cross-linked your angel fire to your
geo cities because all the pictures
wouldn't fit on one so what do you say
let's wrap it up in get right into
playing doom on your zip it rocking out
your droid and what else coming on your
EP c install USB alts goodness alright
guys your questions at the end of the
show so yes jam-packed but we do have to
thank our awesome sponsor go to assist
express when it comes to providing my
users with technical support my days of
flying blind are over I don't even
bother if I can't see their desktop and
interact with it so I convinced my
employer to get me go to assist express
by Citrix now when I take a call I can
instantly connect to their desktop and
kicks the problem in no time I don't
need to worry about a whole lot because
it's 128 bit secured end to end our need
a fancy firewall or fancy VPN just a web
browser will do so it reduces my travel
costs it doesn't waste my time doesn't
waste my users time so you know they can
get back to work not they don't even
need to be at the computer for me to fix
the problem if it's not severe I say hey
Jan go take lunch when you come back
your computer is going to be as good as
new so I encourage you to check out go
to assist express whether you're
supporting a workforce or just
supporting your family's computer it is
definitely the way to go when it comes
to you know remote support so if you
would like to try it out you can get a
30-day trial at go to assist calm / hak5
and again to support the show you've got
to use that URL go to assist calm / hak5
what could be more fun than unlocking a
zip in running Linux unlocking a zip at
running Linux and playing doom because
it's not a real hack unless for playing
Tim right you have to put do on
everything as policies my crap yeah yeah
how do you like my toys in d well I
don't take my license if you put doom to
my on my iPhone I'll be pissed cuz it's
already unlike my DS do my own cell
phone and do you have it on your day
yeah it's not a real it's a it's a
coming-of-age thing like a device isn't
a real device until place doom alright
well yes you can put doom on here and if
you want to i'll show you how sweet
because we tried last time segmentation
faults figured it out what's the special
sauce PR boom is the special sauce
alright this doom source port for
windows mac and linux lucky for us yay
and to get it you just have to hit
startx to get into fluxbox and then hit
apt-get install PR boom to install PR
boom into flux box on your zip it that
is so much easier than the crazy been
details were allow for easy yeah yeah
once you have this thing running linux
like installing anything is a breeze
well it's debian and we love apt but we
hear that yum is nice too but anyway
don't email us about that please so PR
boom comes with freedom it's a free and
open-source doom 2 i wad I odd that's
such a silly where it's important it's a
collection of like the graphics and the
videos and music and the sounds and
different levels right make up the
entire game pretty much well because it
does this they open source their games
like you know doom quake whatever they
open slow some but they don't open
source the like the WOD or whatever the
pbk or if it could forget the name but
the the files that make up the levels in
the actual game the the creative content
that sells it they just open source the
engine which is nice because then people
like PR boom can come along hey we got
athletics down you know and you can also
provide your own I wide for if you own
your copy of doom doom 2 or I think its
ultimate doom so you could use any of
those or you can use a doom one
shareware I'd wad so you can google
X of doom wad and possibly come up with
a good one yeah that you can use a good
one I bought doom back in 96 or 94-92 I
anyway I wish everybody I'm back in the
day like legally yeah I really did I was
on too many floppies so how do we
actually get it set up now that we've
got it installed it how do we pay well
you do need to change the width and
height okay so that you can see
everything so you change it PR boom tech
wit 320 tak height 240 mm which is
pretty much the size of this guy yeah
the screen size or you can use PR boom
tech wit 320 height 240 tak i wad doom 2
dot wad if you have a legit doom to what
what's this one does have yes ok so you
press ENTER and it starts running it oh
there you go goodness yeah it's it's so
simple sweet so the first thing you want
to do is set up your key bindings and to
do that you just go to options set up in
key bindings alright sweet ok let's see
what we got we already set up our key
bindings by basically you can go down
that entire list and change everything
up and now ultraviolent and we're in her
new game alright so how to play this
right now we're moving around with the
d-pad we're gonna hit the middle button
to shoot there you go Hey look at that
and I can only see it like to my side to
die die die oh come on there we go huh
we can also do a death match with this
guy yeah how do we do a death match oh I
just cover it all I'll get killed by the
employers camp near the death match so
to do a death match you can run it run a
server from another computer using PR
boom tech game tax server tech and two
ok or however many the two stands for
however many players you want to sure
playing the game together so um we just
stuck with two and then to connect to
the deathmatch server you put PR boom
tech wid 320 hi
240 and then technet in the server's IP
address there we go this is where it
gets a little tricky right yeah this is
a something that I was not anticipated
you can have to take this from me
because I will seriously finish that
level the turns out as we develop with
the Zipit we've got a couple laying
around house here that we're working on
and ran into an interesting problem when
we start trying to do some fun
networking with them and that is that
they all have the same mac address and
that is I believe built into the
firmware that the Libertas file that we
move over in you know the unlocking
process so I've gotten around that just
by on bootup every time we config to get
to the wireless and everything just
running an ifconfig on f1 with HW space
ether space and then an IP address so
you know just six bytes separated by
colons so you know I've got like 0 0
colon 1 through 00 Cola 02 anyway so
that's the kind of that I've been using
to make sure that they don't all have
the same hardware address because before
I did that I had some interesting packet
adventures with the router where things
were just not going the right way anyway
that's how I have been getting around
that limitation so if you do have more
than one or you know you know I just
realized pure boom yeah we can do it
obvious just tcp/ip to do the death
match if you have a zip it and you put
PR boom on here you have a doom 2 wad
email us because I would love to try
doing a VPN PR boom deathmatch or on the
server ooh what does sound fun so as
shannon destroy some em so let's go
ahead and find out about this week's
trivia you guys remember last week's
trivia question was released by the
openbsd team in October 1999 openssh
claims to be the free and more secure
alternative to what proprietary software
this was correctly answered by psalm ken
who writes SSH I know right proprietary
it's crazy I think of ssh is being
opened
but rich interesting history if you are
into rich and interesting history with
computers which I'm such a dork that I
am so I'll link up the Wikipedia stuff
that has a great write-up on it but this
week's trivia question oh and some can
will be receiving bonobos album zero
equals 1 equals everything this trivia
question this week is for Ash warthog
movie hackers are people too awesome DVD
and the question is philip k dick snob
ille Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
served as a loose plot basis for what
1980s science fiction film starring
Harrison Ford of course send your
answers to trivia at hak5 better what
you can't answer it right now but i know
it i just finished that book and i loved
it yeah how was it I'm so good so good
another one of your you're not all
sci-fi classic not dead tree books where
was this adventure on it was not a dead
tree it was a kindle yeah look hey
Kendall tip for the holidays don't

and save fifteen percent on your next
order when you checkout with coupon code
hak5 got a great idea it all starts with
a great domain domain com
so a couple of weeks ago Darren talked
to us about how to get chromium working
on your machine via a virtual machine
but this week he's actually going to
show us how to use it via a USB flash
drive there we go we're gonna boot it
from the bare metal weight as it were
I'm so excited yeah so first thing we
need to do is plug the cat in via USB
and then the flash its memory flash the
memory oh that's not how I wanted that
to go she's all right there she lands on
all for the internet I had words about
the cat earlier and the internet 10
Chrome OS is awesome and fun to play
with in that vm but it's not it's not
really the best experience and I just
really wanted to get it done in my um my
eeepc here the old original 701 that's
still working still rockin yeah I can I
can seriously like drop this right
outside his butt like oh well I really
did that and oh still booted no problem
I love solid state and in fact Google is
actually said hey Chrome OS is made for
solid-state netbooks I don't really toss
them on the floor like I just nice very
cool okay so how do we get this working
well you basically just need to download
the torrent that you will find in the
show notes to get a build of chrome OS
that is specifically designed to be
booted from USB okay and once you have
that just extract it and I actually have
all this set up here in here and what
you'll find is that you've got as well
you know when you extract the Zep you
will end up with a win32 disk imager
read me a couple of dll's and what's
important to Chrome OS image file now
we're going to be doing this in Linux
because I gave up on windows while ago
and and basically what we're going to do
is screw the disk in the windy deal with
disk image or whatever we're just going
to use DD to write this over to a USB
Drive okay and then we can boot our pc
off of it now this is not going to work
for this demo but I've already done it
with this one but i'll go ahead and show
you up to pressing enter on the DD
command anyway i'm just going to use one
of the USB drives to pick up see yes or
whatever and looks there's like 20 of
them
so in a bunt or Ubuntu you will go over
to system administration disk utility
which one to find out here is what the
address or what the path is to your
flash drive and I'm actually going to go
ahead and delete this oh I've already
deleted good so what I find out here is
that the flash drive is / dev / sdb as
opposed to my hard disk which is slush
dev / SDA I do not want to run this
command with SDA because I would not
have a very happy computer afterwards so
basically all we have to do after that
is ron DD with i F equals 4 input file
and then we want to choose the chrome
underscore OS image and 0 F equals and
then our cases can be / dev / sdb and if
this were a USB Drive of three gigs or
more this would work this is a 512
maggots not going to oh ok yeah I
actually ended up doing this on a eight
gig SD card or flawlessly and once
you've run this command you basically
just sit there and wait for it to image
the file over pop out your USB drive
when it's done you are not it and all
that stuff mm-hmm pop it on your laptop
whatever you got booted up and bam there
you are that's it chromium log into that
does it that's like I do is really easy
yeah if you're enjoy doing any windows
you can do that as well licks in the
show notes all that fun stuff I like the
Linux one it's easy yeah yeah I thought
so too and there we go we got Chrome OS
I mean to let the resolution isn't set
correctly for the for the epc here if
it's close enough that's okay when you
log in you have to use your gmail info
right right but your what if you're not
connected to your wireless yet well
that's exactly what's gonna happen when
you first boot it up mhm you don't have
a configuration option it doesn't say
hey welcome to Chrome for the very first
time and I'm assuming when it is a
full-blown you know packaged operating
system for the masses that's how it will
be but yeah for the time being as a dev
environment
it's set up with a local user that you
can use to get yourself started okay
that makes sense yes so what we do here
is we log into fuel line going out just
log in as Chronos the password is
password ok so here we are in you know
we can login to our gmail and we can do
fun from OS stuff so what's the
difference between this one running off
the USB via the virtual machine one
obviously it's going to be fast around
here the main difference here is that
I've noticed is that we can actually get
to the terminal yeah so that's very
convenient because all we have to do is
hit ctrl alt and T and what's gonna
happen here is oh cool I have a happy
little local host I'm at the shell and I
can you know I knock in LS and I can I
can top and I can all that other fun
stuff and I have you know full access to
the system is there anything cool about
this one that well I mean I know since
you i'm running a here on a netbook i
will be able to actually get on the
wireless and that's just a matter of
clicking up here in the top right and
under Wi-Fi you'll notice that i am
connected to the hak5 Wi-Fi that's all
it is you just click there and check the
box the performance hasn't been all of
that great but I wouldn't expect it to
just yet mm-hmm powering off the device
as easy as just pressing the power
button I want to go into the terminal
type power off that'll work as well but
there is no official shut down it's not
like oh you click start shut their apple
and whatever or KDE or what you know
it's just totally interesting Beast
there and if you want to install it to
your your computer from the SD card or
USB boot you can go ahead and do that
just go into the terminal I am you'll
find a script under / user / s been
called chrome tak install just run that
and there you go you got installed on
your computer cool well thank you for
showing us this yes awesome of course I
don't you would install it it will
overwrite everything on your you know
hard drive so and i play with it yeah
yeah just don't install it cuz i do have
some stuff on that but i don't have to
lose how long i'll just play oh look at
all the cute like where you get too much
involved in it you want to let us know
what's going on with a land party ah oh
yeah LAN party left 4 dead 2 yay I'm so
excited for left 4 dead 2 Ivan even
played it yet fight oh I did play the
demo and it was amazing nice so much fun
we'll grab the game cuz it's coming up
it's a game Dec 5 org and it's January
second and third yay excellent now stay
tuned because in just a bit we will be
rooting the droid but first we do want
to thank our excellent sponsor nokia i
love the freedom that my motorcycle
gives me when I'm riding twistys through
the mountains or chasing sun sets down
the coast but the servers that a support
at work don't seem to have this idea of
paid time off so I don't always get a
break that's why i love the nokia
booklet 3g 12 hours of battery life
windows 7 bluetooth and here's the
kicker always on 3g because i don't
always know where i'm going to be when
the exchange servers have like an empty
a seizure the boss a new laptop gets
hosed but I get all day connectivity to
the sexy aluminium ultraportable that's
just under three pounds slips right into
my tank bag I don't even have to worry
about bringing the power
the intro price is to 9999 with an amt
data connect plan and two year
activation you can pick one up at best
buy exclusively either in-store online
find out more information at nokia com
slashed booklet 3g what is the device if
it doesn't have root on it this is if it
didn't have root but we kind of owned it
and Darren's going to show us how to
root the droid yes it is time to own it
up ladies and gentlemen I've been
getting so many emails about this what
are you gonna rip droidles whenever root
comes out for it I'm not going to spend
you know the next three weeks looking
for an exploit cuz then yes we did it
yes yeah well that's part of the process
okay um and yeah so I've been monitoring
the forms just waiting for you know the
this to come around because it happened
with just about every linux device you
could shake a stick at and I'm excited
because you know it's time to take
motorola droid and make it happy and
awesome useful so i can run route
applications and fun stuff like that so
the process is actually a lot simpler
today than it was yesterday and it might
be even easier tomorrow after this
segment airs but that's just the state
of hackery when dealing with you know
objects in motion you remember the aten
des me stop you stuff oh yeah so anyway
this will get your route on your droid
there might be an easier way to do it
what happened would it was like
yesterday what the the deal was was that
we would have to connect our droid to
our phone and then use the Android debug
what is it called Android debug bridge
it's a special thing that comes with the
android sdk sale aqui viewer software
developer and ones make your own android
apps you'd use this and you use this app
to push basically to push sue over to
this device and Su Su super user is just
a program that lets you run as root
you'll notice that I use sudo or sue do
a lot in Linux that's me saying hey do
this as the super user or as a root so
essentially what's happened here is that
with the latest version of the operating
system which is open source for anyone
to go and take a look at the code of the
awesome Royd hackers that they are have
realized that there isn't any signature
checking on certain on zip files of
certain sizes so they're exploding that
taking advantage of a recent update the
two point zero point one update and
packaging sue along with it so basically
just copying that program over so you
can run as root and I'm I think that may
have simplified it but I'm not saying
that it was the easy I'm not belittling
they also development of the droid
hacking community but I will demonstrate
here for you so you can see that it's
not actually scary it's pretty easy to
do and I'm actually going to be doing
this on my droid live I have not rooted
it yet because once you I mean this I
wasn't sure this is something that I
could reproduce after the fact so I'm
just gonna do it once live to tape and
hopefully not break your phone I might
have a brick by the end of this but but
you know hang on to your pants here so
Shanna you're gonna run the other camera
for me so we can actually get the droid
screen here and without showing you my
password now the first thing that we're
going to need to do before we before we
start the rooting process is we want to
go into settings and come down here to
about and make sure that we have the
latest system update and it's telling me
that i currently have you know the
system update and i'm all good and it
can actually take a look at lips not
that the firmware and i can see what
version i have and yes it doesn't even
have a menu just has to point zero point
one you need the 2 point 0 point what if
you're going to do this you can do this
without two point zero point one but
then you're not going to get it pushed
over the air see what happens is when
you rejoin you no longer get firmware
update pushed to your phone which is
nice because Shannon you know what I'm
talking about oh yeah when you when you
get that homebrew going and then
Nintendo releases a new rom and you
don't want to update when a whole up
make sure everything's still gonna be
cozy first yeah wait till the forums get
updated yes and I have been monitoring
the all Andrew or alldroid org forms
that's where all of this broke and
that's where things have been getting
easier and easier to do so rather than
using the development environment all we
have to do really is download this one
single file
and I've gone ahead and done that here
and it is the droid tak super underscore
user zip all I have to do is rename that
to update.zip and then we take our droid
USB cable here and I'm just going to go
ahead and plug you into the side here
and yes that is kind of a scary noise to
hear it middle of the night yeah now
droids plugged in we've got ubuntu here
we're taking a look at my computer and
in just a moment Oh actually actually
what before it's going to show up in
your computer what you need to do is on
your droid pull up your notification bar
here and you're going to see USB
connected select that it's going to ask
you you on a mount kit yes click mount
and now on your computer you'll notice
that all of a sudden I have another
folder in my / media and that is because
I have auto mounted at the 16 gig SD
card sdhc card that comes with this
little guy so all I need to do now is
come over to my / media and this is
where all of my android stuff is that is
my android so i actually just need to
copy the update.zip / to / media / in my
case it's 119 see yadda yadda it's going
to be different for yours so there we go
it's copied over now all verify that say
I take a look and yes I do have the
update.zip there excellent now I just
need to go ahead and unmount this bad
boy click here to unmount and I can
succeed safely unplug him and he is a
have your little droid waiting to get
rooted now so let's go ahead and reboot
him so i'm going to hold down the power
button until i get the option to power
off go ahead and shut all the way down
and now I will turn them back on but
this time what we need to do is hold
down the physical x button on the keypad
while pressing the power button so I'm
holding down x yes I'm pressing power
okay and I've got the icon here I can
let go of X and power and at this point
I need to hold down the volume plus and
the camera button at the same time I
never again I get a little menu and I
can use the d-pad here and it says
android system recovery and use the
d-pad and what we can do is reboot the
system now we can apply the SD card file
update.zip we can wipe the data or we
can write to the cache partition we just
want to choose apply SD card update.zip
there we go we are applying the
unofficial update now this is unsigned
code from the community the awesome
community it is install complete install
complete hooray that's click OK and now
we just want to come down here and
choose reboot the system now we'll hit
ok and little droid here should start
rebooting this is a good time to have
some wine after the flash not before the
people in the chat room are yelling
brick that's not very nice if you ever
want to join us on the live chat that is
I reseda hak5 org count hak5 or pound
hack house and you can watch the stream
live at hacc house calm oh it does look
like a Cylon oh my gosh oh that is
creepy that thing's gonna kill you in
your sleep it's not more creepier than
Gladys oh god what if this thing talk
like Gladys does all right I'm just
gonna log in here
and all of my icons are gone oh I'm just
gonna give it a minute hey all my icons
are all right and I believe I should be
able to just come over here to a
terminal now oh wait that's my ssh
client yes I know Wow stalled way too
many oh my gosh I've got a terminal
emulator here that has just force closed
on me excellent this is the fun of live
to tape I think that's the only terminal
I have lets you turn me alam ii letter
and force close okay we're gonna take a
quick intermission well Darrin download
the new terminal emulator and hopefully
it's fun isn't broken all right I've
taking a quick break to download a
better terminal emulator than the one
that was crashing on me surprisingly its
name is better terminal emulator and
we're going to see just how good it is
because I'm here and you notice I have a
dollar sign because I'm just my user and
right sooo not sure how well that's
going to come out and I get a su request
that this process would like to run as
root and I'm gonna say allow and oh my
gosh check that out is that a dollar
sign or is that a pound yeah that's a
pound so i can actually if config or IW
config whoops IQ config i need an IQ
config right now um yeah I'm gonna have
to figure out what it is available to me
now here's what i do now i know that i
can now download applications from the
marketplace that require root access and
that is exciting because there are
plenty of those that can do fun things
such as regular applications couldn't
i'm not sure what I'm gonna really be
able to do in the terminal yet but just
justice means that i haven't the bit
more wine that just means that i haven't
done enough research but you know i will
see here soon because now that
I've got root I'm going to want to start
having all sorts of mysterious fun with
it very cool yes so hurry my phone
didn't break oh thank god and and I
survived and I'm in one piece and I have
root and so this means that you guys
have been rocking Android for longer
than what have I been on this thing for
a week now yeah something you know me
your suggestions for root applications
to play with because I yeah I could apt
to get there you go I don't know if it
has apt but maybe there's another
repository of some sort and the phone
just went blank anyway I'll deal with
that later so that is reading enjoyed
and I do need to give mad props to the
developers that made this happen that's
in beam xenyx virtue MJ x m j XG and
kind of gin cyanogen cyanogen one of
those alldroid org is the place to find
the details on that as well as our show
know to have fat org and yeah there we
go so we have it rooted cool soon as we
got the show I am totally with
oh my gosh he's not gonna put his phone
down he's gonna be like me on his phone
oh this is terrible alright cuz you you
rid of your iphone as well yeah I did oh
now I need to run passwd oh yeah yeah
yeahs need to get that done for work for
installation yeah there we go like the
first thing I learned how to do yeah
okay do you want to move on to our
question we haven't done one question
before we get out of this running so
long let's get the question done yeah
the question is Nicholas wrote in in he
asked while he did say thank you for all
you do yay and his question is does the
Zipit hack work with the original Zipit
I found it to be more cost affordable
but it cannot find any specs Nicholas
that is a good question and if you can
still find an original zip it might be
cost effective solution for your hacking
desires however we should point out that
is not nearly as powerful as the Z to
which you can get for about 50 bucks so
you can afford to spring for it the z2
is really where it's at a place where
you can find the information about some
of the details to software the unlocking
and fun stuff like that would be a linux
org slash zip it there you can find the
deck tech details where you will know
that it only has two Meg's of flash 16
megs of ram and a sad sad 90 megahertz
iris processor I realize that they were
still making processors there you go um
it's gotten agree or I'm sorry eh yeah
Aguirre however you pronounce that Wi-Fi
chip I'm not sure what that means as far
as like injection or anything like that
is concerned but yes you can actually go
ahead and mod it you can get some
software for you can unlock it the full
info all the stuff you want to find out
is at a linux org slash zip it if we had
an original we'd probably have to hear
too but yeah but who wants to run doom
grayscale yeah that's the big that's the
other big drawback it's 320 x 240 mm-hmm
four colors gray scale or shades of grey
yeah I like my color sometimes hacking
is shades of grey oh I know I'm gonna
stop over it way ahead and we should
probably get out of here before I finish
this yeah we probably should slow down
yes but don't we have some excellent
people to pimp because our rifles I mean
our friends in there yeah you know it
needs to be you know it needs to be uh
Patrick and Veronica versus Darren and
Shannon go head-to-head you know we need
to cross over show now like smash
brothers that's what we need to do so
much fun nothing we might be able to oh
yeah but if you guys don't know we're
talking about we're talking about
