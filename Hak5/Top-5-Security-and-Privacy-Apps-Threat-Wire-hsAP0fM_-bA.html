up now on threat wire greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for Tuesday January 10 2016
fYI my voice is totally shot I went to
CES last week and I'm like out of voice
so if it sounds funny that's why this is
your summary of threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom patrons
over at patreon.com slash threat wire we
have reached our goal for a video RSS
whoa I am freakin stoked about this so
we are going to start the video RSS
within the next week or so
I did just get back from CES last week
and I am heading to the shmoocon hacker
conference tomorrow we also have a pen
test with hack 5 training tomorrow so I
will probably start the new feed right
after that
thank you again patrons you made this
possible this is so so cool this week I
am sharing a roundup of excellent
security apps and privacy apps or
software picks to help you make your
life more secure in the new year I asked
you in early December via Twitter at
snubs for your favorite security and
privacy apps these are the top 5
security apps or topics in general that
you should probably start using ASAP
number 5 is signal signal is an iOS and
Android app that is made by open whisper
systems and is the leader in private
conversations via mobile the app is free
and open source phone calls are
encrypted end-to-end via the app as well
as text messages in recent years video
photo animated gifs or gifts stickers
doodles as well as group messages have
all been implemented while still using
cryptographic protocols and very strong
ones at that to keep anyone from seeing
your messages except for the intended
recipient and best yet signal is so easy
to use so anybody in the family can use
it
it just replaces your normal texting app
and that's about it it's so easy
number four is two-factor authentication
apps specifically you guys recommended
Google Authenticator or offi Google
Authenticator is a free app from Google
that gives you 2fa at your
your tips in your smartphone so this
basically means that you'll get a
special code whenever you want to log in
to a site along with your usual username
and password so for example if somebody
gets your password from some kind of
hacked on some site and then tries to
log in they would still you need your
two-factor authentication code along
with it so they would kind of be stuck
when you go to a website that uses
two-factor authentication and it is
enabled you can either scan a QR code or
you can enter a code to add that account
to your Google Authenticator app once
accounts are added any time you log in
to them you'll open the app and then
enter the code on your screen and that
code will refresh over several seconds
protip for Google Authenticator make
sure to print out your Google account
backup codes in there ten of them just
in case you lose your phone Google auth
doesn't do any kind of server backup so
you would be pretty much Sol if you
don't have a way to access your accounts
of--they is another free option for 2fa
codes and works just basically the same
as Google Authenticator for any logins
that it supports avi is cross-platform
though so it also works with desktops
and it allows you to do an encrypted
backup to the cloud in case you lose
your phone so you won't lose access to
any of your accounts but this is turned
off by default keep in mind those these
are not open-source but a two-factor
authentication app for code generation
is better than SMS text if available
through a website since text can be
easily man in the middle you can find a
huge list of 2fa supported websites over
at two-factor off org and I'll link that
down in the show notes along with all
the ones that currently don't support it
and you can tweet them and tell them
that they really really should number
three is secure email like protonmail or
PGP protonmail went open-source in 2015
and it is a mail service provider out of
switzerland that totes security before
anything else it is free and available
on iOS Android and in the browser
they have intend encryption and they
don't require any personal kind of
details to sign up for an account free
accounts allow up to 500 Meg's of
storage but for 4 euro or more you can
get 5 gigs of storage and custom domains
PGP on the other hand stands for pretty
good privacy
it is an encryption technique popular
amongst techies for email it scrambles
your emails into garbled text that can
be decrypted with a very unique code
that only the receiver has now while it
sounds complicated companies like
Melville open key-based IO have made it
super super easy to implement even if
you still use an email provider like
gmail hotmail or yahoo ooh yahoo mail
Volokh is a browser add-on that can
encrypt your emails in the browser in
key-based io is a website and a command
line interface app that pairs your
social network accounts with your public
key so people know that it's really you
that they're sending encrypted messages
to each PGP key only works with one
email so if you have a work email and a
home one you will need to keep airs
number two is a password app like key
pass or LastPass to manage your
passwords a password manager generally
just stores all of your random passwords
into an encrypted safe that you have the
key to and only need to remember a
master password to get into that safe at
any time and anytime you visit a site
stored in the manager it will autofill
it for you or at least the really good
one should and you will need to unlock
your safe and copy and paste that stored
password into the site to log in if it
does not autofill for you
now key pass is probably the number one
choice among security professionals and
it is the one that you mostly
recommended but it's not the one that I
use mainly because of convenience key
pass is available for test ops and it
does have ports available to use on
smart phones as well key pass is open
source it's free and it allows you to
generate random passwords in the app and
the newest version was just released I
believe yesterday fixing a few bugs and
making some updates now while it is not
as automated as some of the other ones
key pass is probably the most trusted
LastPass is the one that I use and now
the free version is probably perfectly
fine for most folks
LastPass works similarly to key pass and
that it stores passwords in a vault you
have a master password to access them it
can auto generate new passwords and the
app is free it also has a browser
extension mobile apps and two-factor
authentication support so you can login
not only with a master password but also
with a two-factor authentication code
that you
on your phone with one of those other
apps that I mentioned last pass also
automatically detects password changes
or new logins to store in the app but
keep in mind it is not open source and
it has had some security issues in the
past though all problems have
immediately been resolved both keep s
and LastPass allow you to use a
different password for every single site
that you use without fear for getting
any of them and number one is a VPN
before starting on picks for VPN
providers definitely check out that one
privacy site net and his round ups of
VPN providers and their privacy terms
some are more private than others for
example some may log your IP address or
other data or require a credit card to
sign up with an account open VPN is a
VPN with SSL support that uses the SSL
TLS protocol it's not a web application
or an app and it does require quite a
bit of setup to work correctly along
with a download of their software while
it is tougher to set up than some
applications available on the Internet's
for VPN providers Open VPN can be used
with third-party clients that offer up
really easy-to-use graphical user
interfaces if the name didn't give it
away already open VPN is also open
source which is always a good thing
P ia VPN which stands for private
Internet access is a low cost
alternative VPN starting at 3:33 per
month and up you can pay with Bitcoin or
gift card for an additional layer or
privacy and security and they don't log
your traffic PIAA is easy to set up and
use by downloading an app on your Mac
Windows or Linux PC plus they are also
available on iOS and Android another
site that I want to recommend is privacy
tools dot IO they have a ton of more
privacy tools that you can use right now
to make your life more private and more
secure the best part is most of these
are very consumer friendly and they are
almost all of them are free now while my
roundup didn't include all the different
apps in the world that you can download
like SpiderOak and tor and privacy
badger and HTTPS Everywhere it's
cyberghost and malwarebytes and you
block origins and brave browser and
DuckDuckGo and three mind veracrypt in
cubes OS and tail
at open wrt and all the other apps that
are made with security as their main
focus and main concern
don't worry have probably already
reviewed all of them and there is a
website out there called hack 5 that has
all of my reviews on it so definitely
check it out before commenting below
that I forgot one because I already know
about it the first few should get you
started outright for 2017 and these were
your recommendations as well as mine as
with any apps use your own judgement
when it comes to choosing what's best
for you because I what works for me may
not work for you while the most secure
choice may work for you it might not
work as well for your grandma and if
it's not consumer friendly she's
probably not going to use it and I would
argue that anything is better than using
no security at all thank you again for
