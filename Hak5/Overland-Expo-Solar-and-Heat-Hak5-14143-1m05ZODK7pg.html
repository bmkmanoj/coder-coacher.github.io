the Ben Heck show the buddy heater is
the world's only patented endorse a
propane heater has an oxygen depletion
sensor in it and the idea is before the
lack of oxygen could kill you from the
propane eating it up it'll actually turn
the unit off making it safe yeah that's
what I heard is you can't run from a
meter inside exactly yeah even like your
Coleman heaters the little catalytic
heaters are actually being stricken from
the code is being indoor safe because
even though they produce such a small
amount of carbon dioxide or carbon
monoxide they still kill people intense
so those will no longer be indoor safe
in America this will be the only indoor
say what makes it work is what we call
an OD s which is an oxygen depletion
sensor and it's basically built inside
of this piece which is the pilot and
what happens is when flame is seeking
oxygen oxygens here the flame comes up
to seek it eventually it disconnects
from the pilot and that turns the entire
unit off so it usually happens exactly
until it's an alive and sweet but yeah
it usually happens at about a 1%
difference in oxygen so the person would
never even know that the oxygen level
has gone down it's such a minor amount
that it can detect that it will pop off
each one so how would you safely
say you know vehicle or attempt yeah now
mr. heater always recommends that you
keep a window open you have proper
ventilation you have a little bit air
flow in there again it is indoor safe so
it's designed to turn it off but we
don't want that we want you to be able
to use it all night long if you have to
this propane cylinder will typically
last you about two hours on high for
hours on low so if you're running it on
low which believe me if you're in a
small area low will be fine these things
get really high well what kind of BTU
output am I expecting from on high 9000
on low for things you just got your
sweat will be your time so some of our
other products mr. heater is the heating
division obviously and then base camp is
our camping division we do a fridge
freezer that has a bunch of different
little features on it it has a remote
readout so you can plug it into the
front and I'll actually tell you the
voltage on your battery as well as the
internal temperature of the stuff inside
exactly you can run it AC or DC it's got
three different battery cutout levels so
you can adjust it from on the high
eleven point eight ten point seven or
ten even when it gets there it'll turn
off so won't drain your battery it'll go
from negative eight it's at about fifty
degrees so you can use it as a freezer
or refrigerator we do a washing machine
for your cabins so you can run it
turn it on rinse them with this so you
drop that yeah drain it refill it and
then turn it back on to rinse it our
biggest product from the camping line is
the hot water shower and on the opposite
side we have free showers set up for
everybody the way this works is it has
an internal battery it'll run 40 minutes
on the battery alone hit your power
button on make sure it's coming out of
your showerhead because you could also
use it as a sink if you want it to hit
start you'll see the water come on and
then you'll see the burner light it's
gonna jump up pretty rapidly yep so and
then you can actually read here the
different temperature outputs with the
Sun it might be hard but this is your
internal temperature and that's the
outlet temperature yep
eight gallons per minute and some yeah
so if you want to go a little bit higher
more pressure you can come here you can
dial it down on here so on your sink
output you can dial it down to about
four so if you want it a little bit
hotter it's about four it's like sport
six and then the last thing is a safety
feature you can turn the water on and
off here but what happens is it turns
the burner off so instead of the
pressure building up and superheating
and blowing out when you turn it back on
you don't have super hot water and it
will light the burner again for you this
is an hour on here it's an 18,000 BTU so
you get an hour on this cylinder and 40
minutes on the battery and so all of
these that work on sensitive the buddy
is elevation sensitive it's only
elevation sensitive because of the
oxygen depletion sensor as you go higher
in elevation there's less oxygen so that
flame will go up trying to seek it and
it'll kick it off depends on the oxygen
quality too so if you're in a place like
say Denver that tie it'll go off but if
you're in a place like Jackson Hole
where he got pretty clean air you'll
still be able to use it a lot of times
so there's some give-and-take there you
can find it at mister heater com thank
you it's good meeting you good luck on
your journey
join modding wizard Ben Heck and friends
as they bill to modify a host of amazing
community inspired creations be sure to
watch new episodes of the Ben Heck show
each week right here at revision3.com
slash t bh s in the latest episode of
the Ben Heck show Ben shows viewers how
to create an automated doggy treat
dispenser I'm totally using that for my
cats now don't forget to go to
element14.com / t BHS to find out how
you can enter to win Ben's ultimate
gaming system as well as other builds
from the show yeah we're gold zero and
we started from a humanitarian
in thrust we our owner actually started
goal zero when he went to the Congo to
try to bring some light and power to the
people over there
I didn't find any any solutions we'll
need it so we came back at the start at
goal zero to bring power to the Congo to
other parts of the world and also from
disaster relief what is the target
market for gold zero is basically
anybody who needs portable power
we got photographers we got medical we
got you know third-world Preppers you
know ham radio CPAP campers hunters
hikers anybody who needs some power when
there's like what are some of your most
popular we'll start with the Nomad seven
Nomad 7 is is this a small foldable
power solar panel and from there you can
collect the power you can charge your
phone and directly to the panel or you
can store it in a few of our smaller
power packs we have the note we have the
guide tents which allows you to store
that power and then plug in your phone
later when it's most convenient for you
you can also pop out the batteries and
use those double A's and other devices
that yeah yeah we have what we call the
switch eight it has eight watt hours of
power which will take your smartphone
all the way to full it has removable
caps from the ends and you can swap
those out for other tips and as time
goes on we're going to be releasing
other kinds of light bands flashlights
fans things like that right now it's
just USB right now it's just for phones
okay and so what kind of how would you
get out of the battery you get like 1
a.m. or 2 amps you get one-and-a-half
amps out of the switch alright so not
enough for an iPad but you know
it'll give an I've had a nice kick about
20% okay and so what are the this is
just portable yeah you get about 10 watt
hours out of the guy 10 and 8 1 hours
out of the switch so these these really
they just 7 panel here is really at
maybe one of these two what kind of
charging time would you expect to bring
one of these from zero all the way up
you can charge the guy ten in about two
to three hours depending on on the
conditions technology is actually used
in this portable panel here is this
Morpheus a mono
this is mono crystalline the same is in
our rigid panels has just been adapted
for a foldable format and so what kind
of challenges do you get and as far as
designing a product with you know those
mono panels in well we have to make sure
that it's mounted to a substrate that
doesn't allow the crystals to crack so
they're very durable we've run over them
we've stopped on them and they still
collect light over yeah we have we've
done everything we've soaked them in the
creek we've done everything we can to
test them and they keep working they're
even even when it's a little overcast we
get we get like going in there and
charging under study so the amount of
course in session it's an efficiency
rating somewhere around what about 17 to
20 percent right around there does
collect store news so we've talked about
the phone applications we also have a
step up from there which is a pack
called the Sherpa 50 volt and that lets
you click power from a bigger panel
after the plug in your laptop directly
into there
and unless you gives you another 45 to
two-hour boost to your laptop that's
twice as big as the Nomad stuff and it's
called a nomad 13 and it it's just it's
got a bigger footprint charges it up
faster yes they chained together we've
always put them all on a Ana system
where you can move it modular you can
chain them together and just is going to
charge that same battery pack and from
the 13 watt panel we can step up to a 27
watt panel and those can chain into the
system oh yeah it folds out too big
we have designs for a 90 watt panel
which folds out that would be something
you could deploy a like on a on a trip
run you know you can't think whatever
and you can charge up the larger power
packs we like to keep everything in watt
hours it's a good way to compare apples
to apples we've talked about the guide
10 and we talked about the Sherpa 50
well this is called a Yeti 150 and it's
been beat up it's a prototype but we
have it set up here as a phone charging
station for the people here at Overland
and this will give you 150 watt hours of
power it's got the AC port the USB and
some 12-volt options to allow you to
charge all your devices so 150 watt
hours of 12 volts 150 watt hours of
total power available through AC or
through 12 okay so 110 12 or USB USB for
five yes awesome and what are the kind
of bigger panels you can put on this
well this will charge up off of a
boulder 30 let me show you those here we
have an array of 430 watt solar panels
they chain together giving you 120 watts
of power
what's the footprint on that it's about
I don't know 36 by 40 guessing and so
how do these guys connect together well
I think that we've loaned out our cables
to some of our friends here at the show
but basically the cables come from one
output into the next panels input and
then from out to in and and so forth
until the final panel you plug straight
into your power pack whether it's the
150 or the other power picks so you're
always running the panels in series
correct okay and so what about the
batteries can you run the batteries in
parallel yes we have batteries that have
a chaining port on them so if you find
out nibs like our 350 Xtreme 350 battery
pack isn't enough for your needs you can
chain that into another 350 up to a
certain number where you can quadruple
your power how big does it get as far as
batteries are concerned what do you mean
happen what's your biggest battery
biggest battery we have is this Yeti
1250 and this is some serious power it's
got a hundred amp hour battery inside
1500 watt inverter geeks at 3,000 watts
has pure sine-wave
three wall outlets three USBs has got
some 12-volt options and an Anderson
report output for higher demand that
allows you to input to two of our eight
millimeter force we have a larger
anderson port from here you can chain
that into other 12-volt batteries or
into another Yeti so even if you just
brought your own like a GM's and then
use this as the this is kind of the user
interface of your battery bank and you
can just chain other batteries alongside
behind it
and then you just add power as you need
it so the idea here is I never have to
think about red and black wires I don't
have to think about all of the different
components
battery my charge controller my panels
my inverter you've got all of that in
the box
yeah well that you throw some panels on
you're done right art our whole theory
is if you plug it in and if it fits you
did it right and it's gonna work for you
