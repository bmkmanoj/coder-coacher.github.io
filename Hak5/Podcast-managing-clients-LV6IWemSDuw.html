got two monsters following you I like
she started reading his email savoriness
lutz key for geek entertainment there's
some that have 700 the most i do eww
this is the TV anything good on it too
everything's good on man and if I
thought I'd see the day 300 channels
it's all good 300 channels of white
Odile TV command and open alpha
diggnation holy crap yeah this is
amazing dude you're dreaming no dude
it's amazing no you're dreaming huh
you're dreaming d you're dreaming d hmm
d Grayman what your dream what you're
dreaming I'm awake you were dreaming
you're you're like some random babbling
about a light diggnation and command and
being on TV oh I was thinking about that
segment with those applications oh
that's right yeah are we still shooting
yeah yeah yeah all right let's get on
set now yeah yeah go clean yourself up
Spanky ok so the opening to this whole
sequence you know this whole segment
completely fictitious complete
dramatization it's nice thought it is
300 channels but no there's nothing good
at least on TV young terrestrial TV yeah
but it's actually not far off no I mean
you think if you've got a media center
pc or if you've got some way to get your
content from your pc over to TV and
you've got a couple of applications that
will help you subscribe to video online
or channels online you know who needs
cable at that point now really you can
if you can pipe all your video you know
back out to a TV or something right so
there's three applications that i want
to take a look at that will allow you to
easily subscribe to video content online
first of course being iTunes we're all
familiar with itunes probably it's got a
podcast directory which also does video
it's not really the best in terms of
video podcasts because it just kind of
has like a featured video podcast list
there's only about five pages that I
know maybe about a hundred right
definitely not everything there are a
lot more video content in itunes podcast
directory but you really have to go
hunting for it so it's not
got a bit of shuffle around for podcasts
it's great love it yeah but it doesn't
handle the video as well as it really
shut because you had to kind of make the
video work I think it's right you know
well what's nice about it though is it's
rock solid it will accept external links
so if there's an online TV show that you
like to watch that's not in the iTunes
directory you can always just add it in
yourself and it will automatically
download those that's all it'll also
sync with your video with ipod by your
with ipod video with ipod ipod with
video that's the one I always try to
call the you i pod but it's alright ants
the ipod were three yes so waiting for
the sixteen by nine but anyway downsides
of course it only handles direct
downloads HTTP right that we don't we
don't like that that much it's nice that
we can track the numbers but at the same
time it kills those in bandwidth yeah
well now libsyn is kind of that's
helping out a lot the other downside is
it doesn't have a nice way to manage all
of those downloads they don't hardly
loaded in hard drives going to fill up
yeah it's a couple other players i'm
going to say now there's some
alternatives there are some alternatives
first being fire ant it's in release
candidate one stage right now so you can
kind of call it a beta if you want it's
really nice it's got an integrated
channel guide which is really cool
that's one of the main features that i
like just to clarify things channels or
RSS feeds channels or RSS feed and then
just basically video podcasts yeah IPTV
vignettes what and intuitively they have
been subdivided into categories tags
it's really nice the way they do it you
can take a look at channels by top rated
you know the most-watched you can check
out what's you know what's new channels
it's got an automated system for popular
tags as you can see it's like your basic
tag cloud where you know the more
popular the bigger the fall yeah
boldface font hot you know and i really
like the way that it's got this ability
to stream video so if you find some
example it yeah if you find a video
kapag cast you like take a look what it
looks interesting to you're like hmm
sample it oh this is really cool and
then subscribe to the RSS
and it'll do the automatic downloading
it's got a built-in player it'll
automatically deletes stuff after a
certain amount of days awesome it's not
rock solid yet but it's it's doing okay
and I think it's going to you know
progress from here this one is for both
PC and actually all of these that we're
going to talk about or for both windows
and let's not call PC because Windows
and Windows and Mac right yet this one
also has a really cool feature where it
will sync with portable devices such as
you or what did I call it you called
video guide video with ipod video with I
5x for Microsoft it'll also it allows to
sync with the PSP which is really cool
nyame if the if the video format is not
in PSP friendly format it will encode
for you yeah using ffmpeg it's not a
hundred percent yet but it does a good
job indoors yeah I mean there's also
other good encoders if you want to do it
manually there's video or has a nice set
of tools that allow you actually use
that yeah we use the video i put is the
video or a video or use video or ipod
converter yeah yeah and they've also got
a PSP converter really nice nice now one
of the things i noticed about this is
the very very nice web interface in fact
you can get to it from your website you
don't actually need the client ok well
that's really nice you know if you're on
a lot of remote computers but i'm saying
you know when you're actually running
your own relational client but the idea
is to set these up let them own
background to subscribe to your channels
and pull them down so you don't have to
think about it right so let's move on to
the other player which is from the
participatory culture foundation I said
that right yeah that's the same people
that brought us blog torrent broadcast
machine and more recently video bomb
which is kind of like a dig for Vegas
I've seen it before this was originally
called DTV but they renamed it when it
came out for the for windows just
recently and democracy it's a no point
eight right now which kind of shows
little more buggy than fire in it's a
little bit more buggy at this point but
it's also open source no that means that
means it's going to be the first to also
go to unix linux bsd toasters toast or
whatever microwave
if it runs linux yeah i think our
refrigerator runs linux sure why not
buddy that's a good Mon but it's not
you'd say that yeah it's not evil it is
not even so it this has got a really
nifty channel guide that looks very
similar to the one in itunes to say this
is very I i tuned reminiscent right it
doesn't have an automated tags kinda a
well it doesn't have the tag cloud but
it doesn't have the popular tags here we
can head over to technology see that
there's 16 technology podcasts in your
video podcast I'm not sure what a goal
you know and you can check out a site or
you know if you see something you like
you can click this it'll subscribe to it
okay it's also got a really nifty player
where it will go fullscreen no matter
what you know by the codec or father's
day is exactly well that's nice that's a
really really nice yeah sure um and it
doesn't doesn't sync with any of the
player or portable players yet yeah but
if it's also open source stuff yeah so
maybe later they've paid somebody else
you know my program program that in but
there's a you know if you have a
portable player anyway you you can do
that man well if you really really want
yeah I mean that's what I do is I just
well the cool thing about both of these
is that they have a channel guide which
will expose you to a lot of content like
I didn't even know there were 300
different vid casts out there so I made
a lot of them are V logs or vlogs video
blogs yeah whatever yeah and those are
cool and I suggest you check out either
of these because it's got an extensive
directory or you could just do what I do
and that is go to a bunch of favorited
tabs bookmarks and downloading yourself
and the hard drive fills up and you got
to manually delete them Manuel Manuel
Manuel and the advantage to these client
type programs like I like to use a male
client and this is to me is like having
a male client does the work for you yeah
it does all the work for you and plus
you can subscribe to the RSS feeds so
that you know you're always checking out
the same side over and over wait for an
update yeah just like okay where's it
coming so you know like some some shows
that you know only release once a month
that 10
you know maybe really some bonus
material through service Lee you might
want to consider subscribing to our RSS
feed because hey we release on the 5th
but every now and then there's extra
content point 5 episode specials as
specials for your holiday just like that
yeah so you know that to me this is the
way to go so check them out you know mol
them over if you like amuse them if you
don't add let us know about your
experiences with both a fire ant and
democracy player give us some feedback
you know just tell us what you think
yeah so other than that thanks a lot and
enjoy the rest of the show action d you
dreaming what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
