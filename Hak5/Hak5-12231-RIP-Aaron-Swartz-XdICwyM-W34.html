by goto assists hello and welcome to a
very shaky camera episode of hak5 my
name is darren kitchen to weekly dose of
technol west and this is probably one of
the most difficult shows I've had to do
in a while I'm really not feeling this
episode but it's after hours it's the
weekend I'm shooting this solo I'm kind
of going for a little bit of a hike here
and thought i would i would talk about
Aaron I know it's been all over the news
in fact I covered it on threat wire I'm
gonna air some of that here so anyway I
guess it's good enough places any really
uh I've been really distraught about the
news and i know i've covered in detail
and i know it's been all over the news
but you know we've just suffered a great
loss because erin was a hero among
hackers and you know he fought so much
for Internet freedom kind of the poster
child of you know the SOPA and PIPA
resistance and you know I was just
recently lucky enough to attend the eff
Internet freedom day event here on
January 18th in san francisco and and
got to hear from aaron's friends and I
max I'm pretty sad that I'm going to be
missing the internet archive memorial on
january 24 this Thursday in San
Francisco so i guess i'll give you a
heads up if you're in the bay area and
can make it to that but you know i'm
just sad that we've lost one of our own
because i didn't expect us you know I
never expected to have to deal with this
on this show too
you know like we've lost people in
technology you know like exceed jobs but
I don't know for some reason that the
hacker culture is so the community is so
new and so young and erin was so young
like our age and I you know we still
have like figures with us like Captain
Crunch even you know so this was really
unexpected and I know we've all lost and
we're going to continue to it's just you
know and God knows I've dealt with my
own grief but I just never expected
these worlds to collide so I guess what
I'm saying you know is that my heart
goes out to the family of Aaron Schwartz
and and and their friends and that I
hope that we can all take something from
this and do something positive with that
energy because you know it's really easy
especially as hackers especially as
geeks to become insular to you know shut
the proverbial computer room door and
not have to do deal with this but the
reality of the situation is you
eventually have to and so I know that
this isn't the episode of hak5 you were
expecting to tune into and it's really
easy to just close this video and not
think about this but at a certain point
it's going to come up and you'll have to
deal with it no matter what and so you
know I just think that we owe it to
aaron to to continue to fight you know
for it for Internet freedom for for all
of the things they believed in and I
guess what I'm saying is don't be alone
in this so you know whether it's the the
forums or IRC or even if you're just
going to find your local hackerspace
you're going to find like-minded people
who are feeling the same way and just
feel free to speak from your heart don't
be afraid to do that and you know grief
takes many different forms and it's been
a reoccurring event in my life I just
I've just know that no matter how it
manifests itself and how you end up
dealing with it the one thing that's for
sure is that being around good friends
will always help no matter what and I've
met a lot of you guys on my travels and
hackers are like the best people ever no
joke I mean I don't think I've ever been
wronged by a hacker really this
community is like full of the nicest
people in the world and so you know seek
them out and I in my travels meeting you
guys I just I don't know I just wish
that I could give the entire internet a
hug right now so yeah that's that's my a
block this area may look familiar to
anybody that's has a hak5 challenge coin
so I'm going to keep hiking a little bit
and keep testing out this new gear and
it's just kind of watch the sunset here
over San Francisco so so yeah that's my
a block I really really really wish I
didn't have to do an episode this week
even more so wish i didn't have even if
I did have to do episode wish I didn't
have to do sponsors on this so there
will be some ads I guess that's just the
name of the game i'm sure my sponsors
don't like hearing that no offense guys
just not really feeling like this is the
episode that I want it to be or that
that I wish that we had to shoot and so
therefore whatever I'm just rambling at
this point I just I just hope that you
guys know that you can always email
feedback at hak5 dot org that goes to
the whole team or if you just want to
email
darren hak5 org I'll listen and we're
going to take a quick break and then
I've got a conversation with Declan
McCullough from cnet and I'm going to
end with a snippet from this week's
episode of threat wire and then we'll be
back in studio next week with regular
stuff I'm going to be talking a lot
about VPNs about public key encryption
going to be going to going around the
world here real soon so we're going to
be talking about that okay I'll see you
guys on the other side and thanks
