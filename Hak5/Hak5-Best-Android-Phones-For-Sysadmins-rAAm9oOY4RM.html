by t-mobile as you guys know we are big
fans of checking what are you doing
checking port 110 I just make the joke
about us popping our mail because you
guys send us emails we answer them and
you're just being a freak again yeah I
had peeps lots of them okay so can I do
something about this can't like yeah
alright peeps Oh peeps what do you think
I said nevermind let's get into the
emails what's your email sugar okay fine
td8 f/4l how do you say that name to ten
eight four four matter no Ted eight fur
said I'm going to be practicing
answering pretty stupid to buffer
preferably one with a QWERTY keyboard of
course
any suggestions about a model that you
guys may have researched I'm going to be
using it for similar purposes tethered
Wi-Fi pineapple serving out pancakes
except with a different router than what
I wanted I saw Darren had the Galaxy 551
would you recommend it as a solid phone
has speed or memory limited you and the
things that you've wanted to do such as
VNC telnet SSH and other fun stuff I
have a budget of about 500 bucks well
yeah but I am veering towards the galaxy
phone because of the nice price okay
well VNC SSH that kind of fun stuff no
problems whatsoever
it's everything else that annoys the
crap out of me with this phone but then
again like like any phone after a while
the honeymoons over
I don't know at least that's been my
experience before this my android phone
was just the original Droid but if
you're buying a Android phone for a
keyboard you're that special use case
you're that person that wants to drop
into a shell and in that sense I love
this keyboard because you know right
here I've got I got Tilda I've got
backslash I got pipe I got colon I get
semicolon I got like all of the special
characters that you need like try
finding a pipe say you know pull out
your iPhone and I want you to type in a
pipe without going through like six
menus first right so the keyboard is not
bad I think if that's
use case then comes down to the specs I
would also check to make sure that it's
gonna be easy to route background moves
sorry yeah well that's what happens I
think this thing is slow it's gimped
it's my experience with it's been crap
as far as the updates are concerned if
you're gonna run your own rom maybe
that's not going to be that much of an
issue for you I have had good success
with my bug this beast and and
CyanogenMod but other than that I gotta
say like the only phone that I was
thinking about who maybe is the Droid 3
it's got an improved keyboard yeah yeah
it's got an improved keyboard I don't
know after having gone to the Samsung
keyboard now I like this but yeah that's
what's up I mean if you're going to be
doing it but no to answer your question
this particular phone haven't had any
problems doing SSH VNC remote desktop
any of that fun stuff it did rui-zi i do
have the Wi-Fi tether on here and in
that sense it runs great it's just that
you know it can be slow at times you to
hack my phone again so I can tether yeah
Benjamin d wrote I love your show Thank
You Ben however I noticed that you say
backslash us our yeah users please it us
also really means UNIX system resources
you know this is so funny because this
is a repeat of season 7 when I realized
that and for some reason I am in the
horrible habit of saying user when I
mean slash USR instead of UNIX system
resource or there's a couple other
generic basically that's like a
backronym though I don't know if it
originally was supposed to mean user and
then later they were like no that's
about idea user and slash home or
whatever the the architecture or the
hierarchy changes based on distro and it
can get a little confusing and yes I
have the problem where I always say user
what I mean
I'm not gonna stop and see I'll just say
USR USSR
