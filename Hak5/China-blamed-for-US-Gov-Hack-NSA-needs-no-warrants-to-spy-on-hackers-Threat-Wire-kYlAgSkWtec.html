government data breach the NSA doesn't
need warrants spy on hackers and Edward
Snowden celebrates two years being
whistleblower all that coming up now on
threat liar I'm Darren kitchen and this
is threat wire for Friday june fifth
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
and with that let's get started because
you know in what is being described as
the biggest government data breach ever
US officials are now pointing the finger
at China the hack that impacted the
personnel records of some four million
people are currently under investigation
by the FBI and while the agency hasn't
made any official accusation comments
from officials and well definitely the
headlines are pointing fingers at China
an FBI spokesman said the agency quote
will continue to investigate and hold
accountable those who pose a threat in
cyberspace meanwhile the Chinese foreign
ministry spokesman said quote China
itself is a victim of cyber attacks more
Snowden leaks and with the latest memos
we learned that the NSA was secretly
authorized to monitor domestic Internet
activity for signs of foreign hackers
and in one of the leaked documents is
actually said that the NSA monitors
various choke points there's a lot of
references to prism and that the data is
then shared with the FBI at Quantico and
while originally the investigation was
to focus on hacking attempts from
foreign governments there's a 2012 memo
that describes the NSA if having
requested the right to monitor anyone
being described as a hacker I don't know
about you but I'm sure as hell on that
list and so two or many of people who
may write code or identify themselves
with the hacker culture and the NSA made
a public statement last year confirming
that it does in fact have section 7 or
two approval from FISA courts to
investigate quote cybersecurity targets
well it's actually pretty unknown what
exactly the NSA defines as a hacker how
do you define hacker now before i go i
do want to point out that there is an
epic piece in The New York Times written
by none other than Edward Snowden on his
two-year anniversary of becoming a
whistleblower it's way more than I can
even begin to paraphrase here but
suffice it to say it says that the
that the world is a much better place
today having acknowledged the
surveillance state that we've secretly
foster this in a post-911 world and you
know how much good has actually come of
that what do you guys think has a lot of
good come from this there are links in
the description below and there will
also be a discussion on the matter on
this week's a daily tech news show with
Tom Merritt a link to that as well if
that tickles your technical us now with
that I want to give a huge thanks to all
of our supporters who have helped
relaunch the show and if you can spare a
