sail university can you hear me you can
ok cool so imagine this me and you have
a place to go where we can talk
completely privately it's real up in the
cloud who are you talking to well be the
internets who invited the Internet well
I did Oh No Paulding Oh lemon on Paul
what is this now we're doing so we are
going to be talking amongst ourselves up
in the cloud secretly would like this
already Oh via kind of like open SSH
type thing hmm with this program called
talk I'll talk d mmm freakin Damon's yay
 demons oh they're so so imagine
like you have something really important
that you need to say somebody say to
someone and maybe you don't have laptop
so you guys go to a really loud bar
somewhere you sit in that really far
back you know that little the booth so
little booth in the back corner where
there's like no lights that actually hit
it and you talk privately amongst
yourselves but if you have two computers
with linux ubuntu on them or well any
linux actually yes distro you can talk
amongst each other with this program
called talk that is completely in the
terminal it's like your own little chat
room like this it's it's between you two
it's the it's the computer equivalent of
getting in the shower with your buddy to
talk yes yes sure but you know what I'm
saying like so we're gonna be using SSH
for this yes SSH is secure now when I
think like secured like you and I
speaking securely I think like oh let's
exchange public and private keys rights
get our gpg on you don't have to do
anything it's you're saying let's meet
somewhere and then just talk there meet
me halfway yeah exactly so first thing
you have to do to be able to access this
is add a new user on your linux machine
so for example i wanted to add darren as
a new user so i would do so
add user and then Darren and I'd have to
put in my password Oh what is my
password oh I think that's my password
yes sounds good and then I'll give you a
password so what do you want your
password to be oh you're going to use to
access my IP address I would like it to
be 13 2 p 1 32 are 13 2 b's and boy huh
13 2 r's and Ralph sure ok 13 to be 132
are cool updated successfully and then
you put in a bunch of information full
name room number work phone just sponge
crap it doesn't really matter
information connect correct yes yes it
is ok so it's really easy to add a new
user as usual on any Linux machine and
then I want to have Darren ssh into my
machines IP address you'd be using
openssh so first off if you don't have
that of course apt-get install openssh
server on my machine so we've already
done that yeah so I already did that
part thank God and then after that we
install this program called talk d and
we also install talk which is basically
the same equivalent what about on my
computer what do I have to install all
you have to do is pull up my IP address
with ssh and login so i don't need to
install talk it or anything cuz im just
gonna be doing it from your machine
that's brilliant i love it because my
machine is going to be thinking that
you're just another user that's using
the same actually actual mechanical you
know my vice my first dial up BBS back
in the 90s used this exact program so
you can talk to the sis op I'm not
joking like weed yeah you get dial-up
you'd also get a shell account like two
megabytes of web space that's the last
tilde aardwolf oh and uh and yeah that
is this is an oldie but a goodie okay so
it is once I have talked and talked d
installed on my machine how do I get
onto your machine so we can talk about
so first you need to figure out whatever
my IP address and i can find that out
with i have config
and I just look for the eth one address
so my address is 10 dot 733 160 okay so
I'm just gonna ssh to Darren at that IP
address yes i'm going to enter in what
did I see my password was 13 to be 132
are ya for wherever you got that idea
bro i'm mr. using lame password on the
show it was hired name password so there
we go and then after that all i have to
do our money i'm darren at shannon dash
ubuntu dash pc perfect okay cool so
since you're logged in like that I want
to go ahead and start talking to you so
i put in talk Darren at local host
localhost because my computer is going
to think that it's going to be trying to
contact darren on this machine oh we're
not even going out through the internet
or anything we're not like i love this
yeah so it's all happening on your
machine now it's going to say waiting
for your party to respond alright and so
you can't see this but on my display it
says a talk with connection requests for
shannon at localhost respond with talk
space shannon at localhost and there we
go connection established hey and I can
see everything that you're typing I can
see all your back spaces your forward
spaces I can see all your screw-ups she
typed anything wrong what's up and it's
weird cuz the cursor will go back and
forth if we're both typing at the same
time so i'll just be like trust your
technet less so it's basically our own
little chat room that nobody else can
access but me and you and it's all
happening right on this machine I love
that it's real time yeah I do too I
really think that can be very useful
especially if you need to share some
some quick information you can use this
or you can use em what's that other one
called just to share a really fast
message like right just writing to some
others so normally as a sister than
administrator use right to like right to
everybody on the network and say hey I'm
rebooting the Machine I need you to log
off or things like that yeah I guess you
could do wall for that which is like the
equivalent of its like before the
facebook wall there was the right all
uh-huh
yeah Oh mesg just allows you to turn on
and off the service whether or not
you're you're right a bowl oh oh sorry
I'm making animals okay I was like
what's going on here I guess we're
having a egg oh that didn't ask me Thank
You Shannon you're welcome that made my
day like a little kitty we're all right
would it okay so now that about this
this is really cool because not only
does it bring up information about being
able to use SSH but it also or openssh
but it also teaches you a little bit
about being able to use different users
on your machine and how you can have
access to more than one user at one time
so it's very interesting cool good
little intro into TTYL I did a lot of
information about users and groups and
worlds on hectic oh yeah get over to the
user group world over at hak5 dorig
you'll find the little hack tip section
with Shannon going into the command
prompts really good stuff very fun all
right we'll stay tuned because in just a
bit we're gonna be getting into your
feedback but first a quick break you
