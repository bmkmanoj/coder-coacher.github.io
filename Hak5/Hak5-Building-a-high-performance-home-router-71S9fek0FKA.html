online web storage building a high
performance home firewall and router
from a scratch and someone thought it
would be a good idea to let me play with
power tools stick around
I'm Darrin kitchen you're watching hack
5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com go to assist Express and
Netflix Lomo can hack 5 my name is
Darren kitchen and this is your weekly
dose of techno list first and foremost
you guys will notice that the audio is
significantly better I think it could
still improve but thank you for bearing
with the last episode we're shooting
with the shotgun mic got the new cams in
can't wait to take them well next week
to LA for e3 video games gonna be
awesome but today well if you're in a
video game you got to make sure you've
got some really good performance with
your tubes I mean I'm I'm saying you
know little chintzy plastic routers this
one's actually not too terrible because
it's a phenom
is the the 2.0 n not the G so it's not
nearly as fun as far as Wi-Fi hacking is
concerned but if you're a gamer you
don't want one of these no now you need
some good ping times you need some
quality of service so that you can see
what else is out there on your network
that might be potentially slowing down
you getting those headshots in modern
warfare 2 and you know we wouldn't want
any lag so we are going to go ahead and
build ourselves a badass router today
and much like we did last week with the
virtualization server which is totally
rockin over there we're going to build a
new one now this one is going to be
based on a mini ITX and we're going to
well I spoke with legal and they said
that if I promise to be very very very
good they'd let me play with the power
tools so stay tuned for that but now
let's just go ahead and head over to
Shannon and find out about this week's
trivia this week's trivia is while talks
the penguin may be the official Linux
mascot larry the cow is the unofficial
mascot of which Linux distribution enter
for your chance to win some killer new
hack 5 stickers by going over to hack 5
org slash trivia now a brief word from
one of our sponsors and we'll be right
back bull give me a hand in here
what's with the rubber duckies oh it's
my latest great idea and what do you
know with all the smoke detectors oh
those are for the americium the
radioactive isotope yeah I did a bunch
of research back in the day during World
War 2 there was this dude like Glenn
Seaborg or something and it was like
bombarding plutonium with these neutrons
and totally discovered this stuff and
now you can get in fire smoke detector
dailies what's not got to do with the
rubber duckies a man radioactive rubber
duckies like the only put like a third
of a microgram in the smoke detector but
I totally found a way to buy him
wholesale and extract this stuff real
easy what are you gonna do with a
radioactive rubber ducky what else man
take a bath of gamma radiation that is
the worst idea I've ever heard no it's
the best idea ever and that's why I've
already registered radioactive rubber

alright so I figured let's just go ahead
and break this project down into two
separate parts first let's go ahead and
focus on the hardware and then we'll
have a lot of fun with the software now
as far as the hardware is concerned I'm
gonna be using one of these guys Mini
ITX boards are awesome you can find them
relatively inexpensive and and you know
enough power to run a router easily I
mean think about the fact that in one of
these guys just some plastic router
you'll find
your big-box store is going to have
something like a MIPS or an ARM
processor that is going to be completely
underpowered with not enough RAM and
just imagine the difference when you
start using some real hardware now this
mini ITX and this one here that we'll be
using later today is these are Intel
Atom chips the same kind of chips that
you're going to find in your netbook pcs
so you know a 1.3 or a 1.6 Giga hurting
a little bit of hyper threading toss in
two gigs of ram because dude if you can
do it right just go ahead and overkill
and yeah you just pop some nicks in and
your way to the races but it's not going
to look as sexy as one of these little
plastic pieces so I figure you know in
the spirit of in the new place
hanging servers on walls as we have last
week let's just go ahead and have some
more fun with some plexiglass with some
acrylic if you will and and build
ourselves a nice platform that we can
begin to stack some mini ITX machines on
and I figured that'd be fun so let's
take a look at your inventory hardware
what are we working with well I've gone
ahead and recycled a parallel ata drive
it happens to be a 250 gig but you know
anything like a couple of gigs or more
is going to do I even have a 13 gig Lane
over there my god and then like I said
this is a mini ITX form-factor
motherboard here it's your Intel Atom
chip right now I've gone ahead and
you'll noticed just rip this out you'll
notice we have you know plenty of USB
but only a single NIC that is going to
be an issue with building a router we're
going to need to NICs obviously because
one is going to go to our cable or DSL
or what have you and the other is going
to go to our network switch which will
power the rest of the devices now for
this particular router I'm not concerned
with doing wireless that is a separate
project that we're going to have a lot
more fun with in the weeks to come but
suffice it to say you're going to need
to next now while this does have a real
tech on board which for the most part is
going to be supported by the mainstream
router distributions that will
playing with like your PF sense or your
mana wall or your what my favorite
smooth wall you you do need to make sure
that whatever Nick that you do find on
your on board on your little mini ITX
here that you want to check your
distributions compatibility list because
you know it's not listed then then you
might run into some fun issues there
another neat aspect about this
particular board is that we're actually
rocking so-dimms here some little laptop
RAM which is pretty cool
whereas this newer guy is actually using
some you know your generic sticks of I
think this is ddr2 2 gigs I love that
overkill for a router that's the way to
do it so come on well fuck's with that
later anyway another kind of neat thing
is you can pick up one of these end and
it wants to come out here this right
here is just your standard header for
your motherboard and it plugs into DC so
what that means is we don't have to have
an ugly honkin power supply sitting on
the the side of our machine that's going
to give us a lot more room to play with
here on our piece of plexi and yes we do
get a single molex and a single whatever
that SATA power connector is called but
but there you go
so we have essentially everything we
need so let's just go ahead and put it
together now as far as the case is
concerned I have seen a lot of mini ITX
cases that some of them are you know
kinda cute but why pay for something
where you could just take some pieces of
scrap material and put it together so
this right here is quarter inch acrylic
this happens to be black for extra
sexiness but you know anything's going
to work and what idea here is that I'm
going to chop this in half which should
be the right size for this motherboard
and then I'm going to recess the hard
drive in the top layer so I'm going to
stick this here and I'm going to make a
cutout so that I can sit recessed and
then I'll go ahead with my trusty
sharpie mark all the points here for the
holes for the motherboard to go ahead
and
fit there and the holes for the bottom
there are four screws in the bottom of
our hard drive and that will allow me to
go ahead and see everything and and then
to just kind of tease a little bit into
the future what that allows us to do is
with these little riser guys where'd you
guys go I'll just steal one off this
show you so with our little risers here
that's going to allow us to do is lift
the board up significantly off of this
acrylic here so that we'll be able to
fit our hard drive underneath and using
either some you know long machine screws
or even more risers we will eventually
be able to do is take another similar
mini ITX great form factor board and
start stacking them yes it's a Beowulf
cluster of goodness up in here so let's
go ahead and get started you can go
ahead and place your bets right now on
injuries that's fine and begin by
measuring a couple of times and then
making our marks our cuts and
what-have-you and I'm just going to go
ahead and speed all of this up and post
to make it look like I know what I'm
doing how's that of course it's nearly
seven inches by 7 inches as it should be
and I've got about eight inches by 14
and a half to work with so I'll cut this
at soo 14 and a half that's as much as I
wanted that means a seven and a quarter
well in that case scrap that new piece
of plexi and I'm just going to cut it to
however I want it in which case let's
give us about an inch on either side I
think that's going to look good it's
going to be nice little Tower to sit in
the kitchen and look sexy all day long
and of course you do want to make sure
that I have proper safety stuff going on
so I don't hurt myself that was that
you
and as you can see my cut doesn't go
completely perfectly with my line and
that's because I only measured that that
it met my line at the beginning and not
at the end and this is why I typically
don't do hardware but hey you know you
live and when you learn but you know
we're mounting a mini ITX to a piece of
flex seeds and do it right I don't know
it looked forward to me but then again I
might not have drawn my line exactly
square either so all right let's go
ahead and take our bets now this was
just eyeballing it did we make perfect
square well let's see 9/5 nope
okay nope I was very very very very
close I was within like I don't know how
many of these are there I was in one lot
of oh yeah but I'm pretty close to
square so I'm going to go ahead and make
an X on this with my marker from corner
to corner now I'll go ahead and take my
motherboard and then place it right
there in the middle and what you'll
notice is that the edges here go ahead
and line up so that I can actually
easily Center this now I'm not going to
break out the ruler again because it's
not that big of a deal but I think
that's pretty Center what about you so
I'm going to go ahead and make my marks
placing a little dot here
a little dot here now good I can see
those pretty well excellent so now I
just need to drill some holes so that I
can actually put well what would be my
risers but we might be changing things
up just a bit so
I'm going to make sure that you don't
get one of these perpetually shrinking
motherboards or else your screws aren't
going to line up but that's an easy fix
I think I this one if I just nudge it
over just a bit we should be all set by
the way if you are a carpenter or
otherwise handyman and you would like to
go ahead and berate me the email that's
Darren at hack 5 org all right so let's
go ahead and get into mounting our
motherboard and typically what I would
like to do is just use you know the
regular motherboard risers that would
come with your case or you know maybe
some longer ones these are what you
would pick up at well wherever you buy
your computer parts or we can go ahead
and use these these are three inch
machine bolts that have the same thread
that you would find on your riser and
that will give us enough space here to
go ahead and get our to get our there's
word for it hard drive underneath so I
just pop these guys in ah
you're a flathead you're a flathead
really you're not off your Phillips head
you're a flat you guys don't love each
other
now I'm going to go ahead and put a nut
on each of these and take them all the
way down down to the ground
gesundheit
take me down six on the ground the
ground then my feet okay yeah I don't
think those are going to go anywhere so
now pretty sure just be able to slide
this right on and hey look at that
they they want to line up now amazing
okay cool
now obviously it's gonna fall down so
let's go ahead and pop two nuts in each
of these so that the lock with each
other and that way our motherboard won't
sag
nobody wants a sagging motherboard I'm
going to take my hard drive and I'm
pretty much going to want the hard drive
to sit here underneath well motherboard
sits on top so it looks like I got quite
a bit of room to work with here I should
go ahead and figure out how I'm mounting
this this hard drive in that case I can
either pop some screws in here and then
run some more machine bolts through from
the bottom because there are our four
little screw holes here on the bottom of
our hard drive and that's one option now
this isn't you know this isn't wall
mounted this isn't going to sit sideways
anywhere so it's you know not too
worried about the hard drive moving
around a whole lot let me see what other
screws I have to work with here I think
these should be the right size here to
go through both the acrylic and right
into the bottom of the hard drive and
yes they're a perfect fit now the
question is I'm going to be able to get
that perfect because these need to be
need to be dead-on so it's probably a
a fancy way of doing this but I don't
know the trick the trick now is to set
that down and make my points with my
marker or if you have a girlfriend or if
you have as you're as lucky as I am to
have a Colleen behind a camera you can
borrow some makeup Thank You Colleen and
we're just going to take some of this
concealer or whatever this is and just
dab a little bit on each of our screws I
guess you could use toothpaste as well
if you don't have access to makeup but
maybe you want to start wearing makeup I
mean you know I'm not judging I'm just
saying can be used for computer stuff -
yeah just give it a little bit of
pressure and pull that right up and I
can clear as day see I don't know if
that's going to come out on the camera
as well be but I've got my little marks
here so go over those with my sharpie
I'm just going to let you know ahead
right now if you're absolutely not
coordinated don't bother just buy a case
but if you're absolutely not coordinated
and have an obligation to make a
30-minute technology program on a weekly
basis well then just go ahead there we
go
okay you know now I've just got to kind
of like leaning back you know and that's
just because it's a well it's from the
East Bay so that's this that's how the
motherboards rock around here we're just
going to leave that for now and our
molex power to the hard drive as anyone
ever said measure once cut twice um oh
my god my molex power connector doesn't
reach the hard drive epic fail
so there we go I took five minutes to go
ahead and make it sexy and now
everything should line up gone ahead and
removed the cover here so you can
actually see the gorgeous black acrylic
that we do have here add a little bit
more room I'd pop one of these sexy ak5
stickers on it which are guaranteed to
improve overclocking performance but as
it is I think as a router it's going to
do fine without it so let me just go
ahead and hook up my IDE s and this guy
is set to master it's been so long since
I've used IDE but you know I don't have
any spare SATA drives so go figure right
there's a little key for a reason
and I think I may want to just go ahead
and trim this cable there we go
let's take this IDE cable and since I'm
only ever going to have one device on
the chain snip off the excess don't need
that and you know West were here we
would trim these and turn it into a
rounded ìbe cable and play with cable
management but we're not going to do
that because then the server would turn
evil and we can't have any of that
excellent now you may notice that I do
not have a power switch and that is
because I've gone into the BIOS and set
it to automatically come on when it gets
power so really all I need to do is plug
some DC into here
and there should be all set so let's
give it some VGA lovin and I've got a
USB keyboard here and we'll go ahead and
give it some power now it's a fan list
so the only way I can tell that's
exactly I don't have you heard that beep
that's the reason that the PC speaker is
connected and there we go I missed the
BIOS it happens a bit disk failure
because we do not have an operating
system on here but we will here shortly
we're going to take a quick break and
when we get back we're going to be
poppin smooth wall on here and
configuring it so that we're going to
have a very sexy Network to get some
high performance gaming another fun
internet ting on if you will so stay
tuned stick around we'll be back in just
a bit this week I have some innovative
online storage solutions for you because
well let's face it
local backups are only going to get you
so far and unless you want to ship hard
drives to your Nana every week of those
pictures that she really wants of you
and the kids well a true off-site backup
solution isn't very commonplace sucks
there are services like Dropbox and
SugarSync which give you about 2 gigs of
space but that kind of reminds me of my
Geocities days when I only had like two
Meg's of space for all of my Sailor Moon
pictures for my fan site whoa yeah not
much space yeah Sailor Moon fan site
pretend you didn't hear that so we have
services that go up to like 50 gigs if
you're willing to contribute to them and
one of those that I really like is
wallah
all right I got to thank JPEG real quick
for sending this in it's an awesome
program everybody can use it
voila comm which was made by LaCie or
Lisi wait that's kind of like Final
Fantasy 13 right the list C made wala
awesome god I'm such a dork all right
you can store basically gigs of data up
in the cloud and it's just for your
priceless materials like your pictures
and your documents and
and music well alright maybe not music
just you know we can all replace that
right pretend I didn't say anything and
the cool thing about wall is that you
don't necessarily have to pay for more
storage you do have the ability to trade
storage on your local machine for
storage up in the cloud which is pretty
cool
there's tons of features first of all is
ad free which is great you have the
ability to do private you can do shared
and public modes so if you want to do
everything private so only you can see
it shared with your friends and family
or public so like your co-workers and
everybody at work can see whatever files
you put up you also have personal
folders and you can add to and join
groups there's secure file storage
everything you do one here is encrypted
so even though all a team can't see
anything that you're doing they have no
clue what kind of files you're putting
up there it's awesome pro users get a
version control and if you don't want to
necessarily share your whole hard drive
with others there's a paid version it's
$25 per year or ten gigs and it's up to
a thousand dollars a year for a terabyte
but really if you have a whole terabyte
that you need to put up on the cloud you
might as well get Amazon s3 storage if
you don't need to upload and download
really frequently voila runs on Windows
Mac and Linux and thanks to go to assist
Express I'm able to do a really really
simple set up using one of our hack 5
cloud lab computers so let's check that
out all right so I've already opened up
the wall a website I'm going to click
the download tab and wallah should start
downloading automatically there it goes
hey all right once the exe is done I
choose the exe I choose run click Next a
few times and the installation begins
and once the installation is finished
I'm going to choose to go ahead and
start Walla and stick it on my desktop
so it's easily findable
alright so my Windows Firewall is going
to pop up yeah I'm going to allow access
and then I'm going to put in my new sign
in info so my ears are names
to email of the hak5
got work I can spell yay my password and
then we wall up we'll start okay so it's
telling me I need to update wala so I'm
going to go ahead and do that run the
setup voila
automatically starts up and then I type
in my password okay now I'm in wala yá
now right now it's telling me I only
have one gig of cloud storage
I can also trade in for local space or I
can buy more space or invite friends for
up to three gigs
oh that's cool okay I'm going to create
a new folder called hak5 in the images
folder to upload a picture I simply
click add files choose my image and open
it and then once the image is uploaded
it's going to have a little green bullet
right next to the file if the file shows
up gray that means it hasn't been
uploaded yet and if there's a taskbar
type thing next to it that means that
it's working on being uploaded to change
the privacy settings of a folder right
click and go to properties change the
visibility by clicking change and then
choose private shared or public I'm
going to go ahead and choose shared and
then I can select all friends since I
don't have any friends yet just picking
all friends is going to make sure that
all of my friends in the future will be
able to see this this folder I can't
change that in the future if I need to
if you did have a whole bunch of friends
listed in here they would show up in
this pop-up and then you can choose
which ones that you wanted to have
visible to this folder there's also a
couple of other features that I did want
to point out right now because they're
pretty cool
I can find my friends through various
services like Yahoo or whatnot and I can
join a group to join a group you simply
search for the group I want to join an
anime group so I'm going to type an
anime there's a ton of them here alright
so I'm just going to choose one by
hitting this little green button next to
the image I click yes and now I'm a
member
yeah now I can add to the group of a
whole bunch of images that I have on my
computer from anime or I can download
straight from it which is nice
so you can see once you start playing
with wool wallah it's really easy and
it's fast and quick and painless now all
of your essential files are now backed
up onto the cloud using industry
standard encryption
I love backups almost as much as I love
my portable apps shame this isn't really
a portable app so do you use this

/ go to assist Express all right we've
got our hardware all set up and it's
time to start putting together all the
bits and bytes that are actually going
to make this gorgeous hunkajunk here
into our sexy router that is going to
perform oh so much better than any piece
of plastic that you can find at the
big-box store now I've gone ahead and
set up our network interfaces here the
Intel Nick here this is actually a pro
1000 GT one of my favorite Nick's is
going to run as our green interface or a
network interface for our local area
network here so it's going to plug into
our switch I've got it connected
directly to my laptop here just to test
what with and then our integrated which
is a real tech is plugged into a really
long cable that is heading to the the
new DOCSIS 3 modem where we've got a
little 30 megabit down 10 megabit up
happiness going on and to make the
installation really easy rather than you
know fussing with any USB drives or
anything like that I've gone ahead and
just grabbed a USB external cd-rom drive
since really we're only going to be
using optical for word
our media anyway and what seems like
that's really how it is these days
anyway so let's go ahead and get started
just download the ISO for your favorite
router distribution mine happens to the
smooth wall I've also been playing with
pfSense which looks really nice
especially if you want to do an embedded
system where you want to boot your
router off of just a USB Drive they have
embedded ISOs that you can just use like
phys disk right to really just image
that bin file over to or that IMG file
over to your USB media whether it be 512
a gig to 4 gigs and the entire operating
system and everything will live there
and it will be read-only so that you
don't need to worry about you know the
longevity of your USB Drive however I'm
going with a 250 gig drive which is
overkill but then again so is the 2 gigs
of ram and the 1.6 gigahertz point being
I'm running smooth wall because that's
going to allow me with the hard drive
there to go ahead and run some
additional features down the road like a
real-time antivirus and some quality of
services and you know a web caching
proxy like squid so that if I fetch I
don't know some obscure Microsoft
knowledgebase article and then somebody
else down the line wants it as well
well it's locally cached you know so
that's going to speed performance up in
that regard so I've gone ahead
downloaded the ISO burned it to a CD
let's boot up and as I said before it's
just a matter of connecting the power
here and auto boots that's exactly what
I want it to do so the power goes out
the machine will come right back on I'm
going to pop right into the BIOS here
for just a sec
and make sure that got it set up the way
I want and our first boot device is our
CD ROM so that's what I need to make
sure of so I can go ahead and exit I
don't need to save any changes we should
start booting off this desk alright so
let's go ahead and begin the smooth wall
setup and this pops us into a sexy and
curses based setup that's just going to
go ahead and guide us through ask us the
questions to help
set up our interfaces our DHCP the whole
nine yards first question is kind of
superfluous please insert the cd-rom
well I think we booted off of it so yeah
yeah it's there now it's going to let us
know that this installation will format
the hard drive we're going to lose
everything on it whatever it's
partitioning it now and there you go
we've got it setup smooth wall has
successfully installed to the hard drive
it's really just matter sitting around
waiting for it to do its thing but when
it's done we now have this beautiful
setup to walk us through the process of
configuring our router so before we even
go into the web interface let's just go
ahead and take care of here when we've
got a monitor and keyboard hooked up to
our lovely router here now wants to know
if we're going to restore our settings
from a previous installation of smooth
wall if this were the hack house I
probably would because we were running
it there before but know this this is a
really nice feature to keep in mind
because new versions come out all the
time this is 3.0 you know we were on a
2x build at one point in time and it's
just kind of nice to be able to bring
those all of your port forwards and all
of those different network settings with
you when you upgrade but we're not doing
it upgrade so I'm going to say no and
it's going to ask about our keyboard
layout we're on the UK I'm sorry us and
machines hostname smooth well that's
fine and it's going to ask us how we
want our outgoing traffic to be now
typically in older versions everything's
just been open which means that your
outgoing traffic is not filtered in any
particular way now you can actually get
really fine-tune here but what I'm going
to do is since I'm going to want to
create different rules later is I'm
going to leave this open for now and
then in a later segment we're going to
go ahead and get nitty-gritty with this
now the incoming is still block
everything if you didn't establish a
connection or if you don't have you know
server listening on the other end for it
so here we go we need to configure the
way that our network cards are laid out
and this is where it gets colorful so
we're going to choose network
configuration type now green green is
going to be our homeland and that is
this interface here on our
or Intel Nick that's what's going to
plug into I don't know like a 24 port
gigabit and all of our devices into that
the red is the integrated Nick here the
real tech and that plugs directly into
our modem yes our cable modem so what
once right now is like an ISDN modem
that's not what we need we need a red
and a green now if you wanted to get all
fancy we could have a red green and an
orange we could even throw in purple and
all these different colors basically
mean additional interfaces if this were
a mini ITX board if I had more PCI cards
to work with here I could add for
example a wireless card and turn this
also into a wireless access point well
that's probably what we're going to do
with this a little bit later on but
suffice it to say those are the
different network topologies that we can
work with here and smooth ball like we
can even do you know like purple is a
dmz if we have servers that we want to
have on a separate VLAN kind of
structure it that way but let's just go
ahead and go with our green and our red
so we need to assign our cards to those
colors those interfaces if you oh so
let's assign those and we're going to go
ahead and go ahead and configure these
so we will probe and it's going to go
ahead and search for new hardware and it
detected our Pro 1000 this is our Intel
one so we're going to say yes let's go
ahead and assign the Intel one to green
because that's our land I'm going to
probe again and it found the realtek 81
69 that's the integrated on our red so
it's going 1 it could be as red and then
all cards have been assigned so now we
can actually change our address settings
now the address settings for green are
going to be DHCP basically this will act
as a DHCP server that is to say it's
going to allow other devices on the
network and say here's your IP address
here's all of the DNS information
welcome to the network and for it to do
that to make things simple we're just
going to go with a basic address scheme
of 192.168.0.1 we could also do like a
one set
2.16 does something does something or
attend that's something that's something
that's something it really just depends
on how many devices we're going to have
on the network depends on what class of
network we do and considering that this
house is never going to have more than
two hundred and something odd devices
I'm just going to go ahead and leave it
with these defaults but if you want to
get really you know crazy here you can
further reading in the show notes about
cider nets and stuff like that and if
that's really what you guys want to hear
about on the show let me know because we
could do that all day long okay and then
we'll choose for our red and our red is
going to be DHCP because that's what we
get from our cable modem so we're going
to say hey cable modem I'm the router
out in this place hook me up or if you
need pppoe if you're on the DSL or if a
static IP address provided by your ISP
you know that's where you would enter
that so now that we've assigned both of
those I'll hit done and last but not
least we can set up our DNS and Gateway
settings
I like the 8.8.8.8 DNS server that's the
new one by Google I find that pretty
good you could also use I don't know
four to two to is a good one there's
tons of DNS out there I'm sure your ISP
provides one I find a lot of the bigger
ISP one's kind of annoying now when they
start fussing with like your results
when you Biff a URL so or there's Open
DNS we've talked about in the fourth
season so I'm just going to go ahead
with these and say we're done now here's
where I can configure a web proxy if I
had to do that if this was sitting
behind another proxy we don't need to
worry about that in this particular
configuration we are going to go down to
DHCP though and enable this so now that
means on our green interface it's going
to run as a DHCP server it's going to
start assigning addresses at 192 168 0
dot 100 all the way to 200 so that'll
give us a big enough address pool for
the devices that will potentially
connect by DHCP to this network and what
I like to do in this instance
since it begins that 100 and goes to 200
I'll keep all my servers all my static
gear at under 100 so you know like some
of my Skype boxes will be like 80
something 82 whatever so come down here
hit okay and finish now I'll set a
password I'm just going to do something
real simple for now and setup is
complete we're going to go ahead and
reboot that's all there is to
configuring a smooth wall setup and once
this reboots basically from any you know
device on our land I can come to my
laptop here and what you want to do is
hit that IP address that one that we
configured on one of those steps where
was the green interface the 192.168.0.1
that's our gateway that's this machine
right here we're going to want to pull
up our browser and head over to HTTP
colon slash slash that IP : 81
that is to say port 81 not the standard
port 80 if it was port 80 we wouldn't
need to do colon 80 that would just be
you know accept it as the default but
that's what we would get if that's what
we have to do to get to the web admin
interface because they use the 81 I
think we established that okay you would
just go ahead and log in with the
credentials that I just gave it I'm from
there we can get we can have a ton of
fun just tweaking all sorts of things
about quality of service and proxies and
casts you know squid caching real-time
antivirus and a lot of other stuff so
look forward to more playing with smooth
well in the future I'm really looking
forward to hearing what you guys have to
say about this you know this is the kind
of projects that you like to see let us
