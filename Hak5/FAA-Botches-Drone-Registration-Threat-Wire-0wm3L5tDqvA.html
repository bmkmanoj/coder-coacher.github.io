registration and the anonymous Bitcoin
author is unmasked or not all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Darren kitchen and this is threat
wire for December 16 2015 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom hello man fun stuff
the FAA just announced on Monday it's
expected small UAS aka drone
registration rules most of it comes from
the recommendations of the task force
that they did made up of industry
leaders and the short and skinny is that
any unmanned aircraft even model
aircraft used for recreational use
between 250 grams and about 25 kilos
must be registered the site goes live on
Monday December 21st it'll be a fááá
up / UAS / registration and new drone
owners must register before flying and
if you think you're going to get
grandfathered in because you've owned
one for a while you'll need to register
yours no later than februari 19 2016 the
civil penalties for failing to register
as a high as 27500 while criminal
penalties can pile up to a quarter
million dollars now upon registration
which requires your name your home
address your email you'll be given a
unique registration number that you can
have fixed all of your drones that's
right the same registration number for
all of your aircraft so the dozen or so
quadcopters I've built are going to have
the same number one might even think by
that logic that it's not actually a
small UAS registration but rather a
pilot registration so if i happen to
know your unique registration number and
i write it down on a DJI phantom and
crash it into the White House I think
you're going to be having a really bad
day oh and did I mention that all of
this data collected for this federal
agencies database is going to be shared
with third-party contractors it's okay
though I'm sure they're going to secure
way better than the office of personnel
management my favorite part of this FAA
PR spin is this quote from do t
Secretary Anthony Foxx who says quote
make no mistake unmanned aircraft
enthusiasts are aviators and with that
title comes a great deal of
responsibility
Oh person of authority called me an
aviator bring on the bomber jacket in
the shades I'm in the skies final
thought the 250 gram exemption that was
accepted by the task force is spelled
out in the final regulation as the all
up weight not the maximum takeoff weight
it's a subtle distinction but this means
that the maximum thrust isn't accounted
for meaning that we are about to see a
ton of innovation in the development of
smaller and lighter components for the
model aircraft community and I am
predicting now a huge boon in sub 250
grant gram aircraft such as my personal
scratch-build fpv racer coming in at
just 240 grams it's almost like I
anticipated this find out more on next
week's episode of hak5 Bitcoin not the
first but by far the most popular
cryptocurrency in existence of course
the first to rely on decentralization
and ever since his debut in 2008 people
have wondered about its mysterious
anonymous inventor that's right the
person or groups of person most likely
responsible for the invention go by the
possible pseudonym Oroku Saki no wait
that's shredder from the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles what I meant to say was
Satoshi Nakamoto but the story only
begins with Nakamoto see Bitcoin was
released to the open-source wilderness
in 2009 and has since thrived by the
help of hundreds of developers though
that hasn't stopped the media from
fantasizing of unmasking the Bitcoin
inventor there have been numerous failed
attempts before and most recently we're
seeing a case of a possible hoax from
Down Under last week wired wrote that
Craig Wright quote either invented
Bitcoin or he is a brilliant hoaxer who
very badly wants us to believe he did
well this week the latest from wired is
pointing to the latter the full story
involves altered posts analysis pgp key
and an Australian Federal Police search
of rice property related to a tax issue
yeah so did the media get duped and who
is Satoshi Nakamoto I'd say both
questions kind of miss the point the
fact is Satoshi Nakamoto brought to this
world groundbreaking technology in
distributed databases known as the
blockchain and it's enriched so many
more projects than just Bitcoin in my
eyes at least the
messenger is no more important in this
case than the likes of Edward Snowden or
guy fox then again I get that were
humans we feed on the narrative the
story behind the story and maybe this is
one that will never end think otherwise
let me know in the comments now before I
go mad props to everyone supporting us
on patreon if you're digging the show
check it out at patreon.com / threat
wire and find out how you can keep the
show going and possibly have your pet
pal featured here we are so keen on
getting this going three times a week
with a rotating cast of Patrick Norton
Shannon Morris myself and we hope you'll
help us achieve this milestone goal of
course if you want to help us keep this
independent an ad-free a like share
subscribe all of those helped
tremendously too and oh did I mention
we're also working on an end of the year
special so let us know in the comments
what you think were the most righteous
hacks of 2015 with that I'm Darren
kitchen I'll see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
