that's easy to implement and manage
thinking about updating to Nintendo's
system menu 4.0 already updated
wondering about we homebrew we've got
the skinny online doom open source free
eyelids killer new futures what's not to
love all that and much much more on this
episode of hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by go daddy
Netflix Squarespace and configure
doodles really Ricker doodles well do it
any idea how bad those things are for
you
well I can't believe you brought those
into this house alright everybody
welcome this week's episode of hack 5
I'm Matt let's talk i'm darren kitchen
and I'm Shannon Morse
it is good to be doing a regular show
it's good to be in this year what do we
you mean we're in the future
Shannon we've talked about this and this
is the present stop messing with me like
good halftime see amazing as you can see
we do not have a special guest on the
stage anymore as awesome as it was to
see your sister I much prefer the
silence of darren and shannon each
blindly staring at their computer and
paul sleeping 30 hours a day nineteen
year old girls yes
paul can sleep thirty hours a day it's
possible to clutch with a 19 year old
girl generation dude I'm on the myspace
Facebook I never swore that much when I
was that old yeah well yeah yeah I've
heard part of your show yeah yeah anyway
so um no it's it's good to be doing a
radio show you
excellent show for you guys today as you
heard in the cold open T's D League so
yeah as fun as the whole 1995 experiment
was and we were actually shocked with
the feedback that you guys gave us
seriously we thought we'd be probably
fired by now yeah I mean there's a lot
of stuff that I forgot to do like
mention fidonet and prodigy CompuServe
like lots of stuff yeah you know like he
could spend all day just to get up
enough sodium there's just you know it's
a gold mine right let's just leave it
behind us because really it sounds
better in your head now than it really
was back then
speaking of Spain terrific nostalgia
uh-huh skull tag skull tag is it is
actually the land game like that wasn't
a joke some people
emailed us made comments saying for real
doom - and I'm like dude yeah let's do
it
yeah I didn't think you were serious
either yeah I got the server running
right now it just needs to fix the DNS
make it work cool yes so um so skull tag
if you haven't heard okay so like give
you a little history here doom - well
Duman in general just as most id games
in games if you will what they do is
John Carmack the you know game god of
what them all goes head and open sources
the engine said I you know we had a lot
of fun doom open source now have fun
play with it same thing happened with
with quake quake 2 and lots of very cool
open source stuff quake 3 yeah that's
where we get that open open quake open
open open arena and then there's the
other one that we played a while ago now
a good stuff comes from that and one of
these good things in particular I mean
I've been playing a lot of like I mean
Doom has my heart
please doom on pretty much every single
piece of technology that it can we can
do it on the way to I mean if you can
hack something you need to be able to
play Doom on it or it's not actually
hacked right there's only so many times
that you could actually play Doom though
oh no there's enough community wads out
there and tree here's the thing is like
skull tag is okay so so there's many of
these there's there's legacy there's e
doom there's so many different ones and
skull tag is a really great
implementation that does doom in and
brings it to the modern times where
you've got your mouse look you've got
your better graphics you even have 3d
graphics sometimes with the weapons and
the people and the characters and
whatnot they've rewritten all the
netcode they've written rewritten the
monster AI code and the best part about
it is this doom supports like forget if
it's 16 32 something but there's enough
players multiplayer over the Internet
don't worry about IP x don't worry about
serial cables or null modem you can just
play on Mac Windows Linux online and
that's what we will be doing
no that's what's running right now so
doomed archive network dupe sauce yeah
so I've been playing with it I got it
here my ubuntu thing I mean you need to
go over to scull tag calm right now and
grab yourself a copy of it so basically
just you know
grando version what do we I mean what do
we do does this include everything or do
we have to have our own wads yeah that's
that's the important part that right
this is the open source John Carmack did
they open source the engine they didn't
give you no graphics the music the
levels so you can there's tons of user
levels out there but those are what we
call P wads and you need what's called
an iPod to to actually but yeah that's
the one that's got all the resources
like those where do we get hamsters well
you could just do a Google search for
quote Apache quote quote index of quote
quote doom to Dodd quote and you will
find a legitimate copy is it what huh
that's Google hacking for you yeah and
you know I owned like doom like multiple
times Oh ever so whatever the thing is
though if you don't if you never bought
it when you were kid then go over to
steam and like ten bucks me have it
right can't believe it's ten bucks yeah
or if you want it for free and and and
you don't you know one like illegitimate
wares on your conscience because we know
winners don't do wares head over to
freedoom and get yourself a copy check
this out this is a complete remake of
the original doom ayoade where these
these community members actually we drew
the textures remapped the levels
resequenced and there's edible with and
it's compatible tag yeah it's compatible
with like so you have free doom and yeah
it's gotta tell my dad has so if I've
got the free do my wad and you've got
the doom to I want we can still play on
a different level
no we can play you could go the winners
don't do where's mmm-hmm or you could do
a little Jimmy thing and go to yeah I
like I mean so I actually have a let me
see if I can fire it up here and oh yeah
okay so I've got skull tag installed
here and yeah you can see I've got my
original doom 2
but I also have the freedom wand which
is named doom tada why the sale if I
just uh it's a lot of water yeah gravy
yeah and please I'm gonna be honest it's
probably gonna crash I wouldn't be
surprised because Darren Aussie freedo
me and OH
segmentation fault hold away okay that's
right yeah excellent that's all right
no I'm stoked one thing that I know that
a bunch of people have been asking about
is when are we going to play Goldeneye
source which has officially come out oh
yeah and we need to play it oh yes we do
because I cannot play Goldeneye
I'm your shitty n64 well we will play we
can like garbage as far as land party
games are concerned and this is a little
different this was like us doing a
little veto at the with the 1995 episode
but we played the games that the
community members suggest and I think
Shannon's got the details on that for
the lamp I do if I don't burp from that
beer we're playing doomed to school tag
the one that you've been talking about
at doom hack five org we're playing on
April 25th at 3 p.m. Eastern and you can
go over to hack 5 land squarespace.com
and check out all the different games
that we're thinking about playing you
can vote on your favorite game for the
next land party all sorts of stuff and
Darren has some interesting information
about our sponsor Squarespace yeah I
want to tell you guys about Squarespace
because with Squarespace you can put
together a professional-looking website
something that I've been doing like all
week and and rather than just getting
nitty-gritty with WordPress code which
isn't as much fun as it sounds
what you want to do is head over to
Squarespace calm their plans start as
low as like eight dollars a month and
they make it super simple to put
together beautiful website let me show
you an example here now alright so here
at hack 5 land at squarespace.com and
I've got my post here about our little
doom to match
and it's all good but you know I forgot
to mention something and that is we're
gonna be playing some custom wad files
and we're looking for you guys to send
us some suggestions so this I got these
four little items over here that allow
me to edit the content edit the
structure edit the theme of the site or
just see what it looks like for you guys
and I'm in my content edit mode and I've
got my blog post here let's go ahead and
click modify and BAM right there within
the site it just pulls up this beautiful
little editor and now I don't have to
touch any code I don't have to go into
any back-end that's the beauty of it is
this the whole philosophy of the
front-end back-end disappears because
it's all on top of the front end if that
makes any sense so here we are in the
little WYSIWYG editor and I just want to
come down here and make mention you know
let's see and say if you have any custom
mod files you'd like us to play it us
alright and I'll save them close and
that's all there is to it I mean
Squarespace makes it that easy and it
can be that easy for you guys too so if
you're interested in head over to
squarespace.com and check out you can
get a two week free trial there playing
start like I said $8 a month
and up and it's it's really cool service
you can get 10% off if you use coupon
code hak5 so you know sports show
support us we like that that's hak5 by
the way
no I actually got a message on facebook
from a guy who spelled @h ACK 5 oh yeah
we get this my coupon code don't work
what show are you watching L did it
wrong I think mat has got some
interesting info for us about some
jabber jabber yeah ok
I'll leave now yeah let's just be gone
okay cuz I got this
hey what's going on guys recently I've
been getting a lot of traffic on Zee Ola
to blog and one of the posts that I
actually have on there is about my
implementation of Microsoft Office
communications server 2007 and while I'm
not going to show you that some of it
because it's a pain in the ass to set up
I am going to show you an alternative
that you can use that is retarded ly
simple to set up manage and deploy a
bunch of different really cool features
it's called open fire and it's a jabber
compliant or it is a jabber server it's
based on Java server back-end kind of
thing if you want to call it that
so one of the things that you are gonna
have to have installed is the Java
Runtime environment on your server of
choice mine happens to be sent OS
because it is a straight Red Hat
derivative just without the branding and
without their support packages they go
to send OS org and find information on
that it's really available and it is
kept very very up-to-date we're gonna do
is we're actually going to deploy open
fire very quickly in what is seeming to
be a very common place for me I'm gonna
show you how easy and quickly you can
actually get a server or system up and
running now there's two real options for
Linux you can download the source or you
can download a prebuilt RPM package
which is compatible with Red Hat
Enterprise Systems cent OS being a
direct derivative it's compatible
there's also servers for Mac and PC all
of which obviously require Java Runtime
environment so we're gonna do is we're
actually going to check out the download
which I actually already downloaded it's
kind of pain in the ass to get through W
get but you don't need to know that so
what we're gonna do is we're actually
going to install the RPM what we're
gonna do is rpm - I V H open fire okay
now the reason I haven't showed you this
before is because open fire had a
security vulnerability with cross-site
scripting problems and some of their
administration panels that's been fixed
therefore open fire is now on the show
open fire is now installed
there's a little note here you can't
directly start open fire from service
start or UTC init.d open fire the open
fire server actually installs to a CD
opt open fire and here you can actually
get license information you know
documentation configuration files B and
so on and so forth we're gonna do is
we're gonna service if I can spell okay
so open fire is not currently running
and that's fine because we just
installed it it installs the unity
scripts it does all its thing check and
fig so on and so forth
we're actually going to do is we're
going to service open fire reload what
this is going to do is it's going to
shut down what isn't actually running
it's gonna close some configuration
files and it should hopefully restart
open fire so that is actually running so
service open fire is running now what
we're actually gonna do is configure it
that's it it's installed it's up and
running you can do everything via the
web interface which is a session that
we're going to open here in Firefox
we're going to go to 10 10 0.1 64 this
could be a public facing IP address
probably should be if you're gonna offer
this as a service which Darin I think we
might want to do if there's any interest
in it I've had a lot of success running
jabber communities in the past for
people that actually are going to use it
and port 9090 so here we are we're on
the initial setup page for open fire now
I'm gonna select English and the domain
is going to be heck five peeps calm
okay the admin portal in port you can
set those to whatever you actually like
standard databases connection or you can
use the embedded database so if you've
got in my sequel server we're already
set up and running which I do not but
probably would be if it's you know on a
hosting server or something like that
you're gonna want to use the standard
database it's a little bit faster and
has a couple more options otherwise
we're just gonna use the embedded
database which is just fine for setting
up a local system with you know less
than 50 users we're going to use default
profile settings so you can actually
integrate this with LDAP or clear space
which is a product of an ignite
real-time dare and I know you're saying
F LDAP but there's a lot of support on
the ignite real-time forums that you
want so in admin at hack 5 Pete's calm
and we're gonna enter a password and
continue that's gonna go ahead and set
up all your options and when it
refreshes here and it actually moves on
to the next step we're actually gonna be
presented with a very nice dashboard now
I've gotten some comments about you know
mentioning this server in particular
versus some others and how easy it is to
set up jabber servers but the nice thing
about this is the Caesar name and
password is it is so simplistic that
really anybody without prior knowledge
of any you know UNIX operating system or
command line can really set this up and
deploy this with some very powerful
management and plugins that we're
actually gonna show you right now so the
servers are actually up and running if I
wanted to I could connect to it but
first we're gonna go ahead and set up a
user and the user is going to be me so
we're gonna come over here to create new
user my name is Matt and man and man
okay great user so now if I came over to
my Mac client they provide to clients
they provide spark which a jet which is
a Java jabber client you can use any jab
or compliant server or excuse me client
to connect to the open fire server that
you want to come down here we're gonna
open spark because it's that awesome
they're gonna open it and as soon as it
pops up here Matt the password is my
password and ten dot and dot o dot 164
and boom I'm now logged into my jabber
server which I believe I set up just a
couple minutes ago now what you can
actually do with jabber is real quick
some of the plugins some essential
plugins that you guys we're going to
want to install right off the bat and
the nice thing is you can actually
download them right from the
administration panel plugins and come
over here to available plugins and we're
going to select the monitoring service
which is really powerful shows you
metrics based on who's logged in chat
sessions that are going on usage of the
server really nice tools that used to be
in an enterprise only version of opened
fire but are now available to everybody
the other thing that you probably don't
want to install is the present service
as well as IM gateway now you can
actually connect open fire server to
public you know aim
ICQ msn google talk you know all those
other services so if you wanted to
deploy a you know a system for corporate
IM communications you can actually
control all that access through open
fire if you wanted to block the extern
the users on your network from being
able to directly access those services
they could all proxy in through open
fire it's a really really powerful tool
if you're actually going to use it a lot
of people say i'm gonna deploy IM
services at my corporate office or you
know just for this community
and while they're great for the five or
ten people that actually use it they
really become powerful tools of you know
communication when you have everybody on
there you set a conference rooms content
filtering email listening broadcast sip
integration really powerful check it out
at open fire
dot no excuse me ignite real time dot
org and you can download spark which is
the Java client spark web which is a
flash based client for web access and
the open fire server for more info on
open fire spark or spark web hit me up
at matt less stock.com where i'll have a
complete overview and screenshots for
you guys on my blog matt less calm or
hit up the forums at forums dot hack 5
or now I think Darin is doing what are
you doing
trivia that's right it's time for this
week's trivia question but before let's
go ahead and check in and see what the
trivia answer was from 14 years ago that
trivia question of course was prior to
miss success the Miller brothers
computer game company developed the what
title that holds a claim as the first
computer game distributed on cd-rom now
that was correctly answered by Double
Dragon 3 who wrote in the manhole so
we're gonna go ahead and hook them up
with a awesome evil server t-shirt not
exactly this one but one just like it
and you can go ahead and get in on our
trivia giveaway action by checking out
this week's trivia question which is
what instant message protocol developer
features this quote on his home page if
it's not logic it's magic and if it's
not magic it's female logic
you can go ahead and answer trivia at
wwf/e org slash trivia and we will
randomly choose you or awesomeness so
well if you get it right well I mean we
could pick a loser one week and then
ridic killed him on the show for getting

so head over to WWF flexkom slash hack 5
and go ahead and support show so I think
at this point I'm gonna let you guys
know that we are heading over to Shannon
to see what's going on with this week in
we homebrew
hey guys I'm back this week with a
little update for you about the homebrew
channel in the zelda twilight hack turns
out Nintendo has released system menu
4.0 it's kind of sad for us because the
Zelda Twilight hack well they broke it
and they also helped privacy or help
piracy in a way it kind of sucks for us
as well I did want to mention though
there are a couple of things that you
need to keep in mind I did want to clear
this up because I've gotten a lot of
feedback over the past two weeks about
the homebrew channel first off if you
already upgraded to 4.0 and you don't
have the homebrew channel yet you can't
get it there's no way to actually put it
on there it's pretty much broken if they
do find a new video game that they can
get the hack to work on I'll let you
know I'm definitely keeping an eye out
for it if you still have three point two
or three point four one of the older
versions of the system menu you still
can get the homebrew channel you can
still download it and it will carry over
at 4.0 if you do what I upgrade if you
just want to stay with 3.0 it'll still
work that way too and the good thing
about this is if you upgrade to 4.0 and
you have the homebrew channel already
you can still get new games on it pretty
cool so just don't upgrade until you
install the homebrew channel please I'm
sorry I didn't know about this sooner I
would have told you if I did okay this
is a game called brutal Mario you can
find this game over at smw central
dotnet and this was created by Carol now
in this game it's basically a Super
Mario World hacked version of the game
you have these tricked-out levels and
these tricked out bosses a very funny
little plot line there's less levels and
it is a little bit more difficult but
all in all it's fun and I suggest it to
anybody twos who's into the whole
homebrew scene now I'm gonna have Darin
go over to this cool little thing this
is called the save game snapshot
basically what you can do if you're in
the middle of a level and you're
screwing up a whole lot and you want to
save in the middle of the level so you
well can start over and get it again and
finally get your way through
there you go you can save your game
snapshot right where you started off
from now I'm going to show you my other
favorite game this is my personal
favorite I don't think the guys liked it
as much but I love it so let's go back
to the homebrew channel okay this is
called remove the demo as you can
see it has this adorable cute little
picture of a kitty alright so this is a
very very simple game all you have to do
is press the B button and I'll hold this
up to my microphone you can hear it I
like this game okay I'm done here guys
go ahead and come over here and join me
so we can in this show
and go back to our daily work day
routines
alright guys so that just about wraps up
this week's episode of hack 5 hope you
enjoyed it
I know I had a bunch of fun bringing you
more systems administration tools
Shannon great job I just want you to
look well a bunch of people I was
actually shocked at the number of people
that came out for caring about a week
yeah well I was I was shocked that many
go home I was shocked that it just
happens that the day I decided to do the
Twilight pack Nintendo comes out with
 system really the day of Reggie
way to go date you can't predict that
stuff thanks guys so mu tools their
rules alright so that has been one that
is what has been keeping me busy I've
been working my off this whole
week doing some web development stuff
which is interestingly enough what I
originally was hired for before I moved
to systems administration so it got a
little bit of background there but I
totally got out of the whole web design
scene for a long-ass time and now when I
had to do some like you know cloud stuff
yeah I mean mootools is it's provided by
everything your your favorite CMS
anything that uses Ajax you know it's a
JavaScript library but this library
makes it super simple to do plus it's
pretty cool that you don't want to have
to think about everybody's get on it
don't reinvent the wheel so I've been
using the tools there's a bunch of
different ones out there well I really
like this one so let me know what you
guys use cuz there's I mean Eddie's out
there like there's plenty of cool god
we've got a bunch of projects that I
actually want to have redone like
eventually sometime this year I would
like to have the community redesign our
website that's mine think about it hack
5 radio I want to bring that back under
the umbrella and have that be a working
website I want
there's a couple other things that we
got in the pipeline but I just want to
throw that out there that start thinking
about it and if you want to start making
time and you know come up with some
ideas and stuff like that yeah there's
definitely some big things happening
with us yeah I want ponies no ponies
can't get ponies no unicorns no ponies
what's up with the shirts I see you're
sporting garb here
yes um yeah I mean these just came in
today okay so what happened was our our
relationship with jinx has come to a
heartfelt and it's we've had amicably
yes actually it's kind of an interesting
thing because you know we've been like
toying around with the idea of like
doing her own stuff and we had a
contract obligation with jinx where we
couldn't do our own stuff as long as we
were still with them but we still love
them and we you know it's it's one of
those fun more fun to DIY like Darrin
sit and stuff them stuff into envelopes
I'm feeling all of my closet space so I
house hey we're we're going a different
direction it's not you it's us and just
love when she says that dirty but except
for a nuke and and Jason over it yeah
exact we've got some great hookups you
know longtime friends lifetime friends
gonna be at very Jenks but we've also
got Jason Applebaum hooking us up with
you know the track jackets you know the
the shirts the polos eventually if
there's enough demand for this stuff we
will go ahead and we'll get quantities
printed however we're seeing how yeah
we're seeing how you guys respond to
yeah evil server and was like mmm but
anyway so go ahead and head on over to
oh this isn't gonna be up for a week or
two half $5 i stickers and maybe you'll
get a shirt randomly there's probably a
place to look the stickers since we're
gonna have to rename eventually by storm
now attack find out org slash stickers
