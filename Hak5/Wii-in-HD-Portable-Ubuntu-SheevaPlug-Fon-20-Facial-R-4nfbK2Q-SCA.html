your questions on this episode of pack 5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by Squarespace godaddy gamefly and
viewers like you hello and welcome to
hack 5 lounge edition my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse and this is

strike that we look forward to seeing
you again soon good luck with your
intergalactic journeys but guess who
else we have here dude jock star third
soccer's you know we've got we got six
hack stalkers with us today it's
italiano 40 loose acquire 42 Sam like
coke Zane 44 and clute man if you guys
haven't checked out hack stalkers head
over to hack stalkers com this is
restocked the wall that we keep talking
about scroll up here yeah we really love
these guys they're ton of fun to talk to
you there's a chat room there's webcam
and you can even watch us during the
entire thing so yeah that's that's it

cooler because it's audio video it's
it's mad chill I should hear any audio
uh I turned a lot but they're just being
you know quiet there was anything bad
awesome stuff for you guys is this week
that we're doing some more wii homebrew
oh yeah tons of stuff hey hey clute man
gets mad props for having a crap shoot
on tonight I'm going to be talking about
portable ubuntu for windows yeah and
then a little later on I have the Shiva
plug I have the fon to some fun embedded
devices yeah do my thing I round up the
best doom source some more do mods not
source mod source ports and
facial recognition one facial
recognition hmm yes bout time to know so
so tell me about this running wii games
in HD how does that work yeah so there's
this user on youtube he basically posted
up a whole bunch of videos of these wii
games just regular use you know that
you've played on your week and they were
720p and everybody was just like how
 did you do that what I honest it so
I looked it up turns out that you have
to download a couple of tools put them
on your we start downloading these games
straight from you your disc and there
you go you can play them under an
emulator called dolphin which i'll be
showing off next week just play them
inside this emulator in there you go so
hopefully we can get it running next
week but for now i'm gonna show you how
to actually set it up on your SD right
because the big deal is dolphin awesome
sounding emulator i understand that is
really a killer machine wise i don't
think it's going to run on either of our
netbooks I'm not literally run on
Darren's computer upstairs netbooks have
taken over the heck house no where's
Matt now target agha toys yeah so gonna
try it on my quad core I got you know
it's an SLI box with some some videos up
in there it's gonna be good hopefully it
works but in order to play this we need
it since my DVD ROM won't just read a
game disc right there's only like a very
few select DVD roms that actually can
read wii games we need to have an iso
the first thing I think what I think I
so is I let me just go over to the
Pirate Bay and download myself some
units right on that I hear that's
illegal yeah a little bit even if you
own smash brothers and then you download
smash brothers supposedly that's not so
i'll show you how to back it up
basically so that if you have okay so
how do we do this what so like let's get
it into so your brother destroys the
disc you have a backup of your game on
your computer that's good to keep in
mind or if you just want to play it in
720p because they tend to recycle the
game Cuban called it a week alright so
let's get started so you have your SD
card right and it's like you know two
gigs or whatever you stick it into your
computer and you have to download these
two different files the first one's
called the
a wad manager mmm and that one's by a
guy named juan in cocoa and we don't
want to get into the politics of that
but we know that you guys a little crazy
yeah well anyway I don't care the wad
manager works for me and it's version
1.3 if you guys are interested in it and
it works so whatever this here who made
it it does its thing of course we need
to mention this is building on the
home-brewed that we've been talking
about for the last couple of weeks with
the wii so you know you got to get the
homeless channel just go back to the
last episode if you haven't watched a
yeah you should download it right yeah
definitely you know download it I'm
watching you there you go okay the
second thing you need is the wii disc
dumper app okay what is that application
do for us um basically it lets you dump
the different pieces of the video game
from the disk onto the SD card awesome
pretty much jackups it's it's pretty
simple once you get all the pieces and
combine them onto your SD card it start
downloading how do we set it all up okay
so the first thing you have to do is
install the weed to stumper mm-hmm from
the weed dump st DOL that's included in
your we dump SD 1.2 rar file great yeah
it's dancing my ELF oh so you make this
new folder on your SD under the apps
directory which you made back in the
homebrew channel mhm make that um
directory all right hold on I'm of
okay that's okay we're in an overlay
okay oh yeah we are okay no no I man
enough layin host yeah it keeps
switching go go use these cameras like
that's good that case we're looking at
each other a lot so feel free to just I
had something in my eye and I was trying
to ignore it so I'll just pause for a
second
okay same 411 on twitter all right so
after you create that we dumper folder
in your apps directory you want to copy
the we done for SD DOL file into the we
dump or folder directory love the DA and
then the second thing you want to get is
the iOS 5 WOD which is also inside the
weed um Perez SD at one point 2 rar file
and to do that you got to put a wad
manager folder in your apps directory
and then copy the dll file into your wad
manager directory copying the new folder
in the root of your SD card called wad
and make sure that's all lowercase it's
very important I don't know why but it
is and then you copy the iOS 5 wad file
into the new wad folder alright alright
ok so that's pretty easy 35 also Darren
figured out when we were trying to do
this that you need to have images made
yan image.png yeah you need one for the
wad and one for the dumper so he just
called 111 dumper so they would show up
on the homebrew channel whenever you
bring it up right in the homebrew
channel the way that it works basically
is that you put in the slash apps folder
on your SD card you have a folder for
every particular homebrew application
each of those hungry applications you
need to rename to boot do L so the
dumper one reboot to boot dl same thing
with wad manager the it also every
application that you've called boot dl
inside of the particular folder needs to
supporting files you need an image PNG
and you need a meta.xml yeah and it's a
really easy XML file to edit just take a
look at any of the other homebrew
applications is it yeah yeah exactly
disqus you can just copy over yeah it's
kind of like it you know copying HTML
from a really cool website XML is so
your cities days not that I would know
anything about copying other force night
we're in the 2009 episode about the 95
alright so moving I'm sorry alright so I
got everything set up on earth yeah you
have everything on your SD card you're
good guy we've got a modder we though
for this all to work with the wad
manager like we car for with the iOS so
you gotta stick your SD card
to your wife and you got to include your
you know smash brothers CD or wed oh
yeah yeah whatever game you decide to
play whatever one you want to look at
site truck yes yes anyway the cool thing
about it on the website that you can get
all this information from it shows you a
list of the ones that are supported the
best with the dolphin emulator gotcha
and of course this is very early days
into this kind of very early so there
are some games not quite working so well
but then there are some ones that work
great so you know that's why it just got
over you know look through the gate game
list and see which one you wanted all
right now so what do we do now okay so
you got your SD card in your disk in
your wii so the first thing you're gonna
do is you're gonna boot up your homebrew
channel and you're gonna go into the i
think the WOD basically you're just
gonna load it up and it's gonna I think
it restarts your wii yeah pretty much
walks you through the installation of
these different wads if you're not
familiar with WOD they did a little bit
research on this basically this goes
into the territory where we don't
venture too much but basically with this
type of installation manager you can
install these wad files that could
perhaps be virtual console games that
you know maybe you didn't buy that's not
what we're looking to do here today but
you know just an FYI i think that's that
anyway whatever politics of homebrew you
know it is oh so we tell you some of
their for so once we have it patched
right and then we've got the iOS 5
installed with our wad manager and
reboots are we what do we do now so now
you're going to go back into the humber
channel you're gonna go to the dumper
program once you load that up it's going
to give you a bunch of choices it's
gonna say select your DVD type whether
you have a single layer a dual layer or
you're using a gamecube disc that you
want to back up each one is different so
i suggest going online and basically
just like googling super smash brothers
layer yeah DVD and it'll tell you super
smash brothers is single or dual i think
i think it's boys yeah yeah yeah that
one is yeah dual now we're using a two
gig SD card here if we were on the four
point oh firmware we would have the sdhc
support and we'd be able to do
you know to back you'll be able to back
up a hole right good pop like a big card
in there and probably do an all one
thing but the thing is it's a dual layer
DVD it's like eight nine gigs or
something so right so we're going to be
doing different parts basically so each
one has a set part number every
different kind of game for our super
smash brothers it has six different
parts so we're gonna end up having to
take the first part 1.5 gig parts 1.5
gigs so you also have to choose how many
gigs you how many megs you want to
download well fit yeah a little 1,500
mags gotcha whatever yeah so you choose
all those different things and then you
just start the download I do have to
mention it takes a long time for the
first one right we did it and we started
at 43 the yeah it took about two hours
for the 1500 megs so that's a deal vs 60
Hertz so this is something that you
would probably do like over over the
course of a couple days or so over the
course of day you know I get done yet
get onto your computer and start
googling I'm playing it but you know if
you got a slow internet connection
that's how long you'd probably take to
torrent it anyway and winners don't do
where's so that's good and hey that's
for a dual layer right fine we're
gamecube disc you could probably do that
in one part see anything game-changers
discs are a lot lot smaller yeah so
those definitely I know we can much tie
in those in HD though so anyway that is
how we get there I'll be back it up and
that's basically as far as we are right
now okay after you get those different
parts onto your SD card what you're
going to want to do is stick it back
into your computer copy over the part
that you had just got and then make sure
to you know erase it on your SD card so
you can copy the next part yeah free up
some space and then start that you know
lather rinse repeat do it six times for
dual layer three times for a single
layer one hopefully next week we'll be
able to combine all the different parts
for super smash brothers and get it
working on my computer in 720p I'm
excited to be playing some see dealer
mattress backs we'd be like Matt dude I
don't care what's your 436 season 2
don't know why I don't like the week I
just plain you know HD two thousand
dollar gaming rig to do it so i'll throw
out the links and all the information on
this i even get you
a really nice step by step on how to do
this on my blog at MC calm and it'll
also be in the show notes woohoo and if
you have any questions or feedback you
can email me snug z @ hak5 raka or
what's up with you I by 2 okay so here
it is 9s 5x 09 right so we are over two
months into the fifth season and I've
been all Linux this entire season up
until this particular episode I'm
rocking chrome my window is here but oh
oh saving grace i got ubuntu running
inside of windows let me let me uh let
minimize the hack socket let me just
turn on that sector for just a moment
here and they won't show you guys I'm
talking about alright so I'm in windows
here as you can see you know all my fun
apps and whatnot yeah but i also have
ubuntu running inside of my machine and
it's not like in a vmware it's inside of
its own little box it's integrating with
the with the rest of my you know with my
windows window manager basically I've
got nibbles here from Nome and I've got
you know I can go in here and launch you
know the different applications and
whatnot and this is what's called
portable ubuntu for windows okay and
there's not a whole lot of documentation
on this it's pretty sparse there's
usually not when it comes to this kind
of stuff well no there's usually like a
ton of documentation and it's all in
Greek yeah but it's a little sparse and
documentation and it's I got a preface
this by saying that it's not technically
a portable app in in the most pure sense
of the term because it does require you
to run it as administrator and you do
have to touch your file system because
you have to install a driver but other
than that it's basically you're you're
you know you can bring a bun to with you
I've got in on an eight gig SD card here
and it's only it's like one point eight
gigs uncompressed it's like a 400 Meg
download from you know portable ubuntu
sourceforge net and it's kind of cool
the way it works because it runs
everything in a single windows process I
mean to run it you pretty much just
download it you double click on this
little batch file here and this batch
file is really interesting what it whoa
wait wait so you're running you're
running an OS inside of an OS but it's
not a vm and you can run a boat well
same time it is a vm
that's the thing but it's not your
traditional VN that's what I'm going to
show you so it runs this this try thing
here and if I actually take a look at
this try oh it's cool tray run and we
can see here's you know here's a like
when you boot up you get your regular
boot screen up in here but you know they
make it easy to minimize that so you
don't have to mess with that anyone it
runs as a single process and the way
that this works is we're using what's
called cooperative Linux or sometimes
called co Linux it's a unique vm it it
basically allows a guest operating
system to have complete control over the
host machine it'sit's fully privileged
which is not like how your typical VMs
work like VMware and whatnot so
basically what it does is it melds both
the windows NT kernel and the linux
kernel together so that they work
cooperatively on the same hardware
that's better yeah and that's why you
need to install that driver to get this
running you do have to have the co Linux
driver which does have to touch your
your windows system a little bit but and
then that's why you needed men but that
driver basically allows the host
operating system in this case windows to
work cooperatively with Linux yeah nice
but you know as a 400 Meg download if
you know if you've ever played with
something like cygwin if you've ever
yeah yeah I was gonna ask you about yeah
if you ever run yeah you know linux and
a vm you're looking for something simple
you just wouldn't you know cuz i've got
a bunch of you you're talking about ask
a security application in a screenshot
app oh yeah you're like it's only for
linux right now and I'm like I will just
load it up in I don't know vm and thumb
well now if you had this yeah have you
had this you could just go ahead and you
know load up your bun to hear you could
you know go right into the terminal and
you'd be all set so you know I'm excited
to have best of both worlds for when I
do have to be on the windows side for
Chrome yeah but other than that i'm
happy with ubuntu native but yeah sounds
pretty nice looks like it's running
really smoothly and every actually no I
do have to well I be my only testing
with this has been on my netbook so the
atom processor it takes a little while
right to it once ever
thing gets going it runs ok like my
nibbles game here takes a little while
but now my little nibbly guy can totally
get that diamond and it will be awesome
what's important to note here though is
that if you're running Windows Vista or
XP 64 you're not going to have a whole
lot of fun with this because it's not
for 64-bit windows it just won't run so
anyway hopefully the developers will I
mean this is it was released in
September of last year documentation
jeske man februari so hopefully more
progress will be done in this project
but I'm excited danza you know see how
this goes sounds pretty cool yeah I want
to play with it alright can i play with
it yes yeah but not until we find out
what's going on with a land party yes
first we are going to place goal tag for
due to its on april twenty fifth and
we're going to be playing at three pm
eastern EST time in the US the server is
up all month at dhoom hak5 org and you
can also check out all the details and
get any downloads that you might need at
hak5 land squarespace.com and that's
where you can hit us up and let us know
if there's any custom wads you think we
should be playing we're gonna be playing
with the the default doom 2 wad i got
links up on the post there about how to
get it through steam or Google or
whatnot but you know hit us up it's all
month long or come in on the
twenty-fifth I'm excited about plans for
customers yeah I'm excited to play to
play to it's free where can they get all
those details hak5 lando squarespace com
rock on I already said that minute cool
weren't listening to me no I was I was I
was just actually better than that as I
was I was totally doesn't listen to me
building it up I'm all I talking about
Squarespace right here he is just like I
was really like it like where do you
find the details a little little segue
to our plug before we're gonna take a
break and think one of our awesome
sponsors Squarespace we'll be right back
seat

code hak5 all right you guys don't know
this but living in the heck out so you
get a whole bunch of crap in the mail
all the time Darren's got this fun 2
point 0 which yeah it looks pretty cool
and this what is this it's a saga it's a
Shiva plug Eva play yeah it sounds like
a creature from Final Fantasy know this
this guy's like a badass wall wart
computer there's no it's a computer this
is a computer hey I was gonna say wow
looks like a bunch of Port Said much
it's a it's like an overgrown ipod that
plugs into the wall and ends up what is
it what's it do computer do it runs
linux what else would it tell Linux I
should have guessed yeah this is the
Shiva plug from marvell semiconductor
and this was pointed out to me by so
many people this great article over at
Linux devices I've heard they've been in
the news a lot lately yeah this is a
really fun upcoming device that a lot of
some manufacturers are starting to use
it it's an open device it's an open
platform uh it you know and its really
like low power it's got a decent chip in
it right so it's got like a 1.2
gigahertz ARM chip in it so you know a
little bit of horsepower they're only
taking did I mention only taken that's
45 watts power maybe what 5 watts yeah
yeah so it's a little late wallboard
dude this is this is what you would
replace like okay so we actually had a
laptop when we were doing the the
missile cam the missile thing where you
could shoot Kirby with lasers and
missiles and stuff we had an entire
laptop dedicated to running yeah java
application and this is what would
replace it if i were saying so I just
you know got one of these and I
absolutely love it so like I said by
Marvel they run run between fifty and a
hundred dollars this is actually the
developers kit so you can pick one of
these up right now for about a hundred
bucks or if you are like a manufacturer
you can totally get like you know and
you want to buy these in bulk and stuff
you can get them down to like 50 bucks
apiece what for an embedded device kind
of cool yeah so they've got an API for
those interested in doing a lot of
development with them I'm actually
playing with that right now trying to
see what kind of cool stuff I can come
up with so no hacks today no thanks
today but it just wanted to kind of
introduce the hardware because I just
got both of these in I'm having a lot of
mom playing with them and I'm just kind
of coming up with some ideas of what can
be done with them so for example to
shave a plug I've got you know USB 2
i've got my 10 100 ethernet on the
developer edition i actually get a nice
little USB for direct access to the
serial port oh yeah that's some good
stuff there unfortunately no Wi-Fi but i
do have USB so i can do that i'm trying
to think of like how i can integrate it
with like the hack house or make some
home automation stuff with it already
some companies like cloud engine has a
device called the proto plug which uses
this and i think we saw that at CES and
it's basically a web-accessible data
store so you like to plug a hard drive
into it and you could access that over
the Internet yeah yeah there's also the
the cloud plug which is another one
that's that's an ass so you just plug
this into your network plug the USB hard
drive into it BAM done and then there's
the hip server which is a media server
for you know all your videos and stuff
like that I don't know there's a lot of
potential with this it's a fun little
project because it has it seems like it
has enough power to actually do
something so right now maybe I'll just
use it for the missile thing bring that
back or I may use it as the host to
drive the tank the house rose we still
need to finish that project yeah so I
although I'm thinking about a beagle
board for that anyway regardless um on
this looks like a fun in
linux device that i'm going to be
playing with soon so that goes over a
global scale yeah that you can you can
buy one of those over at global scale
technologies retailer some it's a Marvel
device and and you know Marvel has a
great track record of doing good devices
the other one is the fon two point oh
this is actually a fond 2 point 0 beta
and if you look at this guy here he
looks very similar to if you're familiar
with a fond plus just like that this is
the faun 2202 and I thought you know
you've got your dual ethernet here it's
aight megs of flash you've got an
atheros 180 megahert chipset on there
and you know red boot all that fun stuff
32 megs of ram what you would expect
from something like a fun plus but the
real big addition here is right here you
actually have a USB port and that's
what's most important and that is a USB
2 port and i gotta say this is the first
device to come out of fun that I don't
immediately want to unlock and strip and
and put a bunch of you know like do put
roll my own with why is that well fons
doing something a little innovative here
they're actually maybe they're listening
to the community and actually listen you
know seeing what's being done with their
devices because you can actually do some
plugins with this for example there's a
dime dns plugin so you can get it got us
if you don't have static IP that's nice
you can do backups just like with the
Shiva plug you know pop the top a little
hard drive on the network here and just
backups with it with an audio with a USB
audio device you can use this to stream
audio to it and have it kind of like a
cheap airtunes you can do network
printer with it you could do like a
webcam that's exciting and those are all
just like the fon plugins there's also
3rd party plugins like a like a proxy
plugin that allows you to proxy one of
the interfaces you can there's a their
support for a couple of 3g cards that's
very exciting so you've got a USB port
here right can you imagine running a
pineapple on this where it's got a USB
for a 3g thing so I just plug my
blackberry
over the USB it tethers and I've got
like the ultimate you know yeah I get
like a pineapple where and even have
been you're nearby to get on some wife
you have to depend on Wi-Fi being in the
area love these Crosby hak5 without
funds and pineapples well I think this
one might end up being a vegetable well
okay primate you know something like
that definitely not a mammal anyway so
those are the two embedded linux devices
that i'm playing with and you know fifty
dollars for the phone too it's about to
come out this is a beta unit so i had it
for a little bit going to be doing some
fun hacks with it later and what I want
to hear from you guys is what you would
do if you had like I mentioned those
capabilities if you had a Shiva plug if
you had a fun too what kind of crazy
stuff would you like to put together
kind of inspire us and we have a special
trip for that right up there on the
forms hak5 dot org slash forms anyway
enough about linux embedded devices what
i really want to know about is is how
facebook can recognize my face when I'm
looking all pretty facial recognition on
facebook finally is it that awesome I
mean that just sounds cool I love the
new facebook okay so there's there's
this team over at face calm they are
working on creating a whole bunch of
facial recognition type programs for all
over the place all over the internet
right now the first one they did is this
application on face book called photo
finder and it's this perfect little toy
for anybody who has like a ton of
pictures and they don't feel like
tagging themselves and more they have
lots of friends and they have no clue
where all those pictures are and they
don't even want to look through all the
tags of them to find out if there's
anything bad in there that they don't
want to be involved in or anything like
that so you can actually go through and
let it load up all of the faces that
it's found of you and then find out if
any of them aren't you or if any of them
you don't want to be tagged for mine the
first thing it's all is these hundred
and eighteen auto tags these are just
ones that have found out there that
either weren't as
they were but I didn't know about so
these are photos of you that weren't
tagged as as being you now are they
expect were they your photos were they
your friends photos oh they could be
both you could they be like anyone's
photos there from what I'm understanding
here it's just your friends okay so it's
not gonna use it to crawl the internet
and like find pictures yeah yeah okay
like I you know I accept a ton of fan
requests and lots of viewers there you
go friend me on Facebook site wats
picture and you were in it like at a
conference or something and somebody
yeah yeah there you know it'll see it'll
find my smile in there and it'll be like
oh that's Shannon so it'll drag it and
it'll say it'll give you this little
question at the bottom you know it'll
say ninety two percent accuracy on this
photo says that it it's probably you do
you want to check it as you or do you
want to close it and say it's not you
now if you accept it it just says
accepted at all now if you decide to
close one and you say that's not me you
can press the X and it says it gives you
the choice it either says it's unknown
or it says I know who this is so you can
choose from your friends and say oh yeah
yeah that's that sound so and then it
know there was this one picture in here
that was my sister it thought it was me
kind of money sister doesn't look that
much like you know she's orange and I'm
white you couldn't white balance off
your sister so I had to go in there and
press the X and say I know who this is
this is brittany so i did that and then
it never appeared again it disappeared
from my lands yeah that's really cool
you know Apple came out with a feature
in the new iphoto that's very similar to
this and it's kind of interesting to see
how as facial recognition technology
just get more prevalent how we start so
I love it the applications like this in
social networks so weird like you can
find this stuff you know in casino
security systems but I've never seen
this on the Internet that's what we need
is this is a security you know a
security system in the casino that's
going to say oh hey this Shannon look
pull up a proton facebook profile yeah
there we go yeah network of all of her
friends and then scan for her friends in
the casino do all sorts of crazy stuff
with this another interesting thing
about this is while it's going through
all your friends and all of your
pictures it has this little tab up here
this is who's this
so it has all these photos under your
friends and your photos then hat it has
no clue who these people are so you can
go through here and help the help the
application learn you can go through
here and start tagging people and then
over over time it'll learn and it'll be
able to tag those people in future
photos and then you cannot us also add
yourself to this watch list so anytime
new photos are added on to it it'll pay
attention to them so if somebody were to
upload a photo and that it potentially
had you they'd send you a little note
and say hey we think there's a photo
finder ill it'll even email you and
it'll be like hey I think I found a
hundred more photos of you do you want
to get out no I now I understand the
name it lives up to its name is the
content is great it finds your photos
here we go it's pretty cool i really
like it we can we just go ahead and sign
up and start using this out right now it
is an alpha you know if they say there's
a lot of bugs i haven't found very many
bugs right now it's a little bit slow
and its first loading up all your photos
but that's about it um so they're very
welcoming you know I signed up for the
the press alpha gotcha just so I could
show it off to everybody else and they
were very welcoming they gave me a note
s you know when you press the kind of
are oh yeah and they said I could share
this with 10 friends Oh Brock on well
then to have people hit you up on
Twitter they should add you as friends
on Twitter and they should give away
Lance there you go at sna ubs cool let
me tell you guys about trivia right look
you want to move on just do some trivia
stuff I know what's going on here um

alright you remember how last week we
had doomed to school tagged by Darren
all right we've been getting a ton of
feedback the entire week I swear to god
I've never seen so many emails about one
friggin segment but everybody loved it
so what's up this week well okay I got I
got to put the final chapter in the doom
thing because you know me I'm crazy
about Jim and I'll stop talking about it
here when I just go ahead and finish it
with this chapter and do my round up of
all of the excellent doom source ports
that have been sent to me lately I swear
it seems like everybody on the twitters
and everywhere have been saying that
there's be talkative as well yes there's
a lot of good dude stuff to go check out
I mean doom fans are fanatic man if you
go and check out doom worldcom ya see
Paul's give me the pound there because
he loves the doom on the ipod reference
season 2 for that but doom worldcom is
the place doomed a wikia anyway so let
me go ahead and give you guys a
gathering a little round up here of my
top doom source port pics ok first is
doom legacy this is actually the first
doom source port that I've ever played
hasn't been updated since 2006 but is
very feature-rich 32 player tcp/ip
OpenGL support looks great kind of solid
I like it but dude doomsday I had no
idea about doomsday this actually sent
to me from brian w doomsday at dooms HQ
com is the place to get it and it is
it's an engine it's compatible with doom
with hexen with heretic and it's uh
here's the best part for windows
mac and linux i know i said in the last
episode that skull tag was for windows
mac and linux it's actually for windows
and linux this one is windows mac and
linux and dude oh my god it is the most
gorgeous doom us what I've ever played
it is absolutely phenomenal the the plug
and support that they have for 3d models
I actually as soon as I loaded this up I
actually ran through and played doom ii
1 m 1 or I'm sorry the entire episode 1
you know and did a little run-through
beat it got about eighty-five percent
secrets on most everything so you know
still got it I think somewhat but but
dude is gorgeous I really love that one
now another really cool one that was
sent in from Richard Gardner is classic
dhoom3 or doom three classic however you
want to put it dude this thing is a
basically a rien visioning of doom for
the from for basically doom one and only
the first episode so all of the great
John Romero maps the star levels if you
will re envisioned using the doom 3
engine so it's not a source port in the
sense that you're taking the wad file
from the old doom if you don't have doom
one or two that's fine the rest of these
you need to have a legit wad from doom
one or two or the shareware this all you
need is doom 3 I just you know I've got
a copy off steam their new version
supports the steam it's a it's a great
little mod that just you know you load
up your dooms use the mods ankle and get
going and it's really interesting to see
how people basically re-envision those
maps because I mean you didn't have a
whole lot of Polly's back then hell you
couldn't even have layers on top of
layers and so it is really cool to see
it's basically in the spirit of doom but
with the doom 3 engine and I've got to
say like I was playing on nightmare and
I've never had it kicked my ass so hard
like that is a hard doom so an
interesting read envisionment also
couldn't do this roundup without
mentioning eternity engine now eternity
engine is an evolution of a thing called
men's better Marines best friend which
was at a mod which was a source port
where the doom guy actually had a dog
that was with him and like helped him
out and stuff
I love video games where you get like a
little dog or lay yeah like table 2 I
can wow where you had a little creature
that followed you you remember what that
when you were level 70 right she's never
know Dave Wow in her life um I I played
enough to actually create a character
and then my old computer pooped out on
me and I took it as an act of God it was
it was an active ordinary monster or
something some some greater being saying
you saying you should not play this game
and I was like okay not gonna play it
what are we talking about again doom
right so turning eternity engine is
basically the purest doom it's the most
backwards compatible with boom it's
it'll run your demos and i think it's
it's it's a good one to take a look at
but you know the other ones are also
especially doomsday dude doomsday oh so
but anyway remember we're playing skull
tag which is also just as I mean there's
five dooms right there for you so get
your do them on and and enough with the
dumari right hey then you're gonna put a
bed for a while unless of course I can
get a fondue to run doom but I mean
aside from that I get a USB port i could
put a USB monitor ah so 10 is ok tell me
where i can get my my game fix now cuz
that cuz i gotta get your dude yeah well
i need to play a game that's not from
1993 where can i play current games

I got this on Twitter and it's from k
zap 333 and he writes someone reminded
me it's technically not a land party as
it's not local but I wouldn't know what
to call it i guess in reference to the
hak5 LAN party yeah so I have a friend
back at home just he said the exact same
thing except the way he said it he said
you know you're wrong you're wrong it's
not land party it's a win party and you
know what you know what it's over over
the internets weeks do man we got him
correct and I was just like right I was
like all right listen Todd night listen
up if you tune into heck stockist Arnett
and watch us on the land a land party I
will see that we're having a land in the
house all downstairs so I don't care if
it's lan or win okay who wants to go
around saying hey this might sway in
party that's sales like crap I'm saying
on the Indian you gotta deal with it I'm
done have a little Wang party no its
land okay I don't want to say weird all
right but yes we know but maybe we had a
little VPN I don't know that still be
aware yeah whatever alright okay alright
what's next I'll read the next one what
twitch tastic yet which tasik rights ass
about jQuery the best JavaScript library
yes I talked about mootools last week
and since then I've been getting a lot
of comments about different frameworks
one in particular jquery and dude just
go over and check out the demos on
jQuery UI calm as a web developer that
is kind of like I haven't really done a
whole lot with the scene of web
development for a while and that now
that of doing that stuff again oh my god
it makes things so easy to use a nice
framework in jQuery is one of those you
should check out so listen if you guys
have some other frameworks you think I
should check out let us know good stuff
but I fell in love with jquery easily
next question fiji writes us about adobe
spy reframe work yes another awesome
javascript ajax like like I said you
know just like and you know I was
playing with that one and it is pretty
full featured I like their accordions I
like some of their other widgets good
stuff so anyway but send us some more
because I would love to see you know
what other frameworks you web developers
use jquery and and Adobe's seem really
cool but you know more is always bad
now Ron em rights in regarding the 90s
show and he says love the show I missed
one thing near the end of the show you
said to go to BBS hak5 org he says that
we should make like a joke page or
something where you when you go to it I
think he's assuming you go to it your
web browser with eight yeah yeah I get
it yeah oh you filmin um yeah we have a
bulletin board system where you know you
go to your command prompt and you go to
BBS hak5 org and you can play video
games and you can chat in the little IRC
client and then we got like message
board stuff anyway it helmet so the key
fine yes telnet dot what does it tell
that to be yes I'm not work that's it so
yeah I killed the ringing by the way
there's no watch out web server on there
but that's fine doesn't need one
whatever so tell that over to that and
you will be just immersed in epic
nostalgia and finally Fiji asks in
regards to our mentioned website
redesign if we would accept template
mock-ups here's the thing we are pretty
much tied to WordPress and yeah it's
good stuff so I mean all of our content
is there and that means template that
we're working for with is excellent so I
guess we could kind of come up with you
it would take a look at your mock-ups as
inspiration whatnot but unless you're
actually a wordpress theme developer
were already a little bit committed to
to the theme that we're doing but that
doesn't mean if you've got some inputs
and ideas of what you would want to see
you know it's up there also we have a
