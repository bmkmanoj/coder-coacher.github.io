plug Kinsella cotton Valley fight Isis
and hey remember that net neutrality
thing all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings citizens I'm Patrick
Norton this is threat wire for December
9 2015 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom and oh my goodness is 2015
running out with a blast look we're
fairly a political here a threat wire
though we lean pretty hard towards
freedom and openness it's what we do and
we know a lot of you all can't stand
politics or politicians whether we're
talking Republican Democrat libertarian
socialist tin foil hat whatever you hate
them all that says let's be honest
politicians have a pretty big impact on
personal and internet freedoms yeah I
know duh but as we record this video in
early December we're still waiting to
see if a writer in the financial
appropriations bill is going to
effectively defund the FCC's ability to
regulate quote directly or indirectly
the prices other fees or data caps and
allowances as such terms are described
in paragraph 164 the report and order on
remand to Tory ruling an order in the
matter of protecting and promoting the
open Internet adopted by the federal
communications commission on februari 26
2015 end quote I get a little passionate
here look it's really simple that bill
that financial bill has to be passed on
December 11th about two days from now or
the government will shut down whether or
not the writer is in there that turns
off net neutrality as well envisioned by
the FCC will know more about that next
week look whether you are pro net
neutrality or cognate neutrality do
yourself a favor develop a relationship
with your local Congress critters boast
in the House and Senate and learn the
best ways to influence them because they
will be voting on things that impact
technology and our future using it in
the wake of the terrorist attacks that
left 14 dead last week in San Bernardino
President Obama said quote I will urge
high tech and law enforcement leaders to
make it harder for terrorists to use
technology to escape from justice and a
senior administration official secretly
told Reuters last Sunday night or
anonymously told Reuters that the White
House would reach
to tech companies quote to offer a clear
understanding of when we believe social
media is being used actively and
operationally to promote terrorism
adding that they are going to work with
law enforcement when the use of social
media quote crosses the line from
expressing views into active terrorist
plotting end quote okay I hear y'all
shouting how the NSA can already track
all that but the same anonymous official
told Reuters that quote it is a deeply
concerning line that we believe has to
be addressed there are cases where we
believe that individuals should not have
access to social media for that purpose
end quote I am all about stopping
terrorism but this promises to be both
technically and legally challenging
somewhat more complicated than say
taking down episodes of a popular comedy
on YouTube the night after it's gone
live hold on people this is going to be
an interesting ride we've been banging
the drum on the security issues that go
hand in hand with the Internet of Things
all year now it turns out that Barbie
more accurately hello Barbie the
internet connected version is insecure
cns Laura hatala writes quote
researchers found the application in the
cloud server that connect the doll to
the internet would allow attackers to
cut through security protections and
access recordings of children's
conversations with Barbie and quote not
creepy enough for you that is on top of
the news last week that hello Barbie
could be used to track home addresses of
folks with the doll the cnet article
reports that matelas partner on the
connected doll toy talk has set up a bug
bounty program to aid in stomping out
security issues with the doll no news as
to whether or not the doll will allow
you to hack into someone's home Allah
some of the less secure light bulbs out
there yes few more thoughts before I go
don't forget people December 8th was
patched Tuesday SC magazines Terrie
Robinson notes quote after a year that
saw 135 bulletins from Microsoft the
tech giant released 12 bulletins eight
of them critical in the final patch
tuesday of 2015 including 140 they found
in the windows kernel ms 15 135 hope I
got that number right meanwhile Krebs on
security says quote adobe released the
patch that fixed a whopping 78 security
vulnerabilities in its flash player
software
seriously compare that 78 in flash to
the 71 flaw is covered by those windows
updates that came out yesterday updates
people there a real good idea by the way
seriously flash probably doesn't need to
be on your machine seriously just leave
it inside a chrome and just get it
everywhere and just get it out of just
get it out of everywhere else is that
too much of this at the end meanwhile
wired says bitcoins creator Satoshi
Nakamoto is probably this unknown
Australian genius well formerly unknown
both wired and gizmodo have written
about Craig Steven Wright in the last
few days either right invented Bitcoin
wired says or he's a brilliant hoaxer
who very badly wants us to believe that
he did which could get complicated
because news reports are surfacing that
writes home and offices were raided by
Australian police last night it's about
taxes people not Bitcoin at least that's
what ARS technica is reporting oh and if
you're lucky enough to live in a city
where AT&amp;amp;T u-verse gigapower is trying
to compete with Google Fiber it means
you can get the 110 dollar a month
service for just seventy dollars one
caveat you'll have to opt into a quote
internet preferences option which gives
a DNT permission to examine each
customer's web traffic in order to serve
personalized ads nice summary what's
going on there by IT blog watch and hey
at least the cap on that is one terabyte
a month do not get me started on Comcast
little long-term game on data caps and
charging you more for services quick
