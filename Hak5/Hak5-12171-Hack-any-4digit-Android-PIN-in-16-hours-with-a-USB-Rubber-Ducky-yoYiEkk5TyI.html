latest Android 4.2 jelly bean with a USB
rubber ducky and Y remote wipe may not
save you then which OS is best for
everyday pen testing I check out back
box plus DD rescue to the rescue all
that and more this time on hack 5 this
segment of hack 5 is brought to you by
goto assist hello and welcome to hack 5
my name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us
welcome to december oh it is december i
guess so yeah yeah your went by super
fast hey no don't be one of those people
that are making where's our tree oh yes
we need to set up our Christmas tree
there you go we'll get that on yeah yeah
um get this this is fun
what yeah so I lost my passport but I'm
holding it right now and okay so I
called the passport authority and report
that I lost it and then as you should do
and then as soon as I get off the phone
I reach in my back pocket and guess
what's in my back pocket oh no answer
did you call him back no they made me
twice confirm that like I understand
that by bla bla bla bla bla
it's no good and so I guess I should
burn this I I don't know what do I do
I guess burning your property what
sounds like a very anti-american thing
to do plan your scrapbook no you don't
you have like little stamps in there
can't you get in a lot of trouble if you
have two IDs whatever I have like six
IDs cuz they're all in my scrapbook it's
awesome cuz I also found my driver's
license I'm like oh yeah well this rule
that's like cut in half no no that's not
the Virginia okay that's yeah I just
thought Darren lose things a lot the
only reason I'm sharing this is because
I'm bummed out about the fact that I now
have to to get a new passport and I'm
gonna leave the RFID and it's gonna be
like six months for you to actually
receive it yeah it takes that long oh
it's like it's six to ten weeks no it's
not it's like six months really yeah no
it's like well after sandy it was six
months oh they were the past play we're
saying that it's going to be six months
yeah my
friend my friend Lindsey has to get a
passport oh and they're telling her that
it's delayed because of Hurricane sandy
okay so if you know ways that I can get
into Canada without a passport feedback
at hak5 org I got a fantastic show guys
for you this week you're getting into
fun distros of Linux game testing yay I
love checking out Linux Linux distros so
I'm checking out back boxes and they
love checking you out too I have mr. an
USB rubber ducky hacking of Android
phones because it turns out you can just
go at this all day long I'm at World War
2 you can do here in just a moment
cuz I just recorded the segment and now
we're recording out of order and I want
to see how high it is I'm so excited uh
hundred fifty attempts I might be a lot
enjoyed it yeah it'll be fun okay so
with all of that said I guess I'll just
throw to myself where we're gonna talk
about brute-forcing Androids to you guys
remember last week we were talking about
the fun stuff that we're developing with
the USB rubber ducky and I've been
having a ton of fun in Android because
just like any other computer they love
human inputs and what is the USB rubber
ducky well it's a human interface device
that mimics human input as a keyboard
and through it we can do some really fun
stuff I've used it in the past to say
brute force the bios password on an old
machine where you happened to have
forgot the bios password and somebody in
the comments on YouTube and mentioned
hey why don't you try brute-forcing
Android too which myself as well as many
other people automatically go like dude
are you kidding they're gonna like after
five tries and if the way like 10
minutes and then after like a hundred
tries or fifty tries or whatever it may
be it's just gonna format the device and
it's gonna be no fun and then you'll
have sad pants on and nobody wants to
wear sad pants but it turns out that is
totally not the case and I was like holy
freaked out when I came in to try to put
together a segment for you guys that's
basically the idea of like why online
brute-forcing typically doesn't work
except for today when it does which is
pretty cool because you know we
typically think about like security as
you know just a measure of like security
and convenience especially when it comes
to mobile you know nobody wants to type
in like a big-ass password like I've got
like an 80 character
Gmail password and let me tell you it's
no fun to have to type or swipe in fact
you can't swipe it many little things to
go into so mitigating you know the the
convenience and security frayed off
there a lot of people go with like a
four digit passcode and so many times
it's been said oh well just you know use
a pin code on your Android device
because that swipe to unlock is no good
as cause has pointed out here Kyle
Osborne on this show cause do with his
p2p adb software go back in the hak5
archive and find yourself a copy of that
episode you get all learned up on how
you can bypass the swiped on lock screen
or you know looking at the smudges you
can say like oh look did go up and then
down and then over and it's like a
Tetris block but I'm bar my use in this
course and so the idea is like use a pin
code that'll save you it's good enough
security because nobody wants to like
type in a really long password and the
idea has always been also that if you
lose your phone you've got time you'll
be ok because you can remote wipe that
phone and you know that these are all
very good ideas but I think that I think
that a lot more could be done to save
you so I've actually put together a
really fun scenario using a stock
out-of-the-box Android 4.2.1 like latest
version as is on a Galaxy Nexus and I
figured that this would be a great
example of showing off some fun stuff we
can do in bash some fun stuff we can do
with the ducky script and some you know
a great example of an online brute-force
attack and some of the caveats involved
there so first of all what we're going
to need to do is put together a ducky
script to do our brute-force attack and
I don't want to rewrite the firmware and
I don't want to spend an hour writing a
text file but this is the perfect time
to be using things like brace expansion
so why don't we just go ahead and have
our ducky script written out in bash and
I'm assuming you're already familiar
with ducky script if you're not it looks
like this we could do nano ducky script
txt yeah yeah and then it would be like
script hello world and then we'd enter
and then we could like it alt and then
f4 and then that would do exactly what
you would expect it to do so what if we
want a ducky script text file that
includes every number from zero zero
zero zero and nine nine nine nine well
if you've been watching what is it
called act tip with Shannon on the kind
of Linux patchy stuff you'll remember
that race expansion is a great way to do
that so let's go ahead and create a file
here or I'll give you an example I'm
going to echo let's see in this case
squiggly bracket zero zero zero zero dot
dot and then 0 0 10 and you can see it
just prints out kind of those and so
that's pretty cool and so expanding on
this I can say go to nine nine nine nine
and what we'll do with this is I'm going
to pass this to X args which is a really
cool tool for manipulating stuff and
we're going to say we want one column of
these and we're going to prefix it with
echo string so if I do that I now have
string and it might take a while but you
can see there it's going all the way to
nine nine nine nine so let's continue
with this at this point what I'm going
to want to do is add a couple of things
because if I start brute-forcing
on my android device every five attempts
it's going to tell me to wait so check
this out I'll take here with my galaxy
note and I'll just say one two three
four up one two three five now three six
three seven one two three eight oh hey
check that out I've typed my password
incorrectly five times I now need to
wait 30 seconds and I can hit OK here
but still counting at 21 20 19 and so
what I want to do here is put in
something that'll allow me to later go
ahead and change that to a sort of delay
and so I'll just use this as a
opportunity to every five put the word
wait and we'll come back and change that
later so if I say said and then do zero
tilda five and then s slash dollar slash
I'm going to do a backslash n which will
do a carriage return here and I'll type
the word wait / G and then if I print
this in fact let me change this from
nine nine nine nine to like a hundred so
you can see there there we go we can see
every fifth line we've inserted the word
wait which is awesome except I also need
to put a delay in here because if I type
this quickly it's going to freak out my
Android phone and I'll really start
fuzzing it I had a lot of fun with them
rebooting a lot so I'm going to also add
in here another said and that's going to
be a 0 tilde 1 so it's every other and
then it will be s slash dollar flash and
then a backslash n for a carriage return
delay 1000 so that delays 1000 cycles or
milliseconds and then backslash n I'm
going to do enter backslash n enter and
then slash g for global so it does it
everywhere and close my tick or my quote
so now every other command has delay and
two enters so that means on the android
keyboard it's going to be waiting you
know one second and then it's going to
damn enter twice and the reason that I
want to do that is because you know I've
just typed in a character and I also
want to make sure that I'm keeping that
screen on it's going to be very
important when we start getting to the
points where we're waiting for 30
seconds what not so with all of that I
should go ahead and actually fix that
wait because that wait isn't actually a
ducky script command that's just a
placeholder for me to later come in and
change that with something that will
wait 30 seconds so in this case what I'm
going to do is pipe this again and now
I'm doing a lot of piping that's
probably better way to do this but I
know said and this works for me and I'm
going to say s slash wait so anytime I
see wait I want to change that to delay
5,000 and then a carriage return or an
enter by doing backslash n the word
enter which tells the ducky to press the
Enter key
on the Android delay another 5,000 and
then Beck's 10 and then enter and then
backslash N and then delay 5,000 one
more time and then backslash n enter and
then finally what is that is that three
okay we'll do it once more to be sure as
I want to make sure that we have ample
time here all right that looks good
let's see I have a backslash n after all
of my commands and that should do it and
select G for global and and my quote
there and now you can see I have all of
these every five instead of saying wait
it will say the light 5,000 and to delay
five doesn't enter delay 5,000 enter I
forgot a backslash n so this is what
happens when you forget a backslash n
that that's a carriage return in now
I've got entered delight which is not a
command so where did I mess that up must
have been on the third one so say 5,000
bexon's and enter rebec's which handle
85,000 eggs and enter your back sister
and lay five that was in backslash and
enter backslash n there it is okay
now when I do that huzzah everything
looks right okay so this is exciting I'm
going to take all of this and I'm going
to pipe it into a file we're going to
call it root five dot txt because we're
on the fifth iteration here and let me
be sure to actually change this from
zero zero zero zero to nine nine nine
nine and we'll send that to a file
called root five dot txt now I also want
to put at the very top of the file delay
1000 or maybe maybe 5,000 yeah I'll put
like a delay 5,000 in there just to be
sure at the very top of the file so in
order to do that this type in delay
5,000 or I could just do this with nano
or Y or Emacs or whatever but I'm going
to pipe that into the file root 5 txt
and then after that with a semicolon
it's going to start doing the rest of
this and when it gets to the end it's
two walkers so it'll append that to the
file that
we just created with that first echo
statement and that just takes a moment
to generate now of course there's
probably a way to do this all in a brace
expansion or with regular expressions
maybe no probably not but there's
probably a ton of other ways to do this
so if you know of some really cool Bashi
ways to do it hit us up in the comments
or email us and tell me why my piping to
pipe to pipe to pipe the pipe is will
fail either way I just created a huge
file that does zero through nine nine
nine and that's what's important to me
in fact if I do if I do a more on that
file this time of year between the
holidays bad weather sick days everyone
is spending time away from the office
but taking time as an IT person is
really challenging now users always need
support networks and systems always need
to be managed and that's why I'm
recommending go to assist from Citrix it
has three essential support tools in one
easy-to-use integrated cloud-based
platform there's go to assist remote
support which lets you provide
unattended support to any PC or Mac or
mobile device from anywhere even an iPad
or an Android device from their free app
and so you can take some time away from
the office to plus go twist this
monitoring lets you proactively identify
issues before they become a big problem
and you can keep track of all of this
from go to assist service desk
it's assisted mins dream I know when I
was assistant min in DC I was using go
