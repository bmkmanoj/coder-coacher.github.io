until me TECA bad but you put me up to
that and you suck what I didn't put you
up to it oh did you didn't that was your

idea doing a half five episode from the
hospital Oh Lady crap oh I remember that
you're like that was so sad you was like
what happened to you did you have a
motorcycle accident again everything
hitters like Alexa with me here
oh this is wait this isn't even in the
script how'd this get in here from
something now oh this is the this is
actually after the motorcycle accident
yeah so Darren's on drugs during this
episode literally there painkillers or
something so this doesn't make me look
good because the last three has been
like me either drunk or in the hospital
or now drinking wine possibly on
painkillers not knowing that I was
supposed to cut this out oh this might
actually be the best blooper of all time
I don't know cuz it's not a blooper it's
like in there it's in the show I can't
believe this got left in the show hak5
has no quality control none wow I so I
found out like immediately after posting
it but what are you gonna do like sip

like sorry little loopy um record and we
talked about those thank you to himself

it all I mean I counted myself so they
look at me doc we're really behind me
during that entire thing look she's God

set my back hair was really black
checking in on you as you progress oh

same as I was two seasons ago except for

nine now with more how did that get
here well speaking of more boy over
here Oh
it's Paul welcome to best songs pants
this makes me so happy because Paul is
more OG than 0 geomag buffers yeah this
was the most exciting thing ever is
getting everyone out here and I can't
tell you how heartwarming it is because
yay then we moved out of that garage hey
that garage was awesome yeah freezing
yeah no I remember I remember going to
target cuz it was so cold in that garage
and saying hey do you guys gotta do like
just about everyone know this is
Stanford it was just like okay like you
did there's no air-conditioning there's
no heaters you just buck up Cowboy fans
i'm like it's winter time you're all
like i have fans to on twitter goes bad
oh it's really bad joke this holiday
season cops are on a mission to protect
the streets from drunk drivers if you're
out for the evening and you get behind
the wheel drunk you will most certainly
not be able to avoid the consequences
that's right we're talking facing jail
time court costs loss of your license
and of course personal embarrassment or
you could just plan ahead and designate
a sober driver I mean you decide nobody
ever gets in the car thinking I'm drunk
I'm driving and I'm gonna get busted
tonight no people drive drunk all the
time because they think they won't get
caught and about a million times a year
they're wrong more people might think
I've had a few drinks but I'm okay to
drive or I only live a few minutes from
here or I kind of way with it plenty of
times before and they think like that
right up until the point where they kill
someone last year more than 10,000
people were killed by drunk drivers so
if you're ever wondering why cops bust
drunk drivers well there's 10,000
reasons why cops are out there and
they're cracking down on drunk drivers
all across the country this holiday
season you may think that you'll get
away with it you won't
alrighty participation thing for you
