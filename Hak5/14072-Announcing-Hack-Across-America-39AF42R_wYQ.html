by teen well how thick is the blade well
that's what I'm noticed if you look at
hand side here ya see how you see the
mark for 10 inches is on the inside of
the blade so it's an inside cut that's
why I have the tape over top of it so I
know exactly 10 inches to that edge of
the blade cruel and then I'll recut the
remainder get the other 10 inches so
what we're doing here at Dave's garage
is building a huge box that's going to
house all of the glass mat cells and all
the other fun stuff that's going under
the bed and as such one of those stories
of measure twice cut once we're ending
up pulling the legs off of the couch and
then basically this frame that we're
building is going to be the new legs for
it it's actually going to be like 10
times sturdier more more sturdy and
that's really exciting because I get to
put a bunch of self tapping screws
that's just fun any time that it can use
self tapping degrees and one of the
methods that are perfected is actually
making the power drill turn to the right
because then that makes the screw go in
it doesn't work as well the other way
not that I've tried and there we go
it's a pup that is also a box it's kind
of upside down right now but you get the
idea that goes over the wheel well and
this sits under the couch well I I
should get the key haptic feedback or
the rumble bed maybe like put the 25
cents and it starts like Barbara room
you would probably could do that with
all the stuff in this shop to pick
seriously what would it take to how many
how many how many amps is this motor
right here that I'll take that 80 amps
yeah I can do some 80 amp rumble pack
hook it up to like Star Fox all right
yeah last one and so there we go with
the box installed and the bed is up
against the wall and just pull that guy
down probably more gracefully than that
but yeah it'll work it'll work yeah and
that's and so this is replacing some
little beams like that and instead of
just got like ridiculous beams and lots
of them so this now with the bed up oh
man that is so much floor space it's
much storage i'll be able to store the
glass mat batteries back there and all
sorts of crap under here so it'll body i
was about to say the same thing Dave
whoa whoa think you'll be fine then
we'll cut some melody here cut skin that
box for you to be fine
oh yeah that's the butter zone so now
baby how are people going to get
involved and know where to ask you to go
and where to meet up well that's the
coolest thing is we've got all of this
tech that we're just kidding this thing
out with and there's a dashboard over at
hacc across America com where you can
see always where the van is where i'm
going with the schedule of events are
you can actually see telemetry from like
pineapples we've got on the roof we've
got some crazy tech that's going into
this thing aircraft running all the time
all of this really cool stuff kismet
stuff sniffers and just like and then
also i'm going to be doing workshops
along the way and talks at different
hacker spaces so you you can find the
schedule of events for how you can like
become part of one of those or any of
the meetups or what have you so all of
it is that hack across America calm and
that's you just go there and sign up if
you've got a cool open source project
that you want to publicize you want to
share with the hak5 audience if you've
got a hackerspace you want to give me a
tour of if you've got a rocket ship that
you're building just yeah let me know
and and then we'll do that and then it
will be awesome and all of that awesome
is that hack across America calm
mobile phone carriers used to make me
cringe trust me as a former phone freak
I'm just flat-out not a fan of telcos I
mean the experience it's intentionally
confusing rhythms with hidden fees
penalties arbitrary rules unnecessary
premiums and ultimately you the consumer
your left over lists but not with tang I
love these guys they're a bunch of
awesome geeks up in Canada nicest folks
you'll ever meet and they got fed up
with the status quo and they're actually
doing something truly revolutionary so
get this or an mvno offering 4g and
android phones on the sprint network and
they have one simple plan it's called
fair and honest pricing megabytes
minutes messages they're all billed
separately so there's no plan to worry
about you you just pay for what you use
you know no penalties and no paying for
stuff you aren't using so if your plans
like 4,000 text messages and you only
use 100 well then get credited for the
900 you didn't use how awesome is that
it's that simple it's why my friends and
I we're all switching a ting I'm using
them my bartenders using them my sister
just signed up with them hey Karen and
she loves him because get this she had a
silly questions she signed up and called
the customer support line and a human
answered the phone I know right also
Karen there's a difference between a sim
card and microSD card so check it out
