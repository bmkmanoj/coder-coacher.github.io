well only woke up a couple of times the
middle of the night that's actually very
good kind of that those camping dinners
that you know add boiled water too and
stuff actually pretty tasty do you
really have to mix them up a whole lot
because not all freeze-dried stuff at
the bottom so accepted well get get the
idea and then I learned that the
campground firewood cannot sucks but
thankfully had pretty cool neighbors
that brought some dry stuff we're going
to share so all's well except for you
know it rain that just means packing up
wet gear that's never fun oh yeah where
are you monkey yeah he had a good time
to eat just wants a banana
so I forgot to bring a pumpkin it turns
out that the road here is sand
thankfully wasn't too soft but I really
wasn't anticipating that and I forgot to
bring a puck last night this kid comes
by the tribes that dirt bikes and I
hands me a two-by-four he was like hey I
saw your bike here and I was like oh
thanks kid way to go so now I just need
to remember to bring it to you by 40 I
don't sink into the sand
so after a quick drive from the campsite
and without the board this case may vary
over to New Jersey New Jersey that is
where we are headed and you're on the
ferry that's across Cape May and there's
my bike right there Mimi parked sideways
they say it's an hour in something long
journey so maybe I can actually charge
from batteries charge my batteries
thanks for breakfast let's go find some
peace goodbye Delaware the Cape May
Perry was awesome you know it was like
an hour and 15 minutes so is really
relaxing a great way to start the
morning the sites were beautiful there
were all these lighthouses and I even
got to see some dolphins I really wish
that I had caught on camera
this is the leg of the journey that I
really didn't plan that much and it's
like as soon as I got off that ferry ah
i just started following this pink line
on my GPS but other than that I I don't
really have any goals right now and it's
just totally changed my my attitude
about this trip I'm just kind of really
soaking it up now so I'm going through
these new jersey wetlands and it was so
rustic this fishing town with all these
little bridges and tolls and I got to
see the enterprise which is cool oh it's
the enterprise look at that I don't know
if you can read that but yeah that is to
leave the enterprise woot a lot of
barges going on yeah oh I hate this
stuff no toll this direction oh I guess
that doesn't I guess that means I'm not
turning back well yeah this right here
this is the best I've never been
anywhere like this it's very cool it has
a very salt treated feel to it so I'm
passing through this area of New Jersey
called Nami Island and there's just all
these islands everywhere of marshlands
and then just wetlands and and they've
got signs no fishing on the bridges and
everyone is everyone is fishing from the
bridges and I guess nobody cares and
half the bridges have like poles and
even the ones where there's a total
operator there's just you know a dozen
guys out there fishing right from the
bridge and everywhere else once we good
fishing
so I'm riding up the wetlands and
through the coast and I figured it was
high time to show monkey the beach I
finally gotten tired of listening to my
gps and pretty much just using it as a
fallback in case I get lost but on this
trip I can't actually get lost because
I'm not really supposed to be anywhere
so I'm just going to go find the beach
this place is empty I don't know if
these are all beach houses and it's just
not the season or what a monkey you want
to go see the ocean all right welcome to
stone harbor beaches all right
these are the kind of beaches I like
with the big dune with the grass and the
little gates and stuff well as far as I
can see up and down this Beach they're
just these pipes going into the water
and pretty sure that's the Atlantic
Ocean I'm not really sure where they're
going or what they are and the types and
told me hey mr. pipe what's in you you
mind if monkey pops up squat here for a
minute enjoy the beach
danger says the sign okay maybe this
seagull knows see he doesn't like me
either well this definitely doesn't seem
like a tourist do beach more of an
industrial beach if there is such a
thing maybe there's a oil rig off the
coast here or something oh wait a second
these are lines coming in these are
lines going out that one ends right
there and there's some just water
pouring red in well yummy you've had fun
at the beach monkey tend to get back on
the road say goodbye to the beach
bicycle first vehicle so I called Jason
made arrangements and decided to
hightail it over to Annapolis Maryland
where there was a renaissance festival
going on but this would mean that I
would have to spend a bit of time on the
interstate which is never any fun it's
not every day you get to drive your bike
through a grass field well I guess I
could be well today is a day for me that
might be a problem where's that
two-by-four when I need it I have never
been to a Renaissance Faire before in my
life and I guess this is like one of the
bigger ones and I had no idea what to
expect Shannon said something about
dressing up and I was like why would you
dress up I'm starting to understand it's
like I walked into the video game fable
and I just wanted to go up to people and
press B
so Jason what exactly am i eating a
turkey leg a giant turkey and you just
plow into it yeah pretty much party they
were like leather shops and pewter shops
and silversmiths and jousting and every
all the girls were dressed up in corsets
and there were wenches and and pirates
and it was totally immersive and I was
just so surprised I was expecting you
know some like you know aluminum poles
and tents and you know particle board
and crap and it was totally permanent I
was blown away by it a very confused
juice and Applebaum oh yes so where are
we GPS boy oh no idea and where are we
going that's another good question to
hell if we don't change our ways who is
this
oh yeah that's that's not creepy at all
I'm not not whatsoever others know if
there's barbie let's see if they get
better they all have that expression I
got run over by a truck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
