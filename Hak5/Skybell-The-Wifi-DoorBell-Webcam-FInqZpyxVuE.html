by Toyota for hak5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2014 and i found a thing
that does the thing you guys know how i
love just a very basic and simple piece
of electronics that just makes you life
a little bit easier this right here is
the sky bell and what it does is it
replaces your existing doorbell but it's
a little bit smarter it has a integrated
webcam here this is a 640 by 480 webcam
with a 70 degree field of view and it
has integrated 802 11 be ang I think
that smells bang anyway it connects your
home Wi-Fi network and then through your
home's internet connection backhaul you
can see who's at your door from anywhere
in the world or just using your home
Wi-Fi network in the house live video so
as soon as somebody presses the button
it actually rings your existing doorbell
so if your Wi-Fi network goes down it
kind of gracefully degra days to a
regular dumb doorbell and then you can
do it the old-fashioned way but either
way you know someone's at your door and
it this is so great pops up an intent on
your phone there's an iOS app right now
there's an Android app coming out in a
couple of weeks and you'll be able to
see who's at your door in fact even
without somebody ringing your doorbell
you can just like turn it on and see
who's in your front yard seems pretty
cool very easy to position this guy all
around and this is available right now
for 199 dollars and so if you'd like one
just go ahead and look up Skye Bell calm
or just head over to Amazon so for hak5
