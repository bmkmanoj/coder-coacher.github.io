virtual server with a wicked web
front-end Shannon's got some great free
and open source to make Windows a lot
less mundane and Jason's here with some
Android application development that I
here has something to do with Wi-Fi
I'm Darrin kitchen this episode of hi-5
is brought to you by domain.com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain.com go to assist Express
and the United States Air Force alone
Walton hack Bob my name is Darren
kitchen and this is your weekly dose of
technolo
we have a great show you guys coming up
tonight as well as a whole bunch of
amazing stuff coming up in the weeks to
come if you haven't been following along
I have recently moved from Williamsburg
Virginia where the show is hosted for
five years to the San Francisco Bay Area
and of course you'd be having you can go
ahead and check out youtube.com slash
hack 5 Garen's vlog for all the you know
wonderful video posts along the way to
get a sense of the adventure I need to
first and foremost though apologize
right now for not only the audio but the
set I'm still lacking some of my
equipment that's being shipped out to me
now and once I get that and kind of come
up with some semblance oh the studio or
a set or something it will get a lot
better so please bear with as you have
during this crazy transition of a season
it has been and speaking of which well I
mean Here I am in San Francisco and you
know what that means
epic Meetup so yeah I haven't had it yet
just kind of trying to settle in and get
a feel for things and but if you don't
already go ahead and follow us on
Twitter and Facebook so you can get the
latest on you know when that infant will
be and everything and hopefully we'll
have that in the next week or so and it
should be really good so hit that up
also thank you so much I've gotten a lot
of great feedback on our last talk about
password creation and techniques and
stuff like that you guys are really
creative so I'm going to share that with
you guys in a future segment but don't
stop sending those in because some of
those are really awesome and oh yeah
just a quick programming note next week
we'll be at e3 the Big Entertainment
Expo thing for video games and woohoo I
gonna know I actually am really excited
because I'm gonna be there with Jen
cutter as something awesome
you remember her we shot an app that
episode in Toronto recently and then
just did some Nintendo DS stuff and I'm
so happy to be working with her whenever
it possible so stick around for that
also wants its servers Android dev
Windows goodies the whole nine yards
it's gonna be great so stick around but
first check in with Shannon to find out
about this week's trivia this week's
trivia is first appearing in ms-dos 6
this command line program was a staple
of Windows systems until being replaced
by Rd with the Windows NT line enter for
your chance to win a set of killer new
pack 5 stickers and for this week I
would like to send out a special thanks
to today's sponsor the United States Air
Force this is time one more no signs of
life
titan-1 4 hold your position what do you
got unmanned aircraft as identified
enemy sniper copy that
let's move
thanks creeper 1 1 we got a man who's
coming off target learn more and here
for scar in the last second when I
showed you guys how to get started with
Android gooeys and today I'm going to
show you how to take it a step further
with the Android Wi-Fi api's we're gonna
be using the Android scanning API I'd be
more specific or Wi-Fi scanning API but
you know it's just create a basic
wardriving tool this application is
going to be primarily based off the
first eggman not similar to the second
one because we're gonna be using the
Android hello world to modify everything
and no extensive GUI work will be needed
so let's take a good we could jump right
into this and take a look so the first
thing I'm gonna do is head on over to
the awesome guide at
developer.android.com and check out the
Android net dot Wi-Fi API and I can see
there's a whole bunch of really useful
ones so the Wi-Fi manager is where all
the Wi-Fi settings are kept and you know
you can see all the api's that we have
the and this get scan results and get
the Wi-Fi state disconnect reconnect
modify the Wi-Fi connection but we're
going to be concentrating it like I said
the get scan result and the start scan
after successfully creating your Android
projects and inside of Eclipse we need
to head on and over and modify the
Android manifest it's right here under
your Wi-Fi scanner and then Android
manifest so you open that up head on
over to the Android XML view makes it a
little bit easier and add these two
permissions permission the first version
is Android permission access Wi-Fi state
and the second permission is Android dot
permission change Wi-Fi state this
basically says hey I need to make these
modifications the phone please allow me
to do so
and then it notifies the user and say
hey this ain't a plication can do this
and then after you've done that we're
going to need head on over to the res
layout main.xml and make the
modification of simply adding an ID to
the textview so that we can access it
inside the code it's Android colon ID
equals ID right here and then just name
it I named it Wi-Fi txt so once that's
done head on over to your main class we
need to modify the oncreate you know
the first method that's called when the
application opens all we need to do is
tie the textview to a local variable
here our global variable excuse me and
call it by the ID because we just gave
it an ID snag the Wi-Fi manager from a
surface so just get service Wi-Fi
services right here and then we need to
tell the phone hey when there's new scan
results available I want to know about
them so we just need to use a broadcast
receiver so we just created a little a
class here that extends broadcast
receiver and every time this scan
results is available in the intent for
the intent filter to pick up it's going
to call the on received method all
that's going to do is call the populate
method which we created right here so
the populate method is incredibly simple
all it does is populates a text string
with the AP data so all I'm doing is
calling the Wi-Fi manager dot get scan
results so once you get all your scan
results can be in a list form you need
to loop through the list once you've
loop through the list you'll have your
actual results that each result contains
a whole period of different things but
all that we're really concerned about
for this project is the SSID the
capabilities that the frequency it's at
and the DB or the low levels what they
call it's basically your your signal
strength so SSID you know the SSID is
capabilities it's actually the security
that it's capable of doing the frequency
it's going to be a four four digit
number it's two point four blah blah
blah but anyway I just went ahead and
formatted that string so that this is
how it's going to display is each line
of our Wi-Fi scanner put a nice pound
sign right here in front of the SSID to
distinguish it from a whole list of them
and once that's done go ahead and tack
it to a plus you know you do your plus
equals so you're not replacing the
string every time and then at the end
all you do is set the text to the text
view which you got from the in from the
ID and then start the scan all over
again it's just that simple
that's it this is a very
basic wardriving application and you
know it's just that easy you can make a
lot of modifications of this there's a
lot of really cool things in the Wi-Fi
API that you could take this further you
could have this email you have it save
out to a text file you could probably
take geolocation data no big deal it's
all pretty straightforward like I said
and developer.android.com is a great
resource to go forward with this project
and that's it it's a really simple
wardriving application and here's the
finished product you know you can see
each AP listed exactly we listed in the
text string all they're in line and you
can make any modification no Wi-Fi
managers a couple other things that I
didn't add in here just there for space
screen real estate but you could source
codes available up on the show notes and
if you have any questions email me jason
hak5 or for this or anything else you
saw in today's show hit up the show
notes at hak5 org this week I'm bringing
you a Windows to buffer or twofer anyway
I'm bringing you to programs that are
fast they're reliable and they do
exactly what they're supposed to do have
you ever had that problem where
somebody's fixing your computer and
really the whole time they're playing
with their flash drive and plugging it
into your computer you're thinking I
wonder if they're trying to steal files
off my computer I know we all have a
little bit of paranoia and that's why
there's a program called USB write
protector it's a small utility that
turns on and off your USB write
protection and it can see secure you
against any would-be physical attacks by
making drives non writable and the
second one is the common problem with
Windows where you're trying to delete a
file and the file says something like a
little pop-up that says this file is
currently being used by another person
or program yeah and there's nothing open
so you're complete completely confused
about what's using the program in the
background and it just drives us crazy
when all we want to do is delete the
file so we have a program called
unlocker a mocker is a portable app that
unlocks files so you can delete them put
very simply USB write protector can be
downloaded from gaijin' 80 slash
/ a bunch of stuff PHP anyway I'd like
to thank go to assist Express for this
week but there's no need for the hack 5
cloud lab since both of these tools are
really easy local apps by using the USB
write protector you can protect yourself
from the harmful rays of the USB
switchblade of death alright let's check
it out you can easily run the program
straight from a dot rar file just run
the exe so I'll download the file open
it up and run this Exe you can also use
this as a portable application which is
very sweet and very cool you guys know
how I like my portable apps you just
double-click and you choose you write
protection on or off obviously if you
can't read Dutch or German or whatever
language pops up because it might not be
your language change it to English or
whatever your language is so you don't
choose the wrong on or off switch you
know you could probably figure it out
there's only two choices when it's on
obviously no files and no data can be
written onto a USB so I'm gonna plug in
my USB flash drive just to test this out
and make sure that it works all right
now if I try to run a tool on my flash
drive or if I try to move content to it
it's not gonna let me it's gonna tell me
that it's right protected or that it's
it's just not going to let me do
anything with this USB flash drive yeah
easy as pie your computer is protected
from physical attacks mmm all right the
next one is unlocker and that one can be
downloaded over at C colon dot free FR
slash unlocker a little bit easier to
say that one you might have a problem
that occurs such as that makes you not
be able to delete a file such as like
access is denied or the file isn't used
by another person or a program or maybe
it says make sure this disk isn't fuller
right protected god I've heard that one
so many times I memorized it oh it's a
pain and finding the problem is a pain
nobody wants to deal with it and that's
why we have unlocker it's a free
downloadable tool for Windows that you
can install or you can also download the
portable version
you just install it and you're set now
if you try to delete a file and if you
get some pop-up like this one that I got
cur press ok and then right-click on
your file and choose unlocker now all
your lockers are going to appear in a
list so you choose unlock all and the
file becomes available for use yeah you
can unlock it or whatever you need to do
also if the file is not locked you still
have the option to delete rename or move
the file straight from a locker now you
may run into a problem like index da T's
that won't be able to be deleted by a
locker if you run into this kind of
problem there are a lot of epic hues on
the website that can help you out with
this
so what's your feedback do you have
these programs to use them or do you use
something else very similar email me at
feedback at hack 5 org both of these
were featured by people that emailed us

revision 3.com
/ go to assist Express okay so you may
remember from several episodes back Matt
and I did an awesome segment on building
a two thousand dollar corporate virtual
machine server using VMware ESXi and
and we had raid and we had backups and
we had all sorts of good stuff in this
like beautiful piece of machinery was
running in i7 I can't remember anyway it
was a great piece of hardware I love
that box and it's still running today
now one of the first things I did when I
came here though is realized man you
know I didn't really need it I mean a
virtual server trust me after being on
the road with this guy as my primary
machine for so long
sure okay the SU 7300 can maybe run a
virtual machine maybe - a lot of times
what I want to do is run three Windows
boxes - Linux boxes simulate a real
network environment here I start
flashing some stuff at it and see what
happens well in that case it's time to
build the home virtualization server and
you know what this means yes it means
recycling parts and doing it on the
cheap and I happened to go pad a Intel
4300 laying around so one of the first
things I did since I've been here in San
Francisco all of five days now was
getting Doctrine ated to this place this
magical place called Fry's where you get
electronics and they are awesome and and
yes so my wallet became lighter but I
ended up building a very expensive
wall-mounted server so let's check it
out we've got the e 4300 stock the
cheapest MSI motherboard I could find
you know spare hard drive very cheap
power supply and there you have it
that's it I mean you just
well why spend money on a case when you
can just mount it on a piece of plexi
but on your wall and there you go none
of you've got a nice you know wall
fixture it looks good with the home
decor try that one with the missus
anyway to the garage here it's totally
going to work I'm not worried about air
flow it's it's been coming great the
trick is since we don't actually have an
ATX case you want to go into the
motherboard and say hey on our resume
turn the machine on and make sure you
spend the five dollars extra on a power
supply that actually has a toggle switch
because then you'll not have to worry
about jumping the green and the black
don't quote me
that but I believe it's the green and
the black wires on your power supply or
I guess who just happen to the leads on
the motherboard and put yourself a
little toggle switch I mean really all
you're doing it's crossing the
connection to get the machine to boot
regardless is booting and it is running
none other than the list version who
Boone - of course it's ten point oh four
it's loose of links I love it it's
gotten better and better with every
version I've been using and well when it
comes to the virtualization of course
we're going to use the most superior
technology on the market yes that would
be Sun oh I'm sorry
Oracle's merciful box you guys know in
the huge fan of VirtualBox I mean we
could do an ESX server here but this is
just gonna run on any Linux box and it
runs great however I must say there's a
caveat here from what we're about to do
a web front-end a beautiful gorgeous
thing where you can get over from any
web browser to all of your virtual
machines on your linux server that's
hanging on your garage door or something
you want to use a well unfortunately
what you're going to have to use is the
proprietary version of VirtualBox no
unfortunately the open-source version
does not support a very key piece of
technology here and that is the RDP the
remote desktop protocol to any operating
system I mean sure you could use the
open source version install Linux guest
on I'm sorry a windows guest on your
Linux host and if it has RDP you could
have that but the beautiful thing about
the RDP and VirtualBox is its operating
system agnostic and that's a key
underlying technology that we're going
to use for remote access over the web
you'll see here in just a bit but let's
go ahead and set it up it's really just
a matter of downloading and installing
the latest version of virtual box from
virtualbox.org and once we have that all
going it's pretty much just and let me
tell you onto makes is so easy because
it's Debian based but not saying that
it's the best history I'm just saying
the most familiar with so you know if
you got pac-man if you got rpm you got
all those I'm sure it's just as easy now
well do you need to make sure that we
have Python 2.6 or higher so we'll just
go ahead and quarry the version there
looks like we are all set to go
we will need Python in our path so let's
go ahead and add that to our dollar path
variable there and now what we want to
do is this is the difficult part I found
this beautiful piece of software but I
have so much hope for it it has so much
promise in it and I think it's very very
cool it's called Virtual Box webserver
and it does exactly that
you know how in virtuals VMware's ESXi
you have the web interface where you can
go and you can actually manage virtual
machines if you haven't played with it
it's very cool to go and check it out
this does something sort of similar to
that where we get a based on you know
it's on the front end we're talking
about Ajax so it's beautiful with the
like HTML sexiness JavaScript going on
it's using JSON to quarry the server on
the backend it's all running in Python
and it uses the native what is it native
VirtualBox API to go ahead and
communicate with the server and tell it
hey you know bring this machine up and
do all this not you know create volumes
and all of the other regular stuff they
would do in VirtualBox
it's able to do over the web it's
unfortunately not able to currently run
on like a separate web server and then
have your virtual machine server on a
separate machine even though the API I
would technically allow for that right
now it's got to be on the same box but
you know it's just a matter of time
before you know this is still a kind of
a beta project that Google
code but yes so there we go so let's
just go ahead and grab the latest
version from subversion which I do not
have installed so let's go ahead and get
that going and there we go it's gravel
is version a V box webserver and like I
said if python-based so all we really
need to do now that we have you know
make sure python is installed and in our
path we'll just run Python dot slash
feed box webserver and you can see it's
doing its happy thing and if we pull up
our web browser Firefox here we can
actually just head over to localhost
colon 8080 if you're using a different
port if you're using that port for
something else when you change the ports
whatever it's all in the V box webserver
comp file simple just go down there and
them and change it over or from Emacs if
you're gonna hurt yourself and you just
go ahead and run this and it will listen
on that port hit it up in your web
browser that's what you want to port
forward from your home router so now you
can get access to virtual machines from
anywhere you walk from just a web
browser how cool is that
yeah so let's go ahead and well
obviously to login we will need to
create a user so let's go back let's
create that user there it's pretty
straightforward and if we draw go ahead
and login now we can see that if we
drill down into some of the menus you
can see that this is still a work in
progress this is not prime time but I
think it's functional enough that big I
think it's really really cool it has a
lot of promise you would find much as
much much of the functionality that you
would find in the client typically so
let's go ahead and set up a machine now
I'm just gonna go ahead and double you
get nice so here not going to bother
running through the boring machine
install but it's the same as usual and
if I go ahead and click on console what
you'll notice is that I'm pulling up in
is one and again the proprietary stuff
you get a flash-based connection to your
RDP session but it's in your web browser
so as long as you go ahead and forward
everything correctly under router you
can get access to this from anyone what
this means is I can now leave my 250
dollar virtual machine server hanging on
the wall of the garage here home in a
way with you know 500 gigs of well
potentially expendable Windows machines
and I can be on my little laptop here
and have them all running in different
tabs and Firefox and just how cool is
that
I love the portability aspect and you
know from any machine leave them leave
the the sessions running exactly as I
want them and just come back to the net
we'll just from a web browser I don't I
think it's really really spiffy I want
to hear what you guys think know that
I'm just kind of like really breezed
through that install but if you've had
fun with any Python based application
before it should be a breeze
let me know what you guys think I'm
always you know dead set on toying with
more virtualization stuff and Linux
goodness and yeah I know I know you can
save the emails about how fugly my
server is I know anyway
Jonah it's a hack five that work
don't make it go faster right you guys
know I love the web hosting and
registration services at domain.com and
it would be fair to say that I'm the
typical slightly paranoid hacker I
believe in the code that if it doesn't
exist in more than one place well it
pretty much doesn't exist to me that's
why I'm a huge fan of domain.com backup
services it comes standard with their
web hosting plans along with 1-click
installs of software unlimited traffic
and free website builders simply add a
backup job select a website in the
database and click finish that's it now
if anything goes pear-shaped it's just a
matter of selecting your backup and
clicking restore what could be easier so
why not get yourself a top-notch domain
or web host with blistering fast DNS and
all the fixings head over to domain.com
and use coupon code hak5 at checkout for
an additional 15% off your order got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain.com so you think you have
the technical exes with his elite LED
display that he's building over at the
London hacker space make sure to send
your pictures over to feedback at hack 5
Gorgon who knows maybe we'll show off
your title list next week also be sure
to check out the brand new limited
edition ultra elite hack pack over at
hack 5 org flash store these come with
our pins and our seasoned force a cast
picture which we are discontinuing along
with a piece of the hack wall from the
hack house which we autographed for you
and there's only a few of these
obviously we can't keep on buying more
of them because they came straight from
the hack house and we have moved on from
there and last but not least be sure to
check out and support us over at iTunes
and YouTube you can subscribe on iTunes
subscribe on YouTube or both at work and
at home and all of yours computers all
of your different routers
subscribe everywhere okay we love you
guys anyway until next week
trust your Peck Millis I'm just gonna
morph thanks for watching hack 5 who
knows maybe you'll get the one that I
bet by using the USB write protector you
can protect yourself from the harmful
rays the USB switchblade death uh
updates right now
really come on yeah I did it
that's so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
