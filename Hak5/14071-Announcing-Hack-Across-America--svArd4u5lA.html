by domain.com hello welcome back five my
name is darren kitchen and this is your
weekly dose of techno lust and we are
here in beautiful california right
inside the San Francisco Bay and the
reason that I'm here enjoying this
amazing California not just today but
always is because of you guys and that's
what this episode is about because this
show started almost eight years ago
we're going to be celebrating our eighth
year in 2013 and one of the things that
I wanted to do is celebrate one of the
reasons why hak5 made it to California
you remember in 2010 this epic journey
began because I lost my job and Shannon
was going back because of her father and
there was like all of this stuff going
on on our lives but one thing has rung
true throughout all of hak5 it's just
followed our lives and become our lives
and you have become part of this amazing
experience that I am so heartfelt for
and so I wanted to celebrate this year
this milestone of eight years of hak5 by
sharing one of the things that was the
most just the most pivotal moment in all
of hak5 the very beginning of season
seven when we made that transition from
the house that hack house in Virginia to
coming out here to California and say
you know what it's we're not financially
ready to do this but we have it in our
hearts we trust our technol lust and
we're going to ask you guys hey can you
put me up on your couch will I take my
motorcycle across the country on a
one-way trip west and now well now it's
time to do it again except we're not
going west for the next six months we're
going to be celebrating hak5 hak5 the
element the community that has been you
guys that has been
the culmination of this whole experience
coming together because we're all geeks
were all the best coolest hacker people
and there are over 400 registered active
hackerspaces all throughout North
America and I want to visit all of them
and I want to visit you guys and I'm
going to see cool projects and I just
like I was just doing in Europe with
hack across Europe seeing like balloon
liftoffs and just an amazing projects
people are doing at hackerspaces I want
to do that now here and so anyway
without further ado that's what this
episode is about that's what we're doing
we're kicking off this project right now
and I'm so excited and filled with so
many emotions right now because we're
now launching pack across America go pee
can we use that cuz I don't feel like
doing that again
I'm Darren kitchen host of hak5 and I
have the simple rule always stay open to
possibility this season I'm traveling
cross-country visiting hackerspaces
meeting you guys and checking out cool
stuff along the way so sign up and take
part in hack across America one of the
other things are good like passengers
like you know a ride shotgun for a
length anybody has some bass cleaning no
no you need to like grease me up with
marmalade and then oh how do you I get
my head stuck in a van this is now OSHA
oh oh babe I'm wrangling this flat knot
holes that concern me before needs comp
need to pull the floor out and an agent
foot think a layer of this this is
reflecting and it's basically like
bubble wrap except it's all reflective
and that's going to add well a little
bit more our value than whatever that
pathetic stuff is there let me just
screw it all down and it's not snippy so
a lot of people put down different
floors like linoleum phone tile stuff
like that I actually like the floor that
comes with the Sprinter van it actually
looks like there was a love note
attached for me on the bottom and we can
see always just where I was born but
Hearst island is de and I think that's
the land and then her Stella code is BLD
I think the postcode and it was made
Gotham the date 38 kilowatts / 2011 so
we're now using power in addition to
dates go Germans well then I could taco
it
they look like you're in a space capsule
now because it's like the way I had the
lighting I like you to do the unwrapped
 man I don't know what Clank what
what the hell is a Clank alright so the
floors back in and everything seems
pretty good in that sense and so before
put the walls and I want to run some
conduit here some solar panels are going
on the roof and this is just some basic
UL what is it called flex + blue conduit
I mean whatever it's just something for
my paws are negative from the solar
panels to come down here we're in a bank
of ATMs and charge controllers and all
that other stuff and so we've run it
down the side wall of the van into a
nice little outlet here it's just going
to stick out there and be all good so
this is going to trim this up and kind
of figure out what the hell I'm doing
with all of this later and I don't think
this is the right tool for the job all
this is definitely not the right tool
for the job I'm doing kitchen in a van
not in Alaska looking for some Wi-Fi and
someone let me use power tools that's
how you do it see I've already got I've
already like got an owie all that not
supposed to be doing that to what now
Greek we're putting spaceships in the
wall so that this thing will look more
like a Dalek see self-tapping screw
flying saucer action and a piece of what
is this drill if you're something anyway
it's just fun to put holes in this thing
yay one more nabis cops snob snob snob
snob so where are you going well that's
the thing is I don't know where I'm
going I'm going to hell if I don't
change my ways I'm going to where people
sign up wherever there are awesome
things to see i am going to seek out new
life and new civilization i'm basically
going to try to do like what i did last
time attack across america which was hey
sign up I'm going to zigzag around I got
to see so many cool hackerspaces I can
Detroit and Cincinnati and everything
and I just want to go and see those but
not just hackerspaces like I want to see
like The Very Large Array I want to see
like all of these other like really
geeky like radio telescopes and cool
stuff like that so I don't know it
really just depends on what people sign
up for and hack across America with and
then I'll go there and no clue we're in
the right place but it says metal and
that's what I'm here for well I'm in the
right place what I came to do was
recycle hundred thousand aluminum can
the other place I want over there now we
just rely rude skills seriously this is
just another example of one google map
see we've all had that experience right
I had one in Berlin but Google Maps took
me to a brothel that's Google Maps
really trying to you
balls the Queen I have the might be cake
well those
whew now we're at the toy store I'm
getting really excited just imagining
jack and jack erector sets
that brat IOT of this red time
just be like basically right Billy
always starts on it electric turrets and
stuff and it could be like someone beat
assault vehicle you know
lady you don't need something day later
oh I mean
trying to build
which begs the question why aren't we
building
in our fur balls and building new
nations
this is such a hack we're allowed near
Cherry Lane because it's a to z got full
occupancy
I can feel like eating more people
if you like Smackdown it would be
awesome in disco ball
Garon's people deliver a service now
with more food Sansa
well how are you gonna get there well
I'm gonna drive the what is this the
hak5 short bus I'm go ahead I'm going to
drive this thing the hacker van the
surveillance man my fed van it's not a
free candy ban whatever you want to call
this thing and so part of that is I know
like right off the bat room is going to
be like one why you're not taking the
motorcycle which is a good point except
for that I'm going for six months and I
want to be able to bring people along
the way and so I'm decking this thing
out building it all out myself and with
my friends help and everybody and we're
we're setting this up so that we can
have like past just like you're a
passenger right now Sarah and so you
could go on a leg with me or like anyone
can go on a leg with me and take people
from point A to point B and set up with
all these cameras up here so that we can
like you know have a conversation and
it's all natural because that's where
natural conversations happen is while
you're driving and so I don't know I the
eye so that's one of the reasons that
I'm not taking the motorcycle and why
this van and then the other thing is
because um as soon as I got to
California like a couple months in you
guys may remember I got I got t-boned by
a by a Volkswagen and buy an audi or but
no I think there's a Volkswagen Paul
whatever I got nothing against
Volkswagen but I did get hit by a car on
the bike and I almost lost my left leg
and I'm just very thankful to be like
walking and still here Darren kitchen is
back with us welcome back back from the
land of the crash motorcycle living or
whatever him you made it out of CSF
general alive yes no not you that in
itself really i mean the mercer might
kick in later but so far no cuz nothing
no that's not all I don't like Gladys
himself Darren had to pull a Volkswagen
part out of his leg and it all Sean
Connery all just can't be good and two
inches of plastic like I might enclosure
like one of those that's not supposed to
be in me we're glad you're with us Yes
Mother I you gotta get off that bike man
Miley's like I'm gonna send him a
message I don't know I'm gonna take some
time when it comes to the motorcycle I
just don't like San Francisco traffic
otherwise motorcycles are cool and
otherwise what was it oh yeah way to go
insurance settlement so I got a van and
