phone and Android factory reset flaw was
found that doesn't really secure all
your data plus it's no secret that
secret questions are bogus and the
latest from Edward Snowden that's right
and I say hacking into mobile app stores
all that coming up now on threat wire
I'm Taryn kitchen and this is threat
wire for Friday May 22nd your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom and a huge thanks and
mad props to everyone who has supported
the show thus far on our patreon and
with that let's go ahead and get started
because oh yes from the break it to make
a better Department comes an awesome
paper from the Cambridge University on
the effectiveness of the Android factory
reset feature and it's a bit alarming
the researchers are estimating them
that's some 500 million devices are well
they're not fully wiping the contents of
the disk after using the factory reset
feature which leaves photos and texts
and other such data just ripe for the
picking and moreover a Google auth token
or even a master token were recoverable
and in at least one instances the
researchers were able to actually
extract a master token and then use it
to give them complete access to the
Google data
yikes unfortunately here's the thing
encryption isn't wholly effective either
as the researchers demonstrated that
while the encryption key sure it is in
fact you know encrypted with a salt and
the user's password the crypto fitter
was recoverable meaning that the entire
volume was susceptible to an offline
brute-force attack and here's the thing
let me tell you that four-digit pin code
that's not really gonna stand up to an
offline brute-force attack the
researchers do advise to use a password
with uppercase and lowercase and symbols
and at least 11 characters which is Wow
rather difficult when you consider it's
for a mobile device that you may be
locking and unlocking a few dozen times
a day the nest next best advice is
actually to go ahead and after doing a
factory reset to fill the phone
completely with random data but that's
not going to really help you if you're
using the remote wipe feature the good
news is though that the researchers
findings have been made public and
they've made technical recommendation
that both google and device
manufacturers can use to make the
feature more secure now for some more
sweet research a team over at Google
published a paper titled secrets lies
and account recovery lessons from the
use of personal knowledge questions at
Google and essentially what's been found
is that when it comes to recovering in a
user's account secret questions kind of
suck I mean either the user tries to
make the secret question more secure by
falsifying the answer like say saying my
father's middle name is pac-man or they
don't lie and the answers are really
easily guessed or found online you may
in fact recall a high profile hack and
when I say hack I used up with air
quotes of Sarah Palin's personal email
during the 2008 presidential elections
in that case the the hacker figured out
that the yahoo mail security question
well it was actually her date of birth
and yeah I know
date of birth like you don't even need
melty go for that you can just look it
up on the Wikipedia page anyway
Google researchers conclude that quote
security questions continue to have some
use when combined with other signals but
they should not be used alone and best
practice should favor more reliable
alternatives Google currently employs
both a secondary email address and SMS
for account recovery also my father's
middle name is pac-man and finally the
latest top-secret document from
whistleblower Edward Snowden was just
published outlining a plot from the NSA
and it's five eyes partners to hijack
the App Store's of Samsung and Google
the program code-named Ayrton horn used
xkeyscore to identify the smartphone
traffic's of the internet and then track
it down to connections to these app
stores the idea was to pull off a
man-in-the-middle attack between the app
store server and the smartphone of
interest in order to send malicious
implants to the device then you know
grabbing emails and texts call histories
I mean really just anything on the phone
think mSpy from a few weeks back that
story except on a nation-state level and
there is a ton of good stuff in the
article and the leaked presentations
that we will have links to in the show
notes but this brings me to the question
of the hour which is how confident are
you on the integrity of the applications
that you download from App Store's for
instance do you trust that developers
keep their private keys that they've
signed their applications with secure
let us know your thoughts in the
comments
and before I go I do want to give a huge
thanks to everyone who has supported the
show so far in patreon if you find value
from the show and you can you know spare
just a few cents in episode please
consider becoming a patreon at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that's
where we can fund this and even even you
know show off some awesome adorable fur
babies that's right maybe yours will be
in the next episode we are hoping to
reach our three times a week milestone
goal with a rotating cast of Patrick
Norton Shannon Morse myself and so
throughout the month of May we're doing
just that giving you a taste and I hope
you will continue to contribute and help
us make this come to you independently
and ad-free but if you can't donate
that's totally cool like share and
subscribe all that goes a long way too
you can find links to all of our
episodes as well as the show notes and
all the other ways to contribute over at
threat wired net and with that i'm
darren kitchen I'll see you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
