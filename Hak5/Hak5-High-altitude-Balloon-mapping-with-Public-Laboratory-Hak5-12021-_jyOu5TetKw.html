by the Ford Focus Electric good morning
internet I got into tour camp last night
like really late it was like 1030 p.m.
and it was really dark and a little bit
of a bummer I must said because the
roads were like super twisty and going
through what you know could potentially
be epic scenery but I'll see that on the
way out but it's kind of cool because it
puts me in that situation or maybe
you've been in one of these similar ones
where you get in super late and you
don't really have any context of where
you are you've been there before they
wake up in the morning you go which
which I haven't done is I've never even
been to Washington so I have no idea
what to expect so this is weird i'm
seeing it on the phone before I see with
my eyes
well
that's a lot of fog no joke I could have
stayed in the Bay Area should have much
fog I'm like expecting some ridiculous
reveal I mean don't get me wrong the
Canadian geese are awesome but uh huh
okay let me try this again the afternoon
Matthew what are you doing with crazy
balloons here at door camp while we've
been flying balloons uh all day Thursday
a little bit of yesterday today I was
flying them to make maps so I made a map
on Thursday imaged image today haven't
haven't stitched the math today and then
Jeff records and I were launching some
antennas so yesterday we got up a
75-foot Zeppelin antenna which is
originally they fly on the tops of
Zeppelin's it's a dipole basic dipole we
got that 75 feet off the ground we're
able to pick up some cool traffic and
also launched a Wi-Fi router and it's um
did some Wi-Fi distance tests off the
balloon so yeah it's been a lot of fun
so what on earth brought you into
playing with balloons and hacking them
oh because balloons are awesome I love
them I've been obsessed with flight and
for a long time and I remember just
seeing a low-altitude model hot air
balloon and getting completely obsessed
starting with hot air balloons then
moving to these and kites the map we met
on Thursday was actually with a DIY kite
but yeah so it didn't like start with
like I really want to make maps and I'll
bloons it was it was balloons first like
what back boy's life magazine or
something grown-up no actually I just uh
back in two thousand and a 2007b any
2008 I was just like I was just I got
excited about it I didn't really have
any applications for it until spring a
2010 when I hooked up with the folks who
were working on this grassroots mapping
project around the Gulf oil spill and
that was we all came together I was
working from a distance on the balloon
and techniques and stuff and we started
the public laboratory as a extension of
that to kind of popular eyes and
continue our process of mapping and so
what is your process of mapping you know
getting those aerial photography when it
comes to balloons and where can people
see those sure well public laboratory
org slash archive is our data archive we
modeled it after data gov and you can go
there and get any of our maps in
standard formats you can go to map
knitter org and make your own map with
our map stitching software it's a web
browser software and on our site you can
buy our kit you can make your own kit we
got a lot of DIY fully DIY options and
yeah so you talked about stitching um
how does that come into play I mean
what's the actual process of putting you
know your equipment up in the air and
getting bringing I'm bringing it back
down bringing the data back down somehow
and I'm putting that together into
something usable sure well it starts
with getting some stabilized photos so
it starts with these like this is a
photo rig that I used from a kite on
Thursday to image this place and from
the balloon today this is a soda bottle
with my cam my canon camera inside and
I'd turn it on and pointed to the
horizon to get messages and if you hear
it it's clicking away right now just a
rubber band over the shutter and then
it's stabilized in the wind because this
tail so it doesn't get any rotational
images so yeah this thing goes to about
a thousand feet we go up to 4,000 feet
generally about a thousand feet I took
most of the maps here from about 800 and
then take a bunch of photos ah you know
imaging to our camp took 560 photos then
sorted them down to five good ones that
just covered the whole area and then in
map knitter Matt knitter starts with
with satellite imagery so we lay the
saddle that satellite imageries laid
down and then you drop the your photos
on top of that and stretch them until
you the features you see in your photo
match those in the ground yeah that's a
little pro so you've got your scale and
then if you've taken multiple images it
puts those together and finds where
those intersections are it's it's manual
you know there are automatic stitching
programs they're automatic Geo
rectification programs but because the
images we're getting we it the easiest
way to do both stitching and geo
rectifications to lay them all in
manually so tell me what was your first
balloon that you actually started taking
photographs with first balloon it took
photographs from was a solar hot air
balloon actually have one of those with
me but
were in northern washington so it's no
way it's going to fly those are the most
fun cheapest least reliable way to fly
anything you need no wind perfect son
and the equivalent left of this bloom
behind us be a 12-foot balloon so and so
what is this bloom bleep behind us is
this what you use in your kits yeah this
is a chlorine rubber balloon that's
neoprene and it they're pretty good at
holding helium it's not really a weather
balloon this is the result of a used car
salesman's aerospace program they you
know if you go by they got like you know
by now get our balloon you know get a
huge balloons up and banners and stuff
the same balloons they use and they hold
helium much better than weather balloons
weather balloons latex weather balloons
lose their helium after a day this we
filled up yesterday about this time and
still going strong probably uh you know
the whole weekend three three to four
days is about what we get you lose
depending on the temperature change five
to fifteen percent a day of helium so
and coming by helium is that tricky
unfortunately there's a helium shortage
right now it's the result of a lot of
supply changes and so it's a little
tricky right now it's unfortunate but
it's not too bad this balloon has about
40 bucks worth of healing a minute
thirty to forty dollars worth the helium
is what generally gets you flying so
okay so when you first started flying
what did you know about like regulations
or what you even needed to have signed
off on to even be able to do that
because you mentioned like 4,000 feet is
that an obstruction to like general
aviation now as long as you're away from
airport stay five miles away from an
airport stay out of special exclusion
zones of military bases Washington DC
other than that you just need to stay
300 feet below the cloud layer that's so
that could be anywhere up to fourteen to
twenty thousand feet in some places
practically you can't get that high
you'll kill your arms trying to reel the
balloon back in so yeah the there no
there are no barriers to that it's
basically any balloon that's less than
six feet in diameter any kite that
weighs less than 5 pounds aren't
regulated by the
okay so if it's less than six feet in
diameter which this obviously is you can
go what what's the ceiling on that 300
feet below the cloud layer so it's where
the clouds are so 350 on it below the
cloud layer but if there's no clouds
whatsoever as much real as you have yeah
it's much much string I mean practically
you're not gonna be able to put out more
than a six-foot balloon can't lift more
than three and a half pounds gross lift
and I'm sure I'm sure most of that
weight is actually in the line that
you're using right right so by the time
you get to your getting to 4,000 5,000
feet you're pushing the amount of line
you can lift so and and what kind of
line do you use I mean obviously you're
looking for something strong to be able
to go up that high but you're gonna need
to be light what have you found that
works best well I started with the i
started going for the thinnest strongest
stuff dyneema spectra this stuff is
Dacron Dacron is really nice it's a
little flexible it's easy to tie knots
the other fibers that the Dyneema the
spectra the aramid the Kevlar fibers
they all have a problem with holding
knots knots breaking none of them are
stretchy so when the balloon gets to
like when the wind pulls it there's no
give in the line really snaps the
balloon so the the DAC rounds not quite
as strong for its diameter but it's the
easiest to use a thin line and what is
this stuff typically used for this is
just cut line solace kite line
manufacturer de skyline there are a lot
of people in the world who love kites so
yeah the whole industry and so when
you've got you know a three pound
payload most of its taken up by your by
your line what what kind of payloads are
you putting up and in what kind of use
cases have a view deployed these well so
just yesterday we put up an antenna that
weighed three pounds Matt that we
basically maxed out the payload on the
balloon but the little cameras we fly
are it's like 300 to 500 gram payloads
those are the easiest ones to get to
altitude and yeah it's about so in your
talky were showing some stuff from
Occupy Wall Street keen tell me a bit
about that sure that was just folks at
Occupy Wall Street's our site
uh they had seen kaat khayega social
sociality intelligente i believe or
intel gente so she'll turn remember the
name of it their group in Chile who done
some protest mapping and so they were
actually just using a adapted version of
our our techniques and so they were yeah
Occupy Wall Street people just found out
about it thought it was cool picked it
up and went for it and then how did
Google end up finding out about it
because you were also showing you know
the maps in in google earth or google
maps right well we've contacted we
contacted google back and back during
the the Gulf spill it took a while to
coordinate with them but then now we're
one of their data providers so they they
sync with our database every three
months and most maps make it into
historical archive data in Google Earth
but if Google determines that your map
is better than existing coverage they
throw it straight into the base layer of
Google Maps so yeah and how do these
maps from your project compete with like
some of the other stuff from like USGS
and what are some of the differences
there um our maps are more transparent
generally higher resolution and they
look funkier because they always have
jagged edges from all our photos so I
say they're more transparent because if
you look at one of our Maps if you just
if you find it city oh no I mean like
from a data transparency side right now
so for on our site you know you go to
map knitter you can find the original
images that were used to stitch it you
can find the original author you can
look at the original exif data from the
camera verify the time so there's this
level of data transparency who was
making the map why where when with what
images what type of manipulation was
done on those images that's not data you
can get from USGS or from any of the
other commercial imagery providers that
Google and other map makers use so i
really i think people really appreciate
that with satellite imagery a lot of
imagery in maps is is from airplane over
flight but from satellite imagery the
maximum resolution you can get is five
centimeters which means each pixel is
you know about five centimeters about
like that big and
with our map making process because
we're flying solo even though we're just
using cheap consumer cameras we get
really high resolutions so 5 centimeter
resolutions pretty normal better cameras
and lower flights a lot of people do one
and two centimeter resolution maps so
we're getting nice high resolution and
beyond high resolution because we're
flying solo there's not the atmospheric
filtering that happens you know you look
at satellite imagery it's very blue it's
very green it's got a lot of this it's
missing a lot of the Reds it's missing a
lot of the colors filtered out so we get
much more vibrant color higher contrast
image there's just a lot more data in it
and so when you're putting a balloon up
with like a 10 megapixel camera how do
you know how much coverage you're going
to get for what altitude and things like
that well every lens is different point
shoot for the most part have fairly
simple lenses and you can estimate that
you're making a 45 degree cone to the
ground so if you're a thousand feet up
I'm getting photos there about a
thousand feet wide that's so awesome i'm
truly inspired I want to like just run
out and throw up a I don't know like a
panel antenna gsm tower or something
over my whole town how do how would i go
about getting started with this you say
you've got kids working people find that
kind of stuff public laboratory org look
for our tool balloon mapping it's on
there we have a host of other tools as
well that we're in development but yeah
we've got instructions on balloons we
have recommendations for commercial
kites and yeah you'll find the whole
process their little we have a little
checklist right at the top of our
balloon mapping page with all the steps
you got to go to to get flying safely so
I love that thank you so much Matthew
really appreciate it
today we're once again sponsored by our
friends at Ford and you'll remember that
last time we had a lot of fun checking
out the amazing technology in the 2013
Ford Focus ST this week alright the Ford
Focus Electric we're taking a closer
look at the mileage and electric range
found here in the Ford Focus Electric
and so get this being that it's one
hundred percent electric with zero
emissions and 110 MPGe City that's miles
per gallon electric equivalent this
actually makes the Ford Focus Electric
the most fuel-efficient five passenger
vehicle in America of course your
efficiency will go up and down depending
on your unique driving style fuel
efficiency is just one of the awesome
features that goes into the Ford Focus
Electric we've been having so much fun
with it and will continue to in future
episodes of hak5 so stay tuned for that
and once again thank you guys to Ford
for sponsoring hak5 and showing your
commitment to technology
