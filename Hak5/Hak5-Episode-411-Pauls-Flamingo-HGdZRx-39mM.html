to you by godaddy netflix and raf star
and this time on the show barcode
reading locking down windows organizing
your desktop and sniffing USB packets
hello and welcome to hack 5 i'm darren
kitchen I met les doc and I'm Shannon
Morse and we are super excited to be
here this friday evening yep friday
evening friday evening friday evening
that's new yeah yeah yeah so instead of
shooting two episodes on a Saturday and
having absolutely no ability to steer
the episodes week by week well yeah I
mean it's the thing we were doing but I
stopped you we uh for those of you who
follow you know what we were doing we
were shooting two episodes every other
week so it was very difficult for us to
gauge interest well it's it's really did
someone feedback it's not as much of
that as it's like you know yeah you hear
some feedback you know like oh I want to
make it change cool we should do that we
should fix that weird video thing or
talk about whatever and it's like great
well we're three episodes behind you
guys so we'll make that change and
hopefully in a month or so you'll see it
right yeah so I mean it was getting a
little crazy for us so what we decided
to do is rework our entire
pre-production process and also we shoot
every Friday now for those of you who
are watching us do this live shown that
that's right I've got it up right here
um let me pull it up right here you can
actually every friday at about seven
o'clock eastern time yeah you can watch
us tape the show live you can go to hak5
org darren has some nifty code that he
he has implemented on the on the website
and it allows you to watch us doing the
show with audio so if you're you know a
little concerned and as a chat Arun also
its function room but we do turn the
audio off for the trivia and I have
promised you this is my promise to you
Darren is the one that comes up with the
tribute questions and he will be making
them harder you know that's actually
yeah yeah and then this what next one is
I should let stitch on this again next
week when we talk about Deb five because
I think that's okay there's a committee
an action group if you will that may be
forming to help make them a little bit
like I think of code
food challenges if you will oh I like
that huh huh what's going on with you
Shannon I got a promotion at work so
what are you doing now I'm a client
support technician so you know how like
you go to a restaurant and they have a
point of sale system and they have a
credit card machine I'm gonna be a
person that installs those and if they
don't know how to turn it on or
something they call me and I say hey
press that button basically nice yes the
shannon has finally joined the world of
the IT professional yeah so she's gonna
learn firsthand what a pebkac really is
pebble back prams nevermind guess what
else I did this week oh yeah what's up I
voted oh yeah did that do so did I yes
Paul we because we're shooting this on
friday after the election we want to
express our great great thanks that all
of you who voted as well i think was
like something like a record turnout for
you know total votes kill us a baby USA
go bhama hell yeah oh I don't have to
move to Canada it wouldn't take it
anyway exactly you do what on the
internet uh well you got busted for that
once like taking all kinds of equipment
up ya ain't you they saw evil server in
the trunk we're going through we're
going up to call for help in Toronto
with this one time I'm with Wes and Paul
and we're stopped at the border and they
look at their like and we check your
vehicle okay and they look in the trunk
they're like what is this computer oh
that's evil server uh you were gonna
have to yeah and then we go into this
room and they like asked us all these
questions and I strip search you know
not a lot of action there was no Yahweh
involved in it okay but West is West go
out and and they were going to like
check is you know check through
everything in his car and like I'm
sitting in this little room with this
window here I'm looking at then going
out to the car checking everything else
I'd like they got West like standing in
front of the car just looks and look and
then all the sudden wes is like goes
like this and puts his hands on hood and
I'm sitting in the little room going oh
 yes yeah and
yeah so turns out he was just like you
know antsy he didn't realize he was like
making me having a heart attack about
the whole like hands on the hood thing
oh yeah yeah it's never good when you're
in a foreign country and you see your
friend getting ready to get arrested on
your car but but yeah so so yeah you
guys can watch us every friday seven
eastern on hak5 org and getting back to
the Shannon real quick before we kick it
over what was your first tech job I
Prosecco yeah still detect job I
currently have all right well you're
gonna have like two jobs in my life are
you kidding me I've been working for the
same company last I was able to do that
I had like 12 jobs i want to show you
something cool all right where we got
i've been playing with this thing called
gotr mm-hm you can find it at jo c r dot
sourceforge.net i know for those of you
that are confused it will be in the show
notes yes and it's a optical character
recognition open source project and i
was one of the ever get that like this
crazy ideas for like stupid crap in the
middle of the night and then you can't
go back to sleep because you're like
practically like putting it together
coding in your head whatever it may be
no no you know the like half the viewers
know what I'm talking about so anyway I
was like you know I bet this exists and
it does because I had this crazy idea
that that you can take something like
you know 2600 that quarterly latest
issue right mm-hmm take a picture of the
barcode i mean this is done unlike
iphone apps and stuff and it's like how
do i do this on my phone because i got
like a blackberry is not cool like that
right so let me show you what I got here
take a picture of of the the barcode
here ok ok and then I use this G OCR
software ok I got it kind of pulled up
here in my project and i'm going to go
ahead and run it based on that image and
i end up with the code of what that the
numbers are it actually reads the
numbers right off the barcode so it's
reading the numbers or it's reading the
barcode well it's it's reading the
numbers see the numbers under the
barcode oh yeah there's 13 characters
and then there's actually an open source
not really open source but there's an
open database of UPC codes and other bar
codes in different formats and whatnot
uh-huh that I can actually go ahead and
grep through and there I go I'm told
I'll 2600 the hacker quarterly just on
that image so this database is how I
mean is it web accessible do we have to
download a copy it's well it's kind of
like Wikipedia or web accessible but you
can also download like the current build
or whatever so I've got the like the
most recent how big is it it's like 50
megs in a CSV really not that's it I
know to do is just a ski come on so I
mean I don't think it's like the most
ultimately extensive one right there's
probably places where you can pay to get
stuff like that out of it but you know
just for like funsies so through this
together now I'm sinking alright cool so
I can take a picture I can read the
barcode i can grep through the list i
can get the thing i can pull that out i
can grab a google search on search
whatever now the only thing I need to do
if I've got a twitter api for PHP i'm
playing with so it's just like I'm like
just a little bit of glue away from I
got the proof of concept in my head
working I got it you know you could also
Van Lines is take a picture of stuff and
create your own wish list mm-hmm like
like wedding registry type stuff yeah
like all right that's what you do it no
that's something idea I suck I'm not
getting married so don't don't crazy it
is oh yeah so I'll believe that
when I see it yeah boom I'm making like
twitpic like like you you do an at some
certain person on Twitter or you do like
a pound code and then like the bot like
searches so you're creating a pocket
everybody can use yeah so like if you do
like at that bot where you tag it with
some and it'll reply to you with what it
was well if they're right there if this
PHP script I've got will like check some
eyes or search that Twitter for a
certain thing in the RSS feed and then
when it sees it and go and grab the
image and run it through the thing rip
out the the thing run it through the
database pull it out and maybe even you
know send you a reply back with a you
know mobile google link or something I
don't know this is kind of far-fetched
little bit this is probably already does
they're already there they've taken the
picture yeah they know what it is yeah
they could buy it right there I guess I
mean I know it's on the FN
just fell like doing it like I'll screw
it in the store them at this point you
don't screw with Paul sure grab that
package behind you Paul and I went to
daikon in Dayton Ohio a few weeks ago
and we were at this party afterwards and
we met some cool people the security
twits I'll have links in the show notes
them they're pretty cool and they sent
Paul a little gift here Oh Darren loves
doing this you did it to West and season
two so when I get this out here this is
from the security twits for put the
poles are down for you introduce and
hahaha see the way it works is you uh
I'm gonna help me out here you want to
go ahead and uh hook that up on me
Freddie well you fill it up first none
that we owe you fill it up first fill it
up first okay you're gonna have to chug
buddy all right well this was for Paul
I'm why isn't pulling camera ha oh yeah
come here oh yeah Tippett ha come on my
car take off them come on oh come here
Paul go leave it on camera one how did
you get them to send this I don't know
he was like I'm gonna see the one of the
discrete wits message me on Twitter
don't just don't spill it on my new car
to spill it on anything dude all right
you ready Paul all the promises i got
picketers from right all right I guess
bong gosh it's a father slam bongo oh
yeah that was my beer look it was my
beer what did I do it will give me
another beer that's the last one what ya
got that was awesome we didn't brief we
didn't refill before we started the show
no well yeah that that was nice that was
over he would like to but he doesn't
render to the mail it's it's p.o.box
6002 blames for Virginia 2 3 188 and
yeah care of pack fire during kitchen
whatever it'll find its way that's gonna
be great I'm not alive mmm um all right
so so let's turns out from that how
these Shannon
laughing over there Shannon what what's
going on with this this week's LAN party
oh my god sometimes I wonder about you
guys I really do it's a pink flamingo
that's a bong he was beer bong he was
doing i'm at the party at the after
party at daikon yeah it's pretty epic
it's pretty epic sauce I love it anyway
let me tell you guys about our next LAN
party it's gonna be unreal tournament
classic yeah Unreal Tournament 1999
we're going to be playing at game dot
hack five dot org on November 29th so
definitely join us I don't know how
Darren is you know playing on Unreal
Tournament I hear he's pretty good
looking for challengers you're looking
for challenge yeah you can just go ahead
and sign up in forms on your gaming
section you know what I think we should
do yeah which we do i wait we have no
confirmation on this whatsoever hmm but
i'm thinking out loud tournament like a
like a unreal tournament tournament it's
recursive i like like a UT deathmatch
back in the day yeah yeah she probably
run some bull whips of you destroying
what call a blessing haha Doolittle
rematch action he nearly broke the mouse
okay maybe maybe we should um but the
only the only thing i request yes it
wasn't the mouse not working for him or
something Oh two years yes he's driving
over here right now probably kick
someone's ass cuz he's watching on the
stream we wish you probably only the
request is if I'm gonna have a co-host
if I'm gonna have a co-host doing the
broadcasting make sure it's somebody
who's at least awake yeah not hungover
what he's getting at is the live show
way to go likes yeah so we'll maybe do a
live thing on the twenty-ninth for the
land party that's a saturday so we're
shooting on the friday tune in for the
shoot and then yeah and then uh and then
the next day we're going to be playing
we do want to do more live events but
we'll get to that later probably next
week we're running a little long we're
top heavy let's go ahead yeah so unreal
tournament 99 Gamecock 5 org on november

hak5 that's hak5 godaddy recently
started registering see a domain names
to some restrictions apply see the site
for details and get your piece of the
internet at godaddy.com next we're going
to be talking about some windows steady
state but first we're going to take a
break
you see that movie Groundhog Day we're
just keep repeating the same stuff over
and over and over what if you could do
that with windows I'm here to show us
exactly that Matt what's going on man
that was a great analogy I must say it's
not the best but all right you kind of
blew me away without I didn't think you
were capable didn't go to school for
this spots all right today I'm gonna be
showing you guys window steady state I'm
basically a window steady state I for
whatever reason I had been thinking
about my days in high school when we had
an aftermarket third party program that
was doing basically what we're gonna be
showing you how to do here for free the
program was like you know something
crazy like hundred dollars per license
and stuff like that you needed installs
on every single computer so this is
something that the school had set up on
the machines to what protect you from
yourself pedobear yeah pedobear yeah um
basically what it was is they didn't
want people screw with machines so they
installed restricting software
apparently nobody heard of group
policies but I digress window steady
state basically the name as the name
implies it's a steady state that you can
always go back to the great thing about
it is well then whose is for that the
primary you know user base for is going
to be people coffee shops libraries with
shared computers okay so random person
comes in off the street off your shop
yeah just internet cafe type stuff
exactly you know random library person
comes in off the street uses the machine
you don't want them screwing up the
machine they bring a little you three
drive they pop it into the USB port it's
not very good yeah that's not very smart
no it's not at all no but what we can do
with window steady state is we can not
only limit what people can actually do a
machine we could prevent them from
destroying the machine totally and the
way that it works is it creates a cache
file okay so there's like an abstraction
layer some sort of way so that when
you're you know some random you know kid
that likes to pack his high school if
you will and then playing with the
registry and I you know leave and come
back
and what I reboot the computer thinking
I own the thing and what basically what
it does is it goes back to the point in
time where the administrator said this
is the starting point so it's like
snapshots and VMware uh yeah but on a
more consistent basis and it doesn't
every time the machinery starts like
this so basically a kid can blue screen
a box he can okay so tell me how this
works so what's that first I want to
show you the administration interface
and basically the administration
interface is just like any other windows
application you've ever used it's very
easy to create users to create groups
and to actually lock down the settings
of the machine by those user settings so
here we've created a user called library
guest and what we can actually do is we
can actually also put time limits on the
amount of time that they can be on the
machine it'll automatically log them off
and in addition put feature in Windows
restrictions on the machine okay so what
kind of feature research what are we
talking about here if we didn't want
them to have access to the internet
which is kind of dumb for a shared
computer well I mean unless you're an
internet cafe yeah yeah because you
couldn't use the notepad help trick
doesn't work oh really new oh yeah I
like that yeah all right yours go okay
cool basically you can actually you
could prevent internet access you can
say you can only go to these internet
sites so Wikipedia or whatever anything
like that in addition system itself in
the in addition we can limit right click
we can limit drive letters and drive
numbers we can block individual programs
i might be installed not part of windows
that you know everything listed here so
we can hide every single drive if we
wanted to and when they go to my
computer sort of blank screen yeah so
this is a lot of stuff that you could
also do with root policies but let's see
that it's got the finesse that this user
interface here looks you know very
similar to your standard XP user page
exactly it didn't it doesn't take an IT
guy to administer yeah window study
season 8 MMC snap-in exactly I mean
we've all used group policy and it's
pain in the ass yeah but the really nice
thing is protect the hard disk okay
okay so what it does is you go ahead and
you turn it on and it creates a cache
file of everything as the computer is
right now so you're going to need
obviously hard drive space nowadays
isn't very expansion an issue yeah but
it will basically take the drive and
make a copy of it sure so every time the
machine is restarted any changes that
were made in the machine if you're not
an administrator you have the option to
save changes and then restart your
changes are completely eradicated and
the system is restored to that cache
file on the drive so like I said kid can
screw up the registry driver is going to
show me so what we're going to do is
we're actually gonna log out of the
administrator panel here and we're
actually going to log into our library
guest now here's the pop-up that comes
up when you're an administrator ok
continue without saving changes or we
can save changes and restart the
computer for the sake of this demo
there's no reason for us to restart the
computer because we didn't make any
changes so we'll continue without saving
changes and it's going to log out you
also have the opportu I'd the
administrator log on and only show the
people that you have set up in Windows
steady state so yeah and thus of course
you hold down control Billy twice but
whatever anyway but soon log in your
library gasps so we're gonna log in the
library guess and just like any other
windows machine it's going to come up
with whatever we had set up from this
specific user ok and here we've got a
notification FYI mr. user whoever you
may be the next time you log off
computer or the computer restarts all
changes will be cleared from the disk so
save your files to removable media so
before you go ahead and actually deploy
make sure that when you plug a USB thing
in that I actually works so yeah you
don't go into lockdown to my computer so
they can even get to the USB Drive right
exactly k so cool so I'm uh I'm punk kid
that wants to mess up yo can be oh you
made it a lot more difficult for me here
look at this yeah like nothing here to
work with so what do we got ok come on
get some um come on I got she left me
the command oh uh huh
I uh there's no windows key on your on
your Mac okay windows on no no are all
right uh I'm put me on the spot here oh
we got explore I got mm-hmm ok cool I
can go into the windows directory and
launch myself a little copy of a UH
should meet this file yeah wherever
command is I forget where it is anyway
so say like I start messing stuff up so
let's go ahead and say we wanted to
delete explorer explorer all right okay
mm-hmm never tried to do that doesn't
work too well oh you have no access oh
now that could be because it's in use or
it's locked but let's go ahead and
delete a font okay I hate courier new
why not it's August with it sucks all
right Oh can't delete that either huh
you have no access to delete anything on
this Drive okay well I can grape files
you can create files put thousands of
files in your boot directory and then
your system is going to slow down like
you could do that and sure why not so
let's go ahead and create a text
document open it okay so obviously you
have notepad in wordpad access great so
now I'm a punk kid and I want to start
filling up your drive here okay so I'm
holding down the ctrl V and I am punking
your drive so if I had movie files and
this would be a serious issue because
it'd be crazy files big there we go so
now I got a new folder here and I filled
it with porn great because that's what I
do ready for porn yes so let's so so but
the next user comes the next user comes
in we set it up so after 10 minutes
it'll automatically log out of
inactivity or in the corner here you can
see you've got 57 minutes remaining
before you're automatically logged out
those are completely user definable
we're going to go ahead and log off and
say you know this guy thinks
I did it I filled the computer with porn
and that's 12 year old kids gonna come
on this thing is really like Oh Larry
yes where did my porno folder go Darren
uh window study state makes it really
easy to administer even if you're not an
IT guy security for shared computers is
really the you know why it was created
it's an evolution from another microsoft
tool but in much simpler form the
prompts that you're going to get are
completely you know Joe Schmo can set
this thing up and administer you know a
shared computer in his internet cafe or
you know your local librarian so you
guys know if somebody that can use it
yeah and I don't constantly have to
rebuild machines for somebody that's
exactly what I'm thinking those there's
problem users those ones that you're
constantly like how did you mess it up
again I made you a limited user right
and and then you're like okay what do
you need you need access to SharePoint
any word and you stop calling me
basically what it what it allows you to
do is if you really wanted to you could
turn it into a dummy terminal that the
only thing they have access to our
things like terminal services on the
internet you know we're going to get a
word internet and that's it and then you
don't have to worry about it now
obviously like you said a lot of the
stuff can be you know done with
Republican group policies but if you
vote if you're only managing a small
business they might not have active
directory to implement group policies
and stuff like that so this makes it a
whole lot easier I love it so does I
like what's that random trivia what does
in with Shannon and see what's going on
with this week's trivia this week's
trivia is by mid nineteen forty what
craft littered London in the hundreds
with the task of defending against dive
bombers in the occasional v1 flying bomb
be the first one to answer the trivia
right in either the hak5 forums or the
revision3 forums will not only send you
a hack five sticker but also a pro nobis
or CD
and that's the music playing in the
background right now we also wanted to
thank our sponsor Netflix calm and we
actually have a Roku in our house for
our netflix instant queue and I've
pretty much watched heroes every single
day of this past month and if you decide
to sign up with Netflix you can be one
of our friends and we'll send you our
recommendations of what we think is cool
with Netflix you can rent over 90,000
titles online including lots of blu-ray
titles with free shipping both ways to
and from your home they now have over 40
shipping centers almost all deliveries
happen in just one business day Netflix
plans start at four dollars and
ninety-nine cents and as a new member
you can get a no-risk two week free
trial membership check it out at WWF
flexkom / hak5 and please don't forget
the 3 w's and next stuff i'm going to
tell you about a new way to organize
your desktop
now i'm sure many of you have felt the
frustration when you've got like thirty
five applications open and you can't
find where your work is and you're
working on several different types of
tasks and even with like three or four
monitors what's going on on your screen
you're to show us a new way to organize
our tasks or desktop Shannon what is
this what still you got going on here
yeah I've definitely felt that anger
towards my computer when I have way too
much crap open everywhere and I can't
find the window that I'm searching for
video editing you got your research
enjoyed chatting you got your email
stuff it's so I found this thing called
Microsoft scalable fabrics it's
basically this visualization of say a
computer desk or table I'm sure you've
done a lot of research projects in your
day when you have a bunch of papers
scattered all over the place and stuff
so a way to picture this is so you've
got a bunch of papers scattered all over
the person you get our hack five scripts
yeah you got a bunch of hak5 script so
you put them in piles depending on what
they are a bunch of different piles and
then you have this main area where your
main work is right so this is a
visualization of this this takes us into
the computer more than just the taskbar
like like there's tools to reorganize
the the taskbar so you can move stuff
around but that's not necessarily what
this is so I'm seeing just show me a
demo because I'm seeing a lot of really
pretty graphics here and thumbnails and
stuff it's kind of show me how this
works okay so instead of having just the
little bar down here with a bunch of
crap we have different groupings of
things like right here i have the
entertainment grouping okay and you
click on that that group and everything
just pop everything maximizes into my
main area pretty cool huh mm-hmm and I
can minimize that and then up here i
have this ustream area since we're doing
this kind of live right now we're doing
a webcam show wahoo tuna non-credit
that's all my ustream stuff okay and i
can minimize that back over to choose my
group fluff and I see we've got this
blue box here we've got our woody would
you consider that this is our main work
area but and over in the corner on the
side I would say this is your like
peripheral vision area huh basically
this is everything out of the way that
you're not and it always like he does it
always
to be like that with my stuff on top of
my icons on the left side of my desktop
no it doesn't you can move it around
wherever you want and you can even make
this box smaller or bigger depending on
how you want it so say you have like
multiple monitors this would be a really
good thing to have the big blue box your
main area in your big wide screen
monitor and then have your different
groupings separated on your two other
monitors big ugly blue box no you can
take this away you just go back down to
the taskbar and go to hide boundaries
and it just completely disappears but
it'll memorize exactly where you have
your windows oh I love that I hate it
when like you've got so many things open
and then when things don't start up in
the same place you Adam I mean I can
remember the first time I went dual
monitors it was actually with like a 19
inch CRT and then I also had like I
upgraded from a 15 inch CRT so I got I
like had like the sidecar going on this
would be perfect for that you've got
sidecar you know my little peripheral
monitor where I came up rupes of of
stuff yeah so this is a really really
good program for anybody who does a lot
of multitasking say somebody who does I
don't know video editing so really
anything I love this so what do you get
to obviously windows only yes it's
windows only it was me by Microsoft labs
so yeah they did a lot of reason it's
like mine does over there at the
microsoft site yeah that's what I've
heard yeah so what do you need to get
this running you need 1.1 net framework
okay you have to have that so so you
know i have like dotnet framework you
can't like have a 3.5 or in a 3.4
whatever is out right now you have to
have one point one all right yeah I

download it on vista didn't work too

wait snubs well okay just one all right
sorry guys we might have more out there
I mean answer room answer your emails
Darren yeah dude I've got a time they're
all tagged to next episode it's more
good all right sinister black rights I
was wondering if there is a way to
capture the data that is transferred on
a USB port when something is hooked up
to one the reason why i was wondering is
because i want to capture the data from
my zune when i connect it to my
computers so i can somehow reverse
engineer it does anybody know how to do
something like this guys it just so
happens that Darren read a single email
this past week and found up Barry I
don't want to all right feedback at hak5
org to get us to answer your own
question Darren what is the answer well
there's just like we talked about
earlier about Wireshark a network
protocol analyzer for sniffing internet
traffic on the network there's basically
the same kind of thing for us be on the
windows side that there are two
different programs i want to point you
to first one is called sniff USB it's a
exact list set it's a free Windows USB
sniffer it looks like this it's not
super pretty but it's going to get the
job done allow you to take a look at the
actual USB packets that are going to be
back and forth because that's actually
how it works it's not kind of okay the
other one is a pig you know I don't know
it's not too expensive but it's called
USB trace its bye sis nucleus and it's a
another software USB protocol analyzer a
lot more pretty I want to go ahead and
you give you a kind of an idea of how
this works like I said looks kind of
similar to something like Wireshark so
over here on the Left I've got all of
the different stuff that's plugged into
my computer like I've got my acer
crystal eye webcam which is you know
point 3 megapixels and sucks or up here
I can check my logitech USB wheel mouse
hooray so I'm going to go ahead and
check that okay okay and it can find all
the fun information about it what I want
to do is hit play up here and start my
capture and when you move that mouse
around what it doesn't do so well on
glass there we go you can start seeing
it's jared you're moving my mouse come
on yeah you can start seeing that I've
got you know a ton of traffic here whoa
it's seriously put the mouse down you
couldn't blow up his acer yeah but you
can actually take a look at the buffers
at the object at the all of the i/o you
can take a look at it and hacks ascii
whatever and come down here and kind of
get an idea i'm not going to claim to be
an expert on reverse engineering or
anything like that but as far as seeing
the traffic that's going across your USB
port this allows you to break down you
know huh by hub device by device and
start taking a look at just that data so
you can hopefully find a way to reverse
engineer your zune and let us know how
that goes because I'd be very interested
in seeing what were your project leads
you yeah reverse engineering yeah yeah
definitely um but alright so does if
you'd like to yeah if you'd like to send
us a question feedback I hak5 org I have
a whole bunch already tagged in gmail
questions for air so have a bunch more I
did get through all my email i had like
150 or something that i had to bury
myself out dig myself out if it only
took you this past week yeah well it's
been a very stressful week but hey we're
back up top oh cool so before we go guys
