support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are going to
go over how to customize your scanning
options there are plenty of occasions
where slowing down or speeding up your
skin can help you receive better
detailed outputs from nmap or network
mapper for example if you're on a really
really slow connection you may want to
slow down your skin to give you more
accurate results now there are several
several options that you can add to your
command to make this happen so let's go
ahead and go through some of the really
important ones so first off I should
probably mention how nmap looks at times
it automatically puts time into a
millisecond format so for example if you
type 101 0 0 that would be 100
milliseconds pretty quick now if you
type 100's with an S after it that would
be 100 seconds or if you typed 1 M that
would be 1 minute
and you could also do 1h and that would
be one hour so 1,000 milliseconds
obviously that's going to be one second
because there are 1000 milliseconds in
one second so if my command ended up
including 1000 I could also type 1s
instead and it would also give me the
same output
there are also timing templates that you
can add to end map commands if I example
typed my command as n map and then I put
tack capital T 0 and then my target so
I'll do the same target I usually do hit
enter and this is going to force n map
to go very very slowly you see it's
taking forever so as you can see I went
ahead and cancelled the t0 scan because
it goes so incredibly slow now I can
also alternatively add up to dash T 5
which will make it go extremely fast
like you just see here now n map will
send out a scan with several parallel
port scans at one time and this is
pretty normal for it you can control
this though with the max parallelism
parallelism
minimum parallelism option now for
example if I typed in nmap and then - -
max - parallel how do you spell that Liz
- space 4 and then whatever your target
is and press Enter
the maximum number of ports that nmap
will scan at any given time will only be
4 so it won't go any higher than that
alternatively if you wanted to use the
minimum parallelism 100 that will tell
nmap to scan no less than 100 Forte's at
the same time which actually may result
in less accuracy now I'll be right back
after a break with so many more tiny
options we're going to have plenty of
fun in just a moment the hack shop is
hack fives premier store for all of your
pen testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and of course
it types like a keyboard it can type
scripts into a computer crazy crazy fast
like this week's favorite from crack
knuckles or crook huckel's that can
attack a Windows machine at the log on
screen and gain access to the CMD the
command prompt with admin privileges now
of course we couldn't do the show
without you so we'd like to thank you
with something special you can use the
coupon code snubz with any order for
your very own signed hack tip sticker
thank you so much for supporting the
show
we're back with more timing options so
let's move on to host group sizes these
commands will tell nmap how many hosts
to scan at the same time on a network so
for example if I typed and map then tack
tack
min tack host group and I'll choose how
many I went to skin 10 dot 70 3.31 dot
1/2 full and I press enter so when this
runs it would scan a minimum of 10 hosts
at a time which can absolutely speed up
your skin you can also use max host
group 10 and then the same target to set
the maximum number of hosts to scan this
might slow down the target so
alternatively either/or will work for
you depending on what your problems are
and here's another fun one use this
command to change the RTT timeout value
which basically is the default round
round-trip time in milliseconds before
nmap has a timeout if you want to do
this you use the command and map tactic
initial RTT - timeout if I spell it
right 6000 so remember that's in
milliseconds and then whoever your
target is and it finishes now remember 6
would be 6 seconds or 6000 milliseconds
you can also set the max RTT timeout
with - - max - Artie T - timeout and
then put ever whatever your timeout
would be so the default in M map is an
RTT timeout at 10 seconds which you can
set lower to make it a faster scan or
you can set it higher to give keep n map
from giving up on a scan now lastly is
the maximum retries that and map will
try before it gives up this one is
pretty important especially if you're
running on a really really slow
connection so you can use the command
and map couple dashes max retries and
i'll tell it to retry three times before
giving up and your target
so obviously this one this target was
able to figure it out it evil to give me
some kind of output after one try but if
I was on a slow connection and map would
try again and again three times in a row
until it absolutely gave up now that's
about it for today we know that we have
plenty of timing options available so
we're going to cover the rest of them
