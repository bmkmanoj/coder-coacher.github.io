sign up the hack across America com even
if you don't you don't add there's a
little misconception here you don't have
to like have a hackerspace you just have
to be interested in participating so if
that's your bag if you have tech nos you
are you want to come out and meet space
then let's meet space it up and you know
make space hi girl whoo yeah laughs IRL
me 20 girls sometimes sometimes I like
IRL see the thing is you can't have
cyber space without IRL that's true damn
shame when there's like crazies on the
road that's when I don't like IRL man
yeah check out the this is another
reason why you should be on the Google+
is Widow hey YouTube video over there I
digress we got we've been getting a lot
of awesome feedback about this ph series
i also want to say that i I've been
having trouble with male volokh so I've
actually switched over oh really I
haven't had any problems with male below
you know might beat some of those excite
ride all of the extensions from your
segment last week and now male the loop
is acting up so it's like privacy yeah I
had to take off all of the ones that i
was using because as soon as I turn them
all on my computer totally well we've
got an i3 I think like ultimately this
is the thing that I hate is the privacy
it just like security not convenient
yeah and it's complicated and that's
actually complicated that's one of the
big questions about pgp and people are
sending it in is we've gotten a lot of
people email us and be like no why do I
want to do this why should I have pgp
because I don't have anything that
really matters yeah I don't have
anything I want to protect ya and and to
that to that I must say it's not about
having something to hide here's a little
story for you guys get this I was born I
was brought into an imperfect nation I
was given a name was given a social
security number I was given an education
it was written by the victors right and
all the while I was brought up to being
told that you know so much better off
than those poor saps and you know that
other country right and
you know you could probably argue that
that might be the case that you know we
were here in the civilized western world
that we actually have it pretty good but
I wouldn't call it some utopia hell you
know if I've learned anything from
Captain Picard over the years is that no
such thing exists not even on the 24th
century so true but consider that I was
born into a nation of war Warren Middle
East war on terror hell when it wasn't a
war with Nick line out the war on drugs
you know trademark all the wars it's
good for the economy right and meanwhile
let's give up some liberties for assault
false sense of security well I don't
know well there's all this war and
slavery and if you're thinking there
isn't check out your uh your financial
debt oh yeah it's horrible that may be
good for the bottom line is it as for
the nation as if it were some faction
that could be you know some real time
strategy game is if this could be one I
don't know it just doesn't work for me
and that's why I'm so thankful for
cyberspace because it's a land that
knows no bounds you know there's no
borders or bias or at least there's no
reason for it to exist I mean that the
code doesn't care either way it's people
of Earth and they're free to be
themselves and to share thoughts without
fear of prosecution from their neighbors
of their rulers well I've heard you say
several times that you feel like you're
a what is it a civilian of the internet
citizen of the internet isn't of the
Internet yeah or is it in real life well
you know talking about citizens I met
this awesome guy at a hackerspace in
Ireland right he's doing some wicked
cool stuff with Wi-Fi and I told him
like dude you should go and check out
the awesome stuff that they're doing in
seattle Wi-Fi right but he's like oh I
can't go to see how our clients go to
see alice yeah right i'm going there on
the twenty-ninth right no you know why
he can't because his passport says South
Africa really but where can he go online
ah not quote the mentor we exist without
skin color without nationality without
religious bias to me everyone on IRC is
green text on a black background don't
get me wrong I'm not under the
impression that the internet is some
utopia you know hell I spent a week the
United Nations finding out that it's not
that first hand right Nations consider
the internet a resource
they're resource just as they consider
you their resource their human resource
to the place which you happen to have
been born whether your Terran or Zerg or
otherwise you know that's it I don't
believe it's perfect anymore than I
believe in flaws you know I've got this
scar on my left leg from motorcycle
accident does that make me flawed or are
we just the way we are and the internet
is simply a reflection of that YouTube
comments and all mmhmm yeah no kidding
so it's not about having nothing to hide
anymore than it's about protecting the
Fourth Amendment of a constitution
written by some imperfect people who
probably had slaves and it's about
staying free as a human tribe honor in
cyberspace because I feel like this is a
land that transcends these more than
vessels which must remain subject to the
bounds of governance and society in this
physical space I don't know I feel like
without privacy we can't have freedom of
expression without anonymity we're far
from free of prejudice and if this tribe
of humans here on earth if we're going
to last another century well then we've
got to be able to live without fear of
oppression now interestingly the 12th
article of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights from the United Nations
which is signed like 65 years ago right
states that no one shall be subject to
arbitrary interference with his privacy
family home or correspondence nor to
attacks upon his honor and reputation
everyone has the right to the protection
of the law against such interference of
tax so you could imagine voting without
privacy without anonymity no more over
than privacy here the part that
resonates with me is that about honor
you know imagine a society without power
and status right without rich and poor
ultimately it's your honor that defines
who you are yeah so are you a scumbag
Steve were you a good guy greg that's
the way I feel about that I like to
think I'm a good guy greg yeah you are
that guy is awesome yeah Greg so cool
yeah I like dinosaurs um that was
awesome it's you know I know you always
go off on these tangents but they're
always really meaningful so well that's
why I say like that's why my passport
don't have
right now my hacker passport you know
says citizen of Earth you know that's
really you like part of a bigger tribe
and I just see the Internet is something
that could transcend this stupid bones
that aren't necessary for one world but
anyway that's why privacy is important
or at least to me and I want to hear
from you guys in the comments and feel
free to continue emailing us especially
with pgp as you have been because this
is an ongoing discussion and I think
it's really important now stay tuned
because coming up we're getting some
software yeah our repositories that
wasn't inner repositories when we're
making repositories outside the
repositories maybe compiling our own
compiling all right sudo apt-get install
oh wait now we can't it's not an
apposite or e all right we're gonna

be back after this quick break and you
