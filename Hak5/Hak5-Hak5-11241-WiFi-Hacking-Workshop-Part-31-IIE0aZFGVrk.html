assist hello welcome to hack 5 my name
is darren kitchen and this is your
weekly dose of technolo stand welcome to
the third part of our Wi-Fi workshop
this is the one that it did over at
noise bridge the excellent hackerspace
here in San Francisco you're gonna have
to give me just a moment mmm rehydrating
cuz we just got back from DEFCON 20 and
had a fantastic time there in fact I
actually did a workshop there much
similar to the one you're about to see
with sebastian AKA Seb as well as Robin
wood aka did you ninja from the Wi-Fi
pineapple project so yeah awesome stuff
in fact even doing another workshop here
next week
at in in northern Washington or the
westernmost tip of Washington tour camp
we're gonna have some awesome awesome
footage from that it's like Burning Man
for hackers I don't really know actually
Def Con was more like nerding man but I
won't get out too much here I'm just
yeah here let you guys know that this is
part 3 of 3 of our Wi-Fi workshop I
wanna thank you for tuning in we've got
so much great feedback on the last two
so any of you guys are gonna enjoy this
and be sure to just tweet us and and and
plus us and like us and all of those
other things let us know what you think
about this stuff and we're having a lot
of fun with it so without further ado
here's me and a workspace thing doing a
thing let's roll Paul make the thing
happen
thanks so last time on this panel we
were talking about management frames and
all of the other different ins and outs
of attitude at 11
our beloved Wi-Fi how it works so let's
understand it and I think a lot of you
have already kind of seen what we've
alluded to about the way that the the
beacons and the probes and the requests
and some of the demos have come and it
Illustrated some nefarious things that
you can do with it and because it's all
really just based on trust
the authentication bit is there to do
like hey
you know my Wi-Fi is around here join me
here are my capabilities and channels oh
I'm using wpa2 you know and it's like
alright good luck
you know you're not going to brute-force
that unless they're using the common
SSID and their password is in the
dictionary in which case there's
probably already rainbow tables but that
aside if they're using something unique
and something pretty secure that's not
what this is about because there are so
many more fun and interesting ways to
hack Wi-Fi than breaking into your
neighbor's wireless network I mean
that's really kind of boring although if
you want to do that most everybody still
has WPS enabled so go check out Reaver
because that'll that'll take it down
like that's awesome we can talk about
that some other done so I bring up how
is your karma how's your karma good to
hear fine mine's pretty good too
I'm stoked because we've been here for
like a year and we finally came out here
to meet you guys and honestly we're only
doing this just cuz we want to network
so if you're timid about coming up and
saying hi don't please do that because
we're here to meet our peers yeah I know
I was like I'm gonna lure all the
hackers in with cheap hardware and
education and then I'm gonna ask them
how's your karma you know just nothing
nothing real deep or anything but yeah
convenience actually that's what we're
talking about right now is convenience
and karma you see karma is this awesome
tool written by Deano a couple years
back and then later adopted by my boy
Robin wood then took it from one driver
set called mad Wi-Fi to another one
called mad Wi-Fi ng and now to a thing
called hostapd and it's a tool and it's
it's the basis of a tool set that we've
developed that we like to call a yoga
and yoga is German for the yes man when
the expression Bishan Deutsche good
so what y'all zagat does is when it sees
a probe request like that it says yes
because it's the yes-man we can talk
about nine zeg a to the know man in fact
I think we did some D authenticating and
I oh yeah it looks like that's going
pretty well actually yeah
do you authenticating it's going pretty
well but we're just talking about Yahoo
got right now and it's simple it's so
beautiful what a simple white lie can do
to break the inherent trust that is the
whole system you know and so what that
allows us to do if we're running a
wireless access point here that all it's
doing is looking for probe requests
saying hey or you might lynxes hair you
Noisebridge hair you ATT Wi-Fi hair you
go go in flight hey are you K OIT
whatever like you name it the this thing
is responding to it and saying yeah
that's me let's be best friends for life
and that now you can imagine if you're
walking one of these guys on a battery
pack so polluted in some sort of a
canister outside I don't know something
that people won't steal you could
actually go up to one of those there are
these boxes I've seen them down here I
just moved to San Francisco a little
over a year ago so a lot of this is new
to me but I've seen these to have them
out here on the street it's like got
this tin can and you put a core or if
it's a Sunday and you open this door and
they've got these dead trees that tell
you things it's like an RSS reader
except it's really slow well if you lift
up the bottom of those there's enough
great room in there to put a car battery
and this thing runs off 12 volts so if
you were to say conceal one of these
guys with a little 3G dongle this one's
great from t-mobile I'm not promoting
t-mobile I also have ones from like ting
and ones from Virgin Mobile I really
like the Virgin Mobile one - this is
great I literally bought this online
actually I guess the t-mobile ones a
better experience because I didn't have
to use an address I went to the t-mobile
store and I bought this with cash and a
man asked me to write my name on a
post-it note
yeah and then I go down to the morgue
Pablo and I get myself a little card and
a scratch off some things and it's
awesome I've got internet with anonymity
and now it's connected to my pineapple
and this is so beautiful because now if
I put this in that little tick hang out
on the street that offers people
newspapers I can also offer them
internets and that's just a like just a
nice little public service a little
thing that I like to do for everyone and
it's kind of great because you can
manage it remotely with SSH tunnels and
things like that and do a little bit of
packet sniffing and what we like to call
man in the middle and I shouldn't have
to explain that at a hackerspace my
slides are out of order and that's a
pineapple yes how is the USB I have a
floppy dongle manipulator on it and it
allows it to pivot in multiple ways it's
pretty cool but there's a USB port yeah
but if you get the manipulator it can do
that huh I'm just saying you're not
living until you had a floppy dongle so
originally we developed this on the show
hack 5 season 4 episode 1 just kind of
like as a big like yeah I wouldn't that
be great you know it actually got its
name because the Jim Louderback CEO or
or something of CEO I believe of
revision3 in that I'm just talking to us
when we were joining the networking and
we're like oh we've got this awesome
segment planned we're gonna do it like
on the first episode when we join
revision 3 and we're gonna get a lot of
viewers it's gonna be so great and I got
to think of some gimmick some way to
make cute or whatever because it's
really all about invoking an emotional
response with something and there's
nothing better than cartoons for that
right so I decided to - pineapple right
because it's like a grenade that
actually turns out Wi-Fi grenade is
already taken and you know honestly I
like the pineapple better it's cuter and
so it was pretty cool in that when we
did that first episode and I actually
use a real pineapple
by the way fYI don't core out fruit and
put bird wear in it if you ever want to
use that hardware again it gets sticky
and so a year goes by and we're not
doing we're like we've moved on and we
give out the firmware and we're like hey
guys go get this router and solder this
thing and get this thing and still on
the stuff and there's like a forty seven
step tutorial ins really a lot of fun
and
and it just so happened that they make
party cups that were the perfect size to
fit the board and a battery pack in with
a little hole for the straw that was
perfect for the antenna and so that's
how we end up with these I know why the
slide is there oh that's what it looks
like on the inside it's just fun oh
don't go through airport security with
one of these though I actually had
somebody like pull me aside and be like
can you explain this and I was like to
be honest that's my novelty router
really yeah they make them in coconut -
I think I bring all that up because of
hackers for charity I'm so excited to
welcome back a fond sponsor of ours go
to assist by Citrix you guys know that

code hak5 again that's go to assist comm
with promo code hak5 i think i'd bring
all that up because of hackers for
charity who's familiar with this alright
more people should be raising their
hands next time because hackers for
charity is an awesome thing put together
by a man by the name of Johnny long you
may know him as J zero SS y then Johnny
I hack stuff as in the Google hacker as
an he's written a lot of books totally
awesome
dude as far as hacking and social
engineering is concerned and so what he
did was he didn't go to Bolivia he went
to Botswana
I know I don't know what the regulations
are like in Wi-Fi but he went to
Botswana with his wife and started doing
some really cool work with with children
there and helping people learn computers
and stuff like that and next thing you
know builds this charity where for the
longest time was accepting hardware and
the money and then building like
computer centers where they teach people
like useful skills where they can go out
and get jobs and it's really a whole big
heartwarming thing and it's awesome
because they support the hacker
community the hacker community supports
them and they're doing some good work in
Botswana
maybe they'll branch out to Bolivia I
don't know I mention that because and is
it there no I mention that because this
guy probably a year after we debuted
this pineapple thing and like people are
knocking down our door will you make
Wayne one when you build me one will you
custom this one and it's like no dude
here's the hardware solder it up 47 step
thing you'll be done in four hours it'll
be a lot of fun you'll learn a lot and
it ends totally true and we still
absolutely wholeheartedly support that
but Johnny long called me up and said
dude I'm going to the House of
Representatives like Dave from tomorrow
or tomorrow or something like that he's
like can I get a pineapple at home like
yeah so I whip one up and FedEx it
overnight Maryland and he does this
thing and I wish I'd the photo up on
here but if you somewhere on the hack
shop if you go to HHH opcom or just
Wi-Fi pineapple calm you'll find it and
it's like on the product page and it's
at the very about a minutes and it's
Johnny long with the pineapple in front
of the House of Representatives and so
that was pretty cool
and so that following shmoocon
remember epic hacker conference where
you can throw things at people and you
guys are totally allowed to hear I know
that I can talk fast but please throw
your laptop at me whoo - and then and
then so for the next shoe con they were
doing a silent auction and so we're
figured to benefit hackers for charity
we'd go ahead and donate one of these
and the thing went for like 400 bucks
and we were like what we what really
really so since then pretty much we've
been doing this and we labeled at the
Wi-Fi pineapple and now we sell it to
government agencies educational
institution penetration testers and
hackers
aka twelve-year-olds the point of it all
the whole point of this whole fun yoga
Wi-Fi pineapple karma integrated driver
hacking Wi-Fi router of doom is so that
you can become the man in the middle so
that just like your internet service
provider just like Comcast or Time
Warner or AT&amp;amp;T or cox communications or
whoever else you've got they can
eavesdrop do a little bit packet
sniffing just like we were doing on a
Wireshark on our mom zero interface they
can do like phishing attacks you know I
mean we would pretty much trust that
Comcast isn't going to do phishing
attacks on us except for when they
reroute DNS when you type in the wrong
thing and then they get some other stuff
with ads side jacking attacks those are
really fun that's where like I'm like oh
hey was that your cookie cool let me
borrow that cookie and hey now I'm you
on Facebook and then injection which is
really cool where you're like oh cool
you want that webpage and it's got all
these JavaScript dependencies and what
we would throw this other JavaScript
that I got you might like it it's called
keylogger Jas yeah yeah go type your
password and kittens because if you're
not injecting kittens into the internet
you're really not doing humanity a
service so just bear in mind that your
ISP is capable of doing the same thing
this just makes it easier for you to
become you know endpoint in the whole
wonderful router hopping fun that is the
internet so I recently hacked a
conference and I started building these
little boxes and I just figured that
it'd be really fun to take these things
which are known as 18 650 batteries
pretty cool it's the designation comes
from 18 is the first number it's 18
millimeters in diameter 650 tenths of a
millimeter long and these things are
what is in most of your guys laptops
right now they're 3.7 volts each you get
them in around 3,500 milliamp hours and
I think over 9,000 of them are in the
Tesla Roadster as I started putting them
in boxes with with Wi-Fi pineapple and
3G adapters and buttons and things like
that here's another example of one this
is a really fun when I built battery
packs toss the router in there and
magnets how do they work right
well the nice thing about this is it's
pretty inconspicuous I mean this is
actually a Starbucks in point Richmond
you guys should come by that's where our
studio is we hang out there all the time
you guys are all welcome just text me
and here's it at South by Southwest
can anybody see it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
