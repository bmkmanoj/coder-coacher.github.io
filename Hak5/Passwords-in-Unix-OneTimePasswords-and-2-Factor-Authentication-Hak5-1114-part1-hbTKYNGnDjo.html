authentication with a you Vicki we're
talking one-time passwords in two factor
authentication for ssh plus free sshfs
clients for Windows relay proxies
without exposing ports and known hosts
editing tips all that and more this time
on hak5 this segment of hak5 is brought
to you by idea paint hello and welcome
hak5 my name is darren kitchen and I'm
shenanigans and this is the show where
we re-engineer everything because it
wasn't broken yeah that seems to happen
a lot whenever you do the show hak5
actually about once a year you know yeah
pretty much either we're doing it in a
dining room doing the show in a dining
room or kitchen or garage the garage
when I do the show in the kitchen it
gets recursive like gnu you know yeah
remember that one when I was like
chewing on popcorn behind you is like
what it's there's no point yeah why did
I don't hack five no but what we're
talking about here and we'll have to get
a beer old shot of this is we have
definitely re-engineered the whole
studio and gone back to a live to tape
setup instead of recording I says I know
that's not what you tuned in but we're
just kind of giving you an FYI why
things might seem a little weird cuz
we're doing happy fun switchy stuff and
Paul's over the corner with board of
lights first we do alive sir and this is
gonna give us a whole lot of new
opportunities with live so we have to
figure this out and that means that we
fly by the seat of our pants with our
hair on fire and yeah I'm just imagining
now the seat with the fire in the pants
mmm my hair on fire alright good times
let's do some techno lusty yeah let's do
it yes so what's going on this episode
well as you know we've been talking SSH
lately in the context of proxies and yes
we talked a little bit about security
and we went into what was it called
public key authentication to him yep we
talked about using proxies to do some
little bouncing around stuff reporting
local and remote and things like that
we're actually going a step back to
password baseless dedication but then
making it even cooler with one time
house or it's two factors ah we talked
to briefing about how i use a yuba key
mm-hmm to log into the hak5 WordPress
right yeah and a couple of other things
and I really love it because you know
it's just easy it's secure and we're
going to do the same thing here for our
ssh server and linux awesome okay so i
figured that we should go ahead and just
start off by talking about like a quick
recap of some of the things that we've
covered before as far as ssh ought is
concerned and as you remember there are
four different modes of authentication
and ssh there's password which we
started with right there's public key
which is very secure yes and then
there's also a keyboard interactive hey
which we didn't really touch on you know
the thing about keyboard interactive is
it's mostly used for one-time passwords
except in this case we're actually going
to be using password authentication for
one-time password and we'll get to how
that's all going work here in just a
second the last one being GS s API
that's standing for generic security
services and it's just like implement
Kerberos or ntlm yeah crap like that
we're going back to talking about
password authentication because we're
going to be tying it in with a module
that allows users are you baqi okay and
so to understand password based
authentication again we need to realize
that at least on the UNIX side of the
world what we what we're talking about
when we say that is we're talking about
Pam that's the chick from the office
right yes the chicken in the office is
actually responsible for authenticating
users in Linux she's an excellent office
administrator yes pants stands for
pluggable like plugging in uh kind of
pluggable a modular okay authentication
module
and this is really the default that
you're going to find in unix-like
operating systems so your your linux's
of the world and all the variants and
stuff we're going to use pam to do
authentication and so this came about
back in the day in response to an RFC or
a request for comment by the by the open
source foundation they were like hey
guys let's talk about the way we can
make linux more happy and open stuff
sounds like it happened a long time ago
well in a galaxy far far away sun
microsystems was all like hey guys check
out them oracle came by and was like
rawr and open-source lawsuits and but
that happened later so the idea is with
this though is that Pam is a modular
system for handling authentication it's
kind of like an API just like gssapi
allows you to integrate things like
Active Directory into ssh authentication
well Pam allows you to integrate lots of
different kinds of authentication modes
into linux or well i'm gonna say linux
over and over and I really mean
unix-like operating systems gssapi
actually does Kerberos I'm just gonna
write Kirby cuz she's all like yay yeah
but um and that's probably the only
caveat that I'm gonna go into it's a rat
hole that you're not gonna mind Kerberos
in Pam you kind of can this different
story okay the point being this is
basically what you use to log in to your
modern linux systems and there are four
modules that go into Pam okay so the
first module is account and this is like
my windows sign on account except for
linux and windows you've got the Sam I'm
Linux we get the pain on the damn to
suplex Pam met Sam and I look if I love
and they use good then they got a
Kerberos and then it's like oh my god
machinima later but yeah the account
module ham is really just saying okay
who are you do you have access to be are
you allowed to even be accessing this
system so it is responsible for you know
just checking out that user right right
second part of this is actually the
authentication
and the authentication is what you know
verifies the identity of that accountant
says hey it's typically using a password
and saying hey what's your password is
that what I have them files everything
all good right well the way that it
actually manages those passwords in this
case is an aptly named password module
so that's a password manager not the not
the same as the authentication the
authentication uses part of this to
authenticate this guy over here ah right
and so it's this is as we've seen as we
kind of dissect more more of these just
like SSH has these different
authentication types it has those three
different channel types we noticed that
there's a lot of modularity in when you
design a protocol and that's all done
for security sake and I think you know
for lots of other reasons that are
outside the scope of this discussion but
suffice it to say these are the first
three of the four modules in Pam okay
the password one is really cool because
this like okay I'll sonication handles
checking the password from the account
right was password well that actually
manages the password is like you said a
password manager yeah and let's just go
ahead and take a little diversion here
into the fun world of / ET c / pass w d
PWD yeah well PWD prince organ drug-free
passwd is the password and people say
UNIX isn't a spy working directory not
quite actually you are writing that PWD
is a Python password module but that's
the totally different story we're
getting really sad direct here basically
the reason that I bring this up is
because Pam as its responsible for
passwords is going to use this database
file that you find on a typical unix
system and that lives in this directory
called etsy and files called passwd it's
just a text file okay and what it
contains and I'll just use my system as
an example so my system at home is going
to say Darren it's going to have a line
this is darren that's my username and
then there will be a coal
and so each of these different values
are delimited by colons ok the next
thing is going to be an X and we'll come
back to that in just a second ok the
next thing is going to be a number and
in this in my case it's actually one
thousand and what is that number that
number is the user ID number ok so
remember how we talked about how in UNIX
there are the there's the user there's
the group mmm yeah and then there's the
overworld ah so this is the ID number
for your user yes to that section that's
my user ID number right i also have a
group ID number and in this case it's
also one thousand this is my primary
group ID well because i am the master of
my own group ah mind you i can also
belong to other groups this is my
primary group just like Paul and you and
I could all be a member of the hak5
group okay no and then we could have so
I would be something like 1000 whiner
yeah if they there are anywhere between
zero and 32,000 something oh and there's
a fun trivia thing about that in 16-bit
integers but we're not gonna get into
that um then the next thing is actually
going to be the geckos Oh geckos inside
your computer oh dude why wouldn't there
be getting why not thank you this is it
protect your passwords this is typically
little hands yeah yeah if they do that's
what geckos do I'm just imagining little
wellin anyway um macaco whose is
actually an acronym ok 44 general
comprehensive open or sorry general
comprehensive operating system and okay
this really dates back to like I mean
we're talking unix here linux is unix
units all the labs and 60 oh my god and
puters the size of your fridge rater
plus your mother plus your house and
your car everything else ok so the
reason i bring that up is because this
here it's fun little trivia fact but
back in the day Bell Labs used this area
here to handle like prints pulling stuff
like that we now know it is geckos and
what it's typically contains as a bunch
of
comma delimited information typically
you're going to find its gonna be like
first and last name the building and
room number that you're in really we're
all in a college here as well as your
office telephone number and other for
your you know your patients that's
amazing yes so that's our geckos I
actually leave this blank all the time I
don't like to fill it in mind we'll just
say comma comma comma comma chameleon
and then the chameleon and the get go
hang out with Sam and Pam and then it's
just a good day and then there's also
your home directory in my case it's
slash home slash Darren uh-huh I'm just
a qk and then finally the last thing is
what you're with the first program is
that runs when you log in now I say that
instead of saying shell because this
could be anything oh really well if I
wanted a user as soon as they log in to
get like a million sees yeah I do like V
in sears anything like that yeah which
would be great for baking like a dummy
terminal yeah mine it's slash bin slash
bash cuz I'm a bash user you could use
TCL seashell any of those others but
this right here you're just going to
find line after line after line of these
guys and it's gonna end you can only
edit this if your route and I would
recommend if you are going to edit it
use what is it PWD why I think PP w by
anyway I'll have to look that one
there's a special vie program just for
editing this because you really don't
want to f it up but this file here
remember we're talking about user group
in world yes it needs to be readable by
all of those guys so remember when we
were talking about life file for
missionaries well it's kind of it like
back in the night later in the 80s and
early early 90s not so much when your
files properties is like our dash dash
dash dash oh hahaha I mean readable by
the world the user user and rip not
necessarily in that order well so for
that reason we have X and what that
refers to so X
means no you can't read no yeah we're an
asterisk sometimes to disable the user
but this refers to a file that you're
typically going to find on unix systems
past 1992 I think it was like 1989 or 86
when it was originally developed but
basically as far as a Linux world is
concerned 92 and on became popular and
you're never going to find a system now
ok it doesn't use this practically
speaking we can boot up a vm just to
fire up John the Ripper and show you why
we do this that X right here refers you
to a file call in / UTC called shadow
because before this X what you would
have typically found in here would be a
hash value for the password and what's
right is that it's not salted or
anything no it's not at all salted and
really yeah instead we're talking about
you know an algorithm like SH am like if
you've got an sha-1 based salt up in the
Earth's our hash of your password up in
there and anyone can read this all the
if you go back text so I could just get
onto your linux box sign in as any user
and then check out this file in the
system because I can read it as any user
and find all your information all your
passwords well you'll find the ashes for
them but then you could run them through
like john the ripper because they aren't
solved brute-forcing program and that's
actually if you go back to like the max
files of the of the late 80s and early
90s on text files org you're gonna find
a bunch of guys let's say login is guest
and download the slush etsy / passwd
file and that John Ripper and they break
into the system alright that's why we
have this because what you're going to
find in here is your user ID and then
some other stuff and basically the gist
of it is least on mine i use think of
dollar 6 which is a sh shaw my case 512
and it's everything's encrypted in this
so this is a encrypted equivalent here
and this has different permissions than
this readable by everyone password file
there
okay alright so that was I know so this
talks to that that talks to that yeah
cool that's the idea got in so so Pam
will use this database here to manage
the password Annette so you know
changing the password and stuff like
that so those are the first three the
last of course remember we're talking
about pluggable authentication module
here the last part of that is session
and so this module in Pam is really just
a responsible for managing sessions so
hey are you logged in did you timeout oh
yeah okay you ever run a sudo command is
sudo apt-get install something right and
then you do and then Adel ask you for
the password right yeah and then later
y'all like want to images so like pseudo
DB this thing does doesn't ask for your
password again cuz you're already in
there its memory well this is you know
this is the part of that that is going
to maintain your session and say hey we
haven't used like say for example sudo
we're logging in you know it's saying
hey after 10 minutes or if you open a
new terminal window it's a different
session things ok ok cool so the reason
that I bring up all of this stuff about
Pam is because what we're going to be
doing is adding a module to pam that's
going to allow us to do a little bit of
one-time passwords yay this sounds
logically similar to my Google
authentication app which uses a one-time
password every time that is a perfect
practical example or an implementation
of that another being you know the yuba
key yeah from yuba CO and we've actually
you know on your RSA tokens if you know
I've one of those toward awake is but I
have hacked it's a keychain really but
you know that's that's the idea is that
if you've ever used any of those like
the google authenticator app is a great
example of one because it's time based
and so i guess i should bring up that
that what these are versus your regular
password is your regular possible
is static and these are dynamic mm-hmm
meaning that every time you go ahead and
run your you know your application or
you use your token or whatever it may be
changes every time it changes every time
yeah right and it works on the whole
principle of this is based on random you
know who doesn't like I hope it's random
well it doesn't love random numbers and
so there's a bunch of different ways to
come up with random numbers that both
the server that's authenticating you
over here as well as you are going to be
able to come up with something that you
can negotiate and everybody's going to
agree upon right there's a couple of
ways you mentioned the Google
Authenticator when you open that up it's
got like a little pie chart thing goes
around yeah so you've got 60 seconds or
something like that yeah I pin this
password will that is an example of one
that is time sink so in this case a time
sink is your application on your phone
is an absolute sync with the Google
Authenticator on the backend which uses
epoch you next time it's another tangent
you can get into but but basically the
time in seconds since some arbitrary
date in the 60s has been incrementing
and so they both know that and then
using the time as well as a formula
they're able to come up with a value huh
that's the oversimplification of this
the other thing that you could do is use
a previous password method so a previous
password method would look something
like this if the first time i plugged in
my my you Becky and it sets 0001 the
next time I plugged it in it said 0002
you might imagine what the next password
one might be oh I don't know 0003
probably and if you got enough of these
your finger well in this case we're
talking about a the algorithm would look
like this and i'm not talking about
google +1 yeah yeah yep but this would
be an example of an algorithm now
obviously you use something a little bit
more complex than plus one you'd like
not multiply it'd be like x the love for
your mother and a bun
two other stuff and you know you'd get
that okay of course if you were able to
get enough these you might be able to
reverse it sorry uh that really dear
utterly complicated yes and that right
there is previous pass okay if if you've
got somebody thats collecting enough of
those you got bigger problems yeah and
then the last one would be a challenge
in response that would be like what um
I'm thinking like WPA so when you oh
yeah when you a fennec eight with wpa
and we could do a whole Wi-Fi series
with a whiteboard that'd be fun there's
a 4 Way handshake involved yeah I nobody
actually gives up what the password is
in plain text or anything like that it's
much math and so that's our fun so this
is you all using that good stuff right
okay those are a couple of the different
methods that you're going to find to
create randomness for one-time passwords
and really when we talk about one-time
passwords you know we should keep in
mind that a lot of times all the things
that we're seeing in here like you know
you mentioned the RSA securid tokens
Google Authenticator your you Becky
those are all single aspects of a
greater two-factor authentication system
so here we go I have no markers anymore
so to factor off and so two-factor
authentication is basically defined as
something that take that uses two or
more of three factors of attend occation
of those three are first of all you have
mm-hmm something you are something you
have shared something I would be
something like you're often your Yubikey
and something you know yes exactly so my
yubikey something I have no is the
password that you have in your head or
whatever right in my case it's one two
three four five and in your case it's
game right yes well kind of is we all
just lost that and then our is like you
said something you are and so that's me
oh so like biometric
authentication yeah so like one of these
I'm not doing a horrible fingerprint or
one of these and you're all like ah I've
been out all night drinking and I'm
angry anyway so um anyway you can
actually already think of an example of
one of these that you currently use
probably all the time and that is a big
fat your ATM debit card oh you're right
it's something you have is something you
know then you've got the plastic card
and you know the pin number yeah which
in your case is 1234 right of course of
course and so now that we've kind of
gotten into that and talked about some
of the different practical
implementations oh I'm gonna go ahead
and show you how you can implement the
yuba key into your ssh daemon on your
linux box and by just adding a pam
module and it's going to be so much fun
so stay tuned we're gonna get into that
here in just a bit right after a quick
break idea paint transforms virtually
