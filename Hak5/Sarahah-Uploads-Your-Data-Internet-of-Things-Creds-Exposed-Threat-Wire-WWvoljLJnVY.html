rope maker changes emails post-delivery
default credentials are still impacting
Internet of Things devices and a new
crowdfunding campaign for malware tech
blog is now up and running all that
coming up now on threat wired greetings
I am Shannon Morrison this is threat
wire for August 29th 2017 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom if you haven't
checked out our patreon yet please do so
we have lots that we want to do for the
show but we can't do it without your
support patreon.com slash threat wire is
the place to support threat wire and we
are fully funded by patreon so big
thanks to our patrons and the link is in
the show notes and now it's on to our
top stories onto the news first off
Sarah ha is an anonymous messaging app
that allows you to leave messages for
people without them knowing who the
message came from it has been all the
rave on social media with over 18
million downloads across mobile
operating systems but is also a breeding
ground for harassment unbeknownst to the
user the application uploads contact
phone numbers and email addresses to
Sarah Haas servers simply under the
permission that it just needs access to
your contacts so that it can tell you
who else has downloaded the app now
there is nothing stating that the
contacts would also be uploaded to their
servers this was first discovered by
Bishop Fox security researcher Zachary
Julian when his device alerted him of
data being transmitted julian used
software called burp suite to show the
contact uploading in action in a video
linked below
now the creator tweeted replies to the
original story stating that it was meant
to be used for a fine dear friends
feature and the database does not
currently hold a single contact
obviously without being open source or
having third party audits we have no
actual way of telling what data is
actually in their databases the creator
also mentioned that this would be
removed in the next update of the app
Julian also pointed out that their
privacy policy clarifies that it will
ask for permission before using your
data now strangely the app is suppose
to be anonymous so a find your friends
feature sounds completely out of place
don't you think if you have downloaded
Sara ha and you have a new Android phone
marshmallow or newer you can change the
app permissions under Settings app hit
the little gear button and then hit app
permissions Sara ha users can also not
use the app at all and just send and
receive messages through the website
instead big thank you to Joe for sending
in this story if you are a patron you
can send your favorite stories to me via
the community tab over on patreon.com
slash threat wire to be featured in the
show big thanks to Joe hey that rhymed a
new attack vector could also allow an
attacker to change an email after it has
been delivered to the recipient dubbed
rope maker which stands for remotely
originated post-delivery email
manipulation attacks keeping email risky
the attack takes advantage of the
ability to change CSS code in HTML based
emails which is possible whenever an
email client connects to a remote CSS
library to grab the correct email
template etc etc the attack could do a
sort of man-in-the-middle attack to the
connection with a malicious link or
image that the client could potentially
click through to a malicious site
content can stay the same to the users
eye by editing the CSS an attacker could
display the new link according to
security researcher Francisco Ribeiro
romaker does not work on browser-based
emails like Gmail or iCloud but it does
work on desktop apps current email
security systems do not read into the
code of CSS and they only look for
detectable URLs that could end up be
phishing spam filters would not detect
the changes to the CSS code and as such
these emails could pass with absolutely
no problem to a user ribeirão also
mentioned that he has not seen this
attack in the wild now since ribeirão
has disclosed this to the email clients
neither Microsoft nor Apple have chosen
to address it furthermore rope maker
does not have a CVE number because the
functionality falls outside vendor
security scope now you can disable HTML
emails and only a set plaintext emails
to defend against romaker alternatively
use a web-based client as
are not affected Internet of Things
devices are prone to being a popular
attack vector for cyber criminals due to
the fact that many manufacturers create
products that either one do not support
encryption updates or proper security
protocols or two they have burned in
credentials that a user cannot change or
are very hard to change security
researchers recently found a list on
paceman of over 8,000 IP addresses of
which 2,000 were running open telnet
servers as of this weekend almost 2,000
of them were using leaked credentials
and of the over 8,000 IPs
they were for the most part just using
144 unique username and password payers
which basically means they were the
original manufacturer settings and they
were never changed with Internet of
Things malware becoming more and more
common throughout the likes of botnets
like Mirai which happened last year it's
easy to deduce that these were probably
used to spread malware as well many of
the devices in this list were already
controlled by a botnet as we kind of
figured out as suggested by their
usernames and their passwords many of
the 144 that had user-generated
credentials or where manufacturer user
generated we're simple enough to
brute-force anything ranging from admin
to 1 2 3 4 5 6 to password for a
password those were actually being used
now if you own Internet of Things
devices including your own router be
aware that default credentials should be
updated to unique ones that are user
generated and that most botnets do not
survive on a device after it has
rebooted but they can come back and
haunt you we are still waiting on the
day that Internet of Things
manufacturers start taking security
seriously but in the mean time we can
vote with our wallets and we can only
buy technology that has the security
that we deserve at least that's what I'm
gonna be doing or maybe I just won't buy
any at all in our ongoing story on
Marcus Hutchins who pleaded not guilty
recently to creating or distributing
Cronos malware as of last week his Legal
Defense Fund was shut down due to over
150,000 in donations being fraudulent
according to tor aiklen who was helping
run the original campaign their
credit-card process
caught most donations that were fraud
but they are refunding the rest of the
legitimate donations as well in a quote
Ars Technica Eaglin said that they are
quote not sure what is the legitimate I
did make a kind of tweet storm after
originally hearing about this since I
used to work at a credit card processing
company and closing a campaign due to
fraudulent cards' seemed a little odd to
me a new campaign has been created for
legal defense funds at crowd justice the
new crowdfunding campaign was created by
Tara wheeler a friend of Mauer tech at
crowd justice comm / case / malware tech
and the link is in the show notes in
case that was too long now in a phone
call with wheeler on Monday morning she
explained that quote the campaign has
raised around six thousand dollars since
it opened on Monday morning I vetted
crowd justice for two weeks before we
decided to go with them they are
transparent and responsive they received
some fraudulent transactions and were
able to fix it within nine minutes total
with a CloudFlare while anna captcha the
site uses multi-factor authentication
and a secure account crowd justice is
set up specifically for legal funds so I
can't touch the funds whatsoever all
donations go into the specified
attorneys trust account now when asked
how long the campaign is set to go for
wheeler also commented that quote I
believe what will be important is to not
lose sight that it'll be a long fight
Marcus has so much community support so
we want to make sure that the crowd
justice campaign will be acknowledged as
such people donate for several reasons
for some it comes down to being afraid
of the CFAA there's a beautiful comment
on the crowdfunding page that says today
you tomorrow me and I could not agree
more with wheelers comments his new
campaign has a goal of ten thousand
dollars with a stretch goal of fifteen
thousand all of those funds go to his
legal fees I also asked Hutchins if he
wanted to add anything to my story and
put simply he said quote thank you for
all of the support thank you again to
