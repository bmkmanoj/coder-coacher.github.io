by go to assist one of the things that
I've always aspired to do and something
I'm really interested in is just the
whole concept of like energy
independence being completely off the
grid the idea here is the only thing I'm
going to drink is diesel and water and
so as far as energy is concerned solar
is the way to go and I am still to that
I'll be completely off the grid here
check this out fact now mounted inside
this new awesome box we built you can
see we've got four massive agms here and
a pretty ridiculous charge controller
and this is all going to be tied into
system that's coming roof racks on its
way we're going to put this into the
roof and basically get three of these
massive panels it's a 130 watts each so
I'm going to have tons of battery bank
tons of ability to soak up some rays
from the Sun and then hopefully there's
nothing I really need to do as far as AC
is concerned I didn't there are a couple
of things like a microwave or whatever
but I'm going to try to stay as DC as
possible but when it does come to aca
it's actually ended up being a lot
bigger and more ridiculous and I thought
that that right there is an inverter
kind of a ridiculous inverter actually
but I'll give me I think like 2,000
watts of of AC power if I need it to run
a 600 watt microwave I know math yes one
of those so this right here is a great
example of basically what's going on the
roof of the van just much smaller and
more simple solution this is something
we set up about six months ago that sits
out here in the sun and runs Wi-Fi
pineapple and like i said it's pretty
much comprised of got a solar panel here
this is a 36 l monocrystalline 5 watt
guy and that is plugged into a very
small charge controller very inexpensive
and really all that's doing is keeping
this led acid cell happy this is a just
lead acid battery for like a you know
kind of like a garage door opener or
security system and that all runs into
Pelican case where we have our Wi-Fi
pineapple and
you know during the day it soaks up
enough raise to keep the battery charged
enough so that it can make through the
molten the night and then the next
morning sun comes up again lather rinse
repeat and yeah this guy will go
indefinitely as long as we have enough
Sun which is pretty cool it's pretty
small and self-contained the only big
difference here is that we're not adding
an inverter for AC power but otherwise
it's the same exact concept that's going
in the van just much bigger so i plug my
meter in here I can actually see what
I'm getting off of this panel right now
we can see a fair amount of voltage and
actually if I come here and like tilt
the panel away from the Sun you can see
it drops dramatically look and then put
it back in the Sun and there we go
pretty cool huh well yeah that's that's
the idea right there just the ability to
stay unplugged for as long as possible
so there are basically three major
components of a solar system have of
course the solar panels we've got a
charge controller you've got batteries
optionally you could have an inverter if
what you want is AC power of it as far
as the panels are concerns there's three
big types there is amorphous
polycrystalline and mono crystalline
cells a monocrystalline tells actually
what we're using in this project and you
can tell those because they're a single
cell they're currently the most
efficient you can get and you can tell
you see a little square cell they work
really well in low light otherwise
there's polycrystalline which is you
know still only slightly less efficient
but also less expensive those are pretty
good as well a more fish I've never had
any experience with these but basically
they're cheap they're light they've got
a much lower absorption of the Sun but
they're great for areas where you have
just a ton of sunlight like out at sea
and basically the way it works is well
these cells they have a positive and a
negative side and between there there's
these electrons which are kind of
loosely held together and when the
sunlight hits those it causes them to
get really excited and then they move
around following of course the path of
least resistance which is of course the
silver grid
that we see on these panels and this is
what basically gives us our DC
electricity and the voltage and amperage
are really dependent on how many panels
are how many cells we have and and you
know how many are connected in series so
each cell produces about a half a volt
and so with a 36 cells that comes out to
about 18 volts which is really what you
need to charge a 12 volt battery
actually a lot less than that see the
thing is there's there's loss involved
panels are rated at the wattage and that
just being the voltage times the
amperage which is typically 12 volts is
what we're working with and when we do
the math something like this 12-volt
system or comes out to about 5 watts
which is about half an amp which is
perfect for this little pineapple of
course it's going to be much bigger for
the van and there are many other factors
that go into the actual output of the
panel as far as like the angle towards
the Sun you've got to worry about the
temperature there's difference in
elevation and the air masses you if you
know if you're in a higher elevation
there's less density and you're going to
get better son you know clouds and shade
and how you're different panels deal
with that shade and even your wiring if
you're using the wrong gauges of wiring
a really long runs of wire in the real
world what you can basically expect is
to get about eighty percent of the rated
output of those panels the other part of
this whole equation is a charge
controller which is basically there to
prevent the solar panels from
overheating to prevent the batteries
from overheating I mean the long and
short of it is there's several different
types of control others but they all
have one primary purpose and that is to
extend the life of your battery to keep
them healthy there's a bunch of
different protocols if you will as far
as doing that but I guess it really
comes down to your costs and the size of
the system like for instance the one in
this little pineapple system is really
small and cheap but you know it gets the
job done as far as batteries there are
so many different kinds of batteries the
two that were the most interested in our
deep cycle batteries like flooded lead
acid and AGM or absorbed glass mat the
biggest difference between flooded in
class mat being that flooded is
not sealed so they actually gasps and
you have to make sure that they have a
way to do that and a GM's which I really
like for inside of the van they're
completely sealed it also makes it
easier when you're purchasing and they
can ship without any kind of special
needs or whatnot but those are all types
of deep cycle which basically means that
these batteries can go you know down
like eighty percent of their charge
value and then come right back up with
no problem and they can do that time and
time and time again as opposed to what
you probably have in your car which is a
starting or a cranking battery and
that's pretty much a battery that's made
to give like a ton of power in a short
period of time but they're really not
made to like go on you know down eighty
percent and then back up they can really
only do that maybe you know 10 30
something odd times before they need to
be replaced which is why you don't like
your car battery died and and that's
solar in a nutshell there's so much more
to it but you know that's the basics
that are making everything Howard here
with everyone working in the cloud using
different devices it can be a real
challenge providing employees with I to
support and that's why I'm a huge fan of

well that just about wraps up this
episode of hack fahd but before we get
going I wanted to get into some of the
feedback as you guys know we love to
hear your feedback either at feedback at
hak5 org or even on our Google+
community in the YouTube comments on the
blog and I'd like to just go ahead and
get into this round of comments from
last week's episode we're installing a
secure portable persistent Linux
installation on a USB drive using lux
encryption and tim ashley wrote would
lux encryption jordan an SSD drives life
well kind of conventional wisdom states
that with trim disabled which is the
default it wouldn't really make a
substantial impact the way that I see it
by the time you're close to the
theoretical limit on the read/write
cycle of a standard SSD you're probably
at the point where you're going to
upgrade anyway but that said I've gotta
hand it to carrot man 135 who points out
that f 2 FS would probably be a better
choice than ext4 as a file system so f2f
S stands for flash friendly file system
it's pretty cool it takes into account
NAND flash memory characteristics then
you know things that you find on SSDs on
SD cards and USB drives and that would
be a really cool alternative to kind of
your standard EXT file systems that use
on Linux now mtz MTU li vu I'm not going
to try to pronounce that on YouTube made
a really insightful comment he points
out that Lux has its upsides up to eight
different keys and can oppa keys can
open a volume its downside it's no
secret that the volume is encrypted with
Lux since the header is not encrypted
look at truecrypt header is hidden but
can only use keys now both luxe and
truecrypt use a header and hence have
one point of failure a corrupted header
and encryption data goes kaput right now
plain volume has no header hence its
resilient to volume corruption but its
lack of a header causes other problems
so which is best to use well it depends
on the case he says if you are on linux
and want one tool to manage all three
encrypted volume formats then check this
out zoo
Luke ripped over at code google com this
is a pretty cool open source project
that it's going to allow you to go ahead
and you know create plane and luxe
encrypted volumes and maintain all of
those and it seems like a pretty cool
thing he goes on to say that he
personally prefers plane volumes over
the remaining two the problem with plane
volumes is that you know since it
doesn't use a header then you have to
actually specify all of the properties
when you mount the volume but still I
thought that was pretty cool so I'd
throw that out there for you guys
another comment came in from your and
you are base all your base anyway you
are a NUS base points out than most
Network logically secure distro he says
is cubes OS I was just checking this out
pretty fantastic he goes on to say which
lets you customize every single element
of security you can isolate applications
from one another you can visit their
website and and do other things in many
disposable VMs for maximum security
poking around this seems like a really
cool tool I like their approach to you
know it's based on Zen so it's kind of
virtualization that we've talked about
in the past and doing basically using a
hypervisor layer between all of your
applications so you can have little
buckets kind of like chrome is its own
vm pretty an FD we'll have to check this
out in more detail on the show but i
thought that that was really neat throw
it out there for you Jim s comments he
got a new asus laptop that doesn't
support booting from USB i want to give
mad props to g gers Jagger's juniors for
for a slick were crowned using easybcd
you got to check this out it's over at
neo smartnet and this guy right here
allows you to take control of your
bootloader it's a modification for the
windows boot later which actually allows
you to do things like boot from USB disk
from network drives from virtual disks
even ISO images which I thought it was
just damn cool so anyway if you have
comments please go ahead and leave them
youtube on our Google+ community I
encourage you to go and seek that out
all of the ways to find out of the
social media stuff is over hak5 dot org
slash follow and this episode in
particular I'm encouraging everybody to
check out hack across America com can
sign up to get involved this is all
about the community this is about coming
together and if you want to suggest a
hackerspace I should check out like a
geeky mission some crazy thing I should
some point of interests I should check
out all of the ways that you can get
involved or over a hack across America
com that's also where you're gonna find
the dashboard of you know all the
zigzagging across the states and whatnot
and the chat rooms and the cameras and
all of that stuff and of course I also
want you to go over there and check out
we're going to be doing a google plus
hangouts on air kind of QA stuff so
that'll be this friday so when this airs
the following friday we're all gonna get
together and i would love to hear your
ideas of crazy stuff we can put in the
van like telemetry we're already i'm
working with jason right now on putting
together our own cell network a mobile
traveling cell network based on gsm so
actually he wants to know if you've got
some like old old feature gsm phones
like some old Nokia's and stuff people
sometimes send gift to a fan or whatever
at what is it well hak5 daughter work
such follow you can find all the details
on sending us stuff but if you have some
of those old ones we're putting together
a base station for gsm and the van is
you have other crazy ideas of what would
be really cool in this you know that
hack across America con that's where
you'll find the forums and chat and all
of those other things so I'm really
really excited to be launching this
project and i hope everybody gets
involved cuz that's that's the thing
that makes it all happen all right oh
but there is one other 20 you Shannon
will be back next week until then what
do I normally say oh yeah we say check
out hack shop calm if you want to
support us directly hey Sarah what's
going on in the hack shop this week can
use we got the travel bundles back and
I'm gonna put a coin in every order
awesome and of course hak5 org for all
the show notes and everything else but
yes very excited can't wait to hear the
feedback on this can't wait to get on
the road and with all of that said i'm
darren kitchen and for shanna morris
reminding you to trust your techno lyst
so late I did not know that that was
about to I did not know that I was about
to say any of those things that it was
just that I just said there's a song off
this album that just means everything to
me which is hold on off lost reality and
it's all about holding onto this until
it's no longer fun and that's what I'm
doing in a nutshell across America
across America the second back mirka
