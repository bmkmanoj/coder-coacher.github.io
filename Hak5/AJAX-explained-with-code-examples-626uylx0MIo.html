so doing alright thanks a lot good now I
understand that you came here with a
Ajax tutorial that you've prepared yes i
have prepared it for what developers
were programmers you want to get started
with ajax and this is the first steps
into learning just the okay beginning
liar well i mean i don't know much about
Ajax it's a huge buzz word on the
internet right now you see it right and
left you see pages using it you know it
when you see it at least I do right but
I don't know what's going on behind what
I see right and a lot of people in the
same boat you are because they have a
lot of misinterpretations of what Ajax
is and they believe it's a programming
language they believe it's a technology
but it's not all it is is just
innovation on top of what already
existed and now that people have
realized that they can do certain things
with JavaScript it's growing and growing
and growing and just the Ajax world is
just getting bigger okay now what is
ajax ajax stands for asynchronous
JavaScript and XML a synchronous
asynchronous asynchronous is basically a
seamless to a very rough down version
it's a very seamless it's a seamless
line to the server so that you want any
interruptions on your web page and is
that what allows us to have that almost
real-time feel on the page it seems like
there's a program running right there
there really is it's basically an engine
running inside of your page that is
going back and forth between the web
server okay and with the XML XML is a
big big punch in this that's why they
added it into Ajax is what it allows you
to do is pull data from XML and just pop
it in on the screen and since XML is so
light not a lot of overhead compared to
connecting to a database and retrieving
the data it's a lot faster and that the
biggest thing that in lets us you know
instead of having to go back to the
server and refresh a page every time we
want to send you information the old way
that we still we'd have to go we'd have
to post it to the web server HP or dot
net or whatever would have you go
through the steps of getting the data or
manipulating whatever and it would have
to refresh page the entire page whereas
with or reload the entire page rewrite
and
with Ajax we're just refreshing the page
was at one section yes yeah it's like a
really refreshing it's like it's just
getting the data that's all it's doing
and it gives you that truce like PC on
desktop application feel okay now
pulling it to the web development all
right so understand that you brought a
demo with you yes I have it's a very
skin down version of just using some
Ajax and you just a little bit of XML
and I guess we're going to get started
alright sounds good alright we're going
to start off by declaring an HTTP
request variable we're going to set the
false okay and then we're going to have
a function call called requests where it
requests the object and gets its
initiation next we actually have to make
sure that it's set to false because if
it's not then we're going to get in true
when the object really hasn't been
created yet okay so it's very important
now this is the part where we check our
browser IE in Mozilla and opera i use
the main outcast yeah they handle things
differently though things a little
differently because it uses activex
right so the object is now created we
have a few trying catches and the
activex to make sure the different
versions of ie mm-hmm and now we're
going to see if it has been initiated if
it has not been initiated we're going to
send an order and say you know there was
this problem so now we're going to go
into the onreadystatechange ready state
being our beginning point for actual
Ajax the up connections connection it's
done it's what do we do now right you're
going to call this function it's going
to be called ready state or whatever you
want to call your function is going to
go through the process of what it has to
do first okay next we're going to user
dot open our data open is going to have
our types like get you can set up the
post if you want then we give them to
our send i set it as null that's it in
terms of what do we do now next we have
our ready state function call this is
where it does on ready state this is
what's going to happen okay this it has
four different exercise five different
stages 0 through 4 mm-hmm 033 really are
insignificant you're most concerned with
number four but for this example I went
ahead and create similar ters to let us
know the status just so you understand
what's actually happening okay now we
are
at four meaning that everything is ready
to go writes all set then we have to
check the HTTP status on the apache side
status is the status code for that's 200
there are many others in case you want
to do something different and dependent
upon what you're going to use is right
but for the most part most of the time
you're going to use to 200 and this
since today we're going to go into XML
which is you know the big name there
we're going to go ahead and create a
variable for an XML document which is
our sample XML we'll get into that and
we're going to create an object for that
next we're going to go into our root
node and our root node is going to find
the root node inside of our XML okay all
right so we've got that set we got
searching for root going to get the
first item and then we're going to print
it right there simple very clean very
easy and if there's a problem there it's
going to send back an error so this is a
lot of error checking okay so we have
that created where you go into some of
the HTML and we're going to unclick do
that request that JavaScript request
call you pass it the URL or the file
name of the xml file and then it's going
to do its work so we're going to go
ahead and pull up our sample xml very
simple very very simple it's only four
lines of code yeah we just declared as
XML we created one node called root and
it'll get the insides of that node so we
have our page up here it's got our link
we're going to go ahead and take a click
at it here's our large order this is the
actual initialization of ready state
okay now we've got it loaded got
interactive and it's ready to go now
hold that no doubt boy dad said no yeah
it's pull it check the note pull the
data out of it and that's the
information that was left in there now
and it's it's a very light version of
course like you can just deal with a
little more research and now you have an
idea of what is the limit with this this
is right to get you started because you
can do some incredible things with Ajax
oh yeah I've seen some beautiful seconds
we're disgusting internet came two years
we're going to see it grow even more so
that's the basic rundown of what Ajax is
good tutorial just to start off with but
really enjoyed it is very informative
thank you
no problem just need you to check out
the show notes yeah you'll have your
script in everything everything all the
codes going to be on there and then we
go from there all right well thanks a
lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
