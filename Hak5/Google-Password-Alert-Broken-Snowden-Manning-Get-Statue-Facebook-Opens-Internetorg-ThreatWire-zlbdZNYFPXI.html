the world get an actually open Internet
what was that statue they just put up
right there and hey people clickjacking
it's a thing I'm Patrick Norton and this
is threat wire for monday may the 4th
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
I'd like to start with a huge thanks to
everyone who has supported the relaunch
of this show we could be more proud of
this awesome community if you're new to
threat wire on the hak5 channel i hope
you enjoy it let's get started first up
Facebook declares internet org is a
platform now Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook
not where I generally look for openness
and clarity but props to Zuckerberg for
moving internet.org in the direction of
net neutrality internet.org if you're
not up to speed is a partnership between
facebook samsung ericsson mediatek nokia
opera and qualcomm essentially to bring
the internet to the 55 billion people in
the world that don't have it or to quote
the group directly internet.org is a
facebook let initiative bringing
together technology leaders nonprofits
and local communities to connect the two
thirds of the world that doesn't have
internet access that is a great quote I
love it because you know what I want
everyone have access to the internet but
up until this morning internet or
sounded a lot like a way to bring
Facebook and a small group of chosen
partners to that two-thirds of the world
for free because look internet.org notes
it pretty clearly eighty percent of the
world's population already lives within
range of a mobile signal instead the
biggest challenges to getting to the
Internet to everyone are the
affordability of the internet and of
course people who are like should I have
food should i have shelter should i have
internet actually knowing that there's
something useful for them to find on the
internet so effectively making a chosen
few services free to those five billion
people might sound a lot like putting an
Internet Explorer icon on the desktop of
say every PC sold everywhere with
Windows it might be construed as giving
certain services a competitive advantage
so as of this morning Zuckerberg /
facebook says internet or will be open
to all anyone who wants to participate
provided they comply by the three
principles or guidelines for
participation on internet org and
they're pretty fair one explore the
entire internet you should develop free
services that encourage the exploration
of the broader internet whenever
possible number two efficiency the goal
is to quote sustainably deliver free
basic internet so keep your bandwidth
demands low quote websites that require
high bandwidth will not be included
services should not use VoIP video file
transfer high-resolution photos or high
volumes of photos finally three
technical specifications websites must
be built to be optimized for browsing on
both feature and smartphones and in
limited bandwidth scenarios in other
words make stuff that will actually run
in the situation it's going to be sent
to it sounds good to me but we're going
to have to see how it shakes down over
time if you're interested in developing
for internet or go to internet org slash
platform if you want to be a part of it
when I say develop for it I mean
actually putting your services out on
the internet org platform from the boy
that ain't going to happen in DC anytime
soon Department euro news reports of a
new bronze sculpture anything to say was
revealed in Berlin's Alexander Platz
this weekend featuring Edward Snowden
Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning
standing atop chairs creator dividir me
know he's Italian said they have lost
their freedom for the truth so they
remind us of how important it is to know
the truth the trio is joined by a fourth
empty chair presumably so you can stand
up and hurl your beleaguered yelp across
the rooftops in favor of Internet
freedom threat post says Google is pat's
to click jacking vulnerability the
researcher that found it says it would
enable an attacker to retrieve or delete
email conversations manipulate YouTube
and Google+ accounts and more in the too
long didn't read version clickjacking is
when something on a web page isn't what
it appears to be so when you click say
an ad for a hair loss product it's free
right if I click on it it's free it
actually clicks several layers of code
that hey deletes everything in your
gmail account how bad would that suck
almost as bad as this while we're
speaking of clickjacking hacker news
reports that password alert extension
that's a new chrome extension google
released last week which is designed to
raise the alarm when you're entering
your password on the phishing site has
been circumvented by security expert
Paul Moore who quote easily circumvented
the technology using just seven lines of
simple JavaScript code I'm pretty sure
there are voices inside of Google right
now going derp and finally from the UM
you know you shouldn't leave your
password
post-it note on your monitor Department
Graham Cluley comms is a BBC documentary
accidentally displayed the login and
password for a control terminal inside
the Wessex integrated control center
believe that's above Waterloo station
and it's kind of a big deal to me
because I don't like the eye that
anybody can walk up and enter in the
login ID and password let us hope that
system requires physical access ie being
in the room because password three when
you get right down to it ain't much of a
password for somebody it's got to stack
a rainbow tables hey got something to
say comments on a YouTube videos right
down below and you just might get
featured in a future threat wire episode
and before I go really I want to give a
huge thanks to everyone who supported
the show so far on patreon calm / threat
wire if you find value from this it can
spare a few cents in episode please

to reach our three times a week
milestone go with a rotation of Darren
kitchen Shannon Morrison myself so
throughout the month of May we're going
to give you a free taste of the full
monty except the full monty it's not us
