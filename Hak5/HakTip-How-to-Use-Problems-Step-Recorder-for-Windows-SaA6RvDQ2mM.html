Hostgator
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I'm helping my
mom fix her computer yayyy again and yes
she is running Windows awesome but did
you know that there's this thing called
the problem steps recorder built into
Windows 7 that's pretty cool well I
checked it out and this is going to save
me like so much time explaining the
difference between left clicking and
right clicking on the mouse to my mom so
psr-4 short will record images each for
each click of my mouse and every time I
use the keyboard but nice enough it
won't record my actual keystrokes
awesome it'll save everything into a zip
file that I can share later before you
start with it you want to disable your
second and third monitors just to ease
any kind of confusion and turn your
resolution down so it'll be a lot easier
for the non techie person understand all
the captured images and make the
resolution nice for them to see because
it pulls up into a browser and then you
want to run PSR exe and open the program
so run yes are entered and it's nice and
built-in there's just a few buttons on
it there's the record button of course
start record there's stop record which
does just what it says and then there's
this thing called a add Comet and the
run time so the program can make itself
very very easy to use now right after
the break I'm going to attempt to do a
little how-to for my mother but first

to get your discount we're back so I've
got PS are open and all I need to do is
hit record and it tells me recording now
now each time I click somewhere a
problem steps recorder will display a
little red icon showing me that it's
captured captured some kind of image so
I hit that and there's a red icon that
shows up right next to my clicker so I
can open up my browser and I can pull up
on the mouse I'll go to hak5 so I'm
going to show my mom how to maybe play a
video on the hak5 website so I'm gonna
add a comment in the comment basically
blurs everything and then I can add it
right here and I'm going to say this is
how you play a
and then I just click over here on the
video and it starts playing for my
mother
awesome so once I'm done I'm gonna add
one more comment and say no the video oh
I'm gonna do a search - I'm gonna search
for pineapple I press enter on my
keyboard that is and when I scroll down
you can see all the different videos
about the pineapple so that's the whole
video I wanted to make so I'll hit stop
record and it automatically asked me for
to save the zip file so I'll call it
hack 5 vids and desktop save cool so
that's all there is to actually making
the how-to video now I can send this
handy little zip file over to my mom via
Dropbox or email or what have you and
then if I unzip it I'll show you what it
looks like when you do that folder and
it pulls up this MHD video or MH TT file
that is so it opens up Internet Explorer
and I can go through all the list of my
steps and it shows me a nice little
image for each one hence why you want to
change the resolution if you need to and
as I go down the list here's my comment
it'll say user comment this is how you
play a pack size video and then at the
end where I type something in it's going
to say
user input in hack five technology blah
the name of the web cuts page and then
dot dot dot enter on the keyboard is
what I pressed so it doesn't actually
show you the keyboard strokes which is
nice if you need to login to a website
and show somebody something anyway so
what programs do you guys use to help
your friends and family I personally
like with us wine it's built-in it's
really really easy and it's gonna save
me a lot of time make sure you guys tell
me about your favorites in the comments
below or you can email me at tips at
hack 5 org and be sure to check out our
sister show hack 5 for more great stuff
just like this I'll be there reminding
you to trust your technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
