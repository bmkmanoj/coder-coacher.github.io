by netflix
it's time once again to check out the in
Barrow check in the ear Merrill's the
first one is from John he says I need to
commend Darren huh it's been at least 10
episodes since he's hurt himself
remember what it would be like every
episode when you would hurt yourself
remember when he sliced his hand open I
remember that he even had to go to the
ER and everything good times I think he
deserves an award and you know what I
have an award for you yeah oh come on Oh
actually you guys missed it you just
earlier in the no I'm not wearing my
shoes right now and I just stubbed my
toe on he did of course Paul tonight
Courtney alright are we ready to record
boom ah and then some superlative
there's words baby baby Nicole
expletives wow I am gone today yes let's
get to the next email thank you for the
award the next one is from igor he says
I'm looking for USB and a USB Ethernet
adapter I think you are using trendnet
TT to tak e TG my question is do you
have any issues and Linux with that
adapter if you are not using that one
could you please recommend one okay so
this right here the USB to gigabit
ethernet adapter from Fred net this is
the tu tu e TG interesting that it
claims to be a gigabit even though it's
USB a mink month what's up with that but
seriously that's actually not the one I
use I use this one here it is the tu tak
8100 see and trendnet actually has a
page a compatibility list listing all
the operating systems at their different
products support I've looked up the one
that you were speaking of and it does
not claim to have linux support but then
again neither does this one so although
i will say from personal experience the
ET 100c works flawlessly in every OS
that i've thrown at it but then again
most most linux OS as I thrown over
really debian-based so I don't know
maybe maybe if you run in gentoo
might have to compile stuff but if you
run jinto you're probably used to
compiling stuff oh just throwing that
out there um oh that's the other thing
this guy though no worky windows seven
no worky will work you in this 32 or 64
no nothing nothing XP you're golden but
seven eggs i really like trendnet yeah
well I mean come on I mean that when
this product came out they didn't they
didn't enter it again that's the thing
but something who drives me crazy though
is the like the whole oh we're not gonna
write drivers for old products you know
Microsoft comes out with a new OS that's
just great time for us to rub some new
throw this old chip and a new packaging
right some drivers for it anyway make
this by anyone yay what open is good yes
I like open I agreement and yeah anyway
I commend uh like probably already did
it in the interview but you become
interesting conversation off-camera
about their choice to go open source I
thought that that was great uh how did
you know Steve Gibson mentioned on air
that they were open source and then they
went oh well sure that's not a bad idea
in a boom you know and it's never a bad
thing it always helps so I I prefer to
go with hardware that has more open
drivers is why you know I mean I don't
want to get into a debate about a TI vs
nvidia but hardware with open-source
drivers is always better but you got it
you got to be really picky i don't know
i'm actually knew enough to linux that i
actually don't know of a fantastic
resource for finding what hardware is
great i mean i know of a couple of
places to find as far as wireless
networks are concerned I mean we had a
lot of fun with your broadcom yeah that
was fun so if you guys actually have
some resources hit us up with those
because we'd love to come through him as
well as there was actually a question
that I had for you guys we're looking to
replace this bad boy that runs our IRC
wall has never been happy with them I'm
thinking some of those displaylink USB
to vga s but I want to hear your guy's
opinion on this is any how they're using
those i'm looking for something
inexpensive something that'll easily
allow us to run eight screens i know the
video performance it's gonna be crap but
we're talking about IRC yeah it is yeah
yeah we don't really need
anything super crazy all right we have
one last email do want to get too sure
this one's from Chris he says I was
trying to use the PE to USB and it won't
find my USBs is there a different
program that I can use yeah p2s be great
thing that allows you to get bartpe
which we play with in the past oh yeah
it's kind of like a Windows Live
distribution going on on a USB rather
than a CD which is like optical media
what's that come on people who knows
turns out unetbootin we love you dat
button it will do it in fact it was
article just published just a couple
months ago about getting bartpe in there
it's going to be linked on our show
notes and I find that the quickest and
easiest way I mean a lot of times you
don't get into you get the drop-down hit
download and you don't have to go and
get an iso before easy for ya so it's
kind of like a one-stop shop for all
sorts of USD booting goodness
deliciousness now stay tuned because
we'll be right back with this week's
