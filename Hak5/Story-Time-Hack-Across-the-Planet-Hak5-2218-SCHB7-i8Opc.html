thank you
all right one more stop to Alderaan
almost there
homestretch soccer girls clinic now in
London
and just like that I'm in London oh man
I remember the first time I came here
done the pivotal moment in hak5 history
it was 2010 2011 and I had been watching
a lot of Top Gear and I got it in my
head that epic motorcycle ride was just
what I needed so I decided to spend my
little bit of my birthday in February in
England in fact this is the only time
I've ever been to England not in
February which makes no sense because
there's actually gorgeous as it turns
out the sky can be blue in London you
just don't come in February anyway point
is yeah it was it was strange because
Shannon had to go back to Missouri to
take care of her dad and I wasn't sure
what the future of the show was going to
be I did know that I at least wanted to
go and have a bunch of meetups
with all of these awesome folks that I
had met on IRC that it would be cool to
do this kind of like tour of meetups
starting in London and doing a motorbike
trip up to Sheffield to see Robin wood
and then you know over to Manchester
through the Peak District and then
across to Holly had to catch a ferry to
Dublin to hang out with archiver and
then back down kind of bypassing
Birmingham but back to London to do it
again I ended up missing the first
flight because of delays and such so I
got in the next night really late and
spite have picked me up
awesome awesome guy funnily enough South
African dude living here in London props
too man thank you for picking up from
the airport getting me a convertor for
my power supply of thing and even taking
me through my first round about this was
like my first trip in Europe as it were
and I just remember like circling this
roundabout over and over and over as if
Benny Hill were playing and I was on my
way to my first host house you could
call it I had such a fuse meetup fell
throughout the Facebook and the idea was
that I would have a meet up and just go
drinking with all the hak5
fans and that I would stand on
somebody's couch because I'm poor and
you know just like a 20-something year
old you youtuber anyway the idea was
pretty sound except I didn't do a lot of
vetting it was just like you know first
come
for serve like hey you say you'll put me
up awesome I'm happy to have an
accommodation this town super
ridiculously expensive
my first accommodations in London I
didn't really know too many details
other than this guy said hey you can
stay with me here's where it is on a map
and I'm like wow that's really close to
Parliament that's like right on the
River Thames awesome what I didn't
understand at the time was that the
accommodations weren't on the up-and-up
in that it was kind of an abandoned
warehouse
and when I say warehouse I mean like the
thing is a castle but then again
everything here the castle formerly so
you know whatever but it's got like
turrets on the roof and you know all
that crazy stuff and so I pull up to it
I'm like where on earth am i right it's
nighttime and and I get introduced to to
my host and and then I meet the is like
not roommate because as it turns out
he's actually not from London he's just
new a guy that was squatting in this
warehouse this French dude smoked the
whole bunch guy was awesome was a lot of
fun he had a friend who was like from
Denmark and he was a Nazi apologist or
something
it was strange and I basically spent my
first night drinking cider out of a can
and falling asleep in a basement in a
boiler room without any heat in a joint
that had stolen power across from
Parliament and I don't regret that
whatsoever it was a wonderful experience
the next morning I had a full English
breakfast as it were
and thank you to you guys for for like
really setting the tone I mean I did
catch a cold and it kind of stuck to
have to motorcycle with that but then
again it was February so what was I
thinking anyway that's the first part of
this story no regrets
now I could go on and on about all the
different meetups and what fun it was to
motorcycle through the snow in the North
Wales but at the time story continues
here because at the time hack 5 was just
like this little beer money side project
and things were you know there was
change in the air and I was open to that
change and I feel like by being open to
that and embracing that change and not
fighting it
I was really fostering what I you know
the life I have today and I'm really
grateful for this kind of mindset that
allowed this all to happen because I was
open for it and willing and accepting
and not scared well ok I was scared I
was working in IT but I'd pretty much
automated my job the Williamsburg office
was closed down I was only going up to
DC maybe once a month at that point so
you know as I was working from home and
mainly working on hack 5 I saw this
opportunity to take this this motorcycle
trip through England and I didn't really
get it approved you could say because I
had automated so much that why walk why
rock the boat it's kind of irresponsible
of me but you know when I got to England
it just popped in a British SIM card and
I went on my merry way this was before
Google voice of course on the flight
home right I'm sitting next to the guy
that you know you're making small talk
and it was just as we were landing and
it was like oh what do you do what do
you do whatever I'm a Systems
Administrator and I also host this
podcast and it's like whoa hang on which
is it are you a podcaster or are you an
IT guy and I'm like Mauro
so we land and we're taxing back and I
pop in my usm card and suddenly I get a
barrage of like all the voicemails
we're like coming in and I'm like okay
so I'm checking my phone my blackberry
is at work and the first voicemail is
like hey Darren not sure we got the
email but we're going to be having an
all-hands meeting here soon and want to
get you confirmed because we all need to
be on this call
and then another one hey Darren still
haven't seen your confirmation listen
you don't have to come up to DC it's
just a cold just need to make sure that
you're on the line the next voicemail
was hey Darren we're having that call in
about now or I haven't heard from you
are you okay where are you otherwise
just make sure you're on the skull and
then the last voice now being a Darren
listen I hate to have to tell you this
on a voicemail but we just had that All
Hands meeting and yeah we're filing for
bankruptcy and and things are going to
be changing around here well yeah so at
that point I put my phone down in it and
I look to the guy next to me I'm like so
as it turns out I'm the podcaster I mean
in my mind I guess I had already made
that decision but this was kind of the
kick in the pants I really needed to
just take that plunge and I do feel like
I was putting the cart before the horse
but by doing that I just said to the
universe like hey we're gonna make this
happen and here we are and it's because
of everybody watching today and
everybody that had been watching since
2010 2011 2005 that this is all
continued and I'm so grateful so yeah
that's that's kind of my story for the
day it's you know always stay open to
that opportunity monsoon season that's
what it's been for the last four or five
months in Indonesia we've been spending
most of my time and so of course I got
you know a nice little raincoat and
umbrella in all of that have I used it
one now now one not of course until I
came to London London oh look there's
something iconic Lee London
