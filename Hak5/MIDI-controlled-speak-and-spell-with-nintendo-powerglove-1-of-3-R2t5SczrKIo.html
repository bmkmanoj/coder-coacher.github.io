friend Andrew who is an electrical
engineer and he's here to show us how to
make a Speak &amp;amp; Spell a power glove and
MIDI all play nice together so how's it
going Andrew how you doing buddy how's
it going laughs I'm awesome nice to meet
you glad to hear it now so what's going
on here how are we going to get all
these completely different things to
work together with hacking of course but
naturally basically what we have is uh
is two parts we have a midi converter
for the power of love that makes it into
basically a musical instrument and then
we have a mini converter for the speed
of the hell that makes it into a musical
instrument too and they're going to talk
and I'm going to make some noise anyway
hopefully will be awesome and hopefully
it was sent like music so you know we're
talking about music and we're talking
about MIDI so MIDI was originally made
for music right yeah it's a network
standard for synthesizers to communicate
with one another it was invented in the
early eighties and it's pretty simple
which is great because it means it's
pretty hackable and how are we going to
adapt MIDI to this archaic technology
that is to speak and spell well in the
case of the Speak &amp;amp; Spell what we've
done is we've bought a kit from highly
liquid com that actually allows us to
take many messages and look up
information in the wrong of the Speak &amp;amp;
Spell and get it to play word fragments
which actually sounds really cool yeah
we were playing that with that before
and it's like that a lot at any rate the
the kid is a great beginner project so
we'll go through that and hopefully on
hopefully be cool enough for some people
at home to give it a try as well sweet
yeah that's good you want to go ahead
and crack it open and talk about the
inside
okay so we've got the speaking spells
finally cracked open and this is one
that we head out this is an unmodded one
and this is the modified it modified one
correct yeah okay so if you just want to
give us a quick overview of what's going
on in here and what you did differently
you know what where's the kit what part
of this is the kitten this is the kit
right here um basically sticks in this
big empty space that has been
community-led for midi modifications um
it's pretty easy to install you got a
side of the board together yourself
that's pretty straightforward and then
there's a wiring diagram on the website
of the maker of the kid that we use to
connect it to the board as well we had
to actually cut a hole in the case for
the MIDI connector it's pretty easy to
do you can use a dremel it's kind of
like standard case modding right yet how
about a hole yeah basically any way you
can with whatever and then there's the
wiring back there just two wires to go
to it and screws in the plastic easy
enough and you said the wiring diagram
is really straightforward so it tells
you exactly where you need to make your
connections and everything else right
yeah it's it's really easy to follow and
pretty much impossible to screw up
anything is possible but at least with
these boards here they have you know
like nice solder points and everything
it looks like so if somebody wanted to
do this remember now granted it is
precision solder work so I'd imagine if
somebody's not you know might not wanna
make it your first project ever right uh
is I don't need to deter anyone either
it's pretty straightforward and just a
little bit of practice with a soldering
iron beforehand I think they'd be able
to get this no problem and I mean so I
mean there's there any kind of like
what's what's so cool and unusual about
these speaking spells that just make
them available for this kind of MIDI
modification well we're really advanced
for their time the speed spell came out
in 1978 which is mind blog if you
but the fact that it basically has a
computer inside mm-hmm what we're
actually doing with the kit is
interfacing to the 4-bit data bus of the
microcontroller that's inside the Speak
&amp;amp; Spell and we're basically putting some
information on there that it's not
expecting to see we're forcing our own
kind of fun so we're sending our MIDI to
its hardware that's putting and we're
making some stuff happen we're just
putting it right in and making stuff
nice that's awesome kind of brute force
but it works so maybe your thumb maybe
I'll just show you a couple features of
the board there's actually a couple
different there's a couple different
modes or ways that you can install this
kit mm-hm there's actually three the
first one emulates the keypad so
basically when you send MIDI messages it
pushes an equivalent key on the keypad
which will let you have the full speak
and spell functionality under midi
control the second two modes are a
little more interesting to us because
they lay make cool noise it was what
it's all about for me anyway this rom
otay and rom mobi and basically in the
wrong modes the MIDI messages will look
up in a table a word fragment and play
it through the speaking spells output in
the second rom mode a sequence of notes
will look up entire word of the table
and speak and spell and play it at the
output so you can either have control
over you can have access to any word
that's in the speaking spells lexicon or
you can you can make any word fragment
noise
it has millions seemingly it has endless
banks of these fragments of world its
lead to play out so you can make really
cool no it's really cool beats really
cool kind of mm-hmm graduation of sound
yeah I'm doing when you're doing like
very unique music that you take part and
you help with it that's like that's the
epitome that's what you're looking for
something that nobody else has unless
they have a speaking spell with a MIDI
chip well that's not that's kind of the
point of the kid rightful people are
interested in getting that sound can get
the kit and they can have something
different or unusual that's awesome I'm
thank you for showing us this now next
up I think we should go to the power
glove you know because that was like if
that's like a homebrew like there's no
get involved in that when you did that
so that's a step up from here let's take
a look at it all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
