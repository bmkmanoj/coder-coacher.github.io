hello welcome at 5 my name is Darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse and this
is your weekly dose of Technol us oh
yeah actually too much further you send
something in pre show that I'm totally
gonna hold you to now you're like oh if
I get enough tweets or whatever - I'll
totally come on the show with Princess
Leia buns so I'm just putting that out
there right now no uh-huh
SN you see somebody said it was Princess
Lee a 2.0 freezing yeah and you're doing
it and I told him I used to do the
buttons with my hair because it's super
curly and braids and I can do it but I'm
not gonna do it again
following up with a blooper from last
week this is not the hair style show
we're actually talking about technology
because you guys heard and cold-open we
got a lot of great stuff and in fact
we've got a lot of great stuff from you
guys we just got this sent in from one
of our fans from Atlanta Georgia Jason
Connelly thank you Jason
so Jason wrote Darren and gang that's me
congratulations on an awesome start to
season 9 just wanted to send this
network tap right here to you and say
thanks for all the hard work you guys do
sorry for the color scheme it's the only
parts I had hopefully you don't have one
of these already but if you do just give
it to Kirby as a chew toy from Jason yay
thank you so much we love it when you
guys send stuff in we've had people send
us in the old computer parts Vegemite
you name
and it's always so much fun to receive
random stuff so this would be going up
there with the Vegemite and I'm sure we
will put it to use sometime we do have a
wife and we do yeah so we actually do
have something similar to monkey but
anyway
that one's Wi-Fi this one's passive this
is really cool I'm excited about it and
he showed us links to where you can
build your own so we'll have that in the
show notes if you're looking forward to
making one for yourself I also did want
to do a quick follow-up to my road test
from last week when I was talking about
the force SSD from from Corsair yeah the
one that got to that thanks so much is
it still in I got the latest firmware I
should mention yeah it still isn't there
right now I'm about to use like ghosts
or fog project or Clonezilla or
something to mirror it onto the new one
I end up just picking up a samsung as
you know inexpensive and look at the job
done that's pretty yeah it is pretty I
mean as pretty as an SSD will be but I
did want to mention that I do have the
latest firmware on there and I'm not the
only one thank you for everybody that's
been tweeting at me emailing me hitting
me up on facebook and saying yes this is
definitely a known problem and yeah I
guess so I'm not the only one griping so
I don't feel so bad oh that's good yeah
so on to the hacker headlines it's time
for hacker headlines because paste bin
is getting a lot of love this week a duo
of Romanian grey accent in code and neo
of slacker dot row claimed
responsibility for hack on my sequel
comm using an SQL injection the attack
compromised my sequel comm usernames and
passwords hashes which can easily be you
know rainbow table down force right of
the more interesting tidbits we've
learned that the Director of Product
Management over at WordPress for example
uses a four digit password are you
serious bore them forward
okay hmm interesting also interesting is
NASA because their computer network is
seriously in need of some security
upgrades well good according to a recent
audit NASA has a bunch of security flaws
that haven't been touched for months and
months these security holes could lead
to defacement gos attacks and
information stealing attacks luckily
though since this has been out in the
open some flaws have been fixed but have
they really filmed all of the falls and
NASA security cover doc so I don't know
maybe my chances have been lost to
controlling that way guess who else is
in the news remember from last week
Komodo was hacked issuing unauthorized
ssl certificates for the likes of
Microsoft Google other well Komodo
release an incident report that track
the hack back to an Iranian IP address
and the company went as far as to allege
that this sophisticated attack must have
been state-driven
well the 11 June Komodo hacker has
actually stepped forward explaining that
he has no association with the Iranian
cyber army and he bragged about how
simple was to issue bogus certificates
after disassembling Komodos signing dll
and then discovering to get this a plain
text password the hacker went on to
paste in the source of trust dll yeah
time to rename that file yeah trust so
yes who's that it again
Sony yeah go figure the company claims
that mr. George Hotz
seems to have sabotage two hard drives
that he had surrendered to the court and
then he skipped town and went to South
America probably but according to Hodges
lawyer they just forgot to attach the
controller cards for the drives do you
think do you think they sent them I
wonder if he sent them like a raid zero
but without the control is it a perk 5i5
a you know RAID controller are we gonna
use a promise card
that would be hilarious for those kids I
want to have a juicy thing of that yeah
okay enough about the who's getting
hacked who got it's time for some fun
stuff now our UAV is online are you
talking about yeah or at least the smart
bird a new herring gull inspired
ultralight from from presto Bionic
network festival anyway there's a video
that shows this near lifelike soaring
taking a landing
still no word on whether or not they can
use it as a you know a Wi-Fi one flight
platform for X from the sky
that's a refresher actually you know
what else would be refreshing before we
get over to the follow-ups let's check
in with Kirby for the TCP packet of the
week
oh thank you so much Kirby you're
adorable and now for this week's follow
up file unlock errs and like unlocker
and la conner are pretty popular and
here is one of your user picks John
tells us you were talking about
unlocking locked files and windows and
we're asking about other tools one that
I like is file assassin which is a
utility inside of malwarebytes but if
deletes locked files instead of just
unlocking them it has come in handy for
me during virus infections or even when
a certain antivirus has gone crazy
pretty cool
I'll assassin can be downloaded as a
portable tool awesome and can be used to
delete any files including malware so do
you guys have some tips follow-ups or
just plain cool software for us to check
out email tips at hack 5 org and we'll
share them and now a word from our
sponsor

have you ever heard of vos vos was this
classic operating system created by B
Inc in 1991 to compete against Mac OS
and Windows the GUI was clean and
uncluttered the API was written in C++
and command-line interfacing was
available but sadly vos was never meant
to be only the big fans use it these
days but another OS took off in its
place this open-source operating system
was called a haiku and lucky for us
haiku is being maintained to this day
with the newest release recently in May
2010 haiku was first created back in Oh
1 under the term open B OS but it wasn't
self hosting until 2008 today I'm
delving into the world of haiku to give
you an introduction to this easy-to-use
operating system you can find haiku over
at haiku OS org its key features include
a focus on personal computing the custom
kernel designed for responsiveness it
has a fully threaded design for
efficiency with multiprocessor and core
CPUs it's rich object-oriented API gives
you faster development it has a database
like file system called open BFS with
support for indexed metadata and a
unified cohesive interface now you can
find haiku over at the website and it
can be downloaded to your computer or
you can download it onto a USB stick
portable I love portable to install
haiku on a flash drive all you have to
do is simply follow these steps you need
to have a decent sized USB flash drive
for example mine is 4 gigs the extracted
files are less than a gig so you'd be
fine with a smaller Drive if need be ok
so first things first you need to
download the any boot image file from
the download page now there's plenty of
different mirrors that you can choose
from I noticed that the u.s. ones work a
lot faster for me than the one in Greece
probably because of where I live also
you need to download image writer from
Launchpad dotnet slash a whole bunch of
stuff so you can write image files onto
your USB you can unzip image writer to
wherever you want so for myself I
created a folder called image writer
and then I ends up tit there right yeah
I'll open that up for you now once you
have the haiku any boot image file
downloaded unzip it to wherever you want
again and you need to rename that haiku
any boot image file to haiku any
boot.img instead of image spelled out so
that image writer sees it now what I'll
do now you can open image writer select
the image file haiku dot haiku any boot
dot image and choose your USB stick
drive and make sure you use your USB
stick drive and check it like seven
times so you don't end up overwriting
your original OS because that would be
really bad and then you just click right
so for myself
it's my D Drive and I open it up and
it's haiku
any boot.img luckily for me though it's
already on my USB stick so I won't have
to stick around waiting for five minutes
to let it finish when it's done you can
restart and you can boot into the USB
flash drive if it's if it doesn't work
the first time you may need to go into
your BIOS and change the boot list to
your USB first instead of your original
OS hard drive and make sure when you
remove your USB flash drive you actually
go into it and safely remove it instead
of just unplugging it just in case all
right now I'm gonna go ahead and restart
ok now I've started the boot up process
and I do have to go into my BIOS and
change the boot up so I'm going to the
USB instead see if it works
haiku yeah so the first thing you're
gonna see is the haiku start up screen
and it'll light up all the little icons
at the bottom showing you how far it's
done once you hit the rocket you're good
to go
okay now that I have haiku booted up I
can show you a little bit about the
operating system so as you can see haiku
is very clean and it's crisp it has no
crazy stuff going on
it's very unobtrusive and
easy-to-learn this desks far up here at
the top is where you go to find all of
your applications and change any custom
8 customizations that you want to make I
played a lot with all the demos and the
applications that are up in here up in
here so you can change any
customizations you want to make I also
played a lot with the demos and the
applications and it gave me a general
idea of how well the operating system
works a couple of really neat things I
found out where that you can open up and
use a terminal awesome so I'll show you
where that is so welcome to the Haiku
shell you can mess around in the
terminal if you want it also has a
built-in file converter there is media
converter so you can upload some media
that you want and then you can choose an
output format into avi for example and
you can save it preview it do whatever
you want in that sense and one of my
favorite things although very simple and
I think Kirby also likes it is this
pseudocode demo I'm a big fan of Sudokus
so when I got into this I kind of spent
like an hour just sitting here and
playing pseudo cool on my haiku OS it's
awesome I pretty much love haiku it's
open source so there's always going to
be new things added to it so if you're
bored and your current operating system
is getting kind of lame and sad and
tiresome and you want to take her around
with something new give it a try there's
a great user guide and there are forums
at their website as well as a slew of
other information so enjoy and you can
email me at feedback at hat 5 org if you
have any kind of fun programs that you
want me to check out or any kind of cool
things and haiku that you want me to
mention in a future snubs report we'll
be back after a brief word from darren
with this week's half tip
that's right it's that hack tip you guys
know last week Shannon revisited ye old
art cache poisoning attack using Cain
and Abel personally I'm actually a fan
of D sniff or ettercap but regardless
whatever the basics of the attack are
this monkey in the middle tells router
he's evil monkey in the middle tells you
is the router monkey in the middle like
smack you yeah well anyway all of this
is achieved using our packets were are
basically how nodes on the network
identify themselves the IP now it's good
stuff now enter X ARP it's an advanced
ARP spoof sin suite you can get it over
at Chris MC EE and it's a pretty neat
program that is both you know for
Windows and Linux so I'm gonna go ahead
and show you in my Linux VM here I'm in
Ubuntu and I've gone ahead and
downloaded the Deb they also have a
version for Windows and let's go ahead
and fire that bad boy up I'm gonna need
to know my IP address because I'm gonna
play both the good guy and the hacker
here in that right Kirby I know so I am
on my victim doo doo doo doo doo 10 1337
159 okay I need to know that right so
I've fired up oops excuse me come on
down here so I've already fired up X ARP
let me go ahead and restart that so you
can see what happens
so under internet internet X ARP
fancy splash screen and it scanned all
the networks and it you know sees all of
the other machines and it's looking out
for malicious Arps it's looking out for
when something suspicious happens like
say the MAC address of the router
changes because honestly when is that
ever going to happen so I'm gonna go
over here to my victim or my attacker
now I'm yeah I'm in Windows running into
VM so I'm just gonna use can enable
those scan the network I know that it's
not 156
I'm sorry 159 it's this guy right here
so I will come over to our pan I already
have let's see let's remove that add
that again so the router which is 10
1337 1 my victim which is 159 it okay
and I'm gonna go ahead and start
poisoning instantly over there on the
left you saw status ARP attacks detected
in fact if you look at the list here and
we can actually you know we can look at
all of the alerts of the attack it's
saying that the MAC address for the IP
of this IP changed 410 1337 change dot 1
changed the routers macca just changed
why would the routers MAC address change
as well as the IP the MAC address of of
159 so and what's really interesting
about this though is you can see these
X's here it's like okay we've understood
that it's 10 1337 one per the router I
already know that in 159 and then hey
look at that I've already identified dot
124 what we remember from last week when
Shannon got my Twitter account we can
see that hey this machine is trying to
poison my machine now I know - maybe
it's a good idea to just log off my
stuff choose a more trusted network or
you know just some dude gentleman stuff
like that you know but this is a really
neat tool it's available for Windows for
Linux it sits in your system tray it's
really pretty don't have to really think
about it a whole lot and I think it is
totally worth giving a shot Kirby
recommends it as well and I wanted to go
ahead and thank Christian for sending
this my way now if you want to send
something my way please do for 70% of
you could just get your windows
and then bailed when the tips from the
other 70% of you are using or 30% no I
don't know let us know we'll be back

the original portable workbench offer
ends April 30th
today we're gonna show you how to change
your wallpaper by right-clicking on your
desktop and hitting properties and here
to chose just how to do that is jason
appabob
how do you right-click on an android
phone oh we're not showing them how to
change their desktop wallpaper in
Windows know what we could but that's
that would be a really short segment
that would be no let's do something a
little more hard quit Mac let's do
something a lot of hard alright but no
oh really I got this Android phone I've
got a cool little wallpaper here but it
doesn't do anything we should do you
know with moving and stuff like that
maybe we have the logo we should
probably explain but the cool thing
about Android it's live wallpaper live
wallpapers this incredible thing that
came out in Android 2.1 version 7 we're
gonna go with that
yeah it's 2.1 it was introduced because
i guess take that iOS I'm ready to get
my my Android programming on what
language you are using what's I know
that is Java ok all new Java oh really
so from every feature out it's only Java
mmm because they just bought it and this
is why Java guys and I know it's time to
get some Java on yes how do we make just
a wallpaper like do something you make
an application the difference between an
application and an Android Walt live
wallpaper
well live wallpaper being the key word
here is it's actually a service you've
got services running on your phone just
like you have services running on an NT
so same idea just stuff that runs in the
background so instead of creating a no I
really in this case what it's literally
running in the background yeah I kept
myself to the background service for the
background yes the difference between
the an Android application and a
wallpaper is it's a wallpaper service go
figure
so your application instead of extending
activity extends wallpaper service
pretty straightforward because it's a
service as wallpaper still has the
oncreate still has the destroyed the
huge giant difference here is the engine
all right
it's the wallpaper engine let's take a
look yes so you have public engine on
create engine it does just that it
creates the engine and then returns it
back to the service itself the wallpaper
engine is just the
in class there's a couple things you
need to take aware be aware of in here
the actual we're using a parallax engine
because we're gonna do a parallax effect
now what's that it's a really good
question it's a it's a view of
perspective a change of view of change
on perspective so a different way to
view things so parallax is a larger
background it involves several layers so
you the background will move at a given
rate the foreground is going to move
faster at that given rate because it's
based on perception so like in Super
Mario Brothers when you run by and then
like the mountains are here miss feeding
them like the clouds are there moving at
that speed so you've got the the speed
of the background is illusion of depth
yep we're gonna give our phone the
illusion of depth in our wallpaper yes I
like that so what kind of you've put
together some assets in fact we put
together the hak5
new c9 wallpaper assets ooh oh yes yeah
it's it's pretty straightforward
basically what you're doing is you're
giving a surface a surface in this case
is is just that your background surface
it's this is it like a like a JPEG no
surface is a data type in Android it
deals with the things that you're
holding or placing images on it's like a
slate anyway there's a canvas on that
surface
I mean programming terms aren't that
complicated it's just kind of think what
what does this actually mean canvas is
something you paint on a surface is
something that would hold the canvas
like wall we're gonna go with that yes
well anyway so anyway you get you get
the canvas from the method I created
called draw frame it's just draw the
frames any way you get the surface from
what you're currently using
you grab the canvas and then you can go
crazy here what we did was we drew
bitmaps because the bitmap the
background on the Bittman of the other
layer and then we know the exposition
because there's a an event that's
triggered the on offset change so every
time what's an offset change exactly so
every time you slide like this you're
you're changing the offset the offset is
this far line okay so like in on an
Android phone how well
in the same phones where you can you
know like swipe your different home
screens if you will look those are the
different options let me explain when
you draw on a canvas you're your origin
is 0 0 where do you think 0 0 if you're
holding your phone where is 0 0 point 2
0 0 stop yes exactly
Android is there you go that's your zero
that's your origin when you move your
offset your offset isn't offsetting the
top-left number okay so you're saying
that you know in homes in my middle
homescreen zero zero is here and then on
my left home screen now zero zero is
over on the right no it's the offset so
this offset is just a number you're
adding to your zero zero so your x value
will change because you've got zero mm
and then the width of your wallpaper
which in this case is he's gonna be 600
because you have five screens 5 screams
times 120 pixels is it's 600 because you
have a 600 width anyway the offset is
what tells you where you are on that
screen and that's really important when
you're going to parallax because the
images you have obviously if you've got
images that could repeat it's really
easy because all you do is you
continually repeat the image or in our
case we've got images that we resize to
be smaller so what you end up with is a
triangle of images you're your largest
piece or your bottom piece the triangle
is the background which will be 600
across and then one up from that will be
one hundred less so that what happens is
they're all aligned to the right and
then as it moves you're going to advance
the front further than you advance the
back since it's a smaller image correct
so all okay so in this case we've got
the back of the main background and then
we've got three different layers of
cityscape since those incremental
cityscapes get smaller they move more
correct cuz this is all right yeah the
smaller the image the more they're gonna
move because you're if you try to fit a
1400 pixel image mm into a 600 pixel
screen when you swipe for every one
pixel you're gonna have to move to point
three six five pixels that's what we've
done here so for the background we've
got you need to make sure you declare
this as a double because Java and
floating point math don't get along hmm
yeah actually when you floating point
1/2 with division things get through
bard beyond all belief oh okay
you know when you drop so when you do
division and you drop that decimal
points like a point six but when you do
multiplication 40.6 that point six is no
longer an insignificant point six it's
like yeah okay so anyway so you take the
width of the background and divided by
the number of red you have or divided by
the overall width that will give you
your factor two times by the offset is
that make sense yeah it's all pretty
complicated but the source would make
sense
the source would make sense it's your
basically your your determining that if
your offset is zero obviously zero times
anything is zero
you're not going to adjust but pixel one
you've now moved in your background that
is fourteen hundred and forty pixels
wide you've now moved by your factor all
right let's take a look yes this place
keeps moving at different rates nice
that's really cool so what about the
code can people find the code somewhere
absolutely well after the code up and
they showed us awesome well I'd love to
see what you guys come up with what you
guys think about building your own live
wallpapers or whether it's called yes
I've uh papers sweet and maybe we can
put an apk up so people can juggle with
them check them out sweet and of course

even more fantastic technicals photo of
the week and guess who's joined us okay
let's get ready to kiss accountable Oh
actually before we even get to the
emails I want to tell you guys about
that hackers for charity cookbook
chickens and that that three or four
geeks are putting on they're putting
together a cookbook to benefit hackers
for charity the cookbook is basically by
hackers for hackers and that's perfect
we've submitted some recipes to it I did
yeah you guys should check it out to the
program we're gonna check back in
whenever they've got that ready to go
because it's gonna have you know recipes
from like Ron gula tenable Larry Bird
our operator Dave Kennedy I don't know
maybe you know check out the delicious
project that's that's all I'm saying
it's good stuff what did you submit uh
my crunchy chicken their crunchy tuna
noodle casserole really yeah oh yeah to
make so what's their special about it
it's crunchy yeah I submitted my cheddar
crisps I haven't had this chatter Chris
you need to bring them in studio one day
it's I should they're so good just like
shredded cheddar stick it in the oven
and then you can eat them I like that
idea all right bring those in when
you've got your Leia buns and then we'll
let you guys know how good they're the
world will love me for my cheddar Chris
in my Leia buns
let me go with that let's get into some
email servers all right so first up
bilbo frag like Bilbo Baggins I guess
but this one's Bilbo bag he wrote I
recently watched your episode on picture
on the picture frame case modding and I
disagree with Darren's comment regarding
his disregard for the importance of
safety goggles when addressing his
vacuuming assistant for reasons of
personal safety and to reduce your legal
liability that's a good call you should
somebody could get hurt during your show
and you would be promoting it and that
would be printed to suggest that one
always uses proper safety equipment when
working with power tools yeah yeah
Darrin should definitely never remember
that play with power tools never play
with power tools that's it guys don't
play with power tools especially Darrin
play that no okay well yes you're
absolutely right Lucy get it away from
Kirby I should absolutely not try to
encourage kids to cut their fingers off
cuz I know and you're right a little
just like a little chunk of wood flying
too high and it could be game over for
the rest of your acting days nobody
wants that so sorry next thing I didn't
curse that back in like season 1 when
did blood melt anyway moving on oh yes
you did yeah what a name rights when
drilling or cutting through a finished
surface to reduce splintering and wood
chunk knockouts try masking tape over
the area to drill or cut that should
make it a much cleaner look thank you
we also have an email here from necro
Khan who writes in to tell us that
regarding the picture frame there
easiest way to make it look good would
be to use a block off plate now do it
like you did on the second case mod or a
case and remove a large section of the
frame but then use some larger ears like
a quarter-inch of like plexi or lexan or
acrylic or whatever you get in lots of
different colors is good stuff you've
got it big enough to cover up the
section you removed and then you use a
little bit of angle bracketing to mount
it to the frame then you can cut a
proper sized hole through that which is
gonna look a lot better I'd probably
paint it black and then you just Dremel
through and you can easily wire it up
with some jacks and use even provided a
template and basically points out that
we want to use the c14 panel mount or
our connector and that way it's gonna be
all pretty it goes on to explain a whole
lot more I recommend you head over to
the show notes so if you're into the
whole modding thing he talks about how
you we could put like a three and a half
inch card reader HDMI ports the whole
nine
it'll be over a hack five org that's
awesome yeah we got a lot of emails over
this stuff alright Clifford Clifford
he's a big Red Dog
yes Clifford right on the last show you
answered the question about what cameras
your
for the great HD content I was wanting
to know if they could be hooked up to a
computer and used by the flash by the
flash Media encoder for Ustream I do
live streams over Ustream mostly on the
go and I need to pan and zoom this is
why this question is so important since
I am looking for a camcorder with HD
that can connect to a computer so do you
have any other recommendations yeah
absolutely so here's what you need to do
Paul do you remember where they are on
these guys because this is actually what
we used to use which is a Panasonic HD
CST 9 the family has since been improved
quite a bit here's there's the family of
the line of you have the component out
which I recommend well not to worry
about the synchronization now we've
never had any problems with the oh well
that was only using their on-air
software so Blackmagic they make a card
or a set of cards and even now a
external dongle that's very similar to
this but not quite that you can use HDMI
so you have digital the whole way really
cool Kirby loves it and basically it's
gonna give you you know as good an image
as the camera can create you're not
gonna get any loss of quality since
it'll be digital the whole way and we
did run into a couple of issues with
their software they they had this piece
of software called
on air which would allow you to do
camera mixing between two different
sources they've since discontinued it we
had them publicly audio sync but if you
used for example HDMI straight into at
one of those capture cards or one of
their little external USB 3 capture
dongle guys then you should probably get
the best source possible for your new
streams and get your you know crazy
soccer-mom zoom and pan going that's
what everybody on Ustream no one's to
see Venice yeah and last but not least
for the emails Taylor writes from
Australia and he says you have to have
Vegemite with butter and bread first to
write this I actually tried it with
butter and bread because you're right
you're right I should not be eating
Vegemite out of the jar I guess oh it's
really yeah that's I see the IRC wall by
the way if you might
supposed to be what does it call
refrigerated I did not know they say no
because it's been sitting on the set
here for a while so I hope this isn't
like full of mold did you toast it I
toasted I talked about I put a generous
helping of butter on there for a week
sure Oh Darrin you didn't like it okay
well yeah Kirby did like it this week's
tech no less photo of the week comes
from spin cycles spin cycle sends us a
photo of him did she DJing with a hat 5
sticker on his setup which I find
totally awesome you're right
got your drink what do you think of the
techno last photo the Technos photo is
great I will also say that this stuff is
as others have pointed out a acquired
taste if I was raised in Melbourne which
is almost as cool as Sydney or is it the
other way around I forget emails to
feedback a hack 5 or then I would
probably be like oh yeah ok it's like
beer yeah I've got a drink a lot of it
before you like it beer is good beer is
good it's done unless you're under 21
