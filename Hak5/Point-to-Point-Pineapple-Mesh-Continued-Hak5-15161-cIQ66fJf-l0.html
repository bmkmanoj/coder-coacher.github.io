segment of hack five this segment of
hack five has brought to you by
domain.com hello welcome back fine my
name is Darren kitchen
I'm Shannon Morse its your weekly dose
of Technol us we're back in the studio
oh it's completely rebuilt I can't wait
to give you guys a tour I love I love
what you guys have done with the place
you know looking pretty good
it's Paul's Paul's dream come true this
is what happens when I like when I go
out for like a week don't come back
where were you yeah I was like on
vacation no I don't know but this is
what happens I come back after like a
week of being out of the studio and this
is what happens oh nice it's completely
changed we have to re-engineer for the
sake of reengineering and any hacker
understands what I mean by that right
you could because if it's not broken you
do fix it I think it looks pretty good I
must say these DSLRs are like fantastic
it's really pretty
yeah well I'm kind of like in these
mm-hmm no fuzzies yes yeah so let us
know in the comments or the feedback and
give Paul props for engineering
something massive and awesome
what kind of looks the same back here so
I guess that that hasn't really changed
so I see you have a one of these
gigantic antennas on those r-25 bad but
yeah yeah is this 9 this is a 9 DB I the
the mark 5 it comes to the 5 or 6 and it
actually has like at least four times
the range of the previous gen the mark 4
really simply because of the connector
it used to me that there was a pigtail
that would go to the board I think was
called apex oh yeah so when we think of
problems with that thing yeah yeah one
of the things that I was talking about
last week was the ARP you know the
combining the output of the radio with
the gain of the antenna to get your
total power the thing that I didn't
really talk about was that there in I'm
sure I got so many comments I actually
haven't has an air yet but I'm sure I
will get comments about the fact that
there's actually loss in the way of like
that your cable or connectors or things
of that nature
Oh interesting yeah that's that physics
physics is it's can man I should have
taken one of those classes
sex man so do you has this changed at
all it has we actually went with a SMA
connector that's soldered onto the board
with mark five and the reason for that
is as opposed to that I pecks
you know pigtail on the the mark four
it's actually a much more solid
connection it's more like pro than
consumer and it means that the unit
itself will have much higher longevity
if something's going to break I'd rather
be an antenna which is less expensive
more easy to it yeah replace yeah then
the mark five and the result is that
even if you do after you say an adapter
to go ahead and get nor PSMA antenna on
it um it's still negligible as compared
to what we had previously
I see interesting Oh so what do you are
you talking about that yeah the idea is
that what you're wearing a giant gun on
your back no no no no no this is just
something I hang out on rooftops with I
like to call it my uh you hang out on
rooftops with that it's my Wi-Fi
boomstick because it's really smart to
hang out on rooftops with oh my gosh
it's like you can get a lot of that
makes a lot of gain with that it's very
stylish thank you yeah so Wow I think
it'll another than InFocus
so yeah we're we're talking about Yogi's
and parabolics and all sorts of other
antennas be cool um I am putting
together a pineapple mesh I'm wearing up
the whole town oh my gosh that's amazing
yeah wait does the town know this some
people in town know this the locals do
yeah well I figured this would be a
great opportunity to talk about you know
mesh networking and creating high-power
legal networks this is a great example
of um actually I should probably preface
that when we talk about stuff like this
please check with your locality because
the laws may differ in your area mat so
don't get yourself in trouble and don't
go over for wotty IRP if you're not
doing point-to-point yeah don't play bus
yeah
well today I am talking about what is
this episode 15 16 yes
cloud storage you love glad story yeah
I'm cloning some drop boxes hmm good
times
remember hard drives
hmm gee what are those all right cool
well let's get right to it
awesome yes right after this quick break
well here we are on the roof taking a
look at the first node in our ladder
known our mesh network or whatever you
will call it here of course I'm using
Wi-Fi pineapples because we make them so
I have them but really a lot of this
applies to just about any access point
and I wanted to follow up on one of the
things that I was talking about last
week as far as power and radios and
specifically DBM well I say DVM we're
talking about the decibel milliwatts
right and so there I did make a little
mistake and I want to clear some things
up because it can get a little confusing
1 DBM is equal to point zero zero 1 2 5
8 9 to 5 watts so as you can imagine
it's one of those things where you
really want to use a calculator or a
conversion table that's what I do
there's a link it in the show notes
there's some amazing conversion tables
for you guys to use and and I did also
make a mistake where I said when I was
talking about 40 DBM 40 DBM would equal
10 watts likewise this unit here we've
coupled a 24 DBM power output from the
pineapple with a 24 DB I gain antenna
this parabolic unit here facing the
building across the street and that's
giving us a total power or a IRP or
output of of 48 DBM which technically
equates to not sixty but sixty three
point zero nine five seven three four
four four eight watts except not
actually you see there's this thing
called the standing wave ratio it's a
ratio of the amplitude of the wave at
its highest point and lowest point and
and you measure the ratio and voltage is
called a VSWR or sometimes vis war or
vez war I'm not an expert in this field
it's a little bit out Scott outside of
the scope of this discussion until we
get into the software-defined radio
stuff but essentially what happens is
your power output will decrease as your
SWR increases and typically the stbr
increase is from well we call cable loss
so essentially in layman's terms we can
say no this is not outputting sixty
three point zero nine five yata watts
it's significantly less now is it more
so than it would be if I was just using
this little dipole antenna connected to
the pineapple yeah absolutely
I don't know the exact measure because I
don't know what the impedance of these
cable losses are and all of the other
physics factors that go into play here
however it is an interesting fact that
yes you will lose I guess a good rule of
thumb is the longer the cable the more
the loss and so we try to keep
everything as short as necessary here if
you are a ham radio operator in the San
Francisco Bay Area and want to come in
and school me and come on the program
maybe that would be awesome because I'm
always up for learning and I love that
stuff but suffice it to say no this is
not sixty three point whatever it's it's
a little bit less but you know what it's
getting a fantastic signal to the
building just across the way and I
couldn't be happier now as I talk about
hams though I should mention that there
was this thing called the HS mm mesh and
I've talked about this a bit in the past
when I talk about free and open networks
and and censorship and you know future
Internet's and things of that nature but
ham radio operators licensed amateur
radio operators here in the US are
granted by the FCC some really cool
abilities that just typical consumers
don't necessarily have and there's a
really fun intersection between the the
frequencies that they're given access to
by the FCC and the consumer stuff that
we use the is M band that 2.4 gigahertz
spectrum which is you know starts at
like two point four zero to two point
four eight something and somewhere in
the middle there and we separated by
channels and whatnot and there are at
least four here us in the United States
we get access to eleven of those
channels so the channel one would be
lower in the spectrum and Channel eleven
would be higher well channels one
through six overlap an area that the FCC
gives to amateur radio operators and so
they can actually use modified Wi-Fi
gear
much higher like we're talking 1500 watt
units here if you're actually licensed
and the way that it works is if you're a
ham radio operator you can set up your
equipment in this spectrum so channels
one through six of the Wi-Fi spectrum
and in 2.4 gigahertz and then your other
friend who is also a licensed ham radio
operator and then pick that up and do
fun stuff with it and that's actually
really cool because you can you know go
from miles and miles with this stuff and
it's actually fantastic for backhauls
making really cool big links and that's
not what we're doing here you know more
power to every operator however I don't
feel that I should have to register with
the government to to be able to use what
I consider something that's a natural
resource as much so as the Sun that is
beaming at me right now which is energy
and and the soil and and the wind and
water and everything else I'm not going
to go on a tangent there but one of the
the key factors that really dissuade me
from the ham radio stuff or getting my
amateur license and being able to have
the privilege to use those higher
wattages and things of that nature is
that they actually limit or censor what
it is that you can say and I'm not just
too talking about dropping the f-bomb on
a CB radio I'm that's that's not a
concern however it's really nice that in
the screen open is M bandwidth this
Wi-Fi equipment that we can use cool
protocols like WPA and TK IP and
encryption algorithms well sure you can
build a 1500 watt Wi-Fi radio of your
ham operator but it can't use encryption
and that's kind of a huge bummer that's
right the government says nope it's got
to be opening in the clear and yeah no
thanks however still really interesting
point to mention there and still
encouraging any hams in the San
Francisco Bay Area that want to get
together and do some fun crazy stuff
I am absolutely down so that was just a
quick little bit on on DBMS and those
things to things that I wanted to note
here about this setup particular to our
first note is that I'm actually using a
POA with the Wi-Fi pineapple mark 5 and
it's not a typical active vo a it's
actually a really passive simple p OE
where basically I have injector
downstairs
that puts 12 volts into the extra cables
that are used in a cat 5e cable
typically you know for twisted pairs or
eight wires and all of them are used so
we're using two of them for power in
this situation which is great because
the only wire that I have actually
coming up here it's through is this you
know hundred foot ethernet that's going
down to our network in the in the office
otherwise it's powered right off of that
my initial concept for this and I
actually have proven this although I was
getting some really cloudy days the last
week when we're trying to shoot this was
to go solar with this and a nice 15 watt
panel does the trick and we're going to
be using that in a later node in the
mesh but I wanted to point that out here
that I'm actually using P OE and I
couldn't be happier because it's really
nice to only have to run one cable so
power over ethernet for the win the
other thing to note here about this and
this applies to of course all of the
subsequent nodes here is that I'm
actually using a horizontal polarization
so what I mean with polarization is that
you know Wi-Fi radios it's its antennas
and we see you know its transmitters and
receivers and all antennas have a
polarization this would be a vertical
polarization well this would be a
horizontal polarization and so with
Wi-Fi typically what we use is a
vertical polarization reason for this is
because laptops you know typically open
them up the screens facing vertical and
that's fantastic because you know access
point has its antenna pointed up it's
radiating its energy like this and it's
and the antenna on the on the laptop
that's built into the monitor or the LCD
screen on the back is doing the same
thing so that's how you get you know
decent reception with your laptop with
an access point and why you may notice
in fact if you actually take say your
phone or your tablet and you're holding
it like this you've got good signal and
then you hold it like this and you don't
have good set
no now there's a bunch of really cool
tricks with my ammo and different
technologies we're specifically talking
to bury them simple 2.4 gig away here
but let suffice it to say with with one
antenna in here going up and down right
here this would be a vertical
orientation for my phone and that would
be horizontal and the reason that I
bring that up is because we're going to
have to make sure that we use the same
polarization on the other end on our
next node in this because if it's you
know I'm going to use Hawk 5 stickers
than it is an example because you know
it's kind of like a sheet of paper
really where you know if my signal is
going this way and my antenna on the
other side is that way there's not a
whole lot of intersection there that's
just a tiny point but if they're both
facing the same way they're actually
speaking much better and so you can
actually try this with you know the
antenna in your laptop hold your laptop
sideways here actually just go ahead
there and let me know how that worked
out run run kismet err or some other
programs to see your signal drop and
it's it's just an important note here
and also that you know as you can see
with with when we look at the DBM table
alright I use a table because it's easy
for me to understand you can see that
it's kind of exponential the way that
the growth is with those antennas I mean
this right here is a you know 60 bi
antenna then we've got a 9 d bi dipole
you know and I'm not talking about you
know wavelengths or anything like that
yet but as you can see things get
exponentially bigger from you know 6 to
7 to 9 of course this is being a panel
and this is being a dipole so this one
is more of a you know shotgun with a
smaller beam width than with this one
Frank radiates all the way around and
then you know we've got like slightly
bigger with our 14 you know so this
would be a 7 DVI panel this is a 14 dbi
panel and then this would be a what is
this a nice VDI panel but they can get
larger and larger and we can get pretty
crazy with those but again this is a
really fun project where I want to hear
your feedback especially if you're in
the Bay Area and want to have some great
radio fun so hit me up in the comments
shoot me an email darren hack v org let
us know feedback at hack 5
or what you think and next week we're
going to get into our next node and some
fun Wi-Fi drops explain that later

we're back and now it's time for the
trivia question of the week so last
week's trivia question was what is the
name of the MIT graduate and NASA
scientist who in 1991 designed a virtual
reality system to drive Mars rovers from
Earth an apparent real-time despite
substantial delays of Mars Earth Mars
signals in answer was Antonio Medina
now this week's trivia question is unit
Junction transistors aka u JT's are
often used in simple oscillator circuits
what is the characteristic of a
transistor defined as you know Junction
