assist
mmmm
Wow it hurt me a battery in there so
what got you in the am radio Oh see what
got me a ham radio so beef when I left
Intel I was a consultant for about a
year and a half working for a private
company in Seattle and one of our one of
our clients was the state of Washington
emergency management services division
and I was actually doing some exchange
work for them they were they needed some
some clustering some exchange server
clustering and so they brought us in
this is at two thousand memories
exchange in man l there you go there's
no all about the MTA stacks I wasn't a
total expert cuz I was kind of a
jack-of-all-trades you know I could
build the exchange servers do the
mailboxes do the stores all that but my
focus was mostly on like server hardware
OS networking so you know I've done
sequel done a little bit of everything
just because as a consultant he half to
yeah so anyway they brought us in to
build a couple of servers optimizer data
center you know like clear out you know
like boxes in front of the the chiller
so there'd be venting I mean there was
this they what their whole thing was a
mess but we came in and put together a
couple of change servers I ran some
fiber to the to the to the switch and
the routers and stuff and one of the
folks there he was one of their radio
people and he was their senior
technician for the state and he goes hey
you want to see something really cool I
said sure so he brought me into a radio
room it was all these you know amateur
radios and there and I'd never worked
with amateur radio as I'd worked on
radios in the military there on the
aircraft and so I worked with I knew a
little bit about VHF and hf radio and he
goes I'm Alicia let me show you how to
send a text message and email via ham
radio and so he
yeah sat down at this at this console of
the pc and pull up the air mail client
and turn on the radio turn on the TNC
and quit made a quick message and then
went to the other side's room turn on
the other radio turn on the other TNC
and totally broadcast an email and I was
like wow that was impressed your first
introduction to a media was actually
packet radio it was yes in 2006 as a
matter of fact so into it was around
november december two thousand six when
i first was introduced to packet radio a
x.25 networking protocol all these
things i had never never worked on so
I'd called around to find out where I
could take my amateur radio test and I
called called a group in can't and they
said oh if you want a really really good
training program call microsoft because
they have micro hams and micro hams they
teach people how to do ham radio packet
radio and you can take your test so i
was like cool so i contacted them sign
up for the class and I knocked out my
technician and general class radio
within two months got it all done and so
then I contacted the folks back at emd
who I had quit that company I worked for
before we're going back to the state and
I said hey I'm gonna be back in packet
radio so they said great we need
volunteers so I still volunteer at state
of Washington and the emergency
management division and we we do hf and
VHF packet radio and we use win link we
use a client called air mail and we we
communicate through other hamri
operators and through other agencies
actually using packet radio so i mean in
a sense we're all kind of familiar with
packet radio because the ubiquity of
Wi-Fi but how does you know packet radio
differ from that kind of like unlicensed
stuff that we use on the 2.4 or the 5.8
gigahertz spectrum with our little you
know blue consumer Wi-Fi routers and
whatnot so you're an honest a great
question
Darren so as we know that our Wi-Fi were
we have strict frequencies that we
broadcast on weight different channels
right but there's within the narrow you
know spectrum and it's in it's usually
short range you know we can set up ad
hoc networks or whatnot and they go you
know a certain feed maybe up to a few
hundred feet when you start working with
packet radio and with VHF hf frequencies
you can broadcast much longer distances
so give me an example I mean I know that
I can I could potentially do five miles
with two parabolic antennas on Wi-Fi 5.8
gigahertz point-to-point yeah but that's
a very specific use case and kind of
hard to dial in it's not like you know
put up an omnidirectional antenna and
broadcast to the world that way it's too
so absolutely so how is the ham radio
different and what what kind of range is
do you expect him in best kinetics
scenario let's just imagine we're like
in the middle of the ocean okay great
great question um so it's the same
principles it's just that with ham radio
we have access to satellites so we can
bounce signals off satellites just
willy-nilly you just pick a satellite
and bounce it no no there are some
public and SEC funded public salads we
can use and yet know the frequencies
obviously be a license radio operator
all I kind of thing but there are a
couple of satellites that we can use we
also when we broadcast like say from
what they call Shore to ship or whatnot
we use hf radio and so hf radio you can
broadcast for hundreds of miles just
skipping across the surface of the earth
between cloud and to the ship so hf
radio using pack door for for
long-distance communication packet radio
and VHF for local regional
communications but we have access tai
chi said two satellites heck we can even
do moon bounce if it's really far we can
broadcast a signal from your station to
the moon and then to the receiving
station if you know there what frequency
they're on there's a lot of math
involved in that hopefully on some
online calculators to to help figure
that all out dial it in so to get kind
of like an idea of you know the spectrum
between like three kilohertz and 300
gigahertz you know
the fun stuff that US hackers have been
you know joining with is that is M band
that industrial scientific and medical
that you know 700 I'm sorry 900
megahertz the 2.4 gigahertz the 5.8
gigahertz that's where we're really
having fun in the iden license stuff you
mentioned VHF UHF and hf where the where
do those fall in the spectrum okay yeah
like you're mentioned like for example 9
910 whereas we can talk we can broadcast
on hf light and what not like 252 or we
can do what 52 megahertz mm-hmm or into
like for example CB radios broadcast on
the am spectrum very low wattage that's
like 170 measures oh yeah yeah we've got
the VHF band which you know is like you
know 144 up to the cops and firemen use
like 555 so there's a whole rod spectrum
of where we can broadcast depends on
what what you want to do for example HF
is good for long distance but it's but
that the transmission rate drops because
you're going to longer distance whereas
if you're shorter distance using UHF VHF
you can do a much faster transfer rate
but shorter distance so it's it's a give
and take so is it safe to say that
generally speaking the trade-off is that
the higher the frequency you're using
the more data you can transmit but the
shorter distance it'll be whereas the
lower the frequency you can go further
but it'll be much as a slower data rate
absolutely and that that's that's
correct when the 4hf like for example
when you transmit a packet on using hf
Sam my friend is on a sailboat he's and
he's got an HF radio he's off from the
coast of New Zealand now for me to
transmit a packet to him we're talking
to 300 baud very slow and so to our
viewers that don't remember modems and
baud rates 300 baud is ass slow
I remember you know on the bulletin
board system this is eight you know AKA
or a bit ascii painting an entire ad
character by 25 characters screen at 300
baud that'll take a minute absolutely
yeah words were if we're locally like
say we're just a few miles away or even
30 miles away you know i can broadcast
on VHF i can broadcast at 1200 baud
right and some some of them can go up to
9600 so 9600 baud is the very bare
minimum you need to do a multiplayer
game of doom 2 so to put that in
perspective exactly exactly depends on
the distance of course short of the
distance much better a response you've
got but one thing also to is we can also
send attachments in our email too so if
you want to send a PDF dependence it's
going to take longer the bigger the
packet is because that's be broken up
chunks and sent but we are using the ax
25 protocol which has been around for a
million years based on the x.25 protocol
and it's reliable it's it's got it and
so that's a signaling protocol it's a
signaling networking protocol absolutely
was used a lot in Europe in a long time
ago until I pee came about so X 25 is
kind of like you know you got if you're
familiar with tcp/ip and then there was
that in novell stuff that was around in
the 90s and thank God we don't have to
deal with anymore it was the IPX ipx SPX
yeah absolutely x.25 is kind of like in
that below that because this is it's a
non routing protocol okay right and it's
insecure by design now yes it is it is
insecure by design but reliable and it's
simple and for basically when they say x
25 is just been modified it's been
slimmed down even a little bit more for
ham radio yeah I know that like for
instance debian if you're running or
like 12 or something it's very easy to
like there's kernel modules where you
can actually just install it and then it
shows up as ax and then 0 for your first
interface and so you basically end up
with like a network card that
is a x.25 and then whatever you transmit
through that goes to your TNC we'll get
to that but that so so it's a protocol
that's pretty ubiquitous it's time
tested but insecure exactly lightweight
reliable been modified tweaked for for
ham radio amateur radio but yeah it
isn't secure so you'd have to take care
of you know security at the client you
know if you're to do something like that
and so what is what does this allow you
to do what do you mainly use amateur
packet radio for well good example is
like in a disaster situation or for
example the state of Washington we have
lots of different radios you know for
disaster or for a national emergency or
whatever satellite communications you
know Wi-Fi we've got wimax got all these
different things satellite you know
those can be knocked down we could have
an electromagnetic pulse a lot of things
could be destroyed but when it comes at
the end of the day if things were to
become destroyed or disrupted ham radio
it's point-to-point and you can build up
build out in mesh networks with other
amateur radio operators it's kind of
like the last line of defense and so
during exercises when the military or
when emergency management services run
their exercise they integrate us as kind
of like the the last scenario so things
were to fail there's always ham radios
what they say when things fail as always
ham radio and I mean I guess the hottie
I'd even get started I know that with
ham radio there's kind of like two
aspects of it you need one the education
and the license and then you also need
like hardware so maybe you could walk me
through like if you wanted to get
started today you wouldn't just go on
eBay or Amazon or wherever and purchase
a bunch of equipment would you or how
would you even get started great
questions um well there are online
stores some of the bigger stores like
for example when I would refer
called ham radio outlet it's kind of
it's kind of yeah there's there's a one
there there's one bakkies there's one in
portland oregon and so they're kind of
the superstore for amateur radio
operators they've got TNCs radios cables
everything to get started as far as
training goes there's not a lot of
formal classes like that used in IT it
is challenging enough when your team is
all working in the same office let alone
when you're supporting members remotely
and that's why you need go to assist by
Citrix you can take control of your
entire IT world from one simple
cloud-based platform with go to assist
you can keep all of your systems up and
running while providing your users
support provide live or even unattended
support from anywhere even your iPad and
with go to assist monitoring get
customizable dashboards displaying
performance of all your networks of
servers your desktops plus get this
proactive alerting that allows you to
fix all those small issues before they
turn into big problems making you an IP
hero now I worked as a sysadmin for 10
years in the DC Beltway area and for
about ninety percent of the time I was
telecommuting for moments where you can
let me tell you go to assist and saved
my bacon on more than one occasion it
took just minutes to set up and I
remember right after the first session
completely ditching that finicky
solution I had before it just does the
thing and gets out of the way so I can
focus on doing my thing now check it out
you're going to love it you can scat
sign up for their special 30-day free
trial today just head over to go to
assist calm and click on the try it free
button and then they use the promo code
hak5 let's go to assist calm with promo
code hak5
to get started as far as training goes
there's not a lot of formal classes like
when you sign for college but there's a
lot of radio clubs so a lot of amateur
radio clubs are normally there's at
least a few and couples in each city
there are online resources now there are
four taking the exams you can study for
there's exam generators to take online
and there's volunteers that basically
Proctor the exam for you those gams not
very much it's about twenty dollars
probably eight nine hours worth of study
take the exam you can become licensed
and so what is that first test what is
that first exam give you a license to do
you said that they were general he said
there was technician you said there was
expert what are those different levels
and what do they mean as far as what you
can do with them yeah it basically it
kind of unlocks different levels as it
were you like level up you gain some
experience absolutely that's basically
what that what the concept is technician
level is the first one technician allows
you to do UHF VHF broadcasts you can you
can what they say operate a station by
yourself you've been licensed by the SEC
you know the rules and the regulations
when you get into a general class which
is the one above that that unlocks more
frequencies including hf which is long
distance global communication and when
you get into expert and there's only out
of all the radio operators that are
expert level there's only there like ten
percent of the total and they get in
some advanced stuff more electronics
working with radar some really
sophisticated these are the folks that
work at NASA work at NASA or they have a
really burning desire to to understand
things like microwave transmission right
radar and it locks a couple more higher
level hf frequencies but yeah there's a
lot of math involved in that one and
there's a lot of study i studied on it a
couple years ago scoring around fifty
percent and then got too busy life
happened and didn't pick it up but
basically to get started to do all those
kind of things the technician class is
more than adequate to get started and
then when you want to get to more
advanced
things with you know hf and packet then
that's when you want to go for general
you just go to FCC gov give me your
credit card number and take the test
online or do you have to go to a
facility has that one yeah so what you
do you normally Google online find out
the nearest ham radio club in your city
say I'm so on so I'm interested in
taking the test what resources available
and can you guys proctor the exam and
let's say oh yeah we have our testing
sessions on the first Tuesday of the
month and then we can we test out on
Saturday you know the second saturday of
the month they usually have a schedule
there's books ought you can order online
amazon books there's a couple of good
study guides and qrz calm is the the
super geek website for the free online
test runner so you can you can actually
take the online exact product exams for
free so there's a couple of those as
well that's interesting I didn't realize
that it's actually the amateurs that are
testing the potential amateurs within
the radio club</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
