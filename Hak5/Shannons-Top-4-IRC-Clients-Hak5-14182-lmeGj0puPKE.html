by team hello everyone on the Internet's
this week I wanted to give you my top
four IRC clients for a series of
different operating systems throughout
my life I've moved from you know Windows
I've used a little bit of Mac and of
course I've been using Linux quite a lot
lately and I've been trying to find the
best IRC clients for you know every
series of operating system that I've
been using so I have a couple of kind of
historical IRC clients that you can use
I also have a couple of newer ones which
you might be interested in even one for
the terminal so let's get right into it
with my number four choice this one is
called IR SSI
you see and it's a command line UNIX
program for IRC completely open source
which is the best part of course and it
started in 1999 so it's totally
old-school one really cool thing about
IR SSI is that there is a plug-in
available to add encryption to your
chats which is really cool and it also
includes a really handy documented
tutorial on the website to start using
it so if you check out my terminal it's
really easy to get connected you simply
download it of course and then you type
in IR SSI and this is a simple apt-get
once you get connected you typing nekked
IRC Dec 5 org or wherever you want to go
once you get connecting you can slash
join to pound hack 5 or whichever one
you decide to join and look you can see
everybody that's joined in and I can get
right into the chats of course it's also
very very easy to quit out of it if you
wanted to you basically just use all the
same IRC commands that you're pretty
much used to if you're familiar with it
so I would just hit slash quit quit
right back out and it will take you
right back to your terminal now it may
seem a little bit complicated at first
because there are no directions that it
really gives you upfront so definitely
go to their website and work through all
the different directions that they give
you on there so while I do think that
command-line IRC clients are a little
bit more complicated for day-to-day
users there's still a couple of my
favorites for a quick chat I had to
install ir ssi with aptitude
first and then connect over was a piece
of cake after that so the tutorial on
their website go check it out for that
one now for number three which is a bub
chat Zilla of course now this one is
basically a plugin for Mozilla Firefox
it's an extension that works in Windows
or Linux which is great so you don't
have to choose between one or the other
this one basically serves up a really
really easy GUI for anybody that's a new
IRC user and it's really super easy to
install so if I go down here and it'll
take me just a moment to a pull up
Firefox you pull it up on here and then
you go down to tools and you simply open
chat Zilla and this opens up a
completely new browser for you and of
course it uses all the same different
IRC commands that you're used to again
so it's very simple to use it also has a
nice GUI interface so if you're in very
new to IRC it's going to be really easy
to get right into it and it's really
easy to install it's just a plugin so
you know big deal there now number two M
IRC yay I mean who doesn't use this one
right so this is what I got into at the
very beginning pretty much is when I way
before I discovered X chat which is now
my favorite now I totally gave away
number one didn't I
it's only for Windows which kind of
stinks but it also has a really great
interface which makes it really easy to
connect to save all your favorite
channels it feels really similar to X
chat on the graphical interface side and
it's really popular I mean everybody
uses it so there's plenty of directions
available online but again this one's
only available for Windows so of course
I can't really show you how to use it on
my Linux machine right now but unless I
like VPN into a Windows box but I really
don't want to do that on my 8 I 3 it
doesn't work so well so I'll go ahead
and go straight into my number one
choice which is X chat this is
definitely my favorite I've been using
it for years because it's really easy to
use it's got a great interface you can
set up all sorts of automatic
connections if you need to and you can
even plug in all your favorite different
channels if you need to the availability
is on all of my operating systems so
it's really open although the Windows
version says that it's a 30-day trial
you know just yell mony trials it's
available as a command line version or
graphical version and it is G and you
licensed so they also have a very easy
tutorial on their website as well x chat
org this one I actually set up an
automatic connection to the hak5 IRC so
for example every time I open up X chat
let me go ahead and close out of these
it X chat it automatically connects me
to the hak5 IRC channel and it's super
fast very efficient log straight in for
me because that was crazy easy to
install and crazy easy to customize for
myself but of course you know that's not
all of them I mean this is obviously a
simple interface and I could easily
install bittle be on here if I needed to
again to get into Twitter and whatnot
but these aren't the only clients
available out there if you search for
IRC clients there's like 40 different
ones so I've only checked out maybe ten
of them some which break and some are
totally janky but these four work really
well but I want to know what you guys
use because plenty are available for all
of the operating systems there's a great
Wikipedia link to several of them in the
show notes so let me know which ones
you'd want to choose and which ones you
decide that you like the best what have
you been using for years so send those
over to me feedback at hak5 org we do
read all of those emails and I may do
another roundup of your favorite picks
coming up tight unless photo of the week
but first a quick break
as a phone tree growing up in the 90s I
never thought that I'd say that I love a
phone service but I must say ting has
won me over because it's the complete
opposite of the whole playing field
right now and Wireless you know it's
riddled with so many confusing confusing
policies and arbitrary rules and
penalties and premiums and really a
bunch of crap that you pay for that
you're not even using and this is why I
love the guys I think this is why I have
like three ting phones and three ting
data devices because these geeks they're
cool they're up in Canada so you know
they're chill and they decided that they
were going to totally change the game
when it comes to mobile phones and
here's what I love not only do they just
pick up the phone when you call support
there's no like phony tree it's just
like hey I'm a human let me help you and
they're passionate about this but they
built an MVNO network on the Sprint
network delivering a Android devices
with LTE 4G and get this I love this
fair and honest pricing that's what it's
all about right
megabytes minutes and text messages are
all built separately which for geeks is
awesome because I don't use that many
minutes right you only pay for what you
use so if you use too much you just
you're just build the appropriate amount
and if you use too little too little
you're just credited the difference
really you don't even need to worry
about the plans but if you'd like to see
how it stacks up to your existing
service go over to hack 510 comm and
check out their online savings
calculator it's a really helpful tool to
compare what you might be doing right
now was all you could be doing with ting
I know I've switched over all of my
friends have switched over in fact I'm
using it right here in the van plugged
into a Wi-Fi pineapple and a signal
booster here which is great because this
thing is like a Faraday cage now with
nice little antenna on the roof I've
always got service I love it so again
check it out at hack 5.10 comm and we
thank them for their support of hack 5
and hack across America time for my
favorite part of the show the techno is
photo of the week and this one comes
from Billy he sends us these photos of
his lair and he says so I had just
finished up my send OS home server and I
thought I'd snap a pic of it and my
others for the show before I moved it
off of my workbench on the cent OS pic
there is a
seven htpc running the Media Center for
the TV in here the windows box just a
typical Windows PC custom-build gaming
PC my main use computer is the iMac with
the 42 inch TV next to it and there's
also an Xbox 360 behind it and an HDMI
switch for when I need to take
programming or design breaks and PS how
is SF compared to Virginia and Billy I
actually love SF it's one of my favorite
places in the world and I am so thankful
that I finally got to move out here I
gotta say I've been an army brat all my
life and this is the one place that I'm
totally cool with staying yet for like
the rest of my life I love it out here
so thank you so much for sharing Billy
and if you guys have photos you can send
those over to feedback at hak5 org with
the subject line Tecna Leste and will be
happy to share them on the show
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
