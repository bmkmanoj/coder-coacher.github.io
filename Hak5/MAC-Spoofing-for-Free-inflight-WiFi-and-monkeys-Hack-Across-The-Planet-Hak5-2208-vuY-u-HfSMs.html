Thailand up top
severe is good this episode is nothing
but non sequiturs by the way the fun
work
you know the most popular program here
it's whatsapp going to hell for that one
and the diplomatic mission to Alderaan
continues on to Jakarta this week and
I'm here at the tire wave lounge finding
little card greeting me with the Wi-Fi
instructing me to go to http an IP
address flashing stuff and a login dot
PHP also one of the big problems with
these captive portals is that on Android
systems or at least on Samsung which is
quite prevalent you get this little
pop-up to sign into the Wi-Fi network
and you'll notice here you know I can
make you know this is the captive portal
or at least it's the one I think it
should be it is an open Wi-Fi network
after all there's no URL bar so there's
no way to tell that I'm next to an HTTP
or HTTPS site or that I'm even connected
to the network that I think I am like
it's really guys you couldn't get a
captive portal and it's still HTTP so
it's not just the ship
this is prevalence everywhere and will
get fixed we just have to keep breaking
it
and you can help from the insanity
behind me that I'm back in Indonesia
as a motorcycle enthusiast this city is
awesome I love the tiny little
displacements in all of these mopeds
scooters motorbikes motorcycles whatever
have you I just saw the sweetest CB 100
and that's like the sufficient that's
big and yet in the US the smallest you
can buy as a one a 250 just goes to show
I don't really need that much and it
works here then again I know if I take
that on the freeway
I'd walk Jakarta I'm trying to make
friends with the local cats my
neighborhood and the cute neighborhood
totally different than whatever you do
you like getting a little weird bug
stuff
watch this I'm just going to walk right
past this
I'm not even going to stop I felt
control what it is I don't know I can
quit any time just don't bother
here at cgk Jakarta on my way to Bali
because once again hacked across planet
is taking me on some business monkey
business plus approach tip this is a
really affordable Airport to get into
and then everything around is super
cheap so don't bother flying straight to
Bali game come to Jakarta first and
jisang go Rach believe me
so one timer forget to bring an ethernet
cable on the plane
seriously that is an Ethernet port right
there I now have to turn in my Accra
card for forgetting to bring by the way
we actually have really cool new
Ethernet here in the hack shop check out
the little micro switch in all the cool
nifty doodad so once again hacker
optimum Bolivian Philomath aladár
skating gold a donation emissary Beach
and reversal Barbara Bellini bow
Madigan's rule deposit Amanda sama
brulee Gilliam Sawa demolishes Rama
three multiple vanity good evening
ladies and gentlemen member of the sky
teams of Indonesia so once again hack
across the planet has brought me an
interesting aircraft this here is an
Airbus a330 which is a really fun love
child of two different aircraft it
shares the fuselage from the a300 which
is an early 70s plane that had the
distinct thing of being able to claim
being the first wide-body to aisle
twin-engine jet the other is the a 340
which was done in congruent development
with this particular plane which was
developed to be a long-haul claim that
has four engines so it doesn't fall
under ETOPS regulations anyway
fun plane and I'm eating at all times
again that's what I do on this trip more
unabashedly for the Microsoft Surface
and that right there is why another Pro
travel tip here if you're flying in
Indonesia you would have to fly
you're really airline like this isn't it
actually enforcement
for real because
state-run government-owned airline and
they don't translate
completely Sweden has the worst air
safety record the other thing is as you
can see from this business class cabin
it is quite empty which means that is
very affordable like ridiculous as if
you're using American dollars okay
that's my process
now I'm going to go find it be anywhere
also they serve bintang you're going to
want one of those just this one today
they didn't have any gin and tonic but
in fact what's up and that not are you
poor up here
now one more interesting fact about
virtu Airlines not only are they be only
Indonesian airline not banned by the EU
to apply in their airspace but they're
also kind enough to provide the patrons
with fifteen minutes or ten megabytes of
free Wi-Fi access which is really cool
considering it's done by MAC addresses
yeah
back address Oh but to their credit they
do put HTTPS on the captive portal so
that's kind of cool
now of course once you've run out of the
free internet access will be asked pay
lets or is you happen to get a new maxi
dress doing so on Windows can be done
with PowerShell command like set - net
adapter you specify the name and the MAC
address or you can run T Mac and then
just click on the interface and click
random MAC address now if you're on
Linux go ahead and install Mac changer
it's Mac's change your attack or for
random and then the interface name like
double and 0 and that's also
pre-installed on the Wi-Fi pineapple and
that will work on any Wi-Fi network that
limits usage by MAC address
if you have a great idea bring it to the
web the way Shannon I do and head over
to domain comm with an awesome domain
discovery service and a quick movie
checkout process you'll have the perfect
site up and running in no time
oh my guys over at domain.com our syntax
5 bands which is why hak5 will save you
an extra 20% at domain.com or just send
the tweet and say thanks for supporting
hack 5 all these years so when you think
domain names think domain.com Thank You
tramica see and that is checkpoint
Bangkok's Poli I know I am I'm in Bali
still don't know why monkey business
that's fine monkey business
let's you steal someone's ice cream is
that your ice cream I don't think that's
your ice cream cone I think that's a
little little boys ice cream cone over
there so you don't care you're a monkey
you're just going to do it I haven't
even made it to the monkey forest and
already I've seen monkeys me both some
little kids ice cream cones so I might
have a hat now I have a hat now
the wrong thing to be in this part so
it's pretty good thing DNS pertain
monkey in the middle attack
Bad Bad Monkey that's my water bottle
well now you've gotten it everywhere are
you done with it
I got to put that in the section this is
not very tape
smart monkeys steal bananas not so smart
monkeys steal durant and umbrellas and
water bottles and plastic bags and
anything that isn't a banana and then
gets disappointed when trying to eat it
find out it is not a banana with my
protest for the episode you can thank me
later
