by the national campaign against drunk
driving drive sober or get pulled over
and we're back with pineapples on the
rooftop yeah yeah didn't you hear
oh no your what do you know what's going
on what is what's happening the hack
shop is delivering pineapples and via
drone to your rooftop I heard about like
Santa
yeah actually it's kind of like the
thing that Jeff Bezos was talking about
crazy cat Amazon he's so great right
yeah I love that easy you know what
don't you if you weren't there to get
your delivery know what happens they
destroy your packs package or it gets
stolen by aliens
oh well you know what happens if Amazon
delivery drones are flying over your
house what skeet-shooting with prizes
uh-huh you know if Amazon tried that in
Missouri that would probably happen you
think so yeah they'd be like oh that's a
big bird yeah look hard I got a phone
case we love you Missouri oh I'm from
there I can say that yes we actually are
gonna be delivering so this is just a
tease for what's coming up after the
Wi-Fi seriously it's not look at all
these rainbow-colored rubber band ever
hang on a horrible-looking something hey
this is the cheapest prepaid cell phone
I can get where I can buy sim card in
cash and then fly over stuff and then
see the telemetry through Google glass
yeah that sector not predicting
pornography on to the neighbor's lawn
well this is like 17 year old Darrin
we're going to have a lot of stupid fun
and get ourselves in trouble cases so
much trouble what we'll talk more about
like our pineapple mesh network delivery
node system and perch and monitor and
all of those other things I just thought
that we'd had some fun um it's beautiful
fun like this mess Network thing has
brought Figaro more fun that I ever
wanted to have in the the lower levels
of the the OSI I'm learning like okay
there's there's a thing about the
physical link layer that's that's not as
much fun as the higher levels with the
application layer or the politics
that's what working there's always a
politics layer we'll get into that in a
sec but there is something there is
something really nice well we've talked
about you know radio stuff where it
comes to yeah yeah no cable loss where
your signal degrades the longer your
cable is and things like that and you
know I've just been like making mistake
after mistake talking about like well
you know well actually and and it's
great because I love the ham crowd that
comes in and corrects me because I
learned so much but there's a difference
between I talk about this war or the
standing wave ratio compared to cable
offs no they're not the same but yes
they do the same thing in that we're
talking about the degradation of your
signal the nice thing is though when we
talk Wi-Fi typically speaking you see
this this is a package deal it's the
magnetic base with the SMA X you know
cable and the antenna and this has all
been done with the same ohms value all
ready to go kind of I don't have to
think about it so that's that's one of
the nice things about the is M band and
Wi-Fi versus the you should probably go
to school learn this before you start
tramping over frequencies that aren't
yours and props to you guys ham radio
operators and yes that's where the FCC
does play a very important role in
making sure that people aren't driving
their monster trucks over school buses
full of flaming nuns well speaking of
all of this awesomeness we actually did
get an email from a fan that I did want
to mention to you so this is from algae
he wrote in about Wi-Fi mesh so all on
top of you know what you're talking
about regards to FCC regulating
encryption on amateur bands the FCC
recently held a panel to discuss the use
of encryption on amateur bands the
argument was made that hams working with
the Red Cross and passing p2 on patients
violates the HIPAA it was shot down and
you have a great platform to bring a
bunch of tech minded people aboard and
start to swing the opinions on things
like encryption and that's one of the
things about you know I love you know I
am a good voice got to play by the rules
I understand the needs for you know
getting a driver's license to drive on
the road or getting a license to use
certain
radio frequencies and just prove that
you're not an idiot right and that's
cool like we can all have lots of fun
here with this consumer stuff but yeah
proving you're not as good what I don't
like is you know this kind of ties in
with the fact that the FCC if you become
a mature radio operator or a ham radio
guy yeah you can but you know you could
potentially use channels one through six
so the Wi-Fi band that overlap and use
like a much higher signal power yeah and
make Wi-Fi link to go for days and days
and it's cool stuff except the FCC has a
provision when it comes to pack a radio
just like they have for you know using
voice for radio where you can't say that
you know F but you can't drop the f-bomb
or say the c-word or any of those things
yeah
well the same provisions apply to
encryption really and so we've had some
questions about that and yes it applies
to not only the encryption on the like
the you know whether it's WEP yes that's
considered an encryption or wpa wpa2 as
well as say you're sending plaintext
email however the email happens to be
GPG encrypted that's still considered
encrypt oh I'm not positive on this but
I've heard that you can in some cases
use some sort of ciphers if the cipher
is public record as in if you like go to
the FCC or the put in like you know in
public records like here is the password
I'm using Y and that's it's interesting
I I just don't believe that like you
know I knew I understand
access control but I don't believe in
censorship and and you know the internet
is so beautiful and I don't want to get
on this tangent because I've already
done a whole episode that see the talk
that I gave at the hacker spaces for the
last hack across America on you know
access versus censorship versus
identification and that the three
pillars of networks and I just don't
like that the you know in order to do
really cool packet radio stuff you have
to identify yourself every to get what
it is like thirty seconds or something
with your you know issued handle and
your and you you know are limited on
what you can and can't say and it's like
I understand why these paradigms exist
trust me if my you know if I were a
government and I was trying to keep my
citizens under control it make no sense
to do
so anyway it all just leads me back to
being very thankful that we can have fun
in the is M ban so let's have as much
fun that we can legally and thanks for
sending that in I know that I know that
you know transferring patient data over
unencrypted stuff does violate HIPAA and
this would be a good platform for me to
get on that bandwagon but I just I don't
feel empowered in that sense maybe I'm
wrong
I don't know I'm wrong I mean up
feedback ak5 dot org maybe I mean maybe
there will be enough of a grants poll
where people are like not use encryption
I mean we've got a whole generation
growing up that has like both a
understanding that everything they do is
monitored online and an understanding
that encryption can protect your privacy
so if those same people are the ones
that are replacing the aging ham crowd
that it's going out and maybe the FCC
will just have to adapt but we're also
talking about government's adapting to
innovation yeah and that's never been
quick well let's have some fun shall we
yes let's have some fun so right now in
the hack shop because it's the holiday
mmm we're having sales but we have crazy
special competitors duckies and all
sorts of other stuff we've gotten
goodies and so head over to hack shop
calm because it is the best way to
support us directly and we absolutely
thank you for that because we couldn't
do this without you
and luckily you don't need any coupon
codes or anything for any of our holiday
sales so get on it limited limited time
and it just depends on availability
really yes get them while you can
and don't forget that you can always
find the ways to follow everything that
we do online you want to be following us
on social media for it whenever the next
big project is you're gonna want to
follow at snubs on twitter and at hack 5
darren on twitter that is yes I was
gonna say at Dirk I've been having fun
doing video blogs with this yeah Oh
where's mine I don't know oh are you
cyborg town
I am cyborg join me in cyborg town doing
some fun hacks with these two they are
daddy on the Wi-Fi yeah yeah they are
don't if you you get the opportunity to
become a pilot
become a pineapple explorer become a
glass Explorer don't take your pineapple
to the fitting facility at Google
because you do that I didn't do that you
know that anyway I don't we'll get in
trouble I love you all thank you so much
for tuning in we will see you next week
until then I'm Darrin kitchen I'm
Shannon Morris trust you're a
technologist Merry Christmas
from December 13 2013 through January
1st 2014 state and local law enforcement
will be out in force cracking down on
drunk drivers they'll see you before you
see them drive sober or get pulled over
if you've been drinking get a right call
a cab or find some other safe way home
if you see an impaired driver on the
road contact law enforcement your
actions may save someone's life and
inaction can cost a life getting
arrested for drunk driving can cost you
a lot more than an arrest and a find you
could face legal fees court costs the
loss of your license and even more
nobody ever gets in their car thinking
I'm drunk I'm driving I'm just gonna get
busted tonight nope people drive drunk
because they think they won't get caught
in about a million times a year they are
wrong this could be a checkpoint that
you don't see til there's no way out it
could be a cruiser parked with the
lights off it could be that set of
headlights behind you that you don't
realize as a cop till they hit the siren
but time after time after time the cops
see you before you see them and then
it's too late or people might think I've
had a few drinks but I'm okay to drive
or I only live a few minutes away from
here or I've gotten away with this
plenty of times before and they think
like that right up until the moment that
they kill someone remember drive sober
or get pulled over
where's our Christmas decoration next
week okay Google oh-oh-oh-oh
okay Google search Christmas and then
this military guy was up at the bar and
he was like dude can I try to glue the
glass I'm so interested in this how did
you get him are they probably already
and I was like no I'm sorry developer
but yeah you can try my picture he was
like okay so it takes a picture and it
goes and he was drunk so he goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
