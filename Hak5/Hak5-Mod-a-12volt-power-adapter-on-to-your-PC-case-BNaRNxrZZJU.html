12-volt accessory outlet into your case
it's basically the same thing that you
would use as a cigarette lighter in your
car but now you're going to be able to
charge your cell phone and use any other
accessories off your case things you're
going to need or of course the accessory
outlet you can buy this at RadioShack
its catalogue number 270 1556 I'm going
to use an optional rocker switch this is
catalog number 27 57 31 a soldering iron
and solder I used a multi-tool as my
wire cutter and strippers a rotary tool
a spare male molix connector a
multimeter and some heat-shrink process
is going to go something like this first
we have to cut the holes for both the
accessory outlet and the rocker switch
and go ahead and mount them after that
we're going to wire the rocker switch in
line with the hot line of the accessory
outlet we're going to connect the molix
to the switch we have to test everything
for continuity if everything checks out
we're going to go ahead and Hotwire a
power supply unit and check the whole
thing with that and assuming all of that
works out we're going to go ahead and
install it so let's get down to it I'm
going to install everything onto a five
and a quarter panel and I've laid out
where my holes are going to be just do
this / dimensions on the packages and
from here we can go ahead and cut
everything out so you get your rotary
tool I'm using a drill bit just to cut
everything out
all right now we've got the holes all
cut out we can go ahead and drop in our
rocker switch and our outlet and these
just pop right in just slide them in the
hole make sure you leave a little tab
and when you hear that clip you know
it's seated do the same thing for the
rocker switch all right now that we've
got the rocker switch in the outlet
seated and the leads connected back to
the switch I'm going to go ahead and
prep the molix connector now on these
molix is the yellow line is the 12 volt
hotline so that's what we need for this
particular application so coming off the
back of this male end I'm gonna go ahead
and trim the 5 volt lead and ground off
like so and then I need these wires so
I'm going to cut this female end off
over here like that separate them there
we go all we have to do now is strip
them down and get them ready for
soldering alright so I've done all my
wiring and just you know make sure you
stick to the directions on the back of
the package for the switch I'm just
finishing it up I've already done my
load and my hot wire they've been
soldered and heat shrunk to the back of
the switch I'm just gonna finish up the
ground right here and just give it a
little solder make sure you have a good
connection all right now they were all
sided up and tied down I'm go ahead and
heat shrink it with this lighter here
just make sure our connections are good
and snug alright now we're going to go
ahead and check the continuity of our
wires
and assuming everything checks out like
it did here will go on and test the
whole thing with a live power feed with
a jump started power supply all right
everything's wired up and cooled off so
we're going to go ahead and test it out
and go ahead and plug in my molix
connectors here now if you ever have to
do any power supply testing without a
motherboard you can jump start it by
jumping pin 14 and pin 17 on a 20 pin
ATX power connector I've already got
that set up over here so jump it powers
running now let's see if we've got power
on the switch there we go red means go
in this case final step installation and
actually plug in and accessory alright
now that we've got everything installed
back in the case powers running let's
really give it a test and plug in an
accessory power on I've got a red light
there it is phones charging so now that
my dead phone is charging I think I'll
log on and play with the hak5 light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
