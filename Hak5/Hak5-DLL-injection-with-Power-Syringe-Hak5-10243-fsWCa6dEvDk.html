by netflix
guys you know the scene in the movie
were like the cops are busting in the
hackers like oh no and he's like trying
to what EMP his drives or something is
that is that where the idea came from
actually the idea came from a
presentation that the shmoo group put on
at Def Con they came up with their own
anti forensics challenge for destroying
a hard drive in 60 seconds their goal
was to take like a 3u enclosure you know
three you server size and have that
render a drive forensically useless
inside of 60 seconds and they failed at
it pretty badly crowd sourced it and I
decided to go ahead and take on the
challenge and present about it here so
that's where it came from let's cut to
the chase this right here is the
skunkworks approach well actually this
skunk works and then this is the result
how do you get a drive to look like that
because I don't think any data is is
coming off this guy yeah that was
actually about 300 grams of a slightly
modified version of thermite that has
calcium sulfate and potassium nitrate in
it and it did a really excellent job of
just targeting the hard drive and not
having too much collateral damage and
basically that used to be a hard drive
in perfect condition and it was inside
of a specially constructed a 3u size
drywall box made out of fire rated
drywall double thickness about an inch
and a quarter and you just have all that
thermite in there and then as soon as
you want to destroy the hard drive you
just initiate a self-destruct sequence
you can do it remotely from a thousand
miles away and it so this just so this
just sits in your rack and then when you
press the button boom yeah exactly now
is the drive running you can do it with
the drive running you can do it with the
drive off either way it works so you
just run a long side of cable to your 3u
enclosure now when you hit the button in
a detonates now you've got a server room
full of black smoke right well the thing
is you actually don't I did a couple
interesting tricks one that I tried out
initially although it's slightly
violated the challenge requirements was
having a big pipe leading out to fresh
air yeah just exterior ventilation in
the second trick that I tried a little
later was using a couple steel baffles
to reduce radiant heat transfer and then
a HEPA filter like on a furnace and that
actually worked really well filtering
all the smoke out and preventing the
data center or fire suppression from
going off because last thing you want is
deadly hail on you know so was this the
first
kind of strategy you had to killing a
drive or how did this come to be no
actually I had a couple previous
strategies of a schmoo group tried a lot
of different things a lot of them didn't
pan out so well they tried acid smashing
drives grinding him down I myself then
tried sodium hydroxide injecting that
into drive to try and dissolve the
aluminum platters because everyone knows
why and aluminum don't play well
together and that actually didn't work
so well turns out the coating on the
platters is very tough and very
resistant to chemical attack I also
tried a high-voltage transformer
approach where I put a couple electrodes
on either side of the spinning drive and
just melted it with a really a lot of
power at a very high voltage and that
did work but it required modifying the
drive in a clean room and it also
required a really lot of power which
gives a lot of practicality issues if
you need to destroy a lot of drives at
once you can't replace your accounting
department with a nuclear power plant so
so the late so if this were to say like
be like a commercial box or something
like that how would this work he just is
a single Drive for every three use or
how does it how does it work well I've
tested my prototype actually up to four
drives but each have a three to four
hundred gram self-destruct charge on
them for a single 3u unit I actually for
see if you were to make this a practical
device though you'd want to scale up
something larger perhaps ten or twenty
you several layers of fire rated drywall
and a lot more drives inside there's a
big economy of scale with this when
you're shielding multiple drives and
multiple charges that there might versus
just a few that's fantastic and of
course I guess the enclosure then
becomes reusable so for the next time
the cops bust in the door and you need
to pitch the big red oh button
things can melt again exactly and there
are a few you know self-destructing hard
drives out there commercially but I
think the big thing that this does a it
meets Fisher group challenge and B it's
very cheap avi enclosure that I built to
melt that drive cost about 10 bucks wow
that is pretty fantastic and I don't
think a bit is coming off of this
actually now I think I see a one where's
that a zero we're not really sure

it's time once again for the technology
of the week yeah put the toy sale or
twice down all right technol this photo
of the week this comes from Zach and
it's awesome so Zach and Josh of UNC
sees hacking team went up to shmoocon
and they went to this party that I just
happen to be yet and that took a picture
with mr. dan kaminsky breeding the
alternate yes I always fix out yes sir
woman and he said the wonderful snugs in
the background photo bombing like a boss
oh my gosh it sounds like you take it to
a hacker con especially on the East
Coast where there's jingling where's our
poverty with the new set we don't have a
healing with luck he did you like this
we want you anyway God yeah I was so
happy late they came out I went to the
party and there was no yingling set out
at all it was like corona right but
light or something I'm her and then
halfway through the potty party this guy
comes up and he's like dr. done legally
yeah you guys and I was just staring the
whole time going so excited so I had to
wait like 10 minutes until it was cold
but I was basically hugging the cooler
the entire time and not letting anybody
around it so sorry if you want to be
evening I apologize but it was really
thirsty it was good I'm just imagining
like a gigantic jingling and you like
swimming in it like a mermaid haha I
don't know why bad idea yeah photoshop
contest snapchat feedback at hak5
doorbell along with your technology otos
and it could just be photo shops let's
just start that now send your crazy hak5
photo shops over to keep that back five
dot org and now it's time course for
this is a very bad bad idea yes I was
with unicorn horns except it's really
giggling anyway this man vampire yeah
alright so trivia last week IBM's
personal system to released in 1987
flopped but it did introduced several
new technologies name three of these
technology so some of the ones that you
could have chosen Vijay connectors 3.5
inch floppy disk microchannel
architecture dude mca was wicked mm-hmm
wait a second i thought i had mca
architecture on my pc xt but now i'm
getting confused cuz the ps2 came out
after have to look that one up
anyway hey you know you top PC I was bad
I are queues for the win this week's
question is according to AMD what does
the abbreviation ap you stand for answer
that over at hak5 org slash trivia to
win some schwag be awesome what do you
think amazing pony unit that sounded
different in my head anyway for the
places to stock as hak5 dot org slash
follow get your rag of a tack shop calm
we got USB rubber duckies the source
code and other fun stuff like that hack
tips every other friday i'm darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse rescue tech no
less we'll see you next week for more to
move on I don't know boning honing unit
coning still doesn't sound good alright
sorry no bloopers that's funny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
