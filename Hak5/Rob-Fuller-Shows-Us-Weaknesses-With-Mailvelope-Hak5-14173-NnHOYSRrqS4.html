by goto assist so lately we've been
talking about using email encryption and
making it completely transparent well
not transparent but as easy as it
possibly can be using webmail tools and
using things in your browser such as
mail Volokh they're really lower the
barrier to entry and make it a lot more
convenient to use strong encryption of
course all of that crypto stuff it's
only as secure as you keep your private
key and here to talk to us about that
Rob fuller Rob I heard sounds going it's
been a while it goes so well dude how
are you doing good
it's have a lot of fun tricks to share
coming up here awesome well it's so good
to get you in on the GoToMeeting uh
you've been you've emailed me and you're
like mail hello lulz like what's it
what's a problem with melville oh okay
so well when as soon as as soon as you
sent me or as soon as I saw this the
segment on mail flow I was like mmm that
has to store the private key somewhere
and it's probably not doing it with GPG
in the background since it's a
JavaScript version so how is this doing
this so I looked into it and so one of
the interesting things about about
Chrome and everybody knows that you can
get the master passwords and passwords
from Firefox by looking in there and
doing show chrome stores of those saved
passwords in that very similar fashion
but it does it by encrypting it with
Windows is own per user crypto which is
relatively secure unless you're actually
executing as that user so I know the
whole point of chrome though was that it
brings all of the security enhancements
the sandboxes the crypto using the user
like you were talking about doesn't the
same thing apply not just to your saved
passwords but to your plugins as well it
can if the developer has the I guess
weird-ass these try a crypto but and
it's really easy but unfortunately both
male hope and this other program that I
found
that's GPG anthem president my milk
crypt doesn't take advantage of that so
they actually store your amazing private
keys in clear text encrypted
so well on people like database so while
the open PGP Jas library that both of
these use is sound it's the way that
they're implementing it and doing the
storage in what your browser cache is
that what you're saying sort of it
stores it in the secret like databases
that make up the extensions and and the
rest of Chrome so if if for whatever
reason in chrome has access to those you
know extensions so does every other
website that you allow to right so
what's the vulnerability here like you
could own my machine and then well I
still need a unit you would need my
password to get my private key right
right right so if I owned the box
I can I can pull that password out or
that private key out
the problem with male hope and my male
crypt is that it stores it in clear text
right so any other user that has access
to this directory on your box can also
get those things whereas if it was
encrypted with the per user they
couldn't do that all right you want to
walk me through how do we get how do we
use this exploit to our advantage for
legitimate reasons of course sure so
let's just start off by sharing my
desktop and showing you yep I got it
right here go ahead and I'm gonna show
you just what I mean so if you can see
in Melville oh and both my mail crypt
extension yeah can you uh can you
increase the control plus for us so we
can see yeah there we go
okay yes you can see that I have two
keys in here and that's my public and
private key and in this one I have a key
for this mail no crypt it only shows you
basic it'll say all right so you can see
I have in both of those the keys right
right I open up sequel
like database browser which is just a
free app I found online you can open a
database go to this directory the users
and that's my user user app data local
Google Chrome user data default all this
other stuff local store you got yeah if
you find the extension name and they
randomized the extension names which is
good because it makes it harder to
specify automated tools and stuff but if
you find the extension name for these
these extensions you open up the secret
light database go browse data it and
look it there oh my god it's just a
table called private key and there's the
PGP private key block that's in plain
text so I mean you know it's in a sequel
Lite but it's still plain text right so
as soon as I saw this I was aghast and
was like oh I have to write a Metasploit
module and luckily enough there was
already a MSF or a medicine wheel onto a
post module with the dead it Union
Chrome okay it's the one that pulls out
the the passwords and and cookie data
and all that for Chrome already so what
I did is extend it basically to also
look for my mail crypt and mail the load
and then pull out the private keys for
that so when I take a look at that let's
uh can you increase the font here on
your Metasploit console so they can see
what you're doing yes thank you I'm just
gonna start a handler and I highly
suggest you don't run handlers it's four
four four four if you don't want to get
caught I just
but just for a binary yeah just just run
evil let's just imagine we're already on
yeah this is this is just example of
like we're at where we've exploited the
machine the browser exploit or whatever
and we are in just session in this si
one
we can see that we're executing to get
mV
and so we're executing as the user right
now yep great on target one user that's
Caesar my username is user so that's
kind of confusing but it so there's on
first so I'm going to background this
and just show you how to use the post on
Joel so the post Manzo's you can use
inside of the meterpreter context or not
but for this record I go inside or
outside of it so use post windows gather
in chrome and the only options here is
just the session ID we set session and
the session has one now that my great
feature allows you to have meterpreter
Auto migrate into processes were that
users executing so if you do a PS exec
module and you're executing and you're
currently system you can save migrate
true or do it manually and it will
migrate into a process for that user and
then you'll be able to decrypt passwords
and stuff so as long as you are running
as that user you have access to that
users data correct that's it so we just
say run and you say it's first thing the
user it's getting all this fun stuff so
here's the part that I added I say
simpson's installed it shows you all of
the extensions installed shows my mail
or but yeah my mail cryptid mail globe
and we have found mail flow extension
extracting PHP keys downloading to you
know the loop directory my private keys
public keys downloaded all of those
here's the rest of the extensions
decrypted all the data so if I am a guy
passwords whatever who was done so I
open up the loop directory open up the
mail little buns and it's just storing
the name of it and there's a public key
and there's your private key that's it
you've got it easy easy that's jelastic
what concerns me the most is wow this is
I have to be actually executing code on
your box I am not 100% sure on the
security of of what a browser or a
website has to do to getting to get
access to the extensions data right
since these are actually these
extensions are executing right under
their own context I'm curious if any of
the viewers out there know if there's
any security boundaries between
extensions and websites because the
extensions have access to the website
dude I'm just curious right so it so
it's kind of a question of like you know
say on Android each application is run
as its own user does the same thing
apply to Chrome when it comes to those
extensions since they are sharing that
cache you know in this case to store
your private key cuz it has to be
somewhere unless you're going to
remember that whole thing and type it in
every time that's not gonna happen
yeah wow that's fantastic well hopefully
we see some changes in the these
extensions because I believe that they
really do a great job of bringing you
know strong security to you know a wider
audience and making it a little bit more
convenient if you are gonna go ahead and
do the the webmail route which you know
it's just too convenient and easy not to
yeah that is really freaking cool Rob
you have so much stuff going on right
now exploits like these they're all
being published like tell me about room
362 what's going on over there right now
um so actually just today and whenever
the stairs probably previous this is a
Friday so I just published a way for to
use maybe cats alpha and so Benjamin
Dell flea the guy who writes maybe cats
released an alpha version that's
amazingly epic what it does is it takes
a process memory dump it takes that
memory dump and I'll just stop sharing
so
take some memory dump of LSS and you can
use that you can get that via Microsoft
tool so you use a Microsoft tool to dump
LSS you didn't take that else ass
process down to your own Windows box and
you dump all of the clear text passwords
that from all of the users on that row
host so you are your you know password
dumping and remote host with using a
Microsoft tool I think it's just epic I
love that well I mean you know these
tools can be used for good or bad that's
the whole point of beuter security and
all of that I love it
thank you so much Rob it's so good to
see you I'm glad we were able to get you
any on here on the go to meeting you're
welcome anytime because you know people
just love the stuff you're doing with
Metasploit in fact aren't you doing more
stuff with Metasploit and egypt yeah so
thanks for the intro at blackhat this
year we municipal mastery it is a go we
first debuted at derbycon and we moved
to the big show we're still doing it
there we can't just not this year
so at blackhat USA 2013 Vegas we have

mastery so sign up come out and there's
links on the website and you can find
stuff there in and we're actually pretty
close to being full so hurry up Wow get
in on that because if you've ever wanted
to master Metasploit you want to master
it with mu bik's try saying that five
steps the Egypt's the primary developer
for Metasploit so like the two guys who
kind of work on at the most low the team
worked on the mo so one guy that works
out nice this is awesome well I can't
wait to see you in Vegas at blackhat at
besides at Def Con it's gonna be good
