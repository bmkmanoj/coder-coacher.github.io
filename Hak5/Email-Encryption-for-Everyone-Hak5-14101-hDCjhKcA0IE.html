your email the easy way then backing up
your Gmail account using your Alou to PC
plus text messaging your Wi-Fi pineapple
all that and more this time on hack five
the segment of hack five is brought to
you by domain.com hello welcome to hack
five my name is darren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse and there's your weekly
dose of Technol us and this time on the
show I'm very excited we are going to
get into encrypting your email the easy
way and we're going to be backing up all
of your emails to your hard drive it's
an email episode all about the emails I
love that you never know there might be
an apocalypse and you might just want
your emails like on your hard drive I
see what you did there an apocalypse
epochal acute walls alright I totally
said long RL all right well we're gonna
learn how to encrypt all the emails so
here's the thing a lot of the times here
on act 5 we go really in depth for a
weeks at a time on a complex subject
like we did with SSH exploring every
nook and cranny that's not this segment
no today we're taking a high-level
approach a practical approach to email
encryption this here this is the segment
you send all your friends your techie or
not that you want to be using strong
encryption in their email that's good we
have been meaning to do this segment for
so long we just never have well and it's
one of those things where we've been
meaning to do it and I still want to get
into a lot of the differences between
open PGP or GnuPG and open PGP and all
of the different cool things that you
can do in Linux with Thunderbird and
enigmail whatever but this isn't this
episode no this is like you know if
we're going to get into a whole you know
crypto anarchy series we should just
start off by getting everybody using
using encryption in their email awesome
and there's many reasons why so a little
bit of backstory nothing too complicated
here basically in 1991 this cool guy by
the name of Phil Zimmerman created PGP
or pretty good privacy and it's a
program for encrypting and decrypting
text email files
even your old hard drive I love how it's
really actually stands for pretty good
privacy that's the thing about
corruption is it's pretty good
keep in mind encryption is only you know
encryption can always be broken yeah
through cryptanalysis and all of those
things and the reason that we use
encryption is to keep it private
now yeah now the things that we
encrypted ten years ago we can easily
break today and things that we encrypt
today will easily be able to break in
ten years so there's no bullet proof
solution when it comes to that it's
always biding time but that's okay
because everything is recorded
everything is monitored and everything
will be broken in ten years and that's
what the NSA and all of these other
people do and good on them right now for
today
let's encrypt all the things yeah let's
do it all right what I've been needing
to do this to my email anyway so all
right well I'm going to show you guys
how to set this up in your email the
easy way
PGP uses various methods of encrypt
encryption and one of them in particular
that we're interested in we've talked
about in the past is called public key
cryptography now rather than simply
having a single password that's used to
both encrypt and decrypt our data we're
actually going to use a combination of
what's called a public key and a private
key and the idea basically boils down to
this the public key is used to encrypt
the message and we can freely give that
key out to anyone so if I want Shannon
to be able to send me encrypted messages
I just give her my public key if I want
the entire hak5 audience to send me a
encrypted messages here's my mmm yeah it
is my public key to speak public key you
give everyone the public key the private
key is what you use to decrypt the
messages and that you store securely on
your own computer and nobody sees that
one nobody sees that one right right
okay
now on Linux there's lots of different
ways to set this up you can use GNU
or GPG as it's sometimes known as it's a
open PGP compliant open source tool you
can use it in combination with a program
called enigmail it's a plug-in for
Thunderbird and you can use this
protocol called IMAP to download your
email and here's the thing the world has
changed
we all
a lot of us rely on webmail it's not a
very easy solution and while we are
going to get into that this segment is
all about setting up email encryption
the easy way and so for that we're going
to rely on an awesome technology called
open PGP Jas awesome so open PGP Jas is
basically a JavaScript implementation of
PGP or pretty good privacy and it allows
really cool web developers to add this
as a library into their code so that you
don't have to think about installing any
software you know as as more and more
applicants become applications yeah this
is really cool because it means that you
know it doesn't matter if you're on a
Windows machine a Mac a Linux box a
Chromebook that's awesome you can run
and use it with anything yeah you can
use it in a web browser and so is the
web browser becomes more and more our OS
yeah
this is an awesome alternative to that
great and it is used by a really cool
tool called mail envelope and Mill loop
is a plug-in for Chrome or Firefox that
allows you to do this kind of awesome
encryption that we're talking about here
right there in your Gmail in Yahoo Mail
in Outlook calm or in gmx okay should I
should I get this now you absolutely
should go over to mail Veloz
the plugin so you're in Chrome or
Firefox I'm in Chrome okay well you're
in Chrome so you go ahead and well we're
getting into this you should download
that just click over to the Chrome
extension and it'll take you to the Play
Store nothing less yeah in wrist or you
know clickety-click I'm the extension
and click Add and Bob's your uncle there
you go sweet and so now just go over to
your Gmail and hit f5 or refresh your
Gmail because gmail is what you use and
there we go so as your Gmail loads let
me get into the reason why or one of the
reasons of why this is important if
you're in the United States you probably
know about the ECPA
or the electronics communications
Privacy Act and it's an act that states
that email stored on a third party
server for more than
180 days is considered by the law to be
abandoned think about this think about
the email in your inbox in your Gmail
right now the years of history that you
have in your Gmail and think about the
fact that the government considers
anything over 180 days abandoned and
what that means is that all that's
required to obtain the contents of those
emails by any law enforcement agency is
literally a written statement certifying
that the information is relevant to an
investigation that's scary I have things
like you know domain name registrars in
there I got old signups from different
websites that I refer back to all the
time I have my whole life since 2005 in
jail for better or worse tax everything
yeah and there's absolutely no judicial
review on this kind of stuff there's no
need for a warrant nothing you know ECPA
was written in the 80s and a lot has
changed since then even just like in the
last ten years we used to you know use
our Internet service providers email and
we would set up like you know I remember
you Dora or Pegasus or or Microsoft
Outlook or Outlook Express and you would
like click send and receive and it would
download your email from their servers
and your email would live on your
computer but that's just not the way
things work anymore with the cloud for
better or worse the cloud while it
provides us all of that cool stuff where
we can get access to our email or other
applications our documents with like
Google Drive for instance anywhere it
comes with a caveat that we no longer
own that information so let's take back
some of that ownership let's encrypt all
the things and and use this technology
that has been totally proven this is the
same stuff that is being used by
activists as well as the NSA so it was
good enough for them it should be good
enough for us right yeah let's do it
all right so let's walk you through
getting set up so you've already
installed the plugin right yes okay well
I have the plug-in installed on mine as
well so I'm going to walk you through
your first time setup so you should see
an icon now in the top right yep called
mail globe click that and go to options
and the very first time we see this
we're looking at our keyring right so
our key ring is
like I said you know if you like all the
public keys that you get from people yes
if you have my public key that means you
can encrypt a message and send it to me
yeah and if I have your public key I can
encrypt a message and send it to you
yeah so this is your keyring if I go
into mine for instance I can see I have
here you know mine as well as Sebastian
right and I have a bunch of others but
this is just for an example I don't want
to show everybody that I talked to you
but basically I have to set up here on
this machine and we can import as many
as we'd like but you need to create one
because you're new to it I don't have
one and there's many ways to create this
we could actually create this with any
open PGP compliant program right we
could go to the command line since
you're here in Linux and we can use GPG
and a bunch of other cool tools to
securely generate one but being that
this is all about ease of use and just
getting everybody on the same page here
in this web app let's do it the web app
style no command line no command line I
love done this time alright so let's go
over here and click generate generate
key all right and so the first time
you're gonna go ahead and give your name
so I'll just name it Shannon Morse and
then your email address and then click
advanced advanced time so you've got the
option for an RSA key click that drop
down and you can also do a DSA key let's
just stay with the RSA for right now and
for your key size choose the highest
that is possible 4096 okay okay and you
can even choose when this key will
expire if you only want to have it last
for a year or six months you can do that
here we'll let it never expire and now
you set up your your key phrase this is
your secure password for your encrypted
email so make it a good one what should
I make this oh I know okay I add ESP ISP
OPD iddqd have a idk FA those are all
good I'm gonna stop I'm gonna mr. pellet
sorry I don't remember all of the cheat
codes for Duke Nukem 3d but I do for
Doom do for some reason okay I think I
spelled it right all right so submit
okay so now it's generating your key and
mind you it's generating a 4096 key on
your computer
or local using javascript okay so keep
in mind that you've got an i3 yes this
is going to take them out okay so we'll
just wait for it we'll just play the
jeopardy music all right except it's
copyrighted so we won't all right Darren
it looks like my key is generated
success new key generated imported into
the king green all right now so there
you go URL said you can now send
messages except you haven't exchanged
any keys with anyone today yeah that's
the one thing about public key
encryption is you need to now give me
your public key so I can send you
encrypted messages with how do I do that
well real easy go over to your key we
should hit submit
yeah they're beginning to Goose yeah and
then scroll up here and go over to your
keyring display keys
alright see now that it shows two keys
it shows one facing up and one facing
down yes to signify that you have both a
private and a public key so what we want
to do now is email me your public key
okay so click export
I'm sorry select your key first and then
click export and say you knew you could
say send public key by email I've been
noticing an error when you do that go
ahead and click it it'll probably break
release it's been breaking on mine yeah
it does that so now I can close it so
okay there's a bug cancel oh yeah it's
it's so it's bringing up the intent for
your operating system send an email okay
so hit display display instead and
that's your public key so now anyone
watching well except they only have part
of it all right scroll down you can see
my own file where you could just copy it
to the clipboard okay so hit copy to
clipboard and now go over to eat your
Gmail okay and compose a new message
send it to you and send it to me yeah
shows up as a huge link that's
interesting
oh I know why because you sent it at the
bottom here delete all that delete your
signature
maybe that's causing it too there we go
alright cool okay and then you can say
here's my public key Mackey's too big
here's too big all right and that's work
and so you just hit Send and so now we
come over to my computer okay and I just
keep clicking there it is alright so
I've got your email with your key and
all I have to do is select this all of
this okay and I do the same thing I
click on my mail Volokh icon in the top
right i go to options and you're gonna
add it yes i select import keys okay and
you can paste as many keys as you want
to if you have a bunch of keys from your
friends you can plug them all in at the
same time it's going to ignore any
superfluous data that's in between them
so you just kind of carriage return a
few times put a little a few enters in
there and so as soon as I hit submit now
so I've just pasted this in there it's
going to see success public key and
there's a fingerprint bro Shannon Morris
has been in imported into the keyring if
I go back to display keys I now see that
you're gonna like key people that's
awesome and so you do the same thing I
emailed you right before the segment we
have my key okay so you just do the same
thing select all of that copying good
options import a key submit success
awesome so now if I go to display keys I
have yours in here hey let's grab that's
cool once he on here because I don't
have your private key as well yes one
little key so now I can send you a
private message so I'm going to do that
I'm gonna hit C just like I would in
Gmail to create a new message and I get
my regular dialog box I'm gonna send it
to Snug via Gmail and say hey Shannon
check out this secret info OMG secrets
OMG secrets and you'll notice that I
have a new floaty guy over here
I have this in the very top right this
this pen and paper and when I click this
and I get this composed message pop up
and I can go ahead and add some
additional exclamation points as you do
when sending secret messages I can tell
this is actually mail Volokh with the
these three characters here and the pink
in the top right we'll get to that in a
sec and all I have to do to encrypt it
is click this lock when I quick click
that lock I can add recipients
I choose from the drop-down and I
already have you as a recipient so I
click that and then add and then hit OK
and there we go that message has been
turned into all of this I click transfer
it goes back into here and I can hit
Send and that's all there is to it to
sending a message since we've already
exchanged key pairs you show up for me
in that drop-down because I have your
public key I can encrypt things for you
yeah and since you have my public key
you know and since you have you know
your private key that I increment with
the public key of it you've got the
private key of it so now you can decrypt
it yeah and since we've both exchanged
keys you can send a reply encrypted with
my public key and I can do the same
thing in Reverse so there's your message
and now you'll notice you're like hey
what's this new thing yeah see that just
appeared and your mouse becomes a key
refer so it's like I'm unlocking the
mail and then it will ask you for your
super secret password and
and checking that box that says remember
this password yeah no no thanks
and they're good secrets you get the
secret oh that's all there is Tracy and
so if you were to you can just saw you
know Gmail shortcut it are to reply or
however you would like to and as far as
Gmail is concerned Google doesn't know
the contents of this email what they
know is all of that gobbly gook that we
know created it password they don't have
the key
they don't have your PI private key so
as long as your private key is secure
that email is secure that's awesome and
so you do the same thing you reply back
to me they're like more secrets and so
when I reply back to you I'm Darren hak5
and I want to just say like oh do I hit
this before I make the you can do it
before or after either what happens when
you click on that that little floating
icon there on the top right is that it
transfers into a new editor uh and it's
this right here and we can finish the
message or if it's already finished you
just click that lock and you can tell
that you were in your proper thing
because you've had a semicolon pound
okay so let's get into that now
obviously you can go ahead and finish
this you click the thing and you get the
drop down just like I did before and yet
I choose you me and add now I had
already added myself so let's get into
that okay okay so there's two things to
note here now that we know how to send
encrypted emails back and forth yeah
really quick and easy and seriously that
was just about as painless yes it was
like five minutes whew
I'll mention two notes that you might
want to consider first of all under
millville opal settings huh or under
security you'll notice that you get a
custom color and custom characters I
have mine as capital o dot lowercase o
okay the rienne you have yours as pound
semicolon something else right and this
color and the reason for that is
additional security this token basically
is allow allowing you to identify that
is this is the mail loop you think it is
okay so you couldn't get fished you
couldn't get tricked into thinking
you're in
a your secure mail that's good I'm glad
they have that it's kind of like when
you log into your bank and you see the
fuzzy animal that you're supposed to see
yeah or the AH flowers or whatever it is
um the sparkly unicorn really don't go
with suppli pods no I go with the
sparkly unicorn okay no there you go
the other thing that you might want to
consider is under general you see here
the check box that I have always add
primary key to list of recipients the
reason that I do this and I have my
primary key set up is this one you can
have multiple keys here if you want you
could have different public and private
key pairs for different people that you
communicate with if you really like the
reason that I do this is it means that
every time I create an encrypted message
and you know you get that drop down of
like who do you want to be able to
unencrypted this yes I am always a
recipient you can have as many people as
you want in a list hey a people that are
able to decrypt it with the private keys
I always use myself because what this
means is if I ever wanted to come back
to this email thread because my new
gmail only sees that garbage yeah if in
a year from now I want to come back to
that message I can see what I wrote not
just what you're right okay let's see
I'm saying yeah which is really nice now
poor see all your private encrypted
stuff that you sent to me you do now you
should probably be mindful that one this
doesn't encrypt the subject line that's
completely different however now
suddenly the subject line is so much
more important when it comes to
searching for your mail because all of
the search terms if you're used to using
Gmail or yahoo mail or any of those
search features to find things from
within your email it's not gonna find
anything within your email all its gonna
find is that garbage yeah that's cool
this is great but if you're relying on
that feature yeah yeah and that's it
that's it in a nutshell that's how you
set up and cryptic email with your
webmail and I encourage everyone to go
out and do this now set it up with their
friends share this around and hopefully
we can all encrypt all the things
whether it's baby photos or your tax
returns or whatever
all the things all of them all the
things whoo I just encrypted my email
I'm so excited I'm gonna send this to
like everybody all right well with all
of that we encourage you to hit us up
feedback at hack 5 org you can use these
keys right here
uh or if you uh if you'd like you can
comment below let us know what solution
you guys use and stay tuned because in
just a bit
Shannon's gonna be showing us how to
backup our email encrypted or otherwise
to our Ubuntu PC we'll be right back
there's some fun trivia about the
internet you guys know how to spawned
out of a Department of Defense project
but did you know that in October of 1984
an RFC proposed the first five top-level
domains govt bu comm mill and org were
on the list dotnet was it officially
mentioned but when those first five came
to fruition dotnet made its first splash
on the scene and since then it has
become the third largest top-level
domain on the web so it's no wonder why
dot nets are globally known and
instantly I inject credibility into next
project if you're considering getting
yourself a dotnet or if you already have
a dot-com consider getting a dotnet to
go with it I just did with Darrin
kitchen and without cross America or if
the domain name you one is already taken
a dotnet is the perfect alternative and
you can find your dotnet over at
domain.com
they are huge supporters of hack 5 have
been for years and they're committed to
hack across America calm or dotnet and
they want to hook you guys up with some
affordable domains without all of the
runaround dot nets are only $8.99 a year
and you can get 15% off domains and web
hosting at domain.com one use the coupon
code hak5 and whether or not you need in
need of virtual property on this awesome
internet of ours you should go ahead and
tweet at domain.com and let them know
you know just that you love them for
supporting hack 5 and hack across
America and we are so grateful to have
them here because this is really
something awesome I'm so glad that they
believe in this and you should have
domain.com and check it all out so
remember 15% off domain names at
domain.com and use the coupon code hak5
so when you think domain names think
domain.com
