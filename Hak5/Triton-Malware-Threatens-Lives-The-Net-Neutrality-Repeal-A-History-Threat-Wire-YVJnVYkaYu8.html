is infecting industrial control systems
and three men plead guilty in the mirai
botnet case all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for December 19
2017 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
our patreon is over at patreon.com slash
threat wire and that is always the best
way to support the show and will help us
reach our next goal this next goal opens
up the special Q&amp;amp;A between me and all of
the patrons plus it helps me upgrade the
set and honestly we're in dire need to
invest into new camera so I'm really
looking forward to that patreon also
reversed their new fee structure
decision which is great news if you
don't know what I'm talking about with
that just check out my previous post on
the patreon page and now on to the news
on Thursday of last week the FCC voted
3-2 to along party lines to repeal net
neutrality rules from the previous title
to isp regulations originally formed in
2015
voting in favor included Republicans
Michael O'Reilly and Brendon car along
with occupy the chairman of the FCC
voting against were Democrats Jessica
rosenworcel and minion Clayburn that
same day some Congress members called on
the FCC to cancel the vote including
senators Susan Collins and angus King of
Maine who wrote a letter to the FCC
calling for public hearings since they
voted for the repeal rules would take
effect about 60 days after published in
the Federal Register in which time many
consumer advocacy groups and Congress
members are vowing to introduce lawsuits
or legislation to block the change
Illinois Oregon Massachusetts and
Washington have all announced suits as
well now net neutrality at his core
derives from Internet freedom it's the
ability for a user to freely explore
learn express grow and mature from the
world wide web without the Big Brother
effect of an isp it's the Equality of a
website that counts not the money in the
website's pocket and whether they can
pay an ISP for faster service it's that
freedom to explore without bias based on
fees or judgment calls made by an ISP
my crime is that of curiosity and yet
this new repeal allows ISPs to choose
what they deem worthy of our view at
least that's what they'll be permitted
to do we go back to times before 2015
when in 2007 for example Comcast was
interfering with BitTorrent packets and
they were allowed to because the FCC
could not discipline an information
service plus we have other ISPs such as
Madison River and Telus blocking VoIP
calls in their competition back in 2005
AT&amp;amp;T blocked Skype and Google Voice on
iPhones back in 2007 to 2009 and Verizon
was caught blocking tethering apps in
2012 just to name a few
you know alright just to name a few then
we also have ISPs stating in quotes that
title 2 regulation has not hurt them or
their growth as ISPs and the fact that
millions and millions of people were
impersonated on the FCC comment database
over the summer oh and let's not forget
there is the whole thing with Comcast
deleting their pledge about promising
not to do paid prioritization the same
day the repeal was announced now
admittedly none of us know the future
nor are we psychics but we can look back
at history to educate ourselves on what
has happened in the past to move forward
towards positive upgrades from the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which
made common carriers sell access to
networks in a non-discriminatory way to
the Supreme Court's 2005 decision on
ISPs allowing them to block rivals from
their lines or charge more to the 2015
title to net neutrality regulations and
now the repeal of 2017 we have seen a
lot of back-and-forth of ISPs and we
will probably continue to see that in
the future now since the core of threat
wire starts with security privacy and
Internet freedom you can probably make a
consensus on where I stand on the
subject with that said even with the
decepticon bots making the same slurs in
the comments and the lack of historical
evidence that we have seen flying about
I will definitely continue to share my
concerns on the future of our Internet
freedom whether you like it or not
on the same day as the net neutrality
repeal vote fire I disclosed on their
website information regarding malware
that targets industrial control systems
or ICS for short dubbed triton or trisys
fire i believes that this malware could
be built to cause physical damage or
inadvertently shut down operations
it is built similarly to Stuxnet which
in 2010 was used to attack Iranian
uranium enrichment plants Triton attacks
equipment built by Schneider Electric
which is used in oil and gas facilities
as well as some nuclear in manufacturing
plants these components called tri
conics safety instrumented system
controllers or sis for short are used to
alert humans of dangerous problems in
the facility by triggering alerts or
shutdowns if tampered with the SIS could
fail to shut down or send out alarms
which could lead to disastrous
consequences for the people the plant
and nearby areas fire I discovered the
malware when a plant they were working
with had a mysterious shutdown of their
sis controller at which point the plant
entered a failsafe mode and everything
shut down appropriately the malware was
traced back to a Windows PC on an sis
engineering workstation where it was
pretending to be the real application
fireEye's suspects that this is the work
of a nation-state actor not a cybercrime
group of hackers due to the fact that
try conics sis tools are not publicly
documented and according to Drago
security firm the malware was
distributed on one victim's machine in
the Middle East though the exact
location and victim is unknown three
young men ages 20 to 21 pleaded guilty
in regards to creating and operating the
Mirai botnet which was used back in
October of 2016 to take control of
security cameras DVRs and other IOT
devices which in turn attacked dine
which is a service employed by sites to
manage DNS thereby taking down several
different popular websites in a
distributed attack the men named Paris
JA Dalton Norman in Hosea white pleaded
guilty to conspiracy to violate the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the FBI
explained that while they were not
responsible for the actual attack they
did create and operate the botnet the
men released Murai to pub
like forums and they sold it to
criminals online and they also pleaded
guilty in regards to another botnet
called click-fraud which grossed 100
Bitcoin and profits for the three they
will each serve up to 5 years in prison
and fines of two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars they also had to turn
over several bitcoins each to the US
government ja also faces another ten
years and another 250 thousand dollars
on top of that for involvement in using
me right to take down a New Jersey
University servers the criminals were
first outed by security journalist Brian
Krebs way back in January when his site
was taken down by the biggest DDoS
attack ever reported which just so
happened to be Mirai the Justice
Department released a statement
regarding the three men on the 13th
