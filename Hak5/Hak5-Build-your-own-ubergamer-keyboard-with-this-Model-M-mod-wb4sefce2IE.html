segment this time around I'm gonna give
the case a break and I'm gonna catch my
keyboard up now what I've got here is an
IBM M series keyboard made in 1987 these
were great keyboards at the time and
they still are actually they've got
great tactile response I mean these keys
are real springy and the cord for it is
eight miles long and detachable plus
stretchy anyway I'm gonna give it the
same treatment that I gave the case it's
gonna be all black with some red accents
the pinstripe and the logo starting off
I've gone ahead and pop most of the keys
off out of and most of those are
actually just caps anyway so it's no big
deal and I've sanded them down rubbed
them off with alcohol got them prepped
and ready for painting and I've also
taken the keyboard apart says that's
gonna get painted just set this aside
make sure you take good care of and
we're going to clean up the back as well
now here's the thing where we're gonna
do it is gonna save you about sixty
dollars because we're gonna make our own
das keyboard in the same stroke no
characters on it whatsoever so this way
you know it's fairly inexpensive and
this keyboard will be for the true elite
hacker let's get started alright we're
back in the backyard again getting ready
to do some more painting I've already
got everything gathered up that I need
so let's get right down to it first
things first is I need to paint the main
body itself I'm gonna paint this black
and I've taped off everything that I
wish to save so let's get to it
all right so while the top half of the
body drives I'm gonna go ahead and do
the bottom half and if you look here we
are even taping off the birth
certificate for this thing you know the
date of manufacture so it'll keep its
authenticity
let's get back to painting all right so
now that I've got the whole body painted
black I'm gonna go ahead and start
painting the keys all my gray keys are
gonna be black and all my alpha numerics
are gonna be red and I might change that
up a little bit later on so let's go
ahead mask up and start painting these
up all right everything's all painted up
the keys are drying right now and I'm
gonna go ahead and logo this thing up
and pinstripe it now I got these cool
little paint pens to do this with it's
really good for small detail work that
I'm about to do and inexpensive so start
off with the red on the pinstripe and
just be real easy with it probably take
you a couple of times to get the effect
that you want
all right well my pinstripe drawers I'm
gonna go ahead and do my stencil work
now and same thing I've got more paint
pens and it's just gonna be the same
principle as it was before just paint it
in all right everything's just about
finished up I've just gotta do my last a
little bit of red on the logo itself and
then we can just go ahead and slam this
thing all back together and show you the
finished product
hey we're back here at the lab we've got
everything put back together it's
working the way it's supposed to and if
you look here we've set aside wasd right
here painted on black that's for you
gamers out there so you can find your
movement controls very easily and also
it's a shout out to our friends at WISD
TV who unfortunately had to suffer
through Katrina so our thoughts and
prayers go out to them any right here we
even have the hack point 5 logo custom
painted on there as well to match the
case so all in all you have a custom
painted keyboard super-elite
matches your own personal colour scheme
on your case and if you have any
questions about this series em keyboard
