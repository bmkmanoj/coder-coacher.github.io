DEFCON 25 all that and more this time on
hack five hello and welcome to this
week's episode of hack 5 something yes
your weekly dose of techno lest my name
is your name is Darren kitchen it is my
name is Shannon Morse and then we are
you still getting into the hang of it
being back in the studio you got sent to
like the casing the stock blogs blogs so
did you see the pineapple on cases like
Syria like what's going around I'm
curious about that you all should tweet
him and be like why do you have a
pineapple sticker and why am i echoing
with you why are we not skateboarding
with you Regulus I don't know it was
Casey missed it it's a tuber he does
YouTube's right yeah okay it was a weird
I know I follow youtubers dude for the
longest time to be like oh cool you guys
like youtubers and I'm like I felt like
somebody called me a youtuber at Def Con
right I was like I've been doing this
it's before YouTube was a thing that's
why I was like with podcast actually no
I haven't read eights hack five by two
months
does it really but you guys weren't on
YouTube we drained YouTube in September
okay months after hacks I've started in
2000 got it okay but hack five predates
the iPhone the color iPod and a few
other things yeah I was so old school I
know I feel old
you know I was thinking I'm Lea old
you're actually pretty decrepit really
yeah it's really and and interviews
before I get killed I'm over here at
DEFCON 25 with Megan from the packet
hacking village you're actually doing a
really interesting talk that's all about
diversity in the hacker community and
for me that's something that's really
important I've been trying to do the
same thing for outreach for women so
thank you for being on the show for
stuff but what is your specific and
details that you're trying to get out
there for the community so I'm
specifically focusing on neurodiversity
and getting people with high-functioning
autism and anxiety depression or any
sorts of disorders into the field of
cybersecurity and I see
in general because I feel that they're a
good diverse group of people and have a
special set of skills that other
individuals may not have so they're
valuable resource for the cybersecurity
industry
can you explain what neurodiversity is
and by the way I love your shirt is so
cute
neurodiversity is just basically a broad
term that covers anyone with
neurological disorders who typically
think differently behave differently so
it can be anything from anxiety to
bipolar disorder to autism
yeah totally so can you give me examples
of like any kind of experiences that
somebody with some kind of neuro
difference I guess would experience in
this kind of community yeah so it's not
so the thing is we've so I have
Asperger's syndrome so this talk comes
out of my experience but it's just
simple things like we behave differently
and the way our brain processes
situations is very different so
sometimes we need neurotypical people
people without neurodiverse neuro
disorders to interact with us slightly
differently and be a bit more clear with
statements so okay so not like broad
vague stuff but actually being like very
detailed about like x locations okay I
think I make those kind of mistakes all
the time and I think some of it comes
from my own ignorance like I didn't know
that was an issue but could you give me
like a good example of how I could do
better with that yeah so this is
actually this arose from a situation
with my manager where I was getting kind
of frustrated and I've been told like oh
bring up the stuff later when I'm less
busy and so that it really stresses me
out because like just because of how I
don't understand that communication
subtleties like I didn't know what less
busy' was and I knew I don't understand
things as well so it's kind of like
Louis I bring up in two hours is you're
going to start getting frustrated
because I bring out too soon stuff like
that so we discussed day we said okay
let's be more specific say can you bring
this up in two hours kay bring this up
in a month because I don't really care
about waiting
things but I show a frustration so then
he thinks I'm sometimes people will
think like oh I'm impatient and I want
to I need to talk to him right now but
really it's just I don't understand
when that time should be so yeah totally
and it's your job so of course you want
to do a good job you don't want to give
yourself anxiety you don't want to take
off your manager so I'm sure that's
going to cause issues for yourself so
what can hiring managers do to make sure
that they are being diverse and they're
hiring and they're not having any kind
of like unconscious bias because I'm
sure that comes up yeah so there's a lot
of unconscious bias and you know a lot
of stigmas surrounding things like
autism so specifically speaking on
high-functioning autism and Asperger's
but I mean it's like any other sort of
diversity don't base your decisions on
that and you have to understand that
because these neurotypical die OSHA
disorders off often have behavioral
things so like somebody who's like
really anxious or maybe they're not
communicating very well in an interview
that's one of the main reasons is that
people don't interview well when they
have these disorders and that's one of
the biggest downfalls and interviews as
people I oh this this person can't
interact with people but it's just
anxiety to is like that so there any
synergies there going to be have poor
communication skills but hopefully I you
just have to take that into account that
just because somebody is Nike and maybe
behaves differently during an interview
it doesn't mean that they don't have the
skills to succeed in the job totally so
neuro people with that have medical
neuro disorders are there specific
things that they can really like shine
in with InfoSec yeah so my talk goes
over a lot of this a lot of skills but
especially with high-functioning autism
what I'm focusing on is it's very
logical a lot of hyper focus and so then
also there's yes detail-oriented and
everything so it's kind of got that
right mindset for tech field so
Microsoft and s AP and a bunch of other
tech companies have autism at work
programs because they have realized like
how good these people are especially
like quality assurance soft
we're testers and stuff like that so
it's there's a lot of those little
skills that they see that also when
people find into when these individuals
find an interest in something it's not
just a hobby or something they get
really updated I guess obsessive in a
way but that can be a benefit for you as
a manager if you need if this person
gets really into network forensics like
encourage them to pursue that and they
can get really passionate and and learn
anything so they're getting an expert in
a field that they're interested in so I
think for a hiring manager is it would
obviously make sense for them to not
just think about the social skills but
think about the technical skills as well
what about after somebody gets hired
into a commute into a career like is
there anything that the job should focus
on to make sure that they're comfortable
in their jobs I mean at the start it's a
lot of patience and understanding so I
just kind of jumped into cybersecurity a
year ago no experience in whatever and
it was my first full-time job so
especially since in an individuals first
time job it's not just a learning
experience for the manager working this
individual it's a very large learning
experience for the individual because
they don't know how to work in a
full-time environment so it's good I'd
say it coming up on a year I've got I
think I had you I guess you'd have to
ask my manager but I've improved a lot
inside those areas where at the
beginning I was clearly not strong in
but it's a lot of patience and you need
to I try and once every few months have
one-on-one conversations with my manager
and say what am i doing poorly because
there's some stuff I don't even know I'm
doing and so having just like at half an
hour lunch with a manager and say okay
what are you seeing that I need to
improve in which in theory every
employee should do that but especially
for a manager with a neurodiverse
employee is a lot of communications
patience understanding and discussing
with the employee what they can do
because I don't want to lose my job I'm
going to I'm going to take into account
every piece of advice to succeed and not
be fired for something stupid I didn't
even realize I was doing so so it's a
learning experience and you just got to
work with them and they will learn but
it's just going to take a little bit
time now I know out there in our
community we've had
people email us and say like hey I have
Asperger's or I haven't I have
depression or whatever it might be
can you give them any kind of resources
or any kind of ideas on how they can
really grow in their own careers and
things that they might be able to help
with so a lot of times I think that
among the community is kind of like when
you're going for these jobs and or more
after you're hired you kind of try to
not tell people and maybe that's good
for some individuals but what I found is
every time a new employee is it comes in
I kind of ping them privately and say
like hey just FYI I do have this
condition and I sometimes behave
differently
so if I ever do anything that offends
you or noisy you gotta let me know but
kind of like having that awareness in
working with others to make sure that
everyone knows the situation because if
I if I hadn't told anyone I kind of feel
like say what the guy was annoying or
rude or something over time but now they
can just be like hey by the way you're
doing this you probably shouldn't do
that so yes and where you're coming from
I kind of experienced the same thing
like women and technology the more you
speak out about it the more we make
society aware of those issues and the
more diverse we can become and that
definitely helps communities and careers
grow especially companies too because it
allows them to focus on much more than
just oh the majority because they could
profit Hey profits focus on the
minorities as well
is there anything that we didn't cover
that you would like to mention now I
think Rogan where can people go if they
want to learn more about you or about
your talk so you can check out well I
guess the talk will be over but being
recorded and so if you look at the wall
of sheep website eventually it will be
posted there then also you can feel free
to direct message me on twitter at
meghan rowdy and hit me up find out what
you want announcer thank you so much
making it with such a pleasure to talk
to you
free free free with purchase you get a
shopping bag blog helping you to joke is
awesome get it like that
nobody's been praying what my slave in
my channel is local just on hello from
deaf guys Vegas us but deaf songs
awesome thank you kind of a cellphone
Bob because it so offensive yoke I don't
write here at Def Con 25 I'm learning
all about detecting GPS spoofing with
David Robinson for Zedeck security how
are you David Wright yeah cretin yeah so
you've been doing a lot of research
lately on GPS spoofing and you've just
released a new tool to your repertory
tool set of GPS spoofing systems tell me
about your latest yeah so I fluff
relates to new tool and suite which is
limas such and that was looking at the
certainly material data that was
traveling from the GPS you see that down
to an NTP server and was detecting that
when someone was actually sort of cut
the wire was trying to pop bad serial
data down the wire so from the antenna
on the roof down to the NTP server and
narek and it was detecting that so when
someone to do that you could possibly
get some protection for it cool okay so
let's break that down so we make sure
that we understand this GPS you're not
talking about GPS signals here you're
actually talking about the NEMA protocol
which is coming from the receiver yes
it's a serial data fear from the
receiver once they're safe let's process
the GPS signal and it will send some
cereal down the wire down to your NTP
server and then from the entity D will
pick it up and turn it into time so why
would a you know data center use GPS to
feed in time to their NPT their network
Time Protocol daemon as opposed to just
getting it from the web will this little
trick Isis is the idiot
works where you try and sever all the
links to the internet so you tap your
time from the interview in that case and
in other cases in the serial data
there's also a pulse for second signal
and that has a very accurate indicator
of winner second stats and that's much
more accurate than what you'd ever get
from the net so that pulse again that
goes high it's a little signal wire
that's hard to start up second and blow
after point right over second stage low
for the ristic and it's very high and
that can give you sort of micro nano
second accuracy while the NEEMO or the
NTP s most probably only get you into
the millisecond accuracy so when your
arms of high performance things like
finance and telecommunications the
energy we want a very accurate start of
a second the pulse per second from the
NEMA and the GPS receiver was actually
very beneficial on that case ok and so
what would in those cases be the the
threat if the time is off and and is it
about it being off by microseconds or
you know what are some of the other
risks associated with it being off much
more one time I looked at when the
actually moving time backwards was you
got Tom bass one-time passwords like
Google or every 30 seconds you hear a
new code
hey it time I saw shouldn't bear to read
the code because times moves on in an
earlier talk I managed to move time
backwards using targets which was when I
was spoofing the GPS signal and I said
move time backwards slowly in steps
because he moved back in one big jump in
TDD would crash but he moved at bases of
five minute increments you could
actually move time backwards and in that
case I could reuse a time-based one-time
password and that basically was because
either they had bad defaults that they
didn't have that don't reuse flag
enabled or they had very end when you're
sittin up they didn't actually have a
default but it gave you a not
particularly good description about what
the city actually was so in that case
you know we were I was using the lead
Panther SSH logins and I said move time
backwards I could reuse it because
the prompt for the user one decision
that didn't actually have a default and
wasn't particularly clear there are some
other some of the other add-ons is due
to fall correctly and looked at some of
the libraries some of them actually have
the function that says don't reuse some
other libraries for other languages
don't ever don't actually have the their
the verify function but they don't hit
the verify worth and don't reuse
function at all so those libraries can
actually detect this and there was just
assume times I never going to move
forward and not backward so you can
imagine that as a developer you can
pretty much assume that the system is
going to know what time it is and that's
not your responsibility so I'm really
surprised to hear that you're able to
you know convince NTP that it was a
previous time what kind of response have
you seen from the industry since you
released that information um not much
just because it's sort of that's quite a
corner case GPS spoofing channel I
haven't actually heard or actually seen
many real cases of it happening this I
mean there is some of we do look at the
GPS spoofing when we had drone which
Iran crashed back in 2011 and then the
license 2012 or 2013 when some
researchers stared a ship off course but
from that Levin it should see much
public GPS spoofing actual instances so
rather than you know fix it on on the
software side word like the system knows
what time it is you're focusing on
telling whether or not the signals
coming in are legit and and seeing if
they're spoofed yet so the GPS snitch
toll which I developed was it would look
at initially if you had an external time
source it could actually correspond to
had times moved out too much something's
must go wrong the GPS I should alert and
also looking at the signal strengths
that when a satellites over here does so
many much stronger when it's down at
horizon it's going to be a lot less
strong and when you are using most
software-defined radio to actually do
the GPS both in broadcast it's going to
be the strengths are going to have that
so much range and it's going to be much
really much stronger so it's why I just
hit that one way then I thought of
looking but
actually look yet as I'm set up some
directional antennas and actually try
and see whether hey the signals only
come in from one direction and I think
some of the there are some professional
sort of really expensive enterprise type
things and I'm looking at some of that
but haven't seen anything down them sort
of the space that people can share
implement it or work on it yes that's
really that's really fascinating sisters
you know pramatta standpoint being able
to use the GPS snitch tools to tell if a
signal is is legit or not just by using
what I'm assuming an off-the-shelf
receiver not some extravagant
software-defined radio with an array of
antennas and such yeah so on that GPS
not China I could run on Russ replay
with a GPS receiver from Adafruit and
antenna and that was teeming of the
serial data or the USB or serial and I
could you know I could get the data I
needed from that it provided you know
the satellite strength data and the time
and all the damage of a GPS snatch that
it could actually detect when as
spoofing this when I just headed out the
window so by using that you lower the
expense a lot it sounds like but you're
also relying on the signals that you're
receiving from the GPS receiver and
having to make your decisions on the
accuracy of the signals that you're
receiving from essentially a black box
it sounds like the the big difference
between from what I'm understanding GPS
snitch versus your new tool Nima
snitches Nemo snitch is just looking at
the serial data right yeah name is such
just look at serial data so you wouldn't
even need any hardware whatsoever to
actually tell if it's things with
correctly about that's much more like
focusing that someone's tapped and
special zero was because if it's GPS
spoofing the actual GPS receiver we send
in the sentences down about the same
rate as before so and Nemo snatch is
working on sort of the rights of the
different types of Nemo sentences coming
through I'm opposed to actually looking
at the data per se but I could X much
for mixed in that look at that all the
GPS data
it's really that this is also
fascinating i I'm sure people at home
are like really keen on getting their
hands on this stuff and playing with it
for themselves Oh
is it open source can they find the code
or the documentation yeah so all the
full tools I've run along github Childre
be a link somewhere down below and the
two lawsuits if the GPS both in is also
and github which someone else developed
yeah well thanks so much David really
appreciate it cool stuff all right for
more from DEFCON 25 stay tuned to hack
five got a great idea
bring it to the web the way we do and
head over to domain comm we've got a
slick domain discovery system and an
easy checkout process so your site will
be online in no time and the domain con
guys have been supporting hack five
three years and they want to celebrate
with a massive promo code use a JK jumbo
for thirty five percent off new domain
registration now through November 30th
it's a limited time offer so when you
think domain names think domain.com well
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of vac 5 but before we get going
we want you to know that we totally
appreciate everybody supporting
everybody that came up to us at Def Con
and and shook our hands and got selfies
and said hey you guys are the reason
we're in InfoSec it's just such a huge
honor being there and of course
personally to all the women that decided
to say hello to me it was amazing to
meet all of you because like you keep me
motivated doing the show because I know
it's important to you and I want to make
sure that you know we're getting our
voices heard especially since we're kind
of a minority and InfoSec so it was
really cool meeting so many women at the
convention I feel like this year
especially at Def Con I'm like yeah I
did notice that there were a lot of
ladies so it was really cool to meet so
many of you and thanks so much cuz you
really really do keep me motivated holy
I feel like we're like at the precipice
of a sea change in intersect and we'll
see where it goes hey listen we have
some really awesome stuff in the hack
shop so you should go and check out the
goodies Haq shop calm it's all of the
cool merch
stuff that we debuted at DEFCON we so
check that out also if you're not
already subscribed to our newsletter you
should definitely do that you can sign
up over at either HHH Ofcom or hack 5
org we're going to be announcing a bunch
of cool stuff including some meetups
here in the San Francisco Bay Area
yeah sure to get in on that as well as
just following us on social media that's
what you will find out first oh I'm at
oxide Aaron guess what I was nominated
for women in cyber jutsu award I don't
know which one and by the time this
posts all know if I want it or not but
you just being nominated is so cool so
thanks to cyber jusu really awesome to
be nominated you showing some
subjectivity - dude I know come - Wow
ok with that until next week i'm darren
kitchen i'm shannon
