by teen hello and welcome back to hack 5
where we discuss your comments this
week's comments the first one comes from
frozen Java he sends in this video of
his texting Wi-Fi pineapple this is a
proof-of-concept video of his texting
pineapple the goal here is to be able to
activate karma DNS spoof or whatever
from your phone's texting app so if you
are ever in a location where you can't
pull up yet SSH or the web interface you
can just look like you are having a
normal conversation with a human this is
so cool because he's able to send a text
message to his Wi-Fi pineapple saying
something like hey open the front door
or open the pod bay doors or something
pretty innocuous so I only throwing this
out there because frozen Java actually
gave me a call on my new public ting
phone if you're on the hi-5 your own
video blog you already know about the
fact my phone number is for everyone to
text me and call me can I go get some
coffee that's delicious after this but
thanks for his in Java and to anybody
that's into the Wi-Fi pineapple dev
community stuff this is a great proof of
concept and I would love to see it
developed more out and to say like a
module yeah because that would be
awesome I love the idea of texting you
pineapple and having it text you back
very cool that's so sweet
next up is tea man he says my question
is what router or routers do you guys
use in your network setup is it just a
Linksys or a custom Linux box I was
inspired by the high performance router
episodes and built my own custom
wireless router out of an HP Pavilion
dv6 thousand series laptop i installed
freebsd on it configured it and it's the
best Wi-Fi router I've ever had the
specs of the box are a dual cool dual
core AMD torreón 64-bit processor with 2
gigs ddr2 memory and an atheros AR 2425
BG network card well keep up the awesome
wonderful work you can't go wrong with
anything at the Aerospace nior what did
you say 24:25 we've done in fact I
believe that was the chipset of no it
was an air 23 31 but anyway yeah if you
go with an atheras chipset you can hook
it up with hostapd and turn like an old
laptop or or
really any old machine you have laying
around into a wireless access point
that's right what do we use let's see
here at the office we use a smooth wall
machine because we built it years ago
you can find the segment on hack 5 when
we built it and it has been running rock
solid since Wow
personally a long time ago that's them
at home I have an Acer Aspire 1830 T
just like you have with a broken screen
so I brought it back to life and turned
it into an untangle box that's gone so I
have that running at home now it's tied
in to unfortunately I have DSL at home I
don't have much of a choice yeah so
thank you Paul for picking me up a new
DSL modem the other day because my
d-link bit the dust so now I've got like
an action tech that's the thing that
drives me crazy about that you know I
guess I could probably put a hardware I
don't know let me know could I put a
hardware modem in there and then set it
up as pppoe so I don't have to rely on
some box from the toy store I know my
wireless router is a new Asus the Asus
BB GN AC router and then my modem is a I
want to say a Motorola surfboard right
you can see is that cable modem see you
got ya I got cable but it doesn't really
matter for me because I'm just you know
at home with my fiance and were the only
people that use it so I don't really
worry about it too much
hey as long as you're not having to
reset your router every hour yeah how
was like years and years ago with that
little blue piece of plastic I remember
that I wanted to freak that thing with a
hammer what are you guys use let us know
in the comments yes definitely now our
last comment of the week comes from Dan
he sends us this hilarious photo of
Darren that says gauntlet thrown
gauntlet picked up in a crane vlog
Darren made a Photoshop pose at the end
and this is what I came up with I have
never used GIMP before so don't judge me
too harshly what were you doing I have
no idea it's my video blog if you yeah
if you've been paying attention to the
video blog that's awesome you know about
all of the inside crazy stuff but yeah
video blogs as well as while we're
shooting we're now experimenting with
happy fun Google hangout stuff yeah we
also have a better hangout for when
we're doing now
really ultimately you need to get in on
the Google+ community or just follow us
on Twitter or on the what's it called
YouTube and then what is it called it's
called it's called vicodin and Darren's
had enough so we are the greatest
we're gonna take a quick break but when
we get back it's time for a technology
over the weekend trivia my favorite part
I want to take a quick moment to tell
you guys about ting because there's a
former phone freak I never thought I
would say this but I love this telephone
company they're bringing clarity
usability and big savings to the mobile
phone market and ultimately empowering
customers and we're plans littered with
hidden fees steep penalties arbitrary
rules and unnecessary premiums and we're
overpaying while being underserved ting
is run by the coolest geeks up in Canada
who've got frustrated with the status
quo and they've built a service on the
Sprint network to offer 4G LTE Android
phones and helpful helpful customer
service here so you just call them up
and they answer the phone and most
importantly and the reason why I've
switched over my sister my friends have
switched over is that they have fair and
honest pricing so you don't have to
worry about plans or using too much of
going over ting is different
megabytes minutes messages they're all
billed separately so if you use less
than you expected then you're credited
if you use more than you simply build
the appropriate amount there's no
penalties and premiums so check this out
hack 5.10 comm check it out you'll see
their online savings calculator and when
you're ready to get started you're going
to get $25 off most ting devices or $25
towards ting service just for being a
hack v viewer so be sure to use that URL
and also let's send them some love on
twitter @ ting FTW because they're
supporting hack 5 and hack across
America and honestly that means so much
to me check it out at hack 5 ting calm
it's time for the tech louis foot of the
week yes and it's not a photoshop to me
no it's good this is from boost from
Sweden he sends us a photo of his work
setup of his wireless link it extends
the network to a new office across the
street it's a 5 gigahertz mikrotik
bridge taped to the box it came in which
is taped to the wall there's another one
across the street in our main office
it's been working for over over
expectations and I have it pulled up
right here so you can see it oh my god
I love that so funny hello there's
something about this that like you know
brings me so much joy I don't know if
it's like my land party youth and just
like seeing like network cables
duct-taped to the ground and crazy
ducting setups through the walls and
whatnot but I love that and I hope that
that your network stays totally secure
