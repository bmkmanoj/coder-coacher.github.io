you can predict your next credit card
number what the NSA's bulk elections
come to an end and the Pirate Bay lives
on all coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for December second 2015
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
support the show directly via our
patreon at patreon com / threat wire so
that we can make more shows for you
along with an RSS feed I hope everyone
had a great holiday but it appears that
our cyber criminals didn't actually go
on vacation because there's still plenty
of news to get to first off I do want to
mention just this morning adobe has
posted an update on their siding with
flash and their new agreements with
html5 will put the link in the show
notes to that onto our first actual
story now while everyone was enjoying
their turkey leftovers on Friday another
vulnerable site was being exposed this
time it is the toy making company called
VTEC who has an online connection app
for parents and children called kids
connect practically five million parents
and 200,000 children had their data
exposed as originally reported by the
website and motherboard so what was
stolen parents and kids names email
addresses passwords secret questions and
answers IP addresses of physical
addresses chat logs photos of kids and
their parents and download history yeah
that was a lot of stuff now passwords
were stored in a one-way md5 encrypted
hash way cool actually not really
because apparently you can easily
reverse engineer that by just googling
the hash and figuring out the password
now everything else was in plain text
and no credit card data was stored on
vtec servers so that's good and all
affected users were contacted by the
company immediately after finding out
that this hack happened now VTEC has
taken several their sites offline while
they go through a security assessment of
everything that they have but let's talk
about why this happened for a quick sec
so according to troy hunt v-tex online
portals were using outdated where's
including flash
asp.net 2.0 framework which probably
should be updated to a newer version
along with vulnerable vulnerabilities
allowing for a sequel injection attacks
and no use of SSL yeah so given there
was no cryptographic encryption
happening pretty much anywhere for the
data that they were collecting except
for the really shoddy md5 password
hashing this was kind of just waiting to
happen luckily the hacker who discussed
the breach is not releasing all of the
data that was stolen but users of vtx
online platforms are well advised to
change their passwords as of Monday
November 30th are bffs at the national
security agency of the United States are
officially closing their bulk phone
record business for good or at least for
now as far as we know a statement made
by President Obama in January of 2014
stated that the NSA would no longer be
able to collect said bulk phone records
under Section 215 of the USA patriot act
and that date came about just a couple
of days ago at time of recording now the
newer USA Freedom Act now requires that
government agencies like the NSA must
file for court approval before
collecting data on individual people so
no more of that bulk stuff any data
collected will require a legitimate
reason for approval remember the Pirate
Bay hmm yeah yeah some of us do they're
still around and if you're in Sweden
they aren't going anywhere many
entertainment companies including Warner
Music and Sony Music filed a lawsuit
last year against Swedish ISPs to block
the Pirate Bay but a Stockholm district
court denied them their win stating that
Swedish ISPs are not doing anything
criminal they are simply providing an
access to an open Internet since the
ruling was made by a district court
there is still a chance that the media
companies could appeal to one of
Sweden's higher courts in the hopes of
winning until then they owe the ISPs a
hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
legal costs our last story today is all
about credit cards and a ten-dollar
device that can simulate a new
prediction attack Samy Kamkar who
recently released research done on key
fobs for cars and how easy they are to
spoof has shared information on a flaw
on American Express card numbers so it
turns out when you cancel an amex
I would say if it was stolen or you just
lost it it's relatively easy to figure
out what your next cards number will be
because their algorithm for generating
new card numbers and expiration dates is
a predictable pattern Kamkar was able to
build a small $10 device called the mag
spoof that can store those new card
numbers and send out a magnetic signal
when placed next to a point of sale
system allowing the user to spoof
swiping a magnetic stripe card that he
has predicted he has contacted amex
about this flaw but amex has claimed
that it's not a major security issue
because they have extra layers of
security to validate a user's identity
during a transaction hmm now all many
businesses have been transitioning to
chip and pin or chip and signature which
is not really necessarily all that
secure either instead of mag stripes
given how slowly the transition will
happen in the u.s. I mean for real i
just went shopping and a business has
the system but they put blue painters
tape over the chip reader so i couldn't
use it i still had to use the mag stripe
this is still a problem and it really
needs to be fixed because people still
have to use their magnetic stripes
wipers patreon.com / threat wire to
support us and a huge thanks to all
y'all that already do a big thanks to
jamie for sending us his photo of pistol
who obviously has a very classy taste in
beer and if you want to see your pet
featured on the show check out our

second episode per week rotating your
three hosts so go to patreon to see how
you can help this show grow and continue
like the show subscribe or just share
one of the episodes on facebook on your
facebook news feed all of it actually
does help go to threat wire dotnet for
all the things and with that i am
