by goto assist we also wanted it to be
unbreakable and I think we did a lot in
the the last version too for that as far
as like the reset switch but we could
take it so much further so take it away
said right so this is unbreakable before
you use the UN Apple unbreakable so
before if you really break your we got
five more slides yeah so uh before when
when you break your device you have to
use a your serial talk about that later
but we we want to make it even more
simple so we now have a in the
bootloader we have a web interface so
you can flip a switch on the device and
it boots up into the bootloader and
you'll be able to recover your software
your your firmware independently from
the device so literally it's an upload
form you upload your file and it's it's
unbreak you've got a reset you don't
need to use a cable you don't need
anything more than Ethernet cable in
your pineapple yes also please to
everyone I'm just saying stop removing
eth0 from the network stack and you
shouldn't brick it but anyway so those
people that continue to want to do that
it's there for you as well as factory
resets oh yeah absolutely so we still do
the factory resets as before we do it
now with the dip switch configuration
again so before you had to press the
button on the bottom while booting up or
after booting up now we actually have on
boots so it's a little more secure
because it happens before all the rest
of the system loads so factory sets are
better now and obviously we still have
you the serial port for all your hackers
out there and this time you don't need
to take apart your device we have it you
know front facing user facing yeah I
love that it was like you know what
serial as beautiful all those ports are
beautiful why hide them don't open the
case there's no need to open it we
actually did an unscrewing video so if
you want to see the insides check that
out it's unscrewed op it's it's
burlesque meets it's it's it's techno
last drink so mmm
so that's unbreakable right and that
actually kind of leads into the fact
that we want to make it expandable so
yes we've got user accessible serial now
which is awesome sure but we wanted to
also make it so that you can expand this
in the future since we're talking about
platform here and we said this with the
you know 93 31 with mark for this is our
LTS and with the new platform we are now
introducing what we call pineapple
slices do we name of the feature all
right so these are these slices they
they base their get an expansion bus now
they're not exactly GPO they are
something we will announce later
there'll be an SDK Teran hdk for it so
you'll be so the hardware developers
software developers will be able to get
in on this and these are pins that you
know there's a hatch you pop out the
hatch you get access to these little
pins and you connect to your heart's
desire we'll talk about that more on the
livestream later but yes stay tuned
because there is sightings awesome
potential for expansion now talking
about expansion and capabilities right
historically with the 802 211 coconut we
have had some awesome abilities to pimp
your pineapple Wi-Fi pineapple so we're
continuing with that actually Sarah can
I get the the new travel bundle shares
around was anyone else with any lis yep
what so yeah thank you we now have a new
travel bundle and so what we're doing is
we're introducing a version of the
pineapple I will in a moment with that
includes the tactical soft case as well
as and I'm very proud of this and
talking about stability of voltage and
what not a 26 to 36 hour
12 volt rechargeable battery yeah not
but we're not stopping there because
we've had always had a no leak here we
got to do with the elite kit I mean as
you guys know you know it's not a
pineapple until you stick it in a
pelican case that you run over with a
tank or toss on the roof of the building
right like we did just a blurry right
and so our new elite kit building on
again the Pelican case we're doing a
ruggedized
Pelican case with a 67 to 70 for our
battery this is the one that you will
deploy and come back days later to pick
up whatever this is we've done tests and
this is running about 90% CPU load
broadcasting the entire time we haven't
even started talking about stacking
those pineapple juices I'm instigating
at this point excuse me
and I wanted to real quick talk about
the fact that this is awesome I mean I
can't I can't begin to tell you how
proud that we all are to be designing
the new thing I new thing and and it
brings in so many awesome opportunities
to not just have you know a UPS shipping
box with you know oh yeah that was sorry
but like I have to say that wasn't great
like we had know the whole how we
shipped it that was know so something
like I don't know if I've really ever
mentioned this but I actually used to be
a graphic designer in my previous life
and and to be honest I I hang on Joyce
over here for some awesome help with
that and so what we're now able to do is
make it sexy and I don't know why but I
feel like that's important and so now it
was fun making it ship sexy with the
sexy full-color manual and all of your
firmware good everyone's seeing this and
buying one if you do definitely please
read this card we do read it don't just
now you plug in the SD card you boot it
up you wait five minutes it's the wait
five minutes yeah but please wait for
our you stickers and all of that and
then of course the mark-5 small isn't it
yeah so I'm very stoked to be you know
shipping international power supplies
and having a real you know yeah prosper
seems like a nice feel like it's good
okay so this is yeah so we saw this on
the forums at all and let me ask you
this so we've got custom packaging we
a custom board of a communication device
the whole cost bunch you want it like
like a whole bunch yeah yeah in fact
we're actually even paying a software
developer full-time to work on this
project
oops yeah might have to get rid of em um
no uh in all honesty custom
manufacturing is not cheap and we
learned a lot from the USB rubber ducky
project if any of you have got in on the
ground floor on that you understand that
it's a really scary risky awesome thing
to be doing and we wouldn't be doing
this if there weren't for the fact that
there is nothing out there like this and
so you know when we had that blank slate
and could actually throw our dreams on
the chalkboard and see what happens it
really made us warm and fuzzy but the
thing is our core values are to make it
simple you know to make it expandable
and to make it affordable and so I've
seen some comments in the forums yeah
rotting some I'm gonna give him a shout
out right here saying we'll go hopefully
under a hundred and fifty I think well
okay so here's the thing historically
and we're not going to get into the fact
that the original mark one was a hundred
and sixty dollars the the mark for
standard was ninety nine dollars right
yeah the mark five standard we're gonna
introduce at a special price of $99 yeah
the mark for Perot was 149 the mark 5
travel is 149 and the elite the elite
the mark for elite 199 take a wild guess
sub one I am absolutely the Wi-Fi
pineapple elite is 199 Prost
and so with that the last question of
course not about the last question we're
actually going to have so many more
questions and to save those questions if
you're here at the event come up to any
of the people wearing the Wi-Fi
pineapple shirt and ask them away but
the other questions are going to be you
know answered on the live stream that
we're going to be doing this Wednesday
