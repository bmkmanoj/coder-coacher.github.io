torque on San Diego and talked to don
bailey and nifty petrello about the
carmen sandiego project and why the
telephone network is full of false
privacy assumptions Stan Tendler joins
us to talk about hacking people and we
catch up with George Tillman to find out
about the end of the world all that more
on this episode of hak5 this episode of
hak5 is brought to you by introducing
the ben heck show building modding in
electronics culture with ben heck and
friends brought to you by element14
domain com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain calm
and go to assist express support smarter
with go to assist express hello and
welcome to hack five my name is darren
kitchen to see weekly dose of technol us
I've got an amazing show for you guys
this week because I'm recently back from
tour con that's right i went down to San
Diego with my favorite camera buddy mr.
tripod yeah i did a han Solo a console
oh I did a console oh I think I keep
going and I had a lot of fun just
talking to so many cool people that were
given talks there and I thought that I
would share with you this really
laid-back chill kind of con coverage
episode I think you guys will really
enjoy we'll be back actually we've got
so much stuff from torque on that I'm
gonna have to split it up into two
episodes but I think you guys are really
going to like the the crazy phone
phreaking and and and psycho and torque
on stuff that we have going on this week
and then social engineering and ip6
stuff for next week so you guys going to
love that and then we'll be right back
into the whiteboard and all sorts of fun
hackery stuff so you know stay tuned for
that and again thank you all for your
well wishes I am recovering still but
but yeah it feels good to be on my feet
as it were and yet without further ado
let's just go ahead get into the relaxed
torque on
and I will see you guys on the other
side join zany electronics hobbyist Ben
Heck and friends as they build and
modify a host of amazing community
inspired creations tune in to the ben
heck show every other Monday right here
on revision3 the ben heck show is
brought to you exclusively by element14
the online store and community for
electronics design engineers check out
element14 calm so Nick Don guys thank
you so much for having me out here I
know this is like really late by his
post to work on and I figured it
wouldn't be completing the experience
unless we talked to you guys about the
amazing research that you guys have been
presenting here and I was hoping that
you could break down for the viewers
that haven't been fortunate enough to be
here at the con what the carmen sandiego
project really is yeah thanks man we're
really happy to be here this is this is
an often awesome experience obviously to
work on being able to hang out here give
this interview and this is a beautiful
place to do it don't you think Nick yeah
I think that's that's another interview
though for itself okay yeah we're gonna
talk about that off-camera some other
time yeah but break it down for me
because I'm so like as a as a former
phone freak I'm just fascinated with the
the level that this is gone what is what
are the foundations of the common San
Diego project so basically a conversatio
project encompasses a two main facets
right to build this platform of
information gathering and that's
building upon prior research on GSM
back-end networks to do geolocation and
then also building upon prior research
on manipulating caller ID databases and
basically being able to pull arbitrary
caller ID lookups so the story really
goes there was some original research
done by a man named Tobias angle at the
ccc a couple years ago and he gave a
talk about this thing called hlr which
is the home location register it's just
this record that has information about
Jason handset and and what network is
connected to the mobile switching Center
the MSC number that it's connected to
which corresponds to some geographic
location and in his talk he just kind of
presented it you know it's just one of
those architectural thing
that exists what was unique about his
talk though was that he was talking
about how there are these European
companies that actually provide
third-party access to these records and
records of the telco keeps yeah so it
whenever your phones checked it to a
tower it go at reg it puts an entry into
this no registry basically that says I'm
this phone I'm this is my home network
you know you might be on some provider
ex and you're roaming on provider why it
just makes a'kla keeps track of
everything like ends they need to know
that for billing purposes and other
things yeah and Cole routing and
everything and so part of this
information that's exposed by these
private companies is supposed to be used
for like SMS marketers and things like
that and for routing calls or text
messages but in reality what it exposes
is a person's actual geolocation now
persons or their msl number or you know
it does it correspond to the phone
number like who this person is where
they are close it where's the
whitewashed no actually that's the funny
thing a totally depends on the provider
may isn't very there's a lot of caveats
here and everything like that but
generally speaking um what you get is a
general location of where somebody is
and we added some intelligence on to
that where we're doing we're able to do
arbitrary caller ID look up and we're
able to now add a name to this number
and actually i'll let ya down about
expense or ID lookups in the united
states and what's unique about that and
how it relates to this we can you expand
on that for me because I know that
caller ID is different when it comes to
the cellular network than it is with the
plain old telephone system what how does
that tie into the San Diego project well
it's not really different different you
know I mean caller Ids caller ID well
it's not a 1200 baud modem that this
little blurt read before the like second
ring or something but it is right
because this is the same information
coming from the same database it's just
populated with different data right so
essentially you're receiving pretty much
exactly the same thing if you have a
phone system at your house that does
color ID and I call it with my cell
phone it'll probably pull up the same
data hmm does nobody really care to our
notice before or realized hey that's
weird we should probably think about
using that as a
source you know I mean so the cool thing
that that we figured out and that I'm
sure other people had figured out but um
we decided to take advantage of it and i
think a unique way and that we just said
okay let's take an entire exchange of
phone numbers for a particular region
and pull all the caller ID entries for
that region and see what we come up with
now how do you pull the caller ID
numbers because in order to receive the
caller ID you have to have them call you
so it's not a world war diary at war
dial situation where you can just call
every during the exchange it is it is
and yeah the reason why is because we
turned it into a war dialing situation
so what we do is we back spoof so we set
up a PBX like asterisk or anything else
we enable caller name lookups or see
name on the actual d ID and then we just
sit there and call ourselves over and
over and over and that you're them yeah
exactly we just spoof the phone number
to ourselves so they're not even in the
loop their phone no rings they're like
has nothing to do with it yeah it's not
like we're dying in the in the middle of
the night in the 90s I'm like you get a
whole bunch of like disgruntled people
exactly we're essentially war telling
ourselves I mean that's what it comes
down to because you're still going
through the you're just tell racism and
they see oh hey such-and-such is doing
this and then it comes back to you and
they don't know the wiser exactly so the
provider that we're connected to is
providing us with the cname information
all we have to do is make that call to
ourselves and over time you know we're
amassing thousands upon thousands of
records throw that into a seagull that
database and then we just perform
lookups on it it's to see what's there
since you only need like one or two
rings to get your lookup you don't even
hear that the best part about is you can
just drop the call right on the floor
because in the first packet coming in
off the wire it's got the cardi data so
you can immediately just immediately
drop it off yeah and a box with a whole
bunch of sip yeah the only thing that
you pay for is the cname look up itself
everything la is completely retarded so
there's no reason to use any other be so
how many how many are you able to well
we're doing the interview right hey
what's up bossman this is my cosmic no
worries hey it's all
this man here no yeah no don't go
anywhere we're talking about something
that you can actually contribute to
women so what you're saying is that you
can do an entire exchange and get the
cname in a second so you could just
pretty much brute force all of those
just by going sequentially through the
numbers using your own asterisk
absolutely it's it's incredibly easy and
how many things really no time are you
kidding me that's wondering at hundreds
of thousands of numbers really right and
me it takes its fractions of a cent per
look up yeah it took you think we're not
gonna pull like entire States we're
looking through California saying to
ourselves hey you know who lives in
California celebrities you know would be
really funny you call celebrities so you
did just an entire reverse lookup of all
of what the phone numbers in California
pretty much but we focused on like you
know where are people gonna live Malibu
Beverly Hills you know stuff like that
so we just you know started scanning
seeing what we got and we got a lot of
phone numbers a lot of really
interesting phone numbers like I said
you know unfortunately when you call
those numbers nobody picks up because
you know celebrities are smart enough to
know if some random people call my phone
don't pick it up yeah yeah so you know I
mean it's a lot less fun when it
actually comes down to it but you can
still say hey I got this really cool
person's phone number never gonna talk
to him but it's pretty neat well you can
call it you know Lindsay Lohan's
sidekick if you wanted well I wouldn't
really want to call that number but you
know if I wanted a tragedy I could watch
TV there we go yeah so I mean that's
really the issue here all right but you
know I the fact is you can get it you
can get it easily and that makes it fun
okay so I get the point that you've got
okay so now you have a reverse lookup of
the name to the number and that ties in
with this h HL s hu tler this hlr record
the human lookup record what was it look
up record home location rotation so
let's let's tie them together yeah with
hlr you've got the ability to track
people's location their current location
and obviously if you do this over time
you can map where they've been for the
last you know month
however long you want they keep these
records for a long time no but we can
obviously I'm pulling that information
how do you pull that information first
let me tie this together so you've got
hlr tracking you've got caller name
lookups that gives the ability to find
individuals right so now if I don't know
your phone number and I scan through the
entire caller ID name list I can find
your phone number based on your name and
then what I simply do is use the
tracking software to watch where you go
and when you're there and I can make
associations based on that information I
can say hey you work in the north side
of San Francisco but you seem to live at
night in the south side of San Francisco
and so I'm watching these behavioral
patterns and building a dossier about
your life over time and Nick can
actually elaborate on that a little bit
more because we use some other tricks to
actually enhance that information by
building social networks and analyzing
the people that you talk to and what you
talk about so this is like Foursquare
stocking + + way beyond four square plus
plus yes I would you space yeah this is
crazy well can you elaborate how do we
even get access to that fire hose of
data like we were to get the HSR hlr hlr
i just write that early as the third
partner you said the third parties yeah
who do i sign up with we're really good
an account if you just go Google around
you'll find that information and you can
just read Tobias angles original papers
and there's some stuff out there about
it but um you know and then like Vaughn
said about the caller ID stuff the backs
with method you can able know that an
asterisk and then just log the results
yeah and then make the correlation
yourselves it's just an envisioning like
a reverse lookup table database of all
phone numbers in the u.s. it's done
within the month and so on all people
who realize is that the GSM providers
include your primary account holder name
and the phone number in the clarity
database and so with hlr we can
determine if a phone is an actual cell
phone number and which provider belongs
to and then we can say you can find out
the provider end with name portable
portability how so well that's I mean
think about what we're querying we're
asking the cell phone back end who does
this blown what's the whole network of
this number and so the home network of
that number will be the original
provider so that's one of the advantages
that you get when you are trying to do
basically reconnaissance on a person
and you want to know what provider they
have it's impossible to determine that
accurately just by their cell phone
number you need to ask the cell phone
network what provider are using and even
with number portability it will tell you
accurately is the current one not just
the originating one like an original
sprint number but I'm on Verizon now so
you can tell that so yeah and obviously
this is primary gsm but well right I
mean if I was on like t-mobile or 18
right pull my docs or anywhere in the
world any gsm carrier in the world in
the world yeah because the HSR is is HR
HR so that is one something I am but but
yeah it's but but that's that's across
that's just part of the spec over the
across the globe yes yes now what about
the caller ID part would you be able to
do that prospect it we primarily didn't
know in the United States but if there
is a similar system and those similar
policies anywhere else in the world then
it would work ha no no we're done our
room phone is ringing and I have to
answer that okay well well why don't you
treasure what led you to even get in
like what led you down this original
path to begin with to even start playing
with us just to bias his work we thought
it was unbelievably cool and we didn't
think it got enough respect that was
really the main issue to us we thought
okay here's a really cool presentation
at ccc but it's really being overlooked
and nobody's determining whether or not
it's affecting individuals in the United
States so we decided you know what we
could take the information we have about
caller ID we combine it with this
information to determine whether or not
it's vulnerable in the United States and
then I use that information combined
together to create a map of the United
States and then determine whether or not
we can follow people around and do all
this crazy stuff and that was really it
was it was simply a curiosity yeah you
know yeah and also respect for Tobias's
work you know so when you say follow
people around a what level of detail can
you actually follow someone around well
it's the granularity varies and usually
a mobile switching center this is the
code that we find in the hlr the MSC
value that tells you the general
location that somebody's in cuz just
tell you the towers that they're
connected to know it's just it's just a
serial number its that's all it is it's
just a string of numbers and it usually
looks like a phone number but the
the context is really another here nor
there the point is it's a number that's
typically opaque okay and you have to
determine how big or how small this
number actually is or what this you know
range of area represents so what we
ended up doing is we determine how we
could reverse-engineer these mses and
determine how how big or how small they
were so what we did is we took a look at
the caller ID database again and said
all right so you know we know we can
take blocks of numbers and we can pull a
caller ID information for all these
different numbers well what can you do
with that name information obviously if
we have whitepages access a lot of
people still have home phones yeah we
can just simply go out to whitepages.com
they have a development site where we
can now take that name put it in a
general area like if I know I'm pulling
Denver Colorado I just put John Smith
Denver Colorado and see what pops up
take all the results what's really cool
about whitepages now if there is a home
if there's an entry for a person's home
address you don't just get the address
but you also get a latitude and
longitude but where that person lives
okay so obviously that's really easy to
pinpoint in a KML or some kind of our
other mapping formats right so what you
do is you take all those names you toss
them in the white pages get all the
results and then start plotting them on
a map and you say okay I know this
person is in denver colorado during the
day and i know they're in denver
colorado at night so the MSC that I pull
for them should be Denver great so I
also know exactly where they live and I
know the latitude and longitude so I
have a point on a map that defines this
is where this MSC value 1 2 3 4 is and
then over time you mask more and more
information about different people that
all live within this Embassy and you
eventually create a bounding box that
gives you the physical approximation of
what the outer boundaries of this area
is so now not only do I know so that's
how figure out so that's how you reverse
the MSC to figure out what the those
areas are what those codes for the
jeweler's wait that's how we give it a
physical characteristic yes so not only
do we know Denver Colorado is associated
with MSU 1234 right so we know that it's
a specific size and shape and we know
what other city
in you know comprised US based on doing
enough of these that you reversed and
gotten the color 84 and the names and
stuff to create a oh this has the same
embassy these all have the same embassy
and they are in these neighborhoods yeah
you're really just reversing the blocks
that these MSC numbers correspond to
geographically pretty much whoa that
sounds like it took a lot of time it did
take a lot of time but it only took in
as much time as it took for us to figure
out the technique and then implement the
technique implementing it because
obviously when we were first doing this
we didn't have a lot of you know really
powerful software we're doing very
simple stuff and just doing what we had
to do get the job done yeah and but now
we've moved our software into the cloud
and if we can reimage the entire united
states in a day if we wanted to Wow but
the point is that you now know the
physical boundaries of where these
embassies are so not only do I know
where you're in Denver but i can figure
out approximately where you are in
Denver like if I see you move from an
adjacent MSC into the mcsa of Denver I
know if you're going at a rate of speed
that i can predict so that's really
figure out like if they're on the go
well you know if they're on an
expressway than sure if it's a long
expressway and you see them hop multiple
embassies you can predict pretty much
what the timing is let me know if we
actually didn't even know talk about
yeah we actually didn't even talk about
the cloud stuff today in our talk even
though he went over yeah we didn't even
have time but yeah that was no
information that relate to this that we
literally talked for about an hour and a
half yeah because we had the last slide
which I think by the way it was it was
by design which is why it was actually
pretty smart well then Nick tell me
about the cloud stuff what is that all
about well basically all we did was to
speed things up we just experimented
with running all these techniques
distributed Lee in the clerk in the in
them as distributed services basically
in the cloud just to try to you know do
it in bulk that's all yeah you know just
experimenting with that and again just
kind of theorizing if an attacker really
wanted to do this on a grand scale this
is something that he isn't approach Lee
he might take so I guess that's that's
well if you want to say more to it but
that's pretty much all main goal of it
was yeah
it's it pretty breaks it breaks down to
this we want to be able to okay so MSC
values are opaque right I mentioned that
earlier which pulsing chat is just a
bunch of numbers but you were able to
translate them into geographic location
by racing home but the opacity is an
important thing to remember because the
opacity makes it really moot what this
number is so tomorrow a provider could
go say hey you know I'm going to switch
out the MSC for Denver with MSU MSU for
San Diego they don't care because
internally they know what number table
yeah nobody else really cares ray is a
whatever getting confused I'm like all
these used to mean something else but
now everybody's showing up in San Diego
what's up with that so we have to be
able to very quickly reverse engineer
the entire United States to know Oh is
there a conflict or is there new
information are they changing we're
doing this all from a black box view so
we can't make any guarantees about what
these values are or what they represent
we have to know that that we have
techniques that can reverse engineer all
this information like that and that was
the driver for the cloud so we just tune
our software through it in the cloud and
said hey you know let's just scale it so
we can you know obviously just on demand
one server 10 servers 20 servers just
image it all now and take care of it
such a brute force approach not not just
the the color ID but the the MSR the MSC
and and all of the other elements there
it's just mind-blowing to see like what
is impossible when you just say okay
we've got fast enough computers and fast
enough lookups and all of this stuff why
don't I just try everything and see what
comes out the other end for that
particular value yeah hlr gave us an
inch and we definitely learn how to get
a mile out of it you know but it
literally was it just took a small bit
of ingenuity a little bit of time so
what is the reception bin from the
telcos I you can speak to that one you
actually have more experience yeah I
guess that's true well we actually
reached out to AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile obviously
the biggest fear the United States and
they were actually extremely helpful
AT&amp;amp;T CSO has been very very kind to us
and has been trying to work
with us and he has done an exceptional
job of being able to bridge the gap
between us and the researchers and
engineers at AT&amp;amp;T so we feel that
they've been doing an exceptional job
and they've actually secured a lot of
this a lot of these problems themselves
they figured out how to virtualize MSC s
so that whenever you query an AT&amp;amp;T
number it no longer shows the MSC that
corresponds with the physical location
it shows a virtual embassy so everybody
has the same number and they only rear
out the data internally okay so it's
almost like a net yeah I know exactly
we're talking about that there's like a
little uh there's a layer there yeah
because these like you said you signed
up for some sort of a service and you've
got an API where you could quarry things
you're being a little vague on this but
whatever it may be whether it's a text
messaging service or otherwise wherever
you're getting the hlr they've basically
whitewashed that that value now so
that's no good right I know who the bad
actors are and they consider this a
breach of terms of service because they
consider the MSC value to be pride in
the United States right they don't want
a week or but but they were doing but
what they were doing wasn't just like
blatant a violation of your privacy by
by by giving access to third parties the
location data because what they were I
mean I could imagine what everything was
oh well run through this hash function
or whatever and give them a number but
they don't know that that number means
Denver and then you guys were to say oh
well here's the number i don't know
let's try everything in denver and oh
yeah there it is yeah and that's kind of
the cool thing because t-mobile's
networks a little bit different now
they've also been exceptional dealing
with us as well but they have different
engineering problems so they have
architectural issues that are holding
them back a little bit from releasing a
solution to this faster now they are
working on it and they will get it done
but it's not there now and the point I'd
like to make about them is that the
interesting thing here is that they're
msds actually look like phone numbers so
if you pull their embassies they look
exactly like you know an american number
one area code exchange and XXX yeah so
what way you end up seeing is like oh
hey when i pull the area code for
Demeter the area code for denver ends up
looking like the area code for you know
the actual area code and exchange per se
you know Boston Massachusetts
is so you know maybe in their mind is
like easier to switch it around because
then they'll say well this is me
anything to anybody obviously the wrong
location but because we were able to
reverse-engineer it that doesn't mean
anything to us yeah we take it as if
it's you know one two three four or a it
doesn't matter yeah because you're just
going to look it up and then cross
references and exactly there's an
amazing your nose two locations this is
just further evidence that you know just
the the the technology is fast enough
the the data is readily available enough
that the idea of just doing a reverse
lookup of something by building your own
tables you know like like you know
totally separate from like like I don't
know ntlm on one side to geographic
locations and phone numbers on the other
side I mean well the funny thing is like
you know doing arbitrary clarity lookups
is nothing new I mean that's a kind of
trick that's been around for a while
it's cute it's a fun parlor trick and
the stuff is obviously based on prior
research what we're doing really is
we're taking these you know pieces of
research these these resources we're
combining them and then we're taking
them 20 steps forward well congrats for
doing that because it sounds really sexy
date than 270 tons that is good i was
just going to say and and you know then
once we've taken them 20 steps further
we have this platform of you know that
we can use to gather information about
people and then we can build all these
little vertical applications on top of a
platform that can imagine that's what we
talked about in our talk really was
let's say like when we first gave the
talk it was about here's the base
research then when we talk to black hat
it was here's the basic research plus
some more and then finally here at
torque on its here's a little bit of the
base research you might have heard of it
or by now by here's to a lot of
different examples about what else you
can do with this right so I'm sure
you've got some fun stories about like I
mean I means it's a stalker's wet dream
right yeah well the point of the room
will be like to point out yeah a little
situation to race to me that way you
want to talk about black and I'm serious
yes there is show that um we can do
something without having lots of
resources at hand yeah right it's it's
the it's it's just showing what we can
accomplish as civilians without having
looks like government resources to pull
off like geolocation tracking now
remember this cat
it's not as granular it's very macro and
another point of the research is that
it's very passive it doesn't alert the
user it's not attacking the phone we're
looking at we're poking at not like
looking at the GPS or you're not doing a
rootkit there's nothing that they could
discover because you didn't even call
them to reverse their their color ID and
you're only getting it through this
third party service where they happen to
be so or yeah I think the one thing that
I really like to say and clarify about
this project is we had no intentions of
you know trying to mimic a stalker or be
a stalker or anything in that nature the
one thing that we did want to do is say
with an extreme minimal amount of
resources minimal amount of time and
minimal amount of money what is the most
information that we can assess or
obtained from the global
telecommunications network and not only
that but how can we build applications
off of that yeah in such a fashion to
give us even more data about individuals
or organizations or even governments all
over the world with no effort whatsoever
because to us it's not about being black
hat and it's not about being shady it's
not about any of that it's about true
hacking is all about the resource and
all about your willingness to go out
there and obtain information out of air
right that's what it's all about that's
the spirit so your ability to be able to
put all these things together that are
just essentially just a huge abstract
puzzle without any resources telling you
what these things are that's the goal
the carmen sandiego from san diego
project is all about being able to put
those things together in an efficient
manner you know what's it it's an
excellent story of exactly what you said
you know just the the it's a politician
yeah yeah it's great stuff so is the the
cloud platform I'm assuming that's not a
public thing no no no no I mean
obviously this researcher you know what
we talk about publicly is is what we
talk about publicly yeah is there
somewhere that our viewers that are more
interested in this stuff can can dig
deeper and find out about your research
and the research that you're building
you know the the Giants shoulders that
you're standing on here yeah the carmen
sandiego project com yes Israeli you'll
find the white paper and the black hat
slides and eventually the torque on
slides and absolutely references for
other people whose work we've baystars
on yes and the references for everything
everything is that the combination diego
project com for guys thank you so much I
really appreciate you and and this is
definitely tickled my talk we appreciate
you two day oh thank you no I'm serious
like like you said this really is a
perfect example of what it is to be
hacker would you like a microphone trust
your technolo speeches Thanks if you're
a 90 or software consultant you're
always looking for ways to be
competitive you need to grow your
business but can't be in two places at

would you congratulations on the twelfth
torque on you you want gun doesn't that
right yep it's been 12 of them here in
San Diego the few in Seattle and the 12
or camp but we're really racking them up
she had now tell me about the the tour
camp because last we talked was a torque
on 10 so we had to miss 11 but we're
here on out you know now being on the
west coast absolutely love the con that
you put on here and you just threw an
amazing event at a missile silo location
we were talking about last time like
what was that all about before camp um
it was the u.s. first hacker camp we got
a hold of a Titan one missile silo
that's right type in one missile silo I
can swear right yeah so we got a hold of
the missile silo in western Washington
took it over for about a week and a half
two weeks had everyone drive out set up
camps kind of a little bit like burning
man for geeks we had one group that
brought in
six shipping containers set them up in a
giant circle put up the blue tarps on
the 60-foot crow's nest in the center
well and had parties they're raised
every day until four in the morning we
roughed it but we made sure there was
internet there were weaned essentials
you know we built showers out there so
we had showers out there we had the
minimal facilities but it was a great
time everyone had a wonderful time
there's a real sense of community and
come rotten tree as opposed to how many
how many people you show up that I'm
trying to get a sense of its going to
treat some of the photos that I have in
a bit but I think like four or five
hundred something like that a lot of
people yeah so really like a like a
burning man for geeks real the one group
that brought in the shipping containers
I think there were 80 people in their
group Wow so it was huge but because one
of the things I really loved about it
was the fact that unlike a conference
like this which is great it's academic
it's wonderful we have good talks during
the day we go downtown did we eat we
what we have big parties we have a
wonderful time but everyone kind of
segments off I mean everybody's got that
a little pet at the end of the day this
group goes to this restaurant that
whereas when you're in the camp you're
pretty much stuck there now this campus
in like okay so it's a missile silo so
i'm assuming middle of nowhere the
government tends to like to put missile
silos out in the middle of nowhere so
yeah it was basically what we found out
after we were there it was the second
largest deposit from Mount st. Helens
really that is the second after the area
immediately in the vicinity the volcano
I guess ashes went up some came
immediately down and some came down
where we work so there was a lot of ash
there it was hot there's a lot of ash we
had our share of dust devils and other
fun things but you know what people
really hunkered down there's a real
sense of sort of surviving all the
roughness roughing it out in the
wilderness hackers
I mean then again I'm one that you know
I'm one to speak yeah now that sounds
great little bit we did wrong to get
people out of their element that was
part of the idea behind it and aware is
going that before because everyone's
camping there together everyone's
together a hundred percent of the time
and so I could be walking down in
between some of the different campsites
and have people hey geo combined in can
have dinner with us people set up some
people cooked for week in advance just
to get all the food setup for for their
team you just wandered left and right
people invite you in for pancakes in the
morning or come have a beer with us or
come eat our Italian peasant cuisine
that we get set up it was it was
phenomenal they're so like workshops and
get sessions going on the same time and
all that yeah we actually had facilities
for obvious reasons the missile silos
been decommissioned for a long time for
obvious reasons we couldn't have people
camping down there it's there's a lot of
broken concrete there's a lot of rebar
sticking out it's kind of a dangerous
environment but we did have some of the
talks down there which was actually
wonderful considering it was probably
150 degrees up top but you go down six
stories and it's a cool even I think 62
or something like that that so it was
nice and it really lent a very kind of
fall of the Berlin Wall feel to it
because the deconstructing that facility
with graffiti all over the place it was
just a perfect context for this that
sounds awesome i wish it could have been
there now do you have any any future
plans for tour camp we do we're going to
go to the end of the world at the end of
the world where's the end of the world
we're looking to go to Antarctica Oh on
December what is it December 21st 2012
oh so that is the end of the world the
end of the world at the end of the world
I think so it should are you going to
get there it primarily will be a boat
voyage so it's not going to be camping
as much but you will still have the same
environment where basically you're on
the boat and you're pretty much there
for the duration so it should be one
hell of a trip
guys a once-in-a-lifetime kind of a trip
that does sound Chan test well you know
cuz it's the end of the world at the end
of it so so have the festivities leading
up to it and then yeah and it is and so
so you so what we're saying is only get
a one-way ticket save yourself some
money right well yeah he'll get a plan
is going to be expensive unfortunately
well yet to get to it getting there yeah
it's not cheap to leap from but you I
don't know if the role really isn't
going to end let's just grab a bunch of
credit cards max out your credit and you
know the world's over so you don't have
to pay it back yeah I'm not actually
suggesting doing that now we all know
that the real end of the world is 2038
unix time good reference anyway that
sounds fantastic how many people are you
can take there is there a facility there
we're going to see same thing with
workshops and and in sessions on
Antarctica well the voyage is going to
be most of it okay so most of its going
to be on the boat we will there's an
area where we are going to touch land
and then I think we people fly back from
there so most of the time is going to be
spent on the boat but I'm sure there'll
be plenty of plenty of opportunities
lookout and spot penguins and other such
things like that see you once again done
the thing where you get a whole bunch of
hackers in a in a space where they don't
they can't go off into all these
separate groups yeah yeah that's kind of
great it screws a wonderful source of
community that gets built from this
which is why I really like the whole
camp thing yeah that is so cool what
about torque on Seattle what's new there
to work on Seattle we're going to get
another iteration of it that's a
slightly different event from the San
Diego the only way and get into seattle
is by invite it's kind of thing where
once you're a member of the club you're
in you're in for life and typically it's
it's usually winding up to be speakers
and other such people that so it's a
much tighter smaller knit group and ones
up being more of a symposium and a lot
of respects as opposed to being sitting
in a lecture hall with 500 people there
you can't really stop and interrupt the
speaker to ask a question or correct
them whereas in the smaller more
intimate environment usually you
probably know the speaker
so it's much easier to heckle them and
it's much easier to stop them and
interrupt them with a question or a
clarification or maybe you have an
insight into a field that they have
lightly touched on that they don't have
fully developed you can interject with
hey but wait did you think about X yeah
and you don't have to throw a soft
rubber balls item or anything exactly
that so and torque on so what's been new
with that 12 this is yeah of course our
12th year that we're going into was
probably one of the best tour cons I'm
either keep getting bigger and better
right yeah but it's just something about
this year we things just meshing
beautifully it's going as smooth as can
be we did have a little issue earlier
this morning where we had lines lining
up to get into to some of the talks I
don't know if you're here for that yeah
the huge line of people queued up but we
we actually rearranged the room got it
so we can get everything in there's like
a huge queue to get into a session you
obviously have never been to death on
well this is a different event yeah it's
a much different sound chill too much
Mary that's more relaxed that's one of
the things I like to say is that tour
cons got five times the amount of
information of Def Con with one fifth of
liver damage oh there's a little liver
damage but it's it's in a very chill
sort of way yeah it's because the reach
critical mass point where there's just
too many people yeah and you know love
defcon but the hassles are trying to get
into the talk and just too many people
and it's just it becomes almost an
obstacle to learning anything we're here
because it's a lot more chill you have a
tendency I think to pick up a lot more
situation like this so it's more
accessible yeah I like to think it's a
guy's definitely put on a great con so
what's uh what's next for for you and
hikari and
any more like tour spin-offs I think
three is enough to juggle for the time
being I'm sure we'll add more as time
goes on but three is enough to keep us
busy for the time being well thanks for
having us 10 going up what they have
here if you've got a creative idea or
want to start a new business I recommend
getting a domain name and web hosting
from domain.com domain com has the
domain you want fast easy and
inexpensive with free domain tools
including URL and email forwarding DNS
management and transfer law their linux
powered hosting plans are dependable
flexible and affordable too with free
setup and no commitment required the
deluxe hosting offers unlimited
bandwidth and site builder pages at a
mere 8 75 a month they even make it dead
simple to get started with plenty of
free software like wordpress joomla
drupal and more all installed in just a
few clicks and as a hack 5 viewer you
get an extra fifteen percent off your
order when you checkout with coupon code
hak5 got a great idea it all starts with
a great domain domain com dan how do we
hack people we get into their heads get
into their heads there's a lot of really
interesting things to throw some
keywords out things like pattern breaks
things like NLP kinesics proxemics just
in terms that i'm not familiar with what
is what is it all involved what are we
talking about here at a talk on so well
i'm giving a presentation on people
hacking people hacking i like to define
as getting people to do your bidding my
sort of catchphrase for the talk is
people are USB sticks and you can read
it right to them at your will and their
you know their to your mercy as a USB
stick would be how did you go about
programming a person well you've
probably seen people to do stage
hypnosis before it's essentially the
same thing except it's very short term
so there's a guy named aaron brown who's
a show host in the UK and he has a show
i think it's called tricks of the mind
and you can find him on youtube he has a
lot of videos of him going into for
example a jewelry shop and paying for
thousands and thousands of dollars of
jewelry with blank paper he'll walk into
a shop and you'll have blank paper in
the shape of dollar bills or hundred
presumably and she'll them out and
speaking to this person who does this
every day
handles money he talking to them and
while their mind is occupied processing
what he's saying he's handing them money
money gestural II as you know what
programmed responses all right so like
if I stick my hand out to shake it you
just instinctively want to shake my hand
or if I'm going to hand you something
you just naturally want to take it just
gave me a knife I gave you a really
expensive knife sweet yeah but that's
sort of the the that right that
transaction there's what gets exploited
so if i were to hand you something and
then interrupt that that would be called
a pattern break and when a pattern break
has issued your mind sort of goes on
pause and you can do things for example
derren brown's done it on video where
you can walk down the street you can
find somebody who looks like they're
zonked people that generally don't pay a
lot of attention or people that are sort
of on autopilot are the best targets it
doesn't work on everybody it works on
people that aren't really mentally sharp
that day like you have slow days right
so the slow days are when you're
vulnerable yeah well if somebody were to
walk up to you and start for example
with darren brown did started asking a
guy for directions and then handed him a
bottle he's tried to shake his hand
handed him a bottle handing him the
bottle was a pattern break the guy was
confused for a moment and while he was
confused for the moment like for split
second he's like wait you were shaking
my hand and directions and wait that
that's the vulnerability window he
immediately started saying i need your
wallet I need your watch I need your
your keys your phone and the guy just
starts emptying his caucus the human
equivalent of a buffer overflow exactly
that's exactly what was his buffer
overflow buffer overflow and then
subsequently like a cord alberca yes or
sequel injection and you're you're
grabbing stuff but how is this different
from social engineering well social
engineering is you know putting on a UPS
uniform and walking into a place and
saying hey I need to deliver this to the
guy in the back that's it social
engineering historically has been very
very sort of topical i got i had a
friend tell me a story where they
dressed up like fire marshals and they
had church custom embroidered with the
city's fire marshal emblem and started
going into places like banks and asking
hey we need to check your fire
extinguishers in the vault and they had
said okay and that was I mean it's a
person of authority what do you think
were you gonna say right show me your
credentials you have fire fire marshal
guy show me your tattoo or your severed
baby head or whatever it is they give
you that says your fire marshal a
thought embroidme ask for credentials I
don't know okay um but so what are some
of those of the terms of reasons Benton
ok so the Arsenal here all right so
there's there's a few of these different
sort of there they're based on
psychology or whether within the
psychology realm I'm still new to this
this is a hobby of mine but I think it's
really neat so proxemics is the stance
that people assume in social situations
for example like the way we're standing
now somebody could approach us from this
side so our shoulders are open right if
we were to say change our posture
suddenly it's a closed posture and
people over here generally will say you
know those people want to be left alone
they're not feeling social there's a
line through you if you were to slice a
person down the vertically like this
yeah so that out to the left and rights
there's 180 degrees or 90 over here and
45 or something I we're here you have in
front of you in behind you and you can
use that as a guide so if you're looking
at a group of people or if you're
looking at a person and the person
suddenly sort of puts you on the other
side of that line there either telling
you to off or there or if they're
not aware of your presence there may not
be feeling social or it depends on how
things work out but you can like to look
at crowds like that one over there and
you can see ooh I can approach that
crowd from this you know vector sort of
that's called proxemics proxemics is
being able to define um people's
interactions within certain boundaries
and there's there's four or I think I
have them in my slides it's like there's
intimate which is like six inches apart
then there's like you know friendly
which is further but then you have these
rings and within these rings you have
these different sort of access methods
where the farther away you are the more
like okay I can tell just based on a
stand so I can walk over and talk to
that guy versus you know if you're three
feet it's going to be slightly different
there's going to be more detail there's
going to be more more minutiae what
about the
the facial gestures that's Kenny talking
about wound right so there's there's for
the four main things I'm going to be
covering as proxemics kinesics cold
reading and NLP proxemics is what I just
described kinesics is if you've seen
that show lie to me yeah lie to me it's
all kinesics is the study of facial
mannerisms and body mannerisms and
gestures it's a meta communicative
communication or nonverbal communication
so it's a body language basically it's a
for emotions that you exhibit you have
certain ticks or movements or gestures
that you sort of invoke so people that
want to be closed will fold their arms
it will see them just see them close the
legs or if they're nervous I'll tend to
shift their weight from one foot to the
other people that tend not to want to
talk will put their hands in the pockets
or if they're there fidgeting their eggs
that you know it's anxiety but all these
different i have a spreadsheet that i
made this huge cheat sheet that i'm
going to be sharing with everybody after
my talk but this just is cheat sheet you
can look at this cheat sheet and watch
any political interview and you'll just
laugh really yeah oh it's ridiculous
it's it's dumb I mean this budget is
neat but like how badly these people lie
is dumb but so works best on politicians
is what you're saying any any scenario
wherein you think somebody is just lying
through their teeth then get familiar
with the spreadsheet it's really easy
and then is this just is are these
elements that you should be adding to
your hacker tool kit for social
situations anytime you're talking to
anybody and you're like did you end that
my server just look at their eyes and
see what they do right they'll be like
oh well you know oh no it couldn't be
neat no no yeah like the rickshaw last
night that wouldn't look me in the eyes
yeah I didn't have any change right yeah
yeah yeah so there's there's there's all
these little detail just like that where
you can tell something's off right but
without a cheat sheet or having studied
it it's difficult to tell specifically
what is off like the interesting thing
about this sort of thing is you can tell
somebody's lying but you can't know why
you can say they're exhibiting anxiety
when answering this question their
exhibit up your self for comfort it's
like you don't have any confidence in
what you're saying so you're fidgeting
and rubbing yourself it's weird there's
a term for it but it slips my mind Oh
we'll come back to ya it was that last
one I know NLP it stands for new
linguistic neuro-linguistic programming
it's the story I was telling earlier
about darren brown pattern breaks yeah
so there's this really cool other i
graph found a clip on YouTube of this
guy they have these okay I should back
up NLP is commonly used by marketing
people and PR people to overwrite what
you think about certain things for
example any in the instance in the news
where you see some marketing person
busted for using subliminal messaging or
subliminal advertising where you have
like a television show or a program or
something happening and then you'll get
one frame of a logo mm-hmm but the frame
is a prominent like for example
McDonald's logo that's bright red with
yellow right for one second like you you
may not have seen its like that line at
a pulp fiction you you might not think
you saw but you did your brain knows you
did and suddenly you're like oh man I
could really use a quarter pounder you
know so that is that keys off of NLP NLP
is used any person that you see calling
themselves a life coach any stage
hypnosis person NLP is literally writing
to people for a temporary amount of time
people that are good at it or actual
hypnosis people that are hypnotist I
should say those people can actually do
damage if they do stuff wrong they can
like tell you that you really like
stabbing yourself and you'll do it with
NLP it's a less permanent depending like
you can go on YouTube and find videos of
NLP people describing to you how you can
hypnotize yourself you can do self
hypnosis to do things like stop biting
your fingernails or stop smoking or
something or whenever you have if you
have a habit you want to get rid of
there's like these self help guides and
they all key off of NLP so if you take
all these little bits and pieces and you
put them together you're sort of come up
with a sniper rifle if you have kinesics
proxemics NLP and cold reading on cold
reading i forgot to touch on cold
reading as um who that guy John Edwards
I can talk to the dead no I wish I could
just pull that memory out of my head no
um so there's these people that go on
television and they have this semi
circle of stadium seating around them
with 200 people and they're like
I'm getting a J named Joe Joe Joe Joe an
Jojo l.joe and then they look for
kinesics in the crowd they see the
person in the car going oh yeah and the
person you oh I had a father named Joe
that just died last year oh yeah joe is
telling me something about October
what's in October right it's feeding
really vague details yeah watching their
kanisa crous ponce and keying off of
whether you're right or wrong based on
their facial mannerisms and body
gestures I'm here to fix the server the
one that you know lately it's been yep
crashing yes the one on the floor with
it the third floor yeah I'm here for the
server on the third floor yeah so you
take all these different things you put
them together you get sort of this first
thing that comes to mind is like core
impact it's just like this thing that's
been put together that just has
everything in it where for every social
interaction there's some sort of answer
or key or or cheat code or something
where you can't get passed over there oh
it's great you talk to the receptionist
the receptionist lets you borrow her her
RFID card nice why why risk yourself
going into a secure area and being on
camera and getting caught when you can
have somebody else do it for you and so
that's what you're talking about here to
work on you're turning people into
assets proxies and your they go and do
your bidding and you've been studying
this for a while can you give me some
ideas where like somebody was interested
in this where they would go to learn
more everything I found is is following
the right people on Twitter there's a
whole bunch of NLP people that's a gray
area because some people are actually
interested in the stuff and other people
are like I'm a life coach give me all of
your money okay and it works which is
really scary so there's people that are
doing it that actually generally are
interested in the subject matter and
there's people that know just enough to
exploit it yeah so so you've put
together some cheat sheet stuff that via
hackers can use to write to their
arsenal to this is really interesting
stuff that you can use in a job
interview interviewing potential
employees like if you're a senior system
in interviewing with junior sisters man
the stuff would come in really handy
contract and salary negotiations are you
talking to your boss hey man I need
another 20 g a year and he goes yeah
yeah that's something wrong you need to
find out what it is
right so any sort of any scenario
wherein people won't tell you the truth
is a good start any scenario where you
need something from somebody and you
know they won't give it to you so you
have to like get around that any
scenario where you know that there's
something behind that door on the left
and you need it okay and so you share
are you sharing this uh the spreadsheet
of your cheat sheet here event for
Connie yeah that published online it's a
google doc right now so by after my talk
I'm just gonna make it a flat out Excel
spreadsheet and publish it to my site so
people can go grab it yeah what's that
everybody needs to be following at this
I'm Center and thank you sir where you
can find your other exploits 810 labs uh
which is a te n right not a 10 but yeah
I San Diego asked me about whiskey ask
me about beer asking me about hacking
sounds good man well thanks so much for
giving me the time absolutely sure
seeing a tour coming out anytime all
right well I'm gonna go play with the
knife yeah yeah yeah thank you
absolutely that just about wraps up this
episode of hak5 but before we get going
I want to let you know that we value
your feedback you can go ahead and send
that over to feedback at hak5 org goes
to the whole team we love to read it
especially when it's kept short also you
know we don't have Shannon in for like
our usual technical s photo or questions
or whatever we'll get back to the
regular pack 54 meal here soon enough as
we transition to season 9 that it is but
but yeah I want to thank you guys for
sticking around next week we will have
even more good stuff from torque on so
look forward to that I also want to
remind you that if you want to support
the show green easy ways please go ahead
and subscribe on iTunes and Miro or
YouTube you can also support the show
with two dollars by heading over to hack
50 words I store stuff some fine swag to
say I'm people stuff and also what else
is going on
not much you can't really think of
anything else I'll slap my head just you
know follow the footer in the
facebooking and we'll have another
that's what's up alright until next time
trust your deck boss oh yeah that's
that's why we do it yeah pretty sure
ladies very bright yeah but you know
what if it gives us that much hacker
glow that we all yes is that it tries to
simulate that of a LCD monitor 3am kind
of well I've got it set to bash I can
turn it to TCL if you'd like but I do
that and after after after the whole
thing I've to hope and like I thought we
resolved this and you're gonna go to all
right all right I understand no no it's
