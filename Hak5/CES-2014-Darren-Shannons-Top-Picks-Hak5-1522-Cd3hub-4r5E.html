by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of techno and here
we are at CES 2014 once again once again
once again so we saw so many interesting
things here this year but honestly I
think my favorite was the curved
Underpants yes it's a fork a flexible
curved wearable it's that's important
wearable Underpants Underpants i'm
wearing my translucent underpants right
now so what did you see what did I see
actually we're going to just run down
our favorite stuff that we've seen so
far and I'm going to go ahead and start
with thin 6 pin 6 is a little company
that has some brilliant engineers from
of MIT that developed a really
ridiculously cool power adapter I know
I'm talking about power power adapter
yeah you know like giant brick you bring
with your laptop they have one that does
the same thing it provides 65 watts of
power and it's only 45 grams so that's
enough to charge your laptop yeah it is
and it's enough to you know maintain it
and charge it at the same time in fact
they even have that USB arm or on the on
the cable as well so you can find a
smart phone while you're charging your
laptop oh I mean aside from the monster
alienware desktop replacement stuff this
will be enough to charge most
everybody's laptop and at 45 grams in
American speak that's 1.5 8 ounces what
this thing is lightweight and it's
really cool that way that they're able
to do it just by like doing much much
faster switching it's like 10 times
faster switching than current you know
120 her power supplies yeah the only
thing that it that I don't know exactly
on it right now I know that is $85 and
it's coming out in q2 is um is I don't
know if it's going to work
internationally I need to find that out
because that's my biggest thing is you
know traveling internationally you want
a really light power supply and there's
gonna be one where you can use with tips
for most any other you know Sony lenovo
whatever laptop you have an 85 bucks if
it saves you an extra pound in your
luggage I think it's worth it cool
alright well I did see something cool as
well 3d systems they've been coming out
with all sorts of really cool things
this year and two of those where the
cube and the cube pro so the cube is a
very small 3d printer
okay it's it's a small 3d printer but
the thing about this one is you don't
have to build it from the ground up
whenever you purchase it so you don't
have to take it apart and put it back
together and recalibrate it every time
you might that's all the fun though I
know it's fun for me if you learn to
being so yeah as I learned with the
Printrbot but this one it's under a
thousand bucks and it's a consumer
product so they're trying to bring 3d
printing out to the consumers and not
just the hackers not just the makers and
I think that's pretty cool because it's
it's giving a lot more people reasons to
understand 3d and reasons to understand
how to develop your own models and
things like that do they you know have
the same kind of ethos as the rest of
the 3d printing community is it open
hardware they don't yeah that's one of
the things they do have their own
website and they have a whole bunch of
different models on there so you can go
there and check them all out one
interesting thing yeah well they're
under a thousand bucks and then their
models they're all free on their website
so you can just download whatever you
want you can print those out kind of
like the shark that I used for the maker
website verse yeah fingers yeah it's
kind of like that except it's their own
their own genre then so one interesting
as thing as well with them is they can
do printing in sugar and they can do
printing in ceramic now now we get to
the point where we figure out why
Shannon likes it they pretty sure yeah
and I was like I saw those and I was
just like this is all the Steel's
packets of sugar from restaurants I'm
out again okay whatever what else did
you see I saw the Geo not and it's
really cool French company they came out
with this we actually looked at a
prototype of it last year it's basically
a 360 degree action camera so you clip
it on your helmet or whatever happens
you don't need to worry about pointing
it at the action they have an app that
allows you to view the playback and you
can just use your finger or the
accelerometer tilt the screen to see the
360-degree image or you can just export
it into premiere and you get like in
2048 x 1024 really wide image and it's
all stitched together in camera then you
like in say premiere or after this video
right yeah whatever yeah so it's like a
regular h.264 okay
yeah for file and you can take this into
your video editor and crop in and then
you know pan and use months that are the
best so what I love is you know Paul and
I have been playing a lot with quad
copters lately and it's kind of a pain
to have to like you know rotate your
gimbal and everything to be pointed out
yeah point of interest but if you get a
360 degree that's horizontal and 150
degree vertical action camera you know
mounted on the bottom of your quadcopter
you would need to worry what direction
it's basic could in post always get it I
I love it is it small it's small it's
dorky looking as all cameras are so they
usually aren't you know it's like six
GoPros on your head um it's actually
kind of small but uh it's also 500 bucks
it's a bit pricey but you can you can
actually hack this together right now at
school with a bunch of GoPros but yeah
cost a lot more because of the rig that
it would take and the expense of all the
cameras and all the stitching after the
fact so yeah you know good on them for
figuring out how to bring it to market
one little quirk that have not fan of is
it's locked at 25 frames per second so
if you're a European you're probably
used to that it's called pal everybody
else we're used to 30 what what the hey
yeah um yeah a lot weird but they said
it was because of the chip and I totally
understand like having to make
sacrifices to be able to bring a product
at the right price so well you know how
there's a whole bunch of different like
wirelessly enabled devices around your
household now there's like the Philips
hue light bulbs there's sonos sound
systems there's a the door locks and all
those Bluetooth door locks at all y
Wi-Fi enabled doorbells so I took a
company that's called revolve and what
they've done is built this app for your
iPhone for your Android device that
basically takes all those different
devices and pears them with the
application so you can control them all
within one application instead of having
to use all three are all six different
kind of apps for each of your different
products that's kind of becoming a thing
hit it and you know while it's really
cool that you know all of these
inexpensive socks and 3d printing and
all these other things that allow people
to quickly fabricate the Internet of
Things is awesome and we see so many of
these cool technologies coming out it is
kind of a concern because he's got like
yeah like 50 apps to control your home
Ramos got one and all of that so I think
what's important here is that's really
interesting
and I would hope that not on a product
side but more on like a back-end side we
would see more of like a standardized
API for talking to these types of
devices and standardized security as
well because as you agree so the way
that they've done their security with
the revolve device in the application is
they have their own personal device that
you hook up to your router and you have
to pair your phone with it your phone
pairs with it by using a light Perry
okay the image pairing on the phone so
you hold it up over the device and then
it flashes until it's paired and then
once you do that the application is good
to go I love free space weird yeah it
was pretty interesting it was pretty
cool and the device was like a hundred
bucks so it was pretty cheap you want to
talk about other free stuff how about
freescale they are a chip manufacturer
they really cool they make some really
interesting chips and freescale was
demoing a really fantastic I think this
is my best of show it is not a product
but it is a development board and what
you can do with this is rapidly
prototype wearable computing so it's
called the warped board w arp for
wearable rapid prototyping I think board
and it's being brought to market by the
same people that brought to brought us
the BeagleBone so that's really cool tax
and this board is like the size of my
pinky and it has a full android 4.2 with
a you know 1 gigahertz chip and oodles
of RAM and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth all of
that in his tiny little chip and it's
open hardware open source software to
get you started writing for it so if
you're into like Arduino zand raspberry
PI's this is that for wearable computing
which is really really brilliant because
they have all of it you know they've
already done all the heavy lifting as
far as the hardware and software now you
can just get in there and write your
application and do what you love and
they have all of these breakout boards
for it so they've got one for you know
induction charging they've got one for
an LCD they've got 14 e ink and so it's
pretty cool that you could just go you
could develop with this and then when
you you know have 3d printed your your
watch band and put on your little chip
that's the right size night and and
figured it all out and Britain your
application taking it to Kickstarter and
raised a million dollars well then you
can go over to freescale and be like
alright cool so now we just need this
minus those chips plus these chips and
you know what you're working with
already so that's awesome yeah
and it's I just love that it's open
software open hardware yeah really
enables a lot of creativity and so I
feel like like you were talking about 3d
printers um this is the coolest product
is not necessarily a product but a
product that enables you to build a
product and that is the most exciting
thing I they have a whole floor of like
Kickstarter ask companies here well I
saw another really cool thing and of
course I'm also big on the 3d printers
my last very cool thing that I saw was
called 3doodler so it sounds like it's
another 3d printer but it's not they
started on Kickstarter and the whole
idea was oh what if I screwed up
something during my 3d print what if the
filament broke or something like that
why can't I go back and fix the 3d print
as it's been so far why can't i edit it
well they created a pen that looks kind
of like a glue gun surprisingly so it
heats up the filament inside the pen and
it extrudes it out the tip of course and
then you can draw you can be creative
and you can draw your own 3d printed
materials so you use the regular PLA and
abs materials just like another regular
3d printer you can buy everything online
they have accessories available as well
but you can actually draw 3d prints so
say at when we went to showstoppers last
night they built an Eiffel Tower and
they drew it that was that was printed
that was printed no one is super and it
was like five feet tall nothing was so
huge they took a 3d print they used the
pen and they printed out one side I love
you at all because as opposed to like
glued it to another side with the heat
gun so as opposed to 3d printers that
are like CNC their computer control
they've got like you know arms that move
a whole gantry and stuff this you're the
arm you are the arm and it enables you
to be so creatively I could see this
developing a new line of creative kids
like kids will see this in their schools
and be able to do this in art class and
be like okay create a cube and they'll
have to draw a cube and it could help
with like geometry and things I just
it's the paintbrush of 3d printing yeah
it is it's the paintbrush of being
creative and being able to draw me and
artists are creative enablers chromium
alloys yeah that's exactly wanted to
talk about one last awesome thing that I
saw at the show here and it's it's not a
product it's actually on you
here you wanna oh this is okay okay so
your badge what's really cool about the
way that press works at CES is that we
were there actually really nice to press
they hook us up with a free backpack
freelance they give us free lunch every
day which is really cool in years past
you would have this big ugly badge with
a pocket full of these coupons and we've
used these paper coupons to redeem our
lunch well now how these badges are all
NFC and what's really great about these
is if you scan the NFC badge you'll
notice that in fact I can actually see
the ASCII in here that it says miss
Shannon Moore some creepy yeah I know
and all sorts of other fun stuff I will
you scanned it that's cool you're
getting a bunch of information about we
know we can scan yes but and I would you
do and it's not well it's not really for
tracking because I do have to get close
enough to you to like tap my phone to
your badge but what's interesting about
it is if i go into tag information it's
of course from an awesome company called
NXP Semiconductors germany so thus is
their their toll but what's really cool
is it's two kilobytes read write and
it's not locked so i press this year's
read it press it to mine and clone your
badge and seal your lunch that's so
funny oh fun hack from CES oh alright
well we hope you guys have enjoyed our
coverage of CES we want to thank
revision3 and all the fine folks that
have helped us get out here of course
yes of course and we're gonna take a
quick break and thank one of our
sponsors
doesn't matter if you're a curved 4k
display or flexible wearable Underpants
when you have that great idea you need a
domain and hosting fast every moment
counts and here's the thing domain.com
is quick discovery system and they're
easy checkout process make it totally
simple to get your website online in
