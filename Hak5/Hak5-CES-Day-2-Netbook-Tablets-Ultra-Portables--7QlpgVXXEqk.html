by godaddy Squarespace and CES chris
hey guys welcome this episode live of
hak5 from CES and we are here in this
you know we we're kind of commenting
yesterday and how we were excited to be
over there I'm even more stoked
NBCUniversal the big stage I love it I
always wanted to be on a mixed gotta
thank them profusely because NBC has
been hooking us up along with revision3
and we're so to be here CES 2009 my
voice I have still like fifty percent of
it so that's good last night we turned
in early we went to bed about ten
o'clock didn't drink anyway anything at
all just is a pre-hearing refresh during
you the fish yesterday because that's
just how responsible we are exactly what
you need to do when your new 20s
basically like we did yesterday for
those of you who watch what we're going
to do is we're going to go through some
of the greatest products that we found
yes I've found some new toys and gadgets
the widgets the little nifty gizmos that
and making us super excited and I think
we've got a great lineup today so why
don't you go ahead and start us off
because we're just going to do like
Thanksgiving style just like BAM past
the turkey give me some USB what's going
on all right so I was walking through
the south hall and i came across pop off
okay company we all know and love and
what we actually found was they came out
with their hauppauge HD PVR and what
this little box does is it will take HD
from your cable or satellite sources and
it will actually record high-definition
content and it actually will take it and
put it in h.264 so that you can then
edit it okay so that's going to be super
happy for consoles as well because h.264
seems to be you know the pretty much
standard possible your ps3 your your
xbox 360 yeah I mean you know how much
has been making you know these products
/ you know a really a lot of time and
this is really the first one that
they've come out with it isn't it's not
a tuner it's just a capture box and will
allow you to take that footage and
bring it in how do we interface with it
USB and it's not optical and I includes
on a bunt a bunch of award-winning
software that the guys have have
developed in it so do I operated with
the remote doesn't get on my network
it's got what mates no it's not a remote
it's just you or it's not another
network that you've got a remote okay so
I mean it's you're watching the tubes
you know something on exam it's an
interface box great so in a computer
then and then it comes out and then
h.264 nice so it's got its own internal
storage or I pop mass storage you know I
don't believe so it's just a box that
actually takes it in puts it in your
computer moving on well okay I ran
across this little guy and the first
time I saw him I thought he must have
been like a digital camera or a webcam
or something like that he's a projector
a little mini micro projector by next
time it's amazing honey i shrunk the
projector yes honey i shrunk the
projector he fits in the palm of your
hand he's super super small and he can
do images up to 20 inches and they can
do 640 by 480 you're not gonna be having
like an office meeting you know with
this probably not I mean he only lasts
for two hours battery life so it's not
it's not like super long or anything
like that I wonder if you'd like I
wonder if you have to take that and I
like project it onto like the back seat
of like your airplane like in front the
seat in front of you Oh that'd be nice
so yeah so you won't have to pay six
dollars for that movie exacto SD I like
it already ya got micro SD USB has AV
input it's mp4 compatible which is
pretty cool okay so you can put your
mpeg-4 files on here and then so you
don't even need to bring a laptop you
just export out your key notes onto an
mpeg-4 file and then BAM you just take
it to your meeting I mean that's really
lightweight I like it oh it looks I am
imagining this is quite expensive it's
srp to 19
but I heard it might be a little bit
less yeah well for 299 you can get
that's that's about your entry level for
your your standard corporate like you
know board meeting I've got this is this
is so you don't have that mean if you've
got your you know a standard you know
ipod or anything like that the problem
is you have you know a tiny little
screen okay 20 inches is a good that big
yeah that's late on inner side that's
that yeah I mean won't 20 inch monitor
rather watch your movie on a 20 inch
monitor then or you know you can take it
on the screen with you and say like you
got you know you don't want to watch the
in-flight movie you just kind of lean
back obviously not enough on american
airlines but you lean back and you just
project it right onto the ceiling how's
that great or the seat back in front of
you or the stewardess exactly it's cute
and he comes with all the things that
you need a little stand it comes with a
little tripod everything like that lose
my dreams so he's good to go rock on or
you can get chris to be your human
tripod and just you know carry your
cameras because somebody didn't pack
type odds but whatever that's all right
tripods okay I got kind of a silly one
here this one's a lot of fun it is made
by by liquid image and this is what is
that this is a I can just go and put it
on because it looks so much fun yeah
look at this all right you got that I am
what point you gotta put your out it's
not even on right yeah am I not wearing
right you gotta put your knowing the man
over there ok this is the scuba series
HD 320 it is a scuba mask that records
HD video we have a camera up here in the
brow and controls over here on the right
side and I can record HD at 720p for how
long well it takes micro SD so I think I
think it's got six yes got 64 Meg's
internal so not going to get you much on
the HD so definitely get messy hard
enough yeah all right and it gets better
check this out right uh-huh yeah get a
get boson okay oh my god okay so now
we're like light goodnight now we got
like emergency mode right check this
you're good I'm that should be blank no
you're not black not like hey god oh my
god yeah yeah as I you're gonna get
something out the cameras there all
right all right so anyway cut it looks
pretty easy enough to use what happens
when you uh when you press these buttons
up here it actually because I mean
you're you're diving you don't have like
a heads up the right way or anything how
do you know you're recording how do you
know you took the picture real quick on
women's the show so i press this and
it's probably going to be really
difficult to show up here but one light
or something yes so when the light is
red you've taken a picture and then
blinks right and then when you're
recording video you switch it over video
mode it's blue it blinks when you record
the video so you know it's a cool thing
for somebody that is actually going to
use it yeah well okay here's here's the
way I really feel about this right um
I'm trying to figure out how practical
it is right okay they start at there's
this is the HD model right are they
start at a hundred dollars for the
standard definition and they go up from
there spec-wise it the iso is only 100
200 it's f 2.8 I'm sorry get really
geeky here but for the people they care
f 2.8 and it's only a one well actually
it's a while it's a 12 second of an inch
ccd so it's actually you know not bad
size the ccd i mean some of the cameras
that we've been recording here or art
health sixth inch right um it's all
right i mean it's comforting i don't
know what I'm not a scuba diver I mean
but if I were I would be wearing one of
those take my videos what a figure is on
the HD one it's a little pricey and I'm
like if you're really like I mean I
understand the convenience if you're
like going around you want to hold a
camera but I don't know I yeah I would
imagine if I was see this is the one
that that can go what is it like 100
meters something like that this is like
Navy SEAL reconnaissance operations here
yeah you know cut some underwater
internet tubes and get your packet
sniffing on like the NSA exactly that's
all right so I've got a product and I'm
really stoked about and you might you
might ask yourself well why oh yeah Matt
went crazy when I I like walked by and I
told myself I'm like did I just see what
I thought I uh I think that's a like a
mac with like mac notebook with two
displays external displays running on at
work I have to 24 inch displays that I
actually want to use okay but can't
because of the mac limitation enter
right the triton see too extreme okay
okay this little guy will actually take
a USB connection to your computer and
will then pipe video out of this
external DVI at a resolution of up to
1920 x 1200 ok wow I can now use both of
my 24 inch monitors so I now have my Mac
20 it might write 15 inch imac 24 it
basically got a USB video card now yes
okay so I'm assuming you're probably not
going to be getting your crisis on you
can it's just another I mean that the
damages bandwidth to do the crisis
really like the the video games and
whatnot a real quick yeah this guy you
could hook five of these up to a single
computer and have six displays running
at 6i because you because if you really
just want to crash to you about
something serious like how much
bandwidth do you really think that I
mean we getting advertised well let's
get five in and see because I would love
to do like a tow ball and I can really
build his video wall halls been asking
us for this damn video wall for the
longest time you've got to drink when
you're following along at home anytime
we mentioned Paul and bitch about him
when he can't say anything camera cell
anyway took it home yes but Triton
technologies and I am as soon as we get
back from CES if Aaron's over there if
he doesn't see me like slip this in my
pocket yeah I have to go buy one see if
he caught me all right very neat that's
well give me an idea of the price is it
out what's the UH they're both out and
they they range in price really from
anywhere from like ninety nine dollars
to you know 200 bucks depending on the
different they have like docking
stations and you know all kind of stuff
so if you go to the website Triton
technologies
it finally exactly what you want sorry
Darren's ultimate word on it neato max
okay neato max no more all right thank
you you've got some weird ergonomic toys
here that are totally baffling the mind
yeah it's not a keyboard no it goes in
front of one and it's not exactly a
mouse it's called the roller mouse pro
is brand brand new I mean it was like
the best product of the year with the
ergonomics convention this year because
it's good for people that I have your
convention for that yes hey they've got
dentist convention and everything we go
to hacker cons come on they have this
convention and yeah it's really really
good for anybody who has like carpal
tunnel or arthritis anything wrong with
their wrists I've seen one of these were
so this is just a wrist rest for your
keyboard not exactly so it's it's a
mouse okay basically so all you're gonna
do is you're gonna have your keyboard up
here right instead of having to reach
over and clutch your mouse every time
and get your hand all tired because you
have to do that back and forth you're
going to just be able to reach down and
start moving this up and down open to
sideways diagonal it's your mouse this
bar right here is your mouse and these
are your left click right click and your
middle and your scroll me and the cool
thing about this is ambidextrous so yeah
if you're a lefty already it doesn't
matter if one hand gets tired you can
move to the your left hand well it
wouldn't be such a great thing for a
gamer no I can't imagine trying to get
my frog on with that I haven't seen one
as nice as this I mean there's you know
brand excuse me there's some off-brand
like officemax and staples ones but I've
seen you know people use them with great
precision you know and you just go
through and they it's like using a mouse
to us is you that you know this is
second nature today here okay also I'm
like I'm typing and I'm just like Oh
with like my thumbs or whatnot and I'm
like baseball and jump and then like
look around and shoot I ain't so it's
very simple to use it's just a very cool
project I think it was neat uh you know
this is the reason why you guys always
get on me about this I'm like ah dunno
you just alter base on them see and then
you like alt tab and then ctrl shift
escaping
okay dominate you always I am like well
you know why the reason being is I'm so
tired of the you know I got my keyboard
here and then I'm like mouse mouse and
I'm like whatever I just need to like
move around explore move around begs
just I know it's it's such a pain in the
ass goin from your mouth imagine that
might have a learning curve yeah yeah
any idea price I think it's a little bit
over 100 bucks for this okay so what I
mean if it's gonna save you a trip to
the hospital it seems you like so many
hospital bills so hey go with it or you
could move the Canada and get that free
stuff right so I'm assuming this is like
big brother cuz you brought have big
brother and little brother oh these are
the contour mouse okay mice mice they're
made by the same people their USB plug
and play you just plug them in and start
using them now does that would feel a
little big or is it pretty comfortable
on use a little big oh yeah I don't like
it see the way that they do this is they
measure your hand from the tip of your
middle finger all the way down and they
figure out what size you need to use for
either your left hand or your right hand
well what's nice though you notice that
doesn't know somebody witness well never
met what's really interesting the laser
you notice the placement a little higher
than standard right so so you can
instead of moving your whole hand I
don't know if that's good or bad
actually no no you definitely have to
move this at all all right you know yeah
you barely have to move it at all and
you can't change my specs if you want to
on your computer for this my mouse it
sounds good what's that what's a
beautiful little goodie over there this
and I am I want to thank Bob for
actually letting us use this this is
actually a a pre-production well you can
see the board underneath yeah Wow
equally storage device the the cable
that it comes with is is different
obviously because they need to make sure
that you're not a dumb user and trying
to put an AGP card in a pcie graphics
lot yeah I don't you know when we were
doing some tests with Bob we were
getting about 255 megabytes per second
well I cattle drive on no this is a 64
oh it's an SSD
yes nice so inside here is the actual
circuitry for the USB 3 host device and
it's blisteringly fast I mean you know
your think about it 255 megabytes per
second real world performance yeah well
give you an idea in this so like i'm
downloading a hard drive low to compare
it to it's you know little brother like
your standard SATA drive 7200 you know
nothing crazy right well forty megabytes
a second yeah that's doing like that
yeah i mean let's think about it this
way they they've advanced the specs so
far okay USB 2 is 480 megabits USB 3 is
5 gigabits yeah that's a little bit
higher than firewire a little bit just a
bit just well what we don't put
those in laptops anymore anywhere late
Steve Jobs doesn't so you know I see
what's happening here exactly it's I
mean and they haven't even finalized the
revision you know of this board here
okay so they're still working on it but
yesterday Bob showed me two hundred
fifty five megabytes a second so I was
pretty much blown away and I can't I'm
gonna get a rate of those because I want
a really fast boot up time I sure yeah
thank you get on that all right yeah
right yeah all right uh you know one of
my favorite things in life yes yeah I'm
kind of like a little netbook or if you
will toys well hey listen Tonka toys are
becoming the the hot new thing all right
so I know you getting with the epc
701 the first gen I'm a little defensive
about it because I love my little
computers love your little obvious it's
so cute yes yes and you know I've been
rocking the acer aspire one but looking
at the triple ee again looking at us
who's this is the new t91 epc and this
guy is itsy-bitsy just like the 701 got
a it's actually got a decent sized
screen here it's a a I'm sorry this is a
8.9 inch screen it's LED backlit it's
got an atom z520 processor its 990 grams
which in the lower third has that
converted for American
right right and it has the option I love
this for I don't understand why a TV
tuner but gps as well right so but
here's the kicker right okay so it still
got the the chiclet keyboard that you
would find on your your come on hey
sausage it's all alright let's just come
up with the shift key already anyway I
digress um so it only use the left shift
key real men use the right shift key and
whatever but ok here's where it gets
cool right haha yes so and we have your
I finally do stabbed there's no you know
what I've always wanted right it comes
with uh yeah I'm a little bit of a no no
no we're not Star Trek doors right but
do you remember like the there's the
duty roster sir you know this is its
slowly getting to finally be an in touch
screen we got a little stylist here um I
would love to you know who needs a
kindle right you got one of these I'm
done I don't know if I can get past the
keyboard but that's that's a personal
problem with me and my large hands but
that's the way I was made but you're
young rich snobs don't break it oh yeah
this is probably not a good idea great
so date anyway it is going to be either
Wow said it was going to be under 600
yes that's probably not with the options
for the gps and nobody to the tablet
itself is going to start at about a
little less than 600 bucks and q1 so
gonna give you one March cells when you
guys actually do Lowen oh yeah so I've
got one real quick thing here sorry if I
rub my mic this is a shuttle it's part
of their display line of you know show
kind of things that's got a touch screen
and all the tests screamer feels on the
side that you guys can see external
monitor out as well and Christmas Chris
was walking by and he said you know it's
it's something that I could put in my
grandmother's house
mm-hmm and because it is touchscreen I
mean you know you go through and you can
get you know your email on and you know
watch videos on it and stuff like that
so it's it's something that you know it
used correctly is really going to be
able to kind of lend itself to who needs
to use it okay so I mean and oh that's
just an that's just excellent yeah so
you just know you could just you know
walking walking silently like anyway all
right so all right so that's shuttle now
we'll give you an ID on the specs of the
price of that because I know it's just
like a laptop fortunately they were not
really forthcoming uh but we will have
more info interesting I'm you know it's
got to be less than the HP oh god yeah
so yeah you see this all the time in
like banks and stuff those itsy-bitsy
thin like all-in-one computer dailies
and I remember the first gen of them
like I'm and I like gateway and stuff
there was just like please yeah I mean I
did and apparently HP trying to push it
to the corporate market but anyway what
else do you have I want that you want
what yes yes oh you can't have it
because I am yeah well it comes in it
comes in standard and it comes in toot
if you will so here kal what tokidoki is
the name tokidoki right here you go let
you talk like this wow so this is the
fujitsu life with a 20 you see if the
APC touch screen daily was just a little
too big for you I mean I understand you
know you've got itsy-bitsy fingers and
and you know space weight is a concern
this is probably well it's a notebook to
consider it's not even a notebook I
don't even know if it's a lifeboat is it
a it's a it's a lollipop yeah that's all
i know is i can use it as a big
blackberry yeah its your right you could
totally let them do an upside down here
but you're right that is one way that
you could do it it's got an atom z5 30
processor in it it's got a 5.6 inch wxga
screen a gig of ram comes with windows
vista home or basic i think and a 60 gig
hard drive
I don't know how they packed it all in
there it's got bluetooth and check this
out GPS and if that wasn't enough just
like our own suits over here yeah here's
the here we go and now now it's more
like you know here's your duty roster
yeah like I'm ready this is like an all
grown up its lucky when I was a killer
run out of the killer at eight hours of
battery life on that battery rocket well
the more hours on this it's the / true
battery it's four hours on a standard
bag oh this is claimed oh is that a yeah
wow yeah there you go just this is this
is the GPS unit and yeah and I wanted to
print my wrong it's like it's like all
of the features you're like if only
somebody would make a notebook that is
you know and you start naming specs that
are ridiculous sighs the a dick euless
features like I want the Bluetooth and
GPS on the touch screen and it only and
it has to be this small and you know
still want it to be usable and operating
system all that stuff right powerful but
not right so you get all that ridiculous
and well yeah with the ridiculous you
also get a ridiculous price tag it is
MSRP of a thousand forty nine dollars
this is a full-fledged computer mm-hmm
that yeah is smaller and probably I mean
think about it this way you were just
talking about the e yeah which is bigger
the e you don't have to type with your
thumbs I mean my blood I would prefer to
type with my thumb's rather than a
little Chiclets you're right you're
right you can go smaller might as well
get all the way right Gulf full-bore
baby alright so i don't know i i'm
intrigued by it i think it's very cute I
know it has a place for the people that
have the money to throw at this kind of
stuff and that you know so if the oh and
I'm believe it's cotton atheros chipset
so I haven't tried and we can get one in
maybe I'd see if I can a little boot a
little happiness off there and see we
could do because you can just throw that
in your pocket you can and yeah air base
ng up in my back pocket yeah but a
thousand dollars ciao we do know
when you're considering eight hundred
dollars for us machine no screw that
machine I'm gonna talk about that
machine okay that machine
is twice the size of this machine it huh
okay what is sighs I'm a cancer now what
oh yeah the size matter oh you're asking
me um uh uh depends all right right so
uh is that it are we done I think that
LOL we've got one other goody out we
talked about the audio bone yesterday
and I demoed the the underwater
headphones that would be perfect for
someone like Paul take a drink and this
is made by the manufacturer that makes
the audio bone so it's not the audiobahn
brand this is this is more for your
security type personnel all right so
we've got your ladies standard motorola
handset here and and I've got my
transmitter so say like I'm a bouncer I
mean obviously you dude you know sorry
you know that in a previous life I was
probably a bouncer just considering how
how built I am right so I'm just going
to go ahead and pop these on and just go
around your ear and so they are it's not
like the jaw thing where it sits on your
jolly it does actually go on your head
on your ears and in the back here what
we've got is a is we've got Bluetooth
right so we've got a a multi dongle
bluetooth adapter here right and this
plugs into our motorola handset right
well now this is all i need to talk this
little wireless steely and I could
probably like if I was like James Bond I
could like pop this in my cufflinks i
guess i really be inconspicuous with a
headgear but but you know if I'm the
bouncy pop it in my cufflinks I hold it
down and there I'm talking but where's
the microphone wow it's picking up the
audio from from the vibrations in my
skull okay how creepy is that a big head
a lot of money you know reverberation
going on but that's just because you
keep telling me every day how pretty I
am and I keep telling you how smart you
are Wow all right
science so yes I think it's got to know
you every yeah if you're this isn't this
isn't like a device that is I mean maybe
I've been told I'm not really sure if
it's at market if it is it's just it's
kind of like an industrial arena you
know doing doing like specialized
application oh definitely so I thought
it was neat I know you know what I would
use it for but I like the technology
that is the whole skull vibration things
I'm yeah the Moore's skull vibrations
the better I'm gonna give it I just
noticed something what's up yeah ah i
didn't want to blend a ticket for you
the failed hey i got enough feel blessed
day today alright well we want to thank
