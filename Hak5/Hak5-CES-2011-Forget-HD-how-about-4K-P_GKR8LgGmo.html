by dice.com the career hub for tech from
hak5 I'm Shannon Morse coming to you
from show stoppers at CES 2011 and
behind me we have this thing called the
4k TV and this is from Marcel networks
and I'm talking to you a mean over here
he was gonna tell me a little bit about
it so 4k is that even possible how's
that different from 1080p so it's a 4
case four times the resolution of Full
HD so you're going to have about eight
point three megapixel compared to HD
which is only 2 megapixel you know now
what make it varies you know so
obviously having four times more pixels
make you know the such a quality that
you never seen before but what is
important to realize is that consumers
consumer is buying four hundred fifty
dollars in us a digital camera that has
10 megapixel pictures resolution already
what most consumers don't realize is
that when displayed those pictures on an
HD screen it's only 2.1 megapixel so
more than 75 percent of pixel are
getting lost so we're porque is not
going to be too late to save your family
you'll be able to display the picture
and it's full resolution ok now the
infrastructure on this is kind of weird
how does this work over here because
this is kind of different forever in
what we call a severe OCD con platform
that virtual second platform enable us
to enable our customers to get the look
and feel of the products years ahead
before even the cheapest manufacturers
by doing so we can see amazing
performance like we've seen here but
more important by the time the customers
has fine-tuned all the product
requirements Marseille is delivering a
high performance low cost components
that make it happen that's awesome now
when are we planning on seeing this out
in the public and the general public as
far as we're concerned there's no reason
why did in 2012 you could not have 4k TV
yes that's awesome now I do have one
last question for you will this work
with 3d yeah absolutely actually what is
happening in the market
as you probably know we're already
moving from shutter glasses privy to
free depolarized but what you need to
understand is free depolarize is actual
resolution of we depolarize today that's
coming on the market is half of HD
resolutions book because of that reason
you must have a 4k resolution in order
to have a true 3d HD polarized solutions
excellent well thank you i mean i
greatly appreciate it i'm totally
looking forward to the 4k tvs coming out
on the market hopefully soon and if you
