free software for 3d modeling and
talking to the creator of demon saw a
free encrypted file sharing platform
also quadcopter cage matches because why
not all that and more at this time on
hak5 this episode of hak5 is brought to
you by domain.com hello welcome to
Darren kitchen my name is hak5 I'm
Shannon Morse do weekly dose of Tekken
loss you can't wait hey I just wanted to
say thank you real quick just starting
off our open house this weekend with so
much fun so thank you to everybody who
came out of course we'll have more in
the future but the quadcopter cage match
was awesome yes homeopathy like arena of
doom a 4-foot cube acrylic quadcopter
match for nanos and micros going at it
it was insane yeah uh thank you burgers
we're doing for making that happen
thanks to Sarah for cooking the burgers
yes amazing it was great to get
everybody out just have like a gold
fashion like you know quadcopter cage
match barbecue very chill it's some 3d
printing action some people brought some
cool 3d printers no the 3d printer was
Corey I love this because doing these
meetups is really like hacking is
inherently social it always has been
whether it was you stat or IRC and just
to get everybody together and meet space
to carnivore out on meats it's good good
we also have vegan options does that way
um yes and I this kind of leads into one
of the things I'm talking about this
week because we well we got the
opportunity to build this cage match
because what we want to do is take
things like you know that the
traditional hubsan h 107 l which is like
the number one most recommended first
time quadcopter for beginners because
it's inexpensive it's easy it's got next
bumpers it's it's difficult to break and
and because of that it's fun to put into
a cage match rather than using netting
we did acrylic which makes it like all
the more forgiving and fun great they
just bounce off so funny so that leads
into some 3d printing stuff that we're
doing as well but I hear I hear don't
have any stickers for the wall yes we do
so this one's actually to you personally
Darren it says thank you darren your
support keeps me going stay strong and
enjoy your stickers actually a
motorcycle guys these are
and get from a fan this is this
motorcycle guy is hunter Honda who is an
awesome motorcycle video blogger oh I
supported by getting his too cuz I want
his stickers on our show he's great so
his wall terrific and so many other
motorcycle video bloggers Aaron's a
total fanboy I kind of am i am totally
yes and then we also had one of our
viewers over at open house gave us all
these this is not a camera stickers so I
think we should put one of these on this
end love those I have one of those only
camera their son and I thing on my car
the did the eff make those is that is it
who was oh I don't remember that's in
austin right there group right there
alright perfect so with all of that you
want to get some three modeling going uh
yeah I do I'm so interested in this I
totally understand how to do you know
slicer but I've never actually been able
to create my own models right so we're
familiar with and we've talked about
this a bit in the past when we get into
3d printing to make all sorts of little
doohickeys that it's great to be able to
go over to thing of Earth grab yourself
an STL file import it as we are right
here into our in this case i'm using
matter control but whatever your other
you know engine is and you know just hit
generate and go ahead and you know
create your model edit your slice
settings and off to the printer it goes
but what if you need something custom
and that's what happened in this case
where we were putting together an
acrylic cube it's a four foot by four
foot by four foot using quarter inch
acrylic it's extruded acrylic so it's
pretty good and and not too expensive
and basically i wanted to be able to put
it together like lego so that we can
take it apart and say maybe I don't know
take it to DEFCON or something there'd
be a lot of fun and as such I needed
some parts there are some things on
Thingiverse that are kind of will fit
fit the bill but not not really what I
wanted so I needed to do some 3d
modeling and while it is here i'll give
you these those are the finished legos
yeah kind of and these are just printed
out of abs but i have some experience
doing 3d modeling from what 3d studio
max I'm very used to like a for pain
old-school display
things like autocad and things about
nature I really I'm very familiar with
but things have like totally changed
since the last time I did those and
while I would love to use an open source
tool like blender for example is the
only that comes to mind it's really not
I don't I wouldn't say it's really made
for this kind of precision stuff it's
more for like character animation and
things of that nature although I have
successfully use blender in the past to
do some video editing so you can find
that over at blender org and it is kind
of like the most notable 3d modeling
software that's open source and it's
pretty it's good stuff but for this I
need some something a little different
and I've talked about autodesk 1 2 3 DS
stuff before we did 1 2 3 d catch where
we were able to use photographs to
create a 3d model of a lighthouse rig
out in the Santa's arrival well they
also make another application called 12
3d design and very similarly it is free
software for mac and pc mac and windows
and ipad for some reason and it's
ridiculously easy and that's why i
wanted to point this out because in just
a matter of minutes i was able to kind
of mock up these these pieces print them
and fit them and say hey that works so
grab yourself a micrometer if you need
and otherwise here's the software this
is one of the end pieces and it's a
single pane program i haven't figured
out a way to get it to do like a for
pain like I'm used to where you have
like a top view and a left view in a
front view but you can get those by
hitting these up in the upper right
rotating around and otherwise the thing
that I just love about this is how quick
it is to model so you start with
primitives so I can just take make a box
or sphere or cylinder so I'll grab a box
and before I drop it down I can actually
choose I want it to be 0 40 millimeters
by 10 millimeters by 60 millimeters cool
and there we go and i can now like
attach this to the other box if i wanted
to by just selecting it and hitting
control
he and I really love this this the way
that they've set this up to move objects
around you just hover over your
basically like this this would be up and
down this would be easy access and over
here with Y or X and awesome you can
really easily get it into place and
what's what's cool about this is the
grid snapping really works I love a good
grid snap this is all done in
millimeters we see we've got these
overlapping here which may be what I
want may not be and then another cool
way to actually manipulate the objects
is with the push so if you hit p and
select a facet you can then pull a facet
in or out so i can now get it snapped on
exactly where I want and maybe I want it
to be just a little wider so I'll choose
P again drag this out until it matches
and it's really interesting because it
by default it's snapping 21 millimeter
but if i want i can zoom in and the more
you zoom the more precise it becomes so
you can do like a tenth of a millimeter
if you get in all the way so if I hit
this now and hit ctrl T I can drag this
guy over a little bit at a time until it
lines up and another really cool thing
about this is as far as doing boolean
operations they've made it pretty simple
so if i wanted to for instance combine
these objects i could just select merge
select the objects that i want to merge
and press enter and now they are one
object that's kool and likewise if i
also want to take a cut out of something
so i'll create like a new box here and
i'm going to make it pink so that it's
easier to see and change the material
over there i can now control t move this
guy over get a better view on it it is a
little weird to get used to the whole
like one pane view thing but I know that
that's pretty common nowadays with 3d
modeling software so get that guy where
I want him this is a far cry from Maya
and then maybe push this guy in a
little bit more so he jets right through
and so now what we're going to do is
similarly to the boolean operation that
allows me to merge we can actually do a
subtraction where I can choose subtract
and then choose the two objects press
Enter when you've made your selection
whoops and I made it in reverse so
that's another thing is you might want
to play around with which object to
select first and there we go and now I
have a hole through this object as if
you know we just removed it yeah yeah so
those were just a couple of things that
I noticed about 12 3d design that made
it ridiculously easy to get started in
modeling I love the be the the precision
the ability to you know say okay I know
but based on the readings of my
micrometer that this is you know six
millimeters wide so I want to make a
channel that's exactly six millimeters
wide and I want to have say i don't know
like 20 millimeters wide total and so i
can like sink an object in and do
subtractions and and get that exact
channel that i want and then start
playing around with it because
everything gets a little bit different
ones you can get into the real world of
course do yeah once you actually print
it out and realize that it's not exact
but then again I'm also just using a
consumer like robo 3d or one 3d printer
so that may be it as well I'm also just
using abs or I'm sorry PLA but it looks
like micrometer zar a pretty decent
price on Amazon oh yeah absolutely this
is definitely something that can be in
your your geeky toolkit and then one
other real quick thing about this is or
if you just hit are you can drop down
ruler this they've actually expanded on
this feature here recently and it can
just drop this ruler anywhere select the
object and immediately get its
dimensions so I can see that it's 45
millimeters wide here 45 millimeters
wide there it's 60 millimeters tall and
things of that nature so as far as like
intricate designs I think this was you
know like I went into it knowing nothing
and it took maybe an hour to get super
comfortable with it and actually start
printing out pieces that lock together
and did exactly what I wanted them to do
so for that did you just create the save
file in the program and you were just
able to export it
up into a lake slicer or something right
so it has the ability to you can either
save it to their cloud or to your
computer and it saves it as a
proprietary format specific to one to 3d
design however you do have the option to
export and you can export here as a
standard stl that's a file that you be
normally using for 3d printing and I
don't see any other like there's not dxf
I don't think but they also have like if
you just hit 3d print it's going to ask
you you want to install their 3d
printing software which would be an
alternative it's called the autodesk
meshmixer for 3d printing and you know
i'm happy enough with matter control
that i don't necessarily want to do that
but i wanted to throw this out there
because i had a great experience with it
and i really enjoyed building things
with it so now i can let go and just put
these STL's on Thingiverse for everybody
else to enjoy yeah although I will be
probably completely redesigning the cube
for the next one especially since we're
going to do I don't want to give too
much away we're going to make we're
gonna make the arena even so I
challenging we should probably show them
the quadcopter deathmatch yes that we
created huh yes it was epic fun as you
can see and really the thing that I'm
super happy about it is like everybody
could just run up to and be like oh I
see how this works immediately start
battling we had was great we had some
really fun Last Man Standing zwi had one
view one's going on that were a lot of
fun we're going to add a new version
which would be a kind of king of the
hill tower defense sort of version and
yeah just i love how everybody could
just like jump in and with very little
quadcopter experience in fact allison
one of the winners who got you know
domain.com sent us a bunch of stuff to
give away like quadcopters and bunch of
other swag Amanda it's Allison no I'm
terrible with yeah I'm ruining
everything and that and that is why you
tune in to hack five hahaha but yeah she
did one yes it was so good it was very
newbie friendly because the quadcopters
just with their bumpers and with it
being acrylic instead of mesh just
bounce right off so I'm gonna be
redesigning this here soon but these are
available and
have links to the to the thingy verse
for all the thingy thingies we're going
to take a break but we will be right
back domain com and doc club came to
hak5 with a great idea build a club all
about learning stuff making things and
having fun so we've been hosting open
houses at the hak5 warehouse through
hack house club and with the help of
domain calm and da club we've taken it
to the next level with a quadcopter
arena of doom from LAN parties drone
racing in battle arenas to 3d printing
software-defined radios and let's not
forget BBQ hacking is just plain better
when it's social doc club gets it and
they are the perfect social domain
whether it's IRC or clubs in RL it's all
about coming together and having fun so
what that our domain to do it then a doc
club it's perfect because a doc club is
universally and globally understood so
if you're looking for the ultimate
social domain consider a dark club so
join us this summer in the San Francisco
Bay Area and bring your mini quad copter
to the arena for drone battle club we're
setting up the leaderboard so show us
what you've got and what's your dock
clock let us know and we'll share it
with the hak5 audience has helped spread
the word get yours over at domain.com /
club there only 999 a year and there are
thousands of great domains available and
be sure to use the coupon code hak5 to
get fifteen percent off and let them
know we sent you so when you think
domain names think domain.com boy have
we come a long way since the days of
Napster and here to find out about the
latest in file sharing with little
encryption is aja aja demon saw man you
guys are getting a ton of press since
Def Con tell me about how are you man oh
great thanks Darren um you know it was
awesome meeting guys and hanging out at
Def Con 23 and it really has been
amazing I'm really really excited about
demon saw 2 point 0 which which we
launched it def con and been getting
some cool press and some good articles
most exciting of all though is that
people are really loving the product
which for me is the founder of demon saw
and and I wrote all the code to it feels
really really good when when people
cannot
you know they just say they love it
thank you very much and it's really
exciting i I'm having a great time so
far it's weird actually for us to have
like vendors on hak5 we don't
conditionally do that but it was really
cool geeking out with you because you're
the hacker behind the scenes that it's
actually coding this and your experience
comes from what game development right
so um I have about 15 years in software
engineering and it goes all the way back
to to kind of early days kind of that
really the birth of Napster kind of back
two thousand 1999 and I I was an
independent contractor I was the
portfolio architect of American
Express's online security division I you
know I dabbled here and there was a
hacker for fun and then the last seven
years I've been in game programming
pretty much all C++ but a little job
along the way and I just thought game
programming would be fun and challenging
and it's been all that but the last two
years demon saw has been my hobby and I
think it's really taken all of the last
15 years to us to make even saw what it
is today so we keep on mentioning Damon
saw and I know that you know there's
probably two people out there who
haven't used it yet so for them what is
demons all uh you saw the easiest way I
found to describe it is demon saw is a
secure and anonymous decentralized
private cloud so that's kind of the best
way I've found to really describe it to
people who are new to it now it's much
more than that as well it can it can be
a global file sharing network as well
that can scale up to ten to thousands of
people but the best way to describe it
is it's really a private decentralized
cloud that you control um there's two
goals I set out when make a diamond saw
and that was I want to make security
easy one of the problems with security
is it's so hard if you're not a geek you
just take PGP for example I mean just
being able to encrypt your email is so
much work now there are some hardcore
hackers and geeks that are going to be
watching this that are going to be like
you just use this and this and this
that's true but I think if my mom or my
sister or people who don't go to DEFCON
it really is hard to encrypt your emails
so number one make securing easy and
number two I really wanted to empower
the individual with diamond saw I wanted
to give control back to you
everybody I didn't want third parties
corporations to host our data I didn't
want the government to snoop on us I
really wanted to make us powerful again
and those are those are really my two
goals for yourself so what would you say
is the biggest difference between demon
saw and say a bittorrent client because
as I was playing with it I noticed that
it's so easy to just you know log into
another client and see what kind of
files they have available for download
so it's very similar and that kind of
weight from a consumer perspective kind
of almost like BitTorrent sync very
freaking yes your solar at your
apartment how Liz demons all different
okay well BitTorrent sync and drop off
both share a lot of commonalities with
even saw the difference though is that
on dropbox as a centralized solution so
it's very client-server model right so
you go to their server as you host your
stuff there and BTW sink is is all
peer-to-peer where demon stall is not
either in fact you could describe
diamond saws a little bit of both but
really not either of them as well so
even saw it takes the best from things
like Napster and BTW sink and dropbox
and it kind of it just discards all the
stuff that we didn't like so it's not
demon cells not peer to peer at all and
that I think is one of the biggest
difference from like a utorrent or dt
sync but it's also not client-server it
is what I call a hybrid private cloud or
decentralize cosmetic it kind of a new
concept well what what makes it well
what makes it different because I
understand that you run an instance like
if we wanted to have our own here back
five warehouse we would set up one of
the machines to run like maybe a linux
server or something to run a router as
you guys call it and so we would have
now have our demon saw router and all of
our clients would then connect to it but
from what I'm understanding from reading
your documentation it seems like all of
the data then goes through that router
yeah so what and that's a great question
so what really makes even smells
different is you can have as many
routers as you want so like a
traditional client server Network where
you pretty much have a primary server or
maybe you do load balancing at a at a
hardware network layer with daemon saw
you you connect to a given router and
then all of your file transfer can be
spread across the world so with even saw
two point oh you would you would all
your friends would have to connect to
one router so if you guys wanted to set
up the amidst all which
by the way you're more than welcome to
do this totally free you would install
one weather router and set it up to be
the message router and then all your
clients would connect to that and you
can set up 10 20 30 other routers in the
office that were data routers that just
transfer the file data so by doing that
you can scale enormously irrespective of
the total number of clients connected to
the network now that's the first cool
thing with 2 point 0 with three point 0
which I'm working on now I'm going to
have routers that can group together but
you'll be able to connect to router a
Shannon will be able to connect to
router be and I'll be able to connect to
router see and if they know about each
other we could all join a huge global
group and not have to join the same
router so you have more redundancy built
in you have more fault tolerance and
that's where we're going with
three-point oh um so it allows you to be
in control of how you want to set up
your network and really the sky's limit
I mean I don't dictate how you have to
set it up it sounds kind of similar to
the functionality of tour but cooler
yeah if so obviously I tip my hat to
tour because making something like this
I'm standing on the shoulders of giants
obviously so the Napster is the utorrent
the tours the drop boxes um you know
obviously have been influenced by all
these technologies and architectural
designs so it is it is very Torah
has an exit node deal but it's totally
encrypted and i'm sure you guys going to
ask questions about social crypto later
on but it has a very unique user defined
crypto model that once again keeps you
and control you don't need private and
public sorts to used in assault which is
super cool well actually from what I'm
understanding about it you're really
abstracting some of those things and
maybe you can kind of touch on for
instance how this like profile images or
icons work and what that plays into
cryptography and I guess that's one of
the maybe that is one of the
underpinning things of what's making it
social crypto because again as Sebastian
but he goes he's taking a look at he
asks me he's like is this crypto for
stupid people well kryptos really really
hard like I that the gentleman who spoke
after me at Def Con was Bruce Schneier
you know a cryptographer a true unlike a
legend in the crypto field I will never
be as smart
respect to crypto is Bruce you know he's
devoted a whole life but many of us well
I'm sure he would be the first to admit
that he has so much to learn so it's it
can very well be crypto for people who
don't have a strong technical background
but it's also very strong crypto and
another it's right it's it's not a roll
your own crypto I don't replace
algorithms I don't replace hashes we use
all the standard stuff the only
difference is is really how we generate
the input entropy that we used for
cryptographic derivation later on in the
chain so that's really the key
differentiating factor with social
crypto so we say that we will never be
as smart as Bruce Schneier why is the
product closed source instead of going
open source with this and then all the
British tires of the world can
contribute okay so that's so that's a
great question um and I'd be a liar if I
said I didn't get that question all the
time it is I open source some of the
crib the lower level crypto layer I in
human saw 2 point 0 is completely open
source map I kind of the subset of the
cold I called demon pricks and you can
get that at github com flash aegislash
decrypt that shows all of the lower
level crypto wrappers and it basically
face all the crypto the demons all uses
um the rest of the code hasn't been open
source yet really for just a couple of
reasons um number one is I I'm trying to
figure out where to go next with you and
saw I mean and I think that's the honest
answer is um you know it's open sourcing
at the very very powerful thing like I
talked about standing on the shoulders
of giants before linux boost a plus+
crypto PP a lot of these libraries have
been open source that that even thought
uses and I wouldn't be able to create
demon thought without the contribution
to people who believed in open source I
also believe in open course my what I'm
working on right now is trying to figure
out wins the timing for that and and
what is going to be open source because
there is there is some obviously doing a
security audit and having the code in
the open source with
benefit that as well and I know you guys
are probably probably reading your minds
and you're asking the right question but
all of that is planned I just have to do
at the right time right now this has
been a labor of love and it's kind of
exploded so I'm taking a moment right
now post DEFCON just to kind of get my
bearing and figure out what am I going
to do and honestly I have no idea what
i'm going to do i'm still trying to
catch my breath in Def Con but I love
the open source community um I I want to
contribute as much as i can to open
source so it's just a matter of time
there's even been some rumors that I
might be open sourcing the version 1
point 0 soon that's it's been deprecated
it's the c-sharp version but the
protocols the same so theoretically
somebody could take it and write a
c-sharp version of a client so there's
even that that I'm thinking of but I
want to make sure when I do it it's the
correct way of doing it creature that
can never be I've got that's awesome
yeah take it nice and slow I'm glad that
you mentioned auditing too because I was
gonna ask you about that but moving on
since you do have that on the horizon I
also know that your partner partnered
with John McAfee of mcafee security so I
wanted to find out are you considering
like a commercial enterprise with this
or a commercial future for demons all
that's a great question so number one is
john is a very supportive partner John
has been a strong advocate for privacy
and information security for a long long
time and privacy is important i know you
guys are firm believers and privacy as
well and privacy is getting more and
more important as we lose more and more
of our personal information and we lose
our data online and there's more and
more breaches like have the you know
recent adultfriendfinder bridge and you
know some of the other breaches are we
going on so privacy is important because
when we put our data in the hands of
corporations and they get hat there's no
accountability I mean they don't have to
pay any penalty for losing our data so
in terms of my partnership of John
McAfee it just made sense you know he
and I think very similar with respect to
privacy and surrounding myself with
people who think in the same way as I do
it has only made me a better programmer
and a better founder for demon soft so
to answer your commercial question on
the consumer version of daemon saw which
is what
available now we're always and forever
be totally free it will never have ads
it was never bundle software it will
never root your machine it will never
bind the machine for bitcoins and yes
that is a poke and a jab at utorrent oh
yeah it will always be what I've said
and that's totally honest it will be
available for free forever whether or
not i end up open sourcing it that's my
commitment to the community I want to do
demon self whole time that's my ultimate
goal the reality of that is I've made
zero money off the demon thought and
it's not a very good monetization model
to give a big way totally well you give
it away for free and then you just make
it up on volume right my passion a
million times zero is a much bigger
number than zero you gotta carry the two
but yes so okay let's go back to the
nuts and bolts of it because that's
already has techies that's a really
interesting part here because there are
a lot of different you know open
specifications for different ways to do
these sorts of things but you're going
at it in this novel way and it's where
how I don't know if you've coined this
but you're using the term social crypto
I want to come back to these profile
icon thing because what exactly like as
a user how do how do adding profile
icons add security and what benefits do
they have for me that's a great question
well this goes back to how we make
security if if we have people using
daemon problems don't know anything
about PB kdf or H max which they
probably a lot of them don't then how do
we allow them to to secure their
accounts and secure their communications
in their file transfer um the best way
to go about making security disease not
to have to have people remember anything
new no passwords no user IDs no passes
no public key nonsense the best thing we
can leverage is what's already in their
minds and everybody uses the internet
and everybody understands websites and
web addresses what we call you our eyes
or URLs so I spoke to my mom about this
just to test out social crypto before I
wrote the code and I asked her for a
list of three websites she goes to every
day and she listed
websites a B and C and then I talked to
her about what I was doing with D
mehsana geeked her out of arch and I
confused her and then at the end of the
ten minutes I went back to her and I
said can you name off in the same or
during those three websites again and
she nailed it no problem so by using
websites or web addresses now doesn't
have to just be a web address it could
be a URL for an image or a PDF or it can
be a local file but by using these these
pathing approaches um people already
know where they like to go they already
know about you and saw calm or about
reddit com or CNN com or whatever it
might be so by using what they already
know we can we can then link that to the
ones and zeros that are behind these is
website so the HTML pages or the the
JPEGs or the PNG files or the pdfs and
we could suck in all those bites those
ones and zeros that comprise the file
and then we can feed those into
cryptographic routines like
password-based key derivation function
or H max or some of these more
cryptographic routines to generate a key
or a series of keys that Luke we can use
to create ciphers like a s or Mars or RC
six and encrypt and decrypt our data so
are you using the actual URL to generate
the key or using the contents that the
URL brings you two to generate the keys
the contents of the file and that's the
clear distinguishing factor because
right now a lot of people will generate
keys from passphrases important when you
use PB kdf to generate a passphrase you
give it a certain amount of entropy a
certain bits of entropy otherwise it
might otherwise you might open yourself
up to collision hash collisions later on
so i'm using the content of whatever you
reference in the URL so if your
reference an HTML page i'm using the
ones and zeros that make up that if you
reference PNG file i'm using the ones
and zeros this can be as if it can be an
executable it can be demon song com it
can be whatever you want which is great
because there's so much content in the
internet that we won't ever be able to
map it in fact one could argue that the
greatest source of entropy we have today
is
the world wide web and that's the that's
the argument I make now in and of itself
those ones and zeros are not random but
by eating them through a bunch of
algorithms adding salts plugging in the
end through PB kdf increasing the
iteration we're able to derive very
cryptographic keys that we can then use
to encrypt and demon cell support
multiple layers of this so once again if
you have if you're Edward Snowden and
you want to transfer state secrets to
Glenn Greenwald then you can do so at
the proper level of security to meet
your needs but if you're my mom wanting
to share pictures of her grandchildren
with cousins then obviously we can keep
we can customized emits automate that
specifically are you not oh go ahead are
you implementing perfect forward secrecy
with this as well perfect forward
secrecy is implemented through the
initial handshake which uses pity helmet
so the clients do an initial
diffie-hellman handshake there's
multiple multiple levels and layers of
encryption one of them is the very first
the very first exchanges between the
client in the router or routers and
there is perfect that they're perfect
forward secrecy with that via gifi
helmet which means that if any given key
is compromised and decide the whole
thing hasn't gotten held is awesome
great sounds like it's an interesting
use of you know like you said your mom
can remember URLs use those as if key
files like in true crypt or something
like that and to do the encryption of
the file in transit and I'm assuming as
the file goes through your data routers
because as you say like it's it's a
peer-to-peer system but you're also
running through routers so these data
routers have a copy of them in their
memory as they go through but the
encrypted copy so you're really just
providing the means for people to make
those diffie-hellman handshakes and
whatnot in a more social fashion I
school yeah yeah that's it so the
routers and even timing and we had a
poison router out there you know the NSA
had had kind of a gave up put up a
honeypot router or whatever and and I
was sharing files with the two of you
and we were using multiple levels of
social crypto we were encrypting our
data
they could they could know that we're
connecting via IPS assuming we didn't
have proxies or VPNs or using tor some
other technology but they wouldn't know
exactly what we were at staging now
questions have come up to about okay
well that's fine and all but what about
like deep packet inspection some of
these other things going on well with
the three-point oh I'm going to be
implementing HD HTTPS support which will
help with that to get end-to-end
encryption but once again once again the
idea behind demon sighs you be as secure
as you need to be so if you're really
worried about security then host your
own message routers host your own data
routers it all comes back to your
comfort zone and where you need to be
there are people who use public routers
in the default group with minimal
security and they're fine with that so
it's about empowering you to make good
or potentially not so good decisions but
um you you are the one who knows your
personal needs best uh but what you were
saying was essentially as far as groups
if Shannon and I both use the same URL
to like a poop emoji or whatever have
you now when we both plug them into our
clients both of our clients are going to
generate the same key so now we have
symmetric keys well then anyone else
with that link to the poop emoji is also
going to have our symmetric key and be
able to what decrypt the information in
transit right which is why we do one of
two things so you can add multiple
layers or you can tweet any of these six
or seven settings for that individual
URL like entropy percentage so how what
percentage of the bites will I use you
can change the cipher you can change the
key size you can change the pass you can
add a salt you can increment the
iteration count so now there's all these
kind of geeky friendly settings that you
can tweet as well as by adding multiple
rows the specific ordering of that it is
absolutely essential as well so you can
you can go horizontally and you can /
you can go horizontally you go
vertically in that so if my friends we
all share the same pic then the NSA has
a pic but they can also generate the key
from that and so all the NSA has to do
is like you said vertically just try all
of those iterations of it if they can do
that although did we change the entropy
percentage like
am I using 23.0 73 percent of your pic
on my end twenty three point zero seven
four percent of you pick up or it did I
add up did I add a hash like tbk tf2
with a 10,000 iteration or 10,000 one
iteration did I add a salt to that what
is myself you know the red fox jumps
over the green fence is myself so
Natalie so as you see it now real
traditional crypto kickstand now all the
traditional crypto settings people so
just using the URL it might be good
enough for baby pics mp3's word doc
stuff like that but if I'm Edward
Snowden and your Glenn Greenwald we're
going to want to get into the meat a
little bit okay but then you can have
the same problem so what you're saying
is if we just use the default settings
and you happen to have the same URL
where we derives the key well then
that'd be simple but there's all of the
twiddly bits that you can twiddle but
now I have to tell Edward Snowden watch
bits to twiddle yep and I was talking to
Sean Gallagher at DEFCON for Allah the
IT editor of ARS technica he was going
into some level detail like what
reporters and whistleblowers and you
guys probably familiar with this what
they have to go through to kind of do
initial handshakes and here's how we're
going to communicate here's the
protocols we're going to use so there's
already a lot of this out of band kind
of finagling going on with with
recorders and whistleblowers and even
even in citizen for there's a lot of
that going on so the idea here is right
now you would use similar protocols in
existence and just replace the software
instead of the WikiLeaks upload software
you could use to even saw but demon saw
is much more flexible we can put it on
our laptops we don't need infrastructure
at all with three point oh what I'm
thinking of doing is making it even
easier and having like some sort of
group export process so that maybe you
export all the configurations in a very
very crypto wrapper that i can send you
through some sort of once again possibly
secure possibly insecure out-of-band
communication that you then decrypt that
obviously opens up some other security
concerns but it does make it much easier
to configure a very complicated group as
well but you can even do it right back
into the pic image making it stand up
stand up
to do this tomography sorry that word
you know the word exactly so it once
again it goes back to however deep and
secure you need to be I provide the
facility but if you're just going to go
just on the surface then you know then
other people could get into the group
but here's the beautiful thing a demon
saw let's say that Shannon gets in our
group and wheel water in there for some
odd reason at all we're mad at her one
day um what we can do is you and I can
just change one of the bits of any of
our settings and we are in a new group
so so it's anti replication we don't
revoke her we sell provoke we just we
just move you know it's somebody being
loud the airport listing the music loud
instead of trying to convince them to
turn the volume down sometimes of these
you're just to get up and leave and
that's the idea with we would just
switch to a new group and leave her
guessing which bit did they change yes
Shannon we're gonna take our ball and
play somewhere else you can't sit with
us oh yeah that's a great question too
it's a it's an interesting novel new
approach to security and it's now keep
in mind it doesn't replace all security
use as you can imagine not it's not a
replacement for traditional corporate
face identity provider type security
models where you need the infrastructure
you need to keep key stores and the
identity authorities in stock but for
individuals and groups transitioning in
and out of relationship in a dynamic
manner and file sharing um it's it's
workable and so that's that and what
I've released with two point oh it
sounds I mean you know talking about old
school like the sounds like a lot it
sounds is easy to set up as it was in
the 90s to get on IRC f serves to
download mp3's if you kind of see where
I'm going with that exactly and with
three point oh I'm going to make it even
easier with groups so all right well you
know it sounds like you're very
passionate about this I'm sure you've
got a ton of feedback at Def Con I'm
sure we'll have a ton of feedback as
well in the comments on this video and
we just want to wish you the best to it
a you know anybody you know venturing
off creating software for the good of
man and it's just yet well no really
it's kind of epic to see the sea change
yeah that's happened in a post
an era where layer is like oh cool
that's a fun problem let's talk you
trust anybody I can trust myself I don't
know if I can trust her well but with
that I I really do want to thank you for
coming on the program where can people
find out more if they're interested in
getting getting demon saw on their
windows machines and linux boxes and
raspberry PI's what not all right well
the best way that place to go is even
saw calm you can download linux version
windows version i'm still working on the
OS 10 version right now and if you want
to get in touch with me there's a couple
of ways you can go to my twitter account
demon underscore sauce or you can send
me an email at each other e IJ aah at
demon song comp I respond to every email
I get I've got an open door policy I'm
here for you guys I'm a demon sought for
us for you for me and that's really a
what you see what you hear is what you
get I'm an honest guy so I'm w quick yes
or no are you making an Android app yes
it's part of demons not three point 0
which hopefully will be done in between
four and six months androids going to
happen as well as the ton more features
I'm excited this is just the beginning
guys you're going to see demon saw three
point oh four point oh and and and not
to give some kind of sneak peeks here
but there's some really cool
announcement that will be coming out in
the next few weeks demon saw and some
extra partnerships that I'm working on
right now so truly this is just the
beginning I'm here to stay this is what
I love doing and hopefully you love
using it well it sounds cool and it
sounds like you have a lot on your plate
that's a lot of platforms to support I'm
hoping personally that we see even if
it's not open source may be an open
specification we're like you would
looted to with one point oh they're
being ways to have some interoperability
with third-party apps yeah yeah I can
see that happening it's on the list I
just don't know where it falls in but
that they respect as well sounds great
it's great to have you on thanks for
joining us thanks guys I appreciate it
 you later bye that just about wraps
up this week's episode of hak5 but
before we get going i want to remind you
guys that we have some epic stuff going
on
of events pen test with hak5 you can
find the details over at Penn test with
hak5 calm so we're going to be having
some epic infosec training with myself
and sebastian kena and with rob fuller
AKA mu Bix we're also going to have some
TAS with you guys as well to help out
with the trainee yes that'll be really
really fun and that's number 18 through
20th are the dates so you can find out
all the information pen test at hak5 dot
or pen test with hack 5.com there we go
that's a lot of fun it really is and
it's unlike any other info SEC training
because it's very story-driven I don't
want to give anything more spoilers no
spoilers but anyway you end up becoming
part of the team and we just take down
epic evil and it's great stuff I'm not
much fun with that said we also have a
camp coming up but I can't release any
specifics about it other than to remind
you that if you are interested in
joining us for a rave style underground
hacker camp all you have to do is sign
up at Camp 503 com 503 is the HTTP
service code for service unavailable not
as in the camp is in Portland although
we may be in portland if a lot of
portland e ins sign up is that what
they're called Portlanders portland
anyway sending everybody hak5 dot org is
where you can go to find all the other
stuff yes NHA ke shop com if you want to
buy some goodies there you go yes with
all of that i'm darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse trust your techno list
stealing this
with all of that I'm Darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse trust your techno list
it's been what day Monday Oh Nick this
is for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
