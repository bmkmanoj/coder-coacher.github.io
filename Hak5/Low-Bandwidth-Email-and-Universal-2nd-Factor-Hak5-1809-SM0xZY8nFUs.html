by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is Gerren kitchen
I'm Shannon it's your weekly dose of
Technol us and I am very excused that
smell that's my Clamato she's really
good yeah we have your this is the show
where we get really caffeinated and talk
about tack we're back in the studio
today cuz we're still building out some
epic stuff in the world I really like
this studio ok I just think we need some
stickers okay oh we should have a
sticker drive we should seriously like
just put all the stickers in all the
places all right that'd be cool
yes sticker all the sticks I'm done with
that on the stakes let's find a way that
we can make it so that people can send
us stickers but yes you know what people
can actually come here to the warehouse
to learn all sorts of fun hacking now
this is very announcing it so Darren has
been working so hard on this seriously
poor guy needs a vacation and I'm sorry
you haven't had one yet but we are going
to be doing pen testing with hak5 yes
and so what that means is it's InfoSec
security training it is being done with
myself and mu bik's and Sebastian and
evil server Cammy oh yeah check this out
yeah the instructor surprise that evil
server is gonna be showing up well
here's the difference right is we're
actually rather than just like talking
at you we're doing we're calling a pen
testing with hack five for two reasons
like first of all we're going to be
using hack five gear we're actually
teaching these right here the Metasploit
framework you rubberducky the Wi-Fi
pineapple in the upcoming turtle yeah
more about that later and so so it's pen
testing with hack 5 in the sense that
we're using hack 5 gear but we're also
doing a with hack 5 of the hosts and the
you know one that movies and Sebastian
and I and we're doing a simulated pen
test engagement where you'll follow
along it's kind of like story driven
it's very much like I don't want to see
the dragons but it's it's a role-playing
adventure where you join the hack 5 red
team
and it's gonna be so exciting because
you'll learn through example right yes
we're gonna be doing the same exact
stuff we would do on a literal pen test
except it's in a simulated Network
environment and nobody can get hurt and
you're gonna see why we're doing certain
things and of course yes we'll stop
we'll pause the adventure and teach like
here's why and here's how that works and
all of that stuff but it's just so
exciting I am really really excited
about this I've never done any kind of
pen testing like that any kind of
scenarios but I've been reading so many
books about it that get me excited so I
can't wait to be there I'm gonna be in
the class yes well you know what it is
it's basically taking a lot of the stuff
that we already do but it's yeah I'd
right so we're applying the same kind of
stuff to the networked adversaries which
is wire
evil server come see ya yes adversaries
are good so check it out over at pen
test with hak5 comm it's going to be
pretty epic you can sign up now it's on
June 26th and every student will receive
300 bucks in awesome hack 5 gear so
including the the exclusive patch I
can't wait to get those patches and they
look thank you
and so yeah that's what we've been
working on yeah so very diligently very
much so thank you
we're back with the show now and we
actually got a whole lot of feedback
about you know getting your email in
just a text-only format oh hey yeah you
know what links is epic check it out I'm
in links sign into Gmail it's not signed
into my gmail it's not the most annoying
thing in the world yeah it's actually
the most annoying thing the world looks
fine like this is no no this is terrible
and this is the HTML view and it's like
really this is my reply to hey oh and
it's in it you know what no because it's
going over HTTP it's way more bandwidth
than it even needs to be right I mean in
fact if you go back to the 2013 hack
across America series you'll find an
awesome episode where I talk to some
fine folks over at a satellite modem
like service company that that does like
satellite modems and stuff and we geek
out about the ways to condense
everything down to like as few packets
as possible because it turns out
bytes are really expensive when they
have to go up to space and back down so
this is a horrible solution as far as
like low bandwidth is concerned I mean
it's better than trying to load the like
27 gigabytes that is Gmail's javascript
framework yeah it might be a gig now
Adorno they met a trimmed it down
minified it so i've been having fun with
that too but should we take a break
first maybe oh we just started but yeah
let's hey how about we ask your boy
Patrick what's going on with tech thing
that's a great idea when I get back
we're gonna get our I map on it sounds
good to me that isn't poppin coming up
on tech thing we've got a festival of
products Shannon's gonna be testing the
pet key which is like remote monitoring
laser torturing of your pets I've got
the Asus Transformer T 300 G right here
people convertibles they're kind of
interesting we got a whole bunch more
products we're gonna explain how to keep
your file streaming even when you shut
your desktop down and yes folks I will
be shaved check it out on tech thing
comm back before the Internet of Things
and social networks and dependence on
webmail we all used epic protocols like
pop and IMAP to get our ISPs mail
through clients like Eudora and Pegasus
and Thunderbird I'm here to share with
us one of the most epic ones Shannon I'm
very excited that you're diving into
pine are you excited yeah I'm excited I
even find my mail since 1995 I I i all
all just announced this year I've never
done Alpine before I started doing this
segment yeah I was kind of like this is
awesome why did I not know about this
when I was like growing up in the 90s
of course as soon as you give Shannon
anything though I gave her a shell on
one of those VPSs and you know then
everything just breaks loose right no
it's like yeah access to all the things
well you know give her a race and the
next thing you know yeah so so building
on this rather than just like used
another text-based program like links
they all some web browser we showed off
last week to just log into your Gmail we
can do it with a
quiet you can yes so I just had a putty
installed on my Windows machine and if I
just log into my Alpine computer okay so
I'm in just a regular command line and I
downloaded Alpine so that was just a
simple sudo apt-get Alpine when I enter
it it looks like this so if I just
maximize this up here you see folder
inbox no messages main menu alright so
obviously this is some kind of email
that I'm able to access over basically a
command line interface so the first
thing that you have to do whenever
you're setting this up is actually going
to your Gmail and you'll need to
configure IMAP we're not using pop in
this location we're using I'm at the
difference there would be that pop would
actually download the mail from in this
case we're using Gmail as our example
mail server because a lot of people use
that nowadays it would actually download
it from Google servers onto your in this
case shell or it could just run on your
computer locally and that's not really
recommended because now if you try to
get your email from like another
computer it's not going to be there so
I'm at this great in keeping things in
sync it still leaves them email on the
Google server so that when the FBI wants
to send a query letter and I get a copy
of it that's still there it's very
important which is why we use be gdg gdg
all right so I go into my setup for
alpine and there's a couple of things
that you need to change in here so first
you can go over to config which is the C
button and you want to change the first
three top three things so I made it just
Shannan Gmail for my personal name the
user domain is snubs e @ gmail.com and
then SMTP server is the one that's very
special it's smtp.gmail.com so this will
let you access it and that's the SMTP
server is actually what you're going to
be using to send your email yeah where
is to receive your email that's gonna go
through imap.gmail.com that's their IMAP
server very aptly named similar to the
pop server being pop Gmail com
so you'll also need to change another
thing in setup and this is under
collections list which you'll press the
L button to actually get into that and
it says you may define groups of folders
to help you better organize your mail so
you go in here and then you want to add
with the a button when you open that you
can make a nickname so I just called it
shannon gmail and then the server which
is called
imap.gmail.com / s SL / user equals and
then whatever you gmail is so for me
some bz at gmail.com and then after that
you want to hit ctrl x to save and then
e to exit back to the main page so now
everything should be set up and ready to
go right you should probably also
preface this by saying that the first
time you ever do this when you create
that profile it is going to ask you for
your password yeah well and since
Shannon and I are smart and we use
two-factor authentication yes or I could
lowered because there's no way for the
Google Authenticator to like pop up in
this client so you will actually have to
create an application-specific password
and we also noticed that there were some
errors when I created a new account on
Gmail and I suspect that it has
something to do with Gmail not allowing
you to do ICMP writes or IMAP as right
as you set it up yeah I think that might
be the case so if you just now set up a
new gmail account you might not be able
to use this but if it's one that you've
been using for years shouldn't have a
problem which we both kind of confirmed
on our own so I'm gonna go back into my
folder list
Shannen Gmail since I had that
two-factor authentication one I use the
generic at specific password that I
created hit enter and it brings you to
all your different folders so I have
inbox discovery for DDA and I have twit
on here my wedding stuff so if I go over
into one of these and I'll just do my
coupon phone oh my god yes I am an
extreme couponer should see her
Instagram it's it's just covered look at
all the couponing or the worst coupon
hey man
it's important okay so let's see I'll go
into this thrift town one because they
have a lot of text in that one hit enter
and you should be able to get into your
inbox yeah so this is the email that I
got from thrift town because I'm very
thrifty
email just like it wasn't that I need
it's totally actually you know what if
you captured all of this through
Wireshark you'd be surprised how little
data it actually is it's a pretty nimble
protocol it's awesome
yet I'm kind of obsessed with this I'm
gonna send you an email
really great too because you know if
you're on like if you just if you have
terrible bandwidth right there's no
reason why you shouldn't have say juice
ssh on android or connect bot at the
very least I'm sure there's some iOS SSH
apps I'm not familiar I don't use iOS
but SSH is a way to go because it's
already light and secure so now you have
a secure connection between your device
and that's that's kind of the nice thing
about using a shell and so yes this this
is pretty epic Shannon it's kind of
freaking cool
enter hi i'm sending you mail thank you
mail from hello thank you for helping us
save the day when it comes to low i'm
saving all the data's yes all the bit
hey let us know what do you guys use are
you a fan of elm feedback at hack 5 org
is the place where you can let us know
or just you know drop a comment below
and say hey you guys forgot to give a
shout-out to mozilla something something
so i can't remember the other day
outlook no we're not shouting out that
outlook are we no look out i do it that
will be ready for attack it doesn't
matter if you're a fan of pop3 or IMAP
you know we're not gonna judge when you
have that killer idea you need to snag
yourself a domain name and web hosting
fast and let me tell you with domain
comm they've got this quick domain
discovery system and an easy checkout
process that essentially is gonna have
you with your website and your domain
name up and running in like no time and
you've heard me tell you before how much
i love them mainly because they're
affordable reliable and easy to use but
mostly because they are so awesome to do
business with it's just a fun company
you can tweet them at domain.com and say
hey thanks for supporting hack 5 for all
these years and the guys over at
domain.com huge fans of hack 5 so they
want to hook you up and get this views
the coupon code hak5 really easy to
remember it spells out 5 you can get an
extra 15% off at domain.com so when you
think domain names think domain.com
it really is a brave new world when it
comes to authentication and
identification and in that we are really
pleased to be joined once again with
steena and Jared from yubico we've
talked in the past with you guys before
because you're doing some amazing things
in the realm of you know logging in
securely and it's some exciting times
because a lot has changed since the
original you baqi last time we talked it
was all about Fido and u2f can you kind
of break down those acronyms for us
again so phyto u2f is a new open
authentication initiative and Fido
stands for
fast identity online and you - f stands
for universal second factor and so we
should probably be familiar with second
factor and that we you know we're using
it in our Gmail's with our google
authenticators we're you know hopefully
using it with Twitter but the problem is
we have so many other like I use it with
my bank but then I have to get a text
message and I use it with this service
and I have to get an email and there's
well there are some standards but there
seem to be quite a few of them how does
how does this differ from ooofff from
open ID from oath and all of those so
Fido is really a huge attempt by the
industry to do something that is
radically different and some of the
other standards out there I mean they've
been a lot of focus on the Federation
side which is you know you sign in once
and you authorize through all these
different systems we really take a step
back and says well we need to do
authentication correctly so Fido you to
have is really an authentication
standard whereas some of the other
standards are part of the Federation and
part of the single sign-on and
authorization portion there's another
standard oath but it doesn't have some
of the same principles that we're trying
to solve it which is privacy and one key
being able to do and be associated with
many services which has never been heard
before so it's a really different in the
way that we do authentication and it's
also really good security I mean it is
we got the session security and these
protection and gains man-in-the-middle
attacks where you know the Google
Authenticator and the GB key one-time
password is really good security but
it's not
we should mention that you know yeah
because we don't know we don't like like
to have vendors on hak5
to talk to out their products and this
isn't even that because u2f isn't a you
Baqi or a yubico product and actually
can be used with many different since it
is an open standard many different
authentication tokens and methods and
many today it's been proven with USB and
and and i've seen bluetooth is in the in
the making
I've seen some smart cards yes there are
smart cards there is biometrics there's
also phone only so the protocols works
directly with your phone without an
extra device and that's the kind of
ecosystem we want to help to build
because it's not gonna happen if it's
just limited to you know one form factor
or one vendor or it just have to enable
a bigger ecosystem this is you know as
far as the ecosystem is concerned it
seems like there's a lot of like tension
in getting something like this deployed
I'm thinking far back as the 1990s and
Microsoft passport and the troubles that
ooo often open idea I've had trying to
get a foothold and nobody does all of
the things right and nobody gets adopted
across the board there's very good
reason for second factor to be a adopted
which we shouldn't have to go into why
you need something more than just
something you know it should be
something you have and something you
know but what are the kind of the
roadblocks in getting this adopted I
think one of the roadblocks is just for
people to start doing something I think
in in in essence you know when we built
some of these systems before it could be
it's complicated and what we'd really
try to focus was this new protocol is
simplicity right you can get things done
today you don't have to wait for new
platforms and new systems you can build
it with existing systems and we are all
about open open source and having
reference code so while we have a
product we are also very focused in
providing the tools and the resources
that the community can bill and so I
think the big difference between why
things have been dropped in many
situations was because it could become
very complicated and it could be some
things that are on different people
Genda what what we try to do is that
strong authentication in two-factor
authentication should be available for
everyone and anyone right and if you
have used your open source stuff in the
past to say for example set up an SSH
session so that you authenticate with
your Pam a password on the SSH server
but also with your Ubik you which is
really interesting but so as a security
vendor you're really not focused on you
know the lock-in or the software then in
that case no so that's our whole
business model we provide great hardware
and then on top of that we put on the
open-source authentication protocols we
got the one-time password we got paid
for smart cards we got open PGP for
encryption pivots also for encryption by
the way and now we also got due to F so
let's talk quickly about the hardware
because when you and I met years ago it
was funny that you and I were both doing
interesting things with human interface
devices us with the USB rubber ducky to
do keystroke injection and you guys you
know acting as ahead to type in a
one-time password with the original you
Baqi has really come a long way since
their what is the latest hardware doing
that the original wasn't well I think
the latest hardware that we are soon
going to release is to be able to do
something to do with the Bluetooth le
but each iteration of the Yubikey it's
is adding more protocols to it so that
you're not bound to just an OTP or you
know maybe just the open PGP but we're
really providing the same set of
usability of the Yubikey with multiple
protocols and you can use them all the
same time and that's the beauty of it so
what are some of the most exciting
things that you've seen being built
around this so I mean I am super excited
about u2f because I think it's so one of
the fundamental things on the Internet
today we can't trust the internet and a
lot of these security systems that are
built they have you know this there's
discussion around who owns it even who
sits on the secrets and with you to have
no one sits on the secrets no one owns
this this is not a Microsoft passport
this is not Facebook Connect
this is you know a key that you can buy
an Amazon today and in the future our
vision will be hanging among the gift
cards and 7-eleven just like you know it
just be there and and you connect it to
any number of services and and it works
in a Simple Touch and if you are using
it together with Gmail today I'm in the
way Gmail is set it up you don't even
have to touch it for a month so it's
easier than a username password and I
think the simplicity and the really good
security and then as Jared said we got
you know it's it's open so anyone can
adopt it you know and speaking of anyone
adopting it I mean u2f seems really cool
in that you've got the same kind of
companies that are having other
different mechanisms involved they're
all coming together to use a universal
standard you know your Facebook's and
your googles and your visas and and who
else has come on that you actually seen
cuz I know that Google was one of the
first she would actually implement it
the fact that you can sign in using u2f
in your Gmail is huge what other major
milestones as you two have seen since
then so I during later this year you
will see financial services and other
cloud company making support for for a
u2f the version that we have now or a
next-generation that will add a few more
use cases that has been requested by
members of the community of the phyto
community it's about 170 companies there
now including Microsoft Bank of America
Visa and they're all backing a standard
that's just exciting to see that you
know things like Bank of America
adopting a standard that is open source
which means that really interesting
things can be done with it and that you
can have a little bit more trust in
knowing that you know nobody owns it
like you say I know that you guys are
really pushing the open source
initiative of this and actually you're
putting some money behind this can you
tell me a little bit about the you
bikini and the virtual hackathon so we
want to encourage people to develop u2f
applications or Yubikey applications so
we put a get together contest where in
total nine thousand dollars can be
earned in three projects
and we just would give free keys you can
come on your you can give free keys and
then we got the open source libraries in
our support team and our engineers will
be there to help you and if we find any
of these projects super interesting we
will do help with PR and you know take
the products to market or you know
develop things oh wow that's really
exciting so they really basically get to
partner with you guys to roll out a new
application and some will be open source
but we're not limiting to open source if
someone who want to say hey I will
actually want to own own this code then
it's not like we are very much for the
open source and we like to give it away
for free but it's not gonna be so it's
not a limitation so you're saying if
they want to use your open source
libraries to build a closed source
product you're okay with that and I
think that you know we are going to give
some preference to people using it for
you to eff I think you twelve baseline
is an authentication protocol but it
really can be extended to many many
things you can layer things on top of it
it is a public key cryptography protocol
which is the key exchange and then there
is a you know challenge to response so
there's a lot of real-life applications
that can be used with something like
that and we'd love to see the community
build something that is useful far
beyond authentication we've talked about
encryption we talked about physical
access that there's so many exciting
things that we ourselves can do
everything and hope hopefully the
community can help
so one community project we are seeing
as we speak is Firefox Mozilla there are
developers in there we hope there will
soon
you know finalize the support in Firefox
for you twelve the strength with you
twelve is that it's integrated in the
browser but that's also limitation
because right now it's only integrated
in Chrome so we need all the you know
the four big ones in I mean ultimately
you want to be integrated into the
operating system and all of that but we
also a meanwhile we are you know any
extension or plugins are also welcome
because it that's you know once you
putting the plug-in equal work and the
buter with putting into the browser you
know don't need any client software you
just eliminate that that lot being a big
complexity around client software and
middleware is just gone and that it
hasn't been the problem historically
with publicly
yeah and smart card I must say even in
the limited use
that is using Chrome with Gmail which is
a lot of what I do but you know the fact
that that it works just so
simplistically and you mention all of
its got the PKI and it's got the key
exchange and all of those things and as
a user when I think about it as a user
perspective I just plug in my you bikini
I don't have to think about what it's
doing and it's really fantastic that it
does it on that back-end so I'm very
excited to see what other things that
people are building with this so how do
they get involved how do they go set out
to build an application with this and
maybe you know win some funding and get
some help bringing it to market so we
have it on a website now you can go in
and register it's a very simple process
and once you register you are given the
set of you the keys and off you go so
it's really that simple and all we saw
this online with a really good developer
resource site now and any tools and
reference code can be used to build
something that you know wow I'm excited
just about the idea that something can
be built to better the internet for all
of humanity and I'd like to take a break
here in just a bit because I do want to
talk to you about you know you meeting
President Obama at the White House
cybersecurity summit so stay tuned for
that but I must thank you so much for
coming out here I really believe in what
you guys are doing thank you thank you
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of hack 5 but before we get
going I have an Easter Egg for you oh do
you turns out I didn't realize I was
throwing down the gauntlet when I said
it last well but turns out you can
actually watch hack 5 in the terminal ha
ha you got told didn't you I did oh you
know what the most of a community
constructed constructive telling yeah
yeah they told me on YouTube in fact
this is the greatest you should check
out this video in fact props two-bit to
steal you should check out his entire
channel because there's all sorts of
good stuff here and I'm going to skip in
to the part where we actually see the
command and I'll fullscreen this for you
but basically using oh my gosh using M
player and player has an option it's tak
vo and the parameters AAA and then you
give it tak quiet and tak monitor pixel
aspect 0.5 I'll have that in the show
notes as well as a link to his video
really watching that it's a ski hack 5
and look at you Shannon you look so
great in a ski yeah it hides all my oh
my blemishes perfection we used to say
in season 1 like don't worry about it
this is not just that we used to say
like I don't worry about it it looks 40
but 480 nobody looks good in xvid now
you got HD so I prefer to downgrade a
little bit to the ASCII so that I can't
see the imperfections on my face except
for all the J's in the caves oh my gosh
there's an aliasing joke in there
somewhere I should anyway you can find
all sorts of cool stuff over at Adler
web dot info that's where you'll find
the rest of his videos and it's really
good stuff Wow a little Easter Egg
mm-hmm so let's see now we can what we
can browse websites browse the Internet
yeah you can watch videos it is what
what can't you do in the terminal maybe
that's a challenge hmm okay comments
feedback let us know what do you think
