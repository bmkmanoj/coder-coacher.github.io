bouncing your internet traffic with a
TCP redirector encrypting secret
documents and hiding them inside images
and answers to your questions about
virtualization all that and more on this
episode of pack 5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by godaddy gamefly Squarespace and
viewers like you hello welcome to hack
five my name is darren kitchen I met
last time and I'm Shannon Morse and
there goes Kirby this is your weekly
dose of techno lost and we are bringing
to you guys an awesome show this week
from Williamsburg Virginia in the middle
of the storm oh it's storming outside
and it's a little bit scary it's just a
little drizzle and so what's new guys I
mean what's going on your life about a
house oh yeah we go that has grown up
and is moving out and taking his xbox so
we will be holding auditions for the new
co-host we finally moved him off the
island no will keep you you just have to
come over here yeah okay Oh turkey just
jumped on the very expensive console
thingy that we use to switch my feet it
always does that is exciting um hey Oh
save some yeah techno lust wise i'm
talking about internet redirection you
guys you ever see those movies like like
sneakers with the lake all they're
bouncing their signal off the satellites
in the yeah so we're gonna be doing some
fun stuff like that just not as crazy
Hollywood looking yeah i'm gonna be
talking about the third part of our
virtualization segments are actually I
should say series I'm gonna take a break
from the how-to or you know planning and
stuff like that I got a bunch of
questions that people have Wow and me so
I'm just gonna do a real quick rundown
of you know some of the things people
are wondering about and things like that
before we actually get into the how to's
like it viewer questions for the one and
then you're playing with with what
steganography ye why don't I go ahead
and tell you about it awesome lily I
guess let's just go right into it so
steganography steganography um it's
basically like embedding data into
images into music files any kind of file
that you want to is also involves like
back in the day there's the story about
this guy who shaved the head of a slave
and then wrote tattooed a message on to
his head waited to the hair girl
back and then let him go let him go on
so he could share the information with
somebody else the thing about
steganography compared to a cryptography
is that crow tog raphy it's it's obvious
that there's a message there you just
can't read it you have to figure out the
code to find out what it says right with
steganography you hide it inside us
something that looks so normal nobody's
gonna even take the time to figure out
what's in there because they don't think
anyone anything is in there it's just an
image so it's just hiding something in
plain sight yes yeah so so cool we could
we could put something inside of a cake
and nobody would like the proverbial
what is it like the file inside of the
cake yes you know exactly there's also
this really cool story about how there's
a supposedly there were these terrorists
that gone on forums and stuff like that
and they would hide data inside these
little avatar images of like cats and
things so they were able to send
messages to each other maybe just inside
of these little avatar files I
cheeseburger is maybe a terrorist outfit
all this mole can you never know there's
so many images cool well how do we do it
oky found out about this really cool
program it's just called steg hide
there's tons of different programs out
out there all of them work a little bit
differently so you know choose the one
that you like the most for me I like
stunts I'd write Steg height is open
source you can find out what Steg hide
dots what is dead hide yes tai chi dot
sourceforge.net so it's available for
they have great documentation for you so
you can figure out how to do it yourself
they've the downloads for they have
linux download on here as well as
windows i think they even do they have a
mac version well if you can run out if
you could run it on mac potentially if
you had all the libraries and all that
fun stuff so i'm gonna show you really
quick how to do it you can you download
the zip file obviously I have this
original picture of paul oh look at
polar camera guy yeah Oh mad save he
looks so cute so all right I have this
original picture if I pull up as
properties you can see that right now
the bites are six to eight thousand and
seven bites right keep that in mind it's
gonna change after I change the photo so
I also did this version of it called
Paul edited I just copied the original
and did that one before I actually
edited this one it was the same
amount of bytes so 68 what can we put
inside of this file oh you better text
files for me i did a text file um god
there's all sorts of things you can put
in it oh and you can also fit behind
things and word documents to well like
that weird huh all right so show me how
to do it okay so you open your command
prompt let me just get in there real
quick okay so I'm gonna open up Steg
head exe this gives me all the
information on how to first of all embed
your information and then extract your
information so first I'm going to embed
this really small little text document
that says the new hak5 store is opening
this week check it out at hak5 org that
says com oh oops here let me show you
that spammers took that hey cuz I was
cheap and I didn't want it register
alright so you've seen my little text
file you know it's nothing important but
maybe I'm like telling somebody some
secret code all right I gotta email him
this file so I'm gonna embed it let's
see stike I'd embed dash CF and then
picture is called Paul edited.jpg dash
EF and the text file of shirts dot txt
and it's gonna ask me to make passphrase
okay well we all like Paul and Paul's
the camera guy so I'm gonna do camera
guy okay so embedding t-shirts in Palo
datacom it's done so let's take a look
at the difference now between those
files alright we have the original yes
you have the original you know it's
still the 68000 where's that sixty-eight
thousand seven bites okay we go into
Paul edit in now and this is kind of
weird because it compressed it just a
little bit more when you added in that
little itty-bitty text documents so now
it's 59,000 and 529 bites right well I
mean it's jpg is lossy I mean you can do
compression on the image so if you have
the original image and then you have
this one that you think maybe something
in there okay if you know how to do it
you can just look at the bites and see
if there isn't that no difference that
gets us right into what's called steg
analysis which we should do a follow-up
segment trying to actually show you how
to you know process some images and see
if maybe there's something hidden in the
cake we should all right so I'm I'm the
person that's getting this file I don't
actually have shirts txt yet so i just
deleted it right since I'm the I'm the
person okay so now that you're the
person that's downloaded this image you
think there's nothing in it so you run
steg hi I'm gonna run stagger it again
the new guy you think there might have
been something put in here with maybe
there's a difference in the size so who
knows I'm gonna put in Paul edited I
wonder if it was edited mm-hmm it's just
egged huh stuck hide extract dash SF
Paul edited.jpg press enter it asks me
me for passphrase so hopefully I know it
I'm gonna thank Paul he's a camera guy
or we could brute force it okay it said
it wrote extracted data two shirts dot
txt so there we go so we've got the file
so here's data inside my image oh it's
awesome okay so i opened up shirts there
you go awesome same exact information is
inside my txt file now I like that it is
so cool I saw this and I was just like
what blows my mind I didn't know you can
do that crap and there are other tools
right i mean not only egghead there's
ones that is hideous I mean it's just
google it google like well we have
bedding inside music tile right and we
have lk so you can embed a text file
inside a music file and then put the
music file inside inside of a pitcher of
ice first cool and we have links to all
some other resources if you're
interested in steganography all sorts of
information got it over at snubz ecomme
and check out steak hide sourceforge.net
for more information sweet and we will
also be taking your questions so if you
have some questions about the stuff
feedback at hak5 org yes so the
information right you guys send me we
can maybe come back and do a little bit
of stegun alisis for you guys um but I
think at this point we are going to go
ahead and find out what is going on with
this week's LAN party hardy from Matt
Matt take from here alright guys so this
month's LAN party is golden I source the
developers have been kind of us to
know that they've released a final
version of golden eyes source which is
obviously a recreation of gold and I in
the source engine head on over to GES
hak5 dot org to connect up to the game
and for more information or to suggest
your own gaming segments and then over
to hack five land squarespace.com with
squarespace you can create blogs easy
expert you know websites who knows you
can do anything with this publishing
platform very intuitive user interface
and over to squarespace com and use
coupon code hack five for ten percent
off the life of your order a little bit
later I'm going to be talking about some
questions that I've received after my
virtualization segments right now Darren
is up with internet redirection
so last week we were talking a little
bit about netcat an awesome you know tcp
IP UDP swiss army knife kind of tool
it's great for when you want to send
packets receive package whatever just in
the raw from the command line and you
know like you guys said in the comments
you right it's very versatile for a lot
of things though you might want to use
ssh as its secure but you know as just a
cool little tool to get things done it's
a lot of fun and one of the neat things
that netcat can do is what's called port
redirection and it got me thinking about
a lot of fun stuff when it comes to
Puerto you direction and I actually want
to show off not net cap but another tool
that we can use to do this and I've got
a fun little example here so let's kind
of imagine what this really means you
can kind of envision this as you know
just basic firewall rules but there's
these applications that make it super
simple to take some incoming data and
then process it and send it out on like
say a different port different IP
address whatever so we're going to show
the just the simplest little traffic cop
that we can kind of put on our own you
know our VPS or something like that so
we can do some interesting things to
maybe get around corporate firewalls so
let's take a look what I'm running here
is our inet d you can find this over at
bout telecom and it is basically a
internet redirection server you can I
believe I there's a yes there is a
Windows version of this as well as Linux
I'm doing this in Linux but you know if
you've got like a VPS or something that
you can run it on either and what I want
to show you is how to set this up so I
already have it just you know download
the tar on tar it and i'll go ahead and
you know make it but once it's compiled
in everything all we really need to do
is set a configuration file for it now
that configuration file lives in / ET c
and it is called our inet decomp and I
actually have a very simple one set up
right here and that is to the is to take
everything coming in on whoops on 10 10
20 de 162 on port 80 and send it out to
217
144 that 138 on port 6667 so as you can
I mean if you're familiar with this port
basically what we're doing is we're
saying oh listen on what would typically
be your HTTP connection for you know web
pages and stuff and go ahead and send it
out to a completely different host on
port 6667 which is typically used for
IRC in fact that IP I mentioned is the
IP address of IRC double revision 3.com
which is hosted by zone 9 which is where
pound hack house lives so we're going to
go and pop in there and say hey by
bouncing my computer upstairs off this
computer right here this 10 10 20 da 162
and it's going to go right through there
now the configuration really simple you
see that's all you need to do there are
a couple other options you can say allow
space and IP address so you can actually
set it up you can also do deny so you
have a little bit of rules there I mean
this is not you know your your cisco
firewall here but it has some
rudimentary rules for access control
based on IP address and some logging so
we could use this to log some stuff
which we could also have a lot of fun
with like a pie in any way we can do fun
stuff with this but let's just go ahead
and show a real simple usage case here
where say like I'm at my office and
they've got the firewall locked down to
where I can only really do stuff out of
port 80 now it's not like some stateful
connection dearly it's not checking the
headers or anything it's just saying it
lock everything down but poor ava so
it's a pretty dumb firewall right so i
connect i use my IRC client so I'm are
DP'd upstairs to my client here i've got
y chat open and I can actually say
server 10 to 10 10 Oh 162 which would
normally be my dedicated server my VPS
my something up in the cloud running
this and I'm going to say on port 80 and
it's going to happen is it's going to
it's going to refuse my connection oh
I'm sorry there's one other important
thing that you need to do after you get
your configuration file setup and that
is you actually need to run the service
there you go Darren now let's give it
another shot all right so connect
1001 62 on port 80 find my host hey guys
and there we go I am in IRC over port 80
so this is a very fun tool it's kind of
versatile we can log stuff we can set up
access lists very very basic rudimentary
stuff and now over port 80 I'm talking
to I owe you and fusion include man and
all those cool kids in in the hacking
cyrusi so anyway up for more information
about this head over to my show notes at
hak5 org and at this point I'm going to
go home and kick it over to Shannon and
find out what's going this week's trivia
so gmail PHP badge code challenge it's
still going on over at hackbutt org
slash code challenge and we have decided
to extend it for another week until
Thursday May seventh the reason being we
ate we've gotten so many really good PHP
codes in it takes a long time to get
through all those we have decided to
give out two of the PHP reference books
which I have right here oh and this book
is by Mario lorig thank you Mario the
Easter egg hunt is also still going on
that is going on over at RTD RTT hak5
org the winner is going to get a deluxe
hack pack actually three winners are
going to get deluxe pack packs and a
lock of matt hair I know you're excited
for that one I know I am Oh Matt
he's so worried that we're gonna cut off
his hair in the middle of the night and
shave his head and put secret messages
on anyway the winner will be announced
on next week's show so definitely look
forward to that and I would like to
thank our sponsor Go Daddy Go Daddy com
makes it easy to customize your own
virtual dedicated server perfect for
running your own internet redirector or
DNS tunneling service choose one of
three popular plans or select your own
linux or windows server with all the
plan options you need plus if you go
over to revision 3.com / godaddy you can
check out all seven not five but seven
of our hack five codes for godaddy some

details and get your piece of the
internet at godaddy.com and i'm gonna
throw it over to Matt for some Q&amp;amp;A s
about virtualization
alright guys so we are here for a little
Q&amp;amp;A session about virtualization now
last couple weeks I have talked to you
about you know the cost savings both in
power cooling just NP R you know
monetary savings and trying to fill a
rack with 42 you servers that's
expensive we all know that but what can
we do to you know try and put some of
your fears or your questions at ease and
I thought you know why not just take the
questions straight from the source for
you guys the last week I asked you guys
to send me some questions via email if
you had any and today we've got a couple
one of the ones was from AZ who been
watching the virtualization segment
obviously despite the possibility of
higher availability and maybe possibly
power reduction his boss is concerned
that they're going to lose performance
in you know from going local storage
which is probably you know SAS 3 gigabit
to I scuzzy storage which for a single
Giggy channel is probably going to run
if you get you know a really high
performing machine 160 megabytes a
second now I've done some you know
sequel i/o SQL I oh whatever you want to
call it tests you know on my inexpensive
sands and I can tell you that you know
peak utilization out of the sand is
about you know hundred and twenty
hundred and thirty megabytes a second I
mean unless you're doing ridiculous
amounts of you know databases on hitting
it at the same time you know that's
where you're going to run into an issue
the other thing that you could possibly
do is there's a function called RDM or
draw device mapping which instead of
going through you know vmware or Zen for
your your virtual disk what you do is
you carve out a piece of your sand and
connect the virtual machine directly to
that so that you know giving you a
little bit better performance if you're
just looking to squeak out every last
bit of performance that's probably the
way to go there's
misconceptions about our DM and you know
performance blah blah blah but to be
honest with you it's really not that big
of a deal if you're running processes
which are going to be hitting the disk
you you have to make that judgment for
yourself and that's why VMware it comes
with a 60 day evaluation period with a
full-blown license so you can test all
that stuff have another question here
about differences between VMware and
virtual box kind of like comparing
apples to oranges virtual box is a
desktop application which is used for
you know running windows on your linux
or running linux on your windows machine
you know the VMware products while they
do offer the workstation class products
like fusion and workstation and things
like that VMware's money and their money
product is in the you know data center
virtualization so high availability
systems dynamic resource sharing you
know constant monitoring of you know
facilities and things like that that's
what you pay for when you pay VMware for
a license it's the ability to do all
those things autonomously and not really
have to be concerned about data center
management things like that I have
another question here from Aaron which
is actually a really good question and I
actually just had to to you know
compensate for this recently he asks
greats I was wondering how you deal with
all these new virtual servers and how
they're affecting your network and your
DHCP is your company large enough that
you're using department VLANs or how is
your network segmented to support all
these servers clients and voip hardware
how has the virtualization impacted your
server management scheme now there's a
couple questions in there one the
easiest one to manage or to answer is
the management of virtual servers you
know running virtual center server it is
completely brain dead easy to manage
your servers it'll list on the side and
create folders different departments for
the servers and blah blah blah blah
click on the console button and boom
you're at the console session the other
question in here is network sprawl now
to combat that segment your IPS
you know if your if you have a powerful
enough router we have a Juniper SSG 140
you know segment your eye peas we use a
255 255 255 so that we get 10 10 0
through 10 10 3 4 you know anything that
is inter office for you know VoIP
hardware it's a different subnet and
things like that so really when you're
playing with subnets and things like
that VLANs tend to be a little bit more
how do we say difficult to manage and
keep track of unless you have you know
some centralized management console for
your switches and things like that so in
this instance it's you know in my my
company's not crazy large that we have
to use VLANs and things like that so I
just segment out the network by IP
ranges and last but not least have a
question which isn't really related to
you know VMware Zen or Microsoft hyper-v
but question on you know supplying a
virtual machine with more than four
gigabytes of RAM if you're running a
32-bit operating system there's a
physical limitation in the addressing
space that you cannot it you know apply
more than three what is it ball 42 43
it's like three or four I don't know you
got to use the slash pae switch or
whatever it is so that you can address
more but it's not true because it's page
just get a 64-bit OS linux and windows
vista 64 and windows 7 64 brain dead
easy haven't had a problem with them so
i would just get a 64-bit license your
life will be a whole lot easier if you
have any other questions about
virtualization and things like that and
in the upcoming episodes we're going to
be talking about some how to's and
utilizing things like freenas and
openfiler to build a sand on the cheap
so head on over to hack 5 org or the
forms of forms on hak5 org I'm at in my
email address is mad at hak5 org hit me
up with questions and I will be sure to
answer them all and right now where is
my sheet it is time to wrap this yo
let's do this all right guys that just
about wraps up this RGB edition of hak5
but before we get going a bunch of fun
stuff to wrap up here one of which is to
thank our awesome sponsor gamefly me
tell you about game pie listen they are
one of the largest baby largest online
video game rental service they've got
over 6,000 new and classic games and you
can get your own plans starting at like
1595 a month and get games just
delivered to your door in the mail and
when you're done with them just send
them back they send you the next one
keep them for as long as you want or
keep them forever just pay a little
nominal fee as you're saying yeah it's
like 40 bucks or something like that
they'll send you the manual and the box
or the case for the game so for example
that dark night game that you were
thinking about yeah I don't know if it's
worth buying it but this is like a try
before you buy kind of daily and there's
nothing better than just open your mail
box and seeing like oh yeah we're gonna
play giveth and if you're a madman like
Paul you could definitely get your
fifteen dollars a month out of the
service yeah so my family get a two week
free trial when you go over to
gamefly.com slash hak5 some restrictions
apply see the site for details and we
thank them for sponsoring this fine
program of education and enlightenment
and we also want to mention to you guys
about scam schoolscam school is a show
by Brian brushwood it's about scamming
your friends and getting free drinks by
using magic everything from card tricks
to rip in a phone book in half
everything you can think of you can
watch scam school over at revision3
every Thursday that's right you could
scan your friends into filling your shot
glasses full of yummy tasty beverages
speaking of which there it's odd that
you have a shot glass on the sunset
there are actually 94 bees I think 94 or
so I make this night a drink keeping it
so bye so so just to let you guys know
the store is available you can head on
over to hack 5 Oregon find the store
back shop the heck shop and we are
finally selling the evil server teachers
which you can see right here you shot
glasses of which there are limited
quantity and we will not be printing
more ever
whoo your sticker packs your pineapple
blah blah blah pineapples I even go mmm
monkeys that are falling out of my hand
anyway fun stuff all at the high shop
and we encourage you to support this
show by getting fun stuff and that would
be cool I don't know what I'm grabbing
at no it's what I do and as you probably
noticed if you've been to the website
there it has is now live editing the
website he just got a little frustrated
with local versions dude doing ph doing
doing like web development on windows
and then when you trying to port it over
how do you mod 77 and the blah blah blah
was the thing in the 755 and you're like
windows and then and then you move over
to linux and you run your own little vm
dealing your blood with buck and you
move it over none of those stuffs the
same adult directory are different you
trying to you know what I said gonna
just take the site live and it's
instruction you can lose one of those
little am animated gifs from back in the
90s and just be like under construction
little guy look like yep digging there
are some huge things that darren has
planned I had war yeah yeah I have to
upload 167 videos to youtube and once I
do there will be related content with
second time you want to I want to use
you to that's where all the YouTube and
a better one what are you trying to say
that our my friends over at YouTube
don't have the bitrate to talk properly
deploy the technolon certain days yes
like when you're trying to view in HD
video sometimes I think Darren's okay
you should probably go so we can rush
into it yeah we are oh gosh I'm dying
I've hurt myself earlier yeah it's easy
level alright yes hak5 org Forbes I've
hack five-dollar work feedback at hak5
org Darren choking and hack 50 or I'm
gonna make a summer be a nanosec a
picture with him boys
hahaha excellent alright guys see you
next time just do that goes and it takes
not trust your technical us guys
120 minute awesome i should never tell
you how long the show is at the top of
the soup it's indeterminate wing I'm
rippin buzz out loud let's try that
again I might have won some cornhole
tournaments in my day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
