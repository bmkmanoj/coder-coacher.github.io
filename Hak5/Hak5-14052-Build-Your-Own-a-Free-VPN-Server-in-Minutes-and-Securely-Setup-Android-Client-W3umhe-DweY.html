by domain.com
here's what's really cool now about
untangle see I'm in this untangle
interface if I just move this window
over you'll see there's this bar down
here and hey hey terminal now we do have
to set up a password the very first time
it's like a root password which is
different from our admin password to get
into the administration interface but
regardless if your company if you're
watching this show you know SSA it's
you're comfortable in the command line
and this should be pretty native to us
if not follow along and if you need some
help on ssh stuff we did about ten
segments outlining everything possible
with them in season 11 so now that we're
in our basically bash here and we LS
we'll see there's a desktop folder and
that is where that config dot zip was
that we downloaded so what I want to do
now is take this config dot zip and put
it over on my phone so SCP with a tak
capital P for the port four four four
four and then we want to tell it the
username which in this case is DK at the
IP address 10 dot 73 to 31.1 87 for my
phone and then colon which will specify
the route of Darren's home on that phone
which we know to be I just showed it was
the SD card folder basically so if I do
this and then I say oh you know what I
forgot
after the port I need to specify the
file I'm copying config dot zip ok so
this will send the config dot zip over
to my phone and it says here's your DSA
key fingerprint we've talked about this
in the past and I'm assuming this is
correct in fact if I look over here it
will tell me and I'm happy so I just say
yes and it was permanently added and now
I give it my password and there we go so
the file is copied over and it's a zip
file so now I can go ahead and set it up
on my sd card so the other thing that I
want to do is actually SSH in here
because I want to move these pi
around to be in the right place so again
from untangle or I could just do this
within putty on my windows box or if
you're on linux whatever you know
whatever have you I'm just gonna SSH
again in this case with SSH it's a
lowercase P not SCP with the capital P
pour four four four four and then I want
to head over to again DK at 10.7 T 331
1.1 87 and CD to sd card and if IL s
stars if there's that config zip alright
that's what I want well you know what
I'm actually gonna have to come over to
my phone just to make things easy for
myself since I don't have a command line
zip utility I know right over on Android
I just grabbed a you know one of the
free unzip tools come down to config I'm
gonna check that and no I don't want to
delete it I want to open the archive
check the folder I want to extract there
we go alright and if I come over to my
laptop again now I will see that by LS
untangle there we go so I have my
untangle folder which I just extracted
from that zip I know I know you would
think that unzip would be a basic
command with an Android you do have do
you have to unzip yeah you don't even
have G unzip although you do have gzip
so anyway that's enough ranting about
Android I mean I guess it's not made for
most consumers to be SSA Qing into it
but that's what we're doing here so now
that I have it unzipped I can go into
that folder and you'll see here I have
the hak5 comp the hak5 OPN file as well
as an untangle folder so if I go into
that untangle folder you'll see these
are the certificate file the cert for my
user and the key and what I need to do
is make sure and I'm going to just move
these to dot dot I'm moving them back a
directory so if i LS again you'll see
they're gone by LS 2 dot dot the
previous directory and LS there we go
now they are in the same folder
as hak5 Kampf and hak5 ovp n so a little
bit of a weird got to there use whatever
file manager you choose in fact I might
have been able to do that just with my
unzip GUI utility on Android but
whichever way you want to do it you just
need to make sure that your OPP N and
your comp files as well as your your
cert files and your key files are all in
the same folder because that's the way
that the open VPN client for Android is
going to want them when it we import it
so everything is pretty much set up on
the Open VPN side eye or the untangle
side we've got our Open VPN server up
and going so I'm going to close this
and close this and we see this green
light here showing that our Open VPN
server is on and running we can check
out our bandwidth here we really haven't
done much of anything other than
download that app and you know we could
come in here and really go crazy with it
with the rest of the features it has but
we're just focusing on Open VPN now so
let's get our client setups I'm gonna go
ahead and get out of this and what
you'll want is Open VPN Connect so I'm
in Open VPN Connect I'm going to hit
menu and choose import and we're going
to want to import the profile from sd
card come down here and we'll find that
untangle VPN folder and there we go all
of our files that we transferred over
and this is what I like about this is we
set up a we set up a untangle server and
then using locally at the keyboard we
SCP the file over SSH over to our phone
as long as those key fingerprints match
and everything we know that we're
transferring it securely I don't see any
issues with this setup as far as
security is concerned I feel very
confident comfortable with this so I
like that I'm not like you know what
like emailing a cert or whatever so if
you do email the cert it will let you
download it from an HTTP site so again
this is all best practices the untangle
people have thought about this obviously
but I just wanted to point that out
because it's pretty cool that you can
SCP your config straight from the router
over to your phone so with all of that
done all I need to do an open VPN client
now is to choose my hack 5.0 VPN file it
select and the profile is imported
you'll see our profiles in this list
right here it already has the IP address
of my server if I go into preferences
you'll see it already has you know we
can choose our VPN protocols but it will
just figure it out and it'll figure out
DNS and and all of the other things that
I'd like which is so great because
that's
beauty of OpenVPN is when you package
that file up and you send it out to your
client whether it's a Mac a Linux box
Windows machine in this case Android
that ovp n file those comp files they
have all of the configuration you as the
network administrator setting up this in
this case open VPN on untangle all of
those different settings are just going
to be in that setup file so you don't
really have to think about you know
telling mo use this hostname and this
password and this username and this wins
the server and DNS IP address and all of
that stuff so that's one of the reasons
why I really love thinking about it as
as far as a systems administrator is
concerned that's where it's really
powerful so now as you might imagine all
I have to do is select my open VPN and
hit connect and this is what's new in
Android for o is it's going to say hey
dude you're setting up a VPN which means
everything you do all of your traffic is
going to go through this when we say
yeah we trust that it's not a you know
it's not a state-run Iranian VPN no it's
my own VPN that I set up at home with
untangle and I hit OK and we're
connected and boom we can see how long
we've been connected the packets that
have gone through the bytes in and out
and tapped for more details get our IP
address and whatnot and I can see it
figured out the pour the protocol all of
that for me and I can browse now and
when I start browsing on my Android
phone
I'm now going to be going through the
VPN that's set up in a virtual machine
on my laptop how cool is that
yeah so with all of that said I really
want to know how you guys feel about
this what you guys think I really thank
you for the amazing feedback I got on
the PPTP segment so if you're still
using that get off that find yourself an
open VPN I like the untangle way a
details pretty great as well either way
with this and I should point out they
are a sponsor but I'd be using this
anyway because I just I love open VPN
and I use untangle at home untangle comm
slash hack 5 I think is the URL for
they've got discounts and stuff so check
that out if this is of interest to you
because they do have pretty cool
bandwidth
that's free that's a bunch of stuff on
here that's just free and you should
check it out
either way I'm really stoked that my
phone now has a secure VPN and not
something using an ancient and broken
protocol but that's my segment to the
one there and I value your feedback
feedback a hack 5-door let me know what
you think and in just a bit Shannon and
I are gonna be wrapping this up getting
into your questions and some trivia and
all that other fun stuff but first we're
gonna take a quick break ciao
budding entrepreneurs startups and
innovators are all turning their ideas
into reality all backed by the strength
of get this dotnet domain names dotnet
are globally known it's one of the most
popular domain extensions in the world
in fact is the third most behind calm
and dot de I know right way to go to
Germany huh and the dotnet injects your
business with instant credibility
entrepreneurs and startups are
immediately discovering the advantages
of building their presence around a
dotnet domain and get this if you
already have it com1 can purchase dotnet
it's gonna go ahead and protect your
online brand or if the calm that you
want is already taken well you know you
can always get a dotnet it is a perfect
alternative and you can find a dotnet
over at domain.com I know I did you can
check out Darren kitchen net yeah it's a
thing and I love domain.com because they
are totally affordable they're reliable
they're easy to use I think that nets
are only like $8.99 a year and get this
domain calm they're totally awesome on
Twitter they're fun to drink with you
can tweet them at domain.com and it just
really makes it a fun place to do
business so get this domain calm guys
they're huge fans of hack 5 which means
they're huge fans of you so they want to
hook you up 15% off their already
affordable domain names and web hosting
all you have to do is use this coupon
code right I'm gonna let you guess what
it is it's hak5 I'm gonna show you're
watching so just in case you came to the
wrong place and you're not sure what
you're watching you're watching act 5
and domain.com is gonna hook you up so
when you think domain names think
domain.com
it's time once again to check port 110
yes it is Darrin well it's fun having
you back here okay so our first question
comes from Charles he writes I was
wondering what distro and bash colors
Darin is using it in episode 1225 it
looks awesome
I like the classic colors they reminded
him old-school BBS days a little bit of
EGA going on basically I up this machine
a the most boring and heavy mind you I
would never bring this again this is
ready but the brick yeah but this Lenovo
for the strip because it says I am NOT a
hacker it says I am a very boring person
businessman this laptop says stop me at
the border so that's why and I'm running
Mint 14 as much as Ubuntu we've had a
good time I'm going to and I know wow
know that your friend mint is very much
like you and and sorry no offense meant
I actually but I think you're a stepping
stone to maybe arch but just gonna throw
that out there but Mint 14 made it very
easy to set up lux full disk encryption
and I'll probably do a segment on this
because yeah crossing borders which
really want is full disk crypto even
with the neccessity there's ways to make
it secure and I was I was just very
happy with the performance of mint so
yeah I'm kind of using Mint no way it
sits well with cinnamon it's like Ubuntu
back in 10 2004 before God all crappy
you know they just released I think 1304
yeah it's just starting I'm over you I'm
over you a bone - we had something
should I upgrade internets I don't know
what distro should Shannon Rock next
answer in the comments fight amongst
yourselves I can do all of them or any
at all at once multi pass so our next
question comes from you Colo maniac he
says I pass by a few captive portals on
my way to work that can be really
annoying because my cell phone always
connects to the strongest available
Wi-Fi is there any way to configure
Android devices to connect to certain
wi-fi's only hey you know what be glad
you're on Android
at least iPhone because I love the way
that I Oh s does this whenever there's a
access point that a connection that has
a captain portal it yeah
port convenience automatically opens
basically a safari frame which is so
much fun with the pineapple to do like
peanut butter jelly time because it just
pops up on their phone right yeah and I
see what you're saying we when I set up
the captive portal either using was a no
dog or using untangle it's very
convenient that an Android phone will
show the little thing at the very top
where it's like sign in here to go to
the Wi-Fi and there's usually because it
sounds like a DNS query or doesn't
paying or it does something to tell if
it's on the internet or if there's got
portal there and then gives you the pop
up well the best case is just don't
connect at all and the security model
for Android is to automatically connect
back to access points that you've
connected to previously so if this is
ATT Wi-Fi for example here in the United
States or in the UK it was like BT open
Wi-Fi at the Starbucks and things like
that your will by default connect if you
don't remember to forget it and what
it's mine by that is under settings and
then Wi-Fi you'll see all the access
points you can hold down and say forget
this network and it will not
automatically connect next time it's a
manual process that you have to go
through and you know just like I said be
thankful you're not on iOS because with
iOS devices they don't even show up in
liquor within range yeah so that means
if you've been owned in the past by
you'll get owned again and then only
after only after you forget this forget
this network now when it comes to
Android at least there are some options
for managing Wi-Fi connections in the
Google Play Store you will find Wi-Fi
connection manager which allows you to
you know do things like EAP and supports
for hidden SS IDs and different kinds of
automatically detecting web
authentication and stuff but again it's
one of those things where you just have
to be vigilant about forgetting those
and I don't know maybe somebody should
just write an Android app that
automatically forgets every network
you've ever connected to yeah go at it
so that'd be cool if you're an Android
developer it sounds like it might be an
easy one to do just
in the api's again this is coming right
out of my ass because I have no idea I'm
not an Android developer but if you are
and you know let us down the feedback
email us feedback at warge I would love
to see something like this come out of
it I would too actually
now it's time for the techno s photo of
the week I'm reading business so this
one comes from will he sends us a photo

alright question two trivia what do you
call it how does a show work again so
it's called the trivia oh yeah we've
been doing this for a while yeah we pick
a winner and we send them some kind of
schwag that we get from like you know
the conventions that we go to maybe even
stickers that we sign whatever what have
you Greg so last week's question was
what will an open port return from an
axe can ACK scan hey the answer was rst
do you know what that stands for reset
maybe answer over at hack five dot org
slash trivia view no no okay so the real
question this week is your target system
is behind a firewall using HP to you
craft syn packets sy n packets to send a
hop count capable of reaching the host
you then send these packets out with
port numbers from 1 to 10 24 what action
are you currently performing when you do
this you can answer that over at hack 5
org slash trivia as well for your chance
to win some hack 5 swag and possibly
Greg apparently yeah so are you just
jealous are you jealous of Craig I'm
jealous of Craig yeah that's Kelly he's
pretty cool I won't lie all right
well with all of that we will remind you
that we value your feedback helps shape
the show and we've got we've got

it over to feedback add content or I'm
going to I promise you I'm gonna
remember how to do this show by next
week you've been home vacation for like
a month and a half
I was working I wouldn't hackerspaces

org will hook you up with the RSS and
all the details yes oh and to answer
everybody's question about that it is an
exclusive show with YouTube so know that
while there is an RSS feed to get it out
of youtube there's not a very simple way
to get it into your podcasting
application like iTunes if anybody still
uses that but or do I just find a mp3
maker for YouTube you just plug in the
Lincoln never mind oh really
yeah I found one that would actually
make an mp4 out of it but it requires
running a local server to Java which is
not an easy one really yeah well you
should do that on the show alright
anyway we're we're rambling again
reminding you something what do we
remind we are always at might be
forgetting reminding you yes remember
