this segment of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com hello and welcome to act 5
my name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
it's your weekly dose Technol s is and
we have plenty of stuff going on in this
episode I'm super excited about my my
segment yeah yeah I'm super excited
about this season we have so much cool
stuff in the worksite and I don't want
to I have some really cool stuff and
stuff would be deep and development for
for long let's talk okay yeah yeah after
the show
winky face he all right so um one of our
really good friends and also one of the
guys who does the music for hack 5 he's
done plenty of the stuff that we use on
plenty of remixes and whatnot pruno bozo
he is releasing his brand-new CD it's
currently on pre-order so you can go
over to pro no bozo calm and get all the
information it's available on iTunes
right now but he'll have it available
after a grace period on every single
other website that you can get music off
of he didn't specify a release date but
it I've already listened to it and it's
really really good so you got the hook
up yeah well I bought I bought the album
on iTunes right artists let me go and
install itunes sudo apt-get a Windows
machine iTunes you know I did a segment
about that right oh I can't yeah I'm
sorry dude it's oh I did a segment about
how you can put stuff on your Linux
machine alrighty - thank you but why on
earth would you yeah see that's yeah
yeah using Windows software on Linux
I've been talked about using Mac
software on Linux I've said what see
Windows Phone is using Linux software on
Mac mmm Hall should come on this side of
the camera a second about that first
segment like through walls
oh yeah either that it either that Paul
or or we just roll your footage from
2008
yes now oh my god yeah it's like Paul
with crazy hair you guys I don't
remember the crazy hair man those four
good times yeah it's like bringing back
the old school right there
all right well speaking of crazy hair
what are you doing with your Linux
machine right now are you trying to say
I have crazy hair
now as the there wasn't accident okay
well this week I decided to check out
some benchmarking techniques that you
can use in Linux so we know there's
plenty of them out there for Windows
machines you know PC mark and whatnot
but there's I didn't know if there was
anything for Linux so I searched out
there I found out there is a website
it's how to forge calm and they have
this whole how-to about how to benchmark
your system from CPU processing speeds
to file i/o input/output whoo-hoo and my
sequel I don't have my sequel installed
on mine because I don't need it at the
moment but I did find out some
interesting things about my CPU
processing speed yeah this good stuff I
mean you know you can't go to a land
party without flexing your benchmark you
know that's what I used to do with like
Crysis and everything else and so the
same should hold true with Linux I've
done really nasty like like said an arc
piping to DD piping to time and of
really nasty longer commands and Linux
to kind of like semi benchmark but never
using a suite like this so walk me
through it what do I have to do to get
started so first of all you're going to
need a program called sis bench that's
sys ven CH so go ahead and install that
if you haven't already apt-get install
sis bench yay bench now yeah if you want
to check it out there's tons of
information in the man page as well all
the different parameters that you can
use with it so it's it's extremely long
I'll be honest I didn't read the entire
thing but yeah it's very interesting
tons of information that you can use
with this program but just to name a few
we can test our CPU speed so the reason
why I brought you on today was to find
out whose machine as fastest because one
they look exactly the same this is well
except month has cooler stickers on it
oh whatever
panda hello oh right and they don't even
know about the Panda unless they were a
Def Con
this is why you need to quick screengrab
that's all you got
i'm revision3 only releases in 720p Oh
YouTube actually gets a higher quality
version than revision3 that's been the
case for a couple of years yeah ptew
should we mention our awesome
subscribers on YouTube
Oh our YouTube subscribers are awesome I
don't pander to that stuff but yes dude
nice pretty cool guys
yeah yeah next next month next month
it's exciting okay alright so this is
what your progress alright so I'm just
gonna copy and paste it since I have it
running over okay won't tell me what do
I need to you alright so you're going to
type in sis bench this is the command
space tactic test equal CPU space tactic
CPU Tech max TAC prime equals 20,000 so
that's two zero zero zero zero space run
that's it yes now before you type that
in all the way yeah I'm gonna run mine
at the same time Oh wonderful yeah so
let me go over here go ahead and paste
it and ctrl shift B yes three two all
right
Tobias now there you go alright so both
of them say threads started doing CPU
performance benchmark mm-hmm and it's
going to last about 1 minute or so so
while this is running let's go ahead and
speed it up
I win not quite
I win total time twenty eight point
seven seconds total time 60.3 this is
wicked let's do more prime numbers I
love this okay so the the really
important ones up here are the total
time of course your minimum max average
those are obvious and then down here
your approximate percentile this gives
you your approximate milliseconds for
your CPU processing yes two point nine
eight milliseconds yours is twice as
fast as mine oh yeah then three in mine
I seven I seven so there you go yeah
it's very obvious what's going on on
these two machines now after this I also
wanted to check out file i/o
benchmarking so this is trying to figure
out how fast you can move files around
ray yay you've got a 5400 rpm spinning
disk in that thing I do what do you have
in yours I have an solid-state disk from
like last year okay so I have plenty of
room on my hard drive right now remember
when I said it was a solid-state disk
from last year yeah I went cheap it's a
32 gig DF tacky I was like I think I
have like 128 gigs in this fingers yeah
I have 12 gigs available twelve count'em
oh let me see how many I have what was
that command again yeah space tech age
tacky okay yes I have 60 62 gigs
available I'm not benchmarking yeah so
you probably can't benchmark this but I
can so let me go ahead and copy and
paste this file over so the first thing
you want to do is create a test file
this is going to be a file that is
bigger than your RAM because if you
don't do it that way your system is
going to use your Ram cache to and
that's gonna completely skew your
results so I'm going to create a file
that I was gonna do this with like a gig
but I've got four gigs of ram in here so
just be like
one gig so I was able to do like a big
10 gig file but I didn't have to go as
big as a hundred and fifty gigs like
they do on their example website okay so
I went ahead and created that file and
then after that and just copy and paste
and do an LS cuz look at this this is
just not see just when you do this yeah
it's just gonna barf all over your
directory so just maybe make in each one
of these is a team eggs right okay cool
so go ahead and hit your I Oh
okay so it's basically running the test
file I'm going to change the size to
match the size that I created so that's
going to be ten gigs go eat go back to
run now this is also going to take just
a couple of minutes to go but at the end
I'll be able to see how long it takes to
transfer these files back and forth all
over the place
how'd you do so well
so total transferred 379 megabytes took
1.2 it's per second 1.2 cool yeah super
slow super slow
you know there's um and that number is
up here at the top where it says total
transferred so that's the important one
that you want to look at right there
everything else is pretty interesting
too but of course you need something to
compare it to so Darren well okay so you
did do benchmark if you do DD you can
say your input file for example in this
case slash dev slash zero is it's just a
in slash dev there's always a file
called zero it contains just zeros there
is also a really cool one called you
random that has random sorry oh no you
are and and then the output file and
then how big I wanted to do and then the
count 1024 so with the one mag and count
1024 this is going to do a gigabyte of
goodies into that file that I just
created
and there we go I got 134 megabytes per
second that is this is a dozen or yeah
you know what that's the thing about
much of that could have been in RAM I'm
not really sure but that's an SSD for
you but I think the thing to take away
here no let's do it on yours here I'm
gonna do it on yours okay and put a
pound in front of that and
there we go all right give it a sec and
this will only take a moment
there goes okay ray okay so check that
out so this is d6 56.7 so my solid state
is almost three times faster than your
fifty four hundred rpms minidisc really
yeah and no way mind you this is like a
best-case scenario kind of test I like
your benchmark program better attitude I
think like the lesson learned is
obviously like stop buying i3 Shannon
seriously like 100 bucks whatever it is
it's like 300 more yeah yeah okay I
guess I was in college all right and
then I was poor I think the other
important thing is though that like
these tests mean nothing alone exactly
yes so if I were not here with a very
similar machine it would just be on the
point yeah it's very true so there is
one other tests that you can run from
this website it's the my sequel
benchmark of course again I'm not going
to run through that since I don't have
my sequel set up on my machine but it'll
also give you a lot of pertinent data
that you can use especially if you're
doing like a whole bunch of database
load ups and a bunch of crazy stuff so
if you're a DBA you probably already
know this stuff but if you're just
wanting to like stress test your machine
why not yeah so that's basically the
rundown of different benchmarking
techniques that you can use for Linux
they should send us their scores oh yeah
dude
yes you know my Twitter it's at snubs
and then you can email us feedback at
hak5 org with or benchmarking there you
go yeah tell us how it works you can be
more like twenty eight seconds twenty
eight point seven seconds if you have
other ways to do it too yeah then you
know DeeDee and my new place ways that I
found suspension yeah cool all right
well let us know we're gonna be back in
just a bit but until then we will see
you later
we're gonna we're gonna what we're
hovering where are we going oh no wait
let me tell you guys about one of my
favorite rfcs RFC 920 it defined it the
very first top-level domain do you guys
know them calm us edu gov Mill and org
were some of the first five but you know
wasn't actually on the list dotnet and
yet it still came into being at the same
time in 1985 and is to this day the
third most popular top-level domain
right behind comm and dot de then get
this no registration or no special
restrictions anyone can go ahead and get
them I get um Shannon gets them we get
them at domain.com they make it so fast
affordable reliable it's easy to use and
then guys over domain comms they're so
cool they're huge fans of hack five and
you guys so they want to hook you up
they're offering 15% off their already
affordable domain names and hosting so
when you use the coupon code hak5 at
domain coms chicka checkout you get the
hook-up and it helps us up and hoax you
up and everybody's just getting hooked
up so when you think domain names think
domain.com last week's trivia question
was Advanced Encryption standard AES for
short was introduced in what year in by
what establishment and that answer is
2001 by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology n ist for short
now this week's question is Ronald
Rivest authored what cryptographic hash
functions you can answer that
over at hack 5 org slash trivia for your
chance to win some awesome hack 5 swag
