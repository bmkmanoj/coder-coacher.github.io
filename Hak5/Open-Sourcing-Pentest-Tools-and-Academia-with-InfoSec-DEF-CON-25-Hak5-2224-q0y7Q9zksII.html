testing tools in academia with InfoSec
all that and more this time on hash five
everyone welcome to this episode of hack
five my name is Shannon Morris I'm
Darrin kitchen and this is your weekly
dose of techno West you always wanted a
go you already feel like it yeah I feel
like I should walk in I should throw my
sweater on a chair and then I should tie
my shoes oh my gosh like what was his
name
I used to watch the show when I was a
kid what was it called though the one
with the dew is in Rogers yes mr. Rogers
yeah I know I could like it we need a I
need a new set we need like a big living
room set to be able to do that you can
test it that would be really cool bring
back the swivel camera oh man the crane
we need to that yeah we could use a
little little sprucing up in the studio
anyway when I want some fun stuff today
we do we have a couple of different
interviews the first one with is with
Chris aka lava lamp on Twitter he is
talking about open sourcing his tool
which helps you automate a lot of
penetration testing and a lot of like
vulnerability scanning numeration
getting an idea of the assets of the
organization yeah cool stuff even if
you're not doing a pen test yeah you're
like an IT administrator you might want
to use this against your own stuff and
then right after that we are
interviewing Brittney who is in academia
and she's talking about how you can
further project research even after
people graduate so that InfoSec
professionals can also use these tools
as well so really interesting stuff
today I hope you enjoy it
we got good stuff from Def Con we'll see
you on the other side today we have the
unique pleasure being joined by Chris
Greyson from a website Chris thanks for
joining us man dude so much awesome
stuff came out of Def Con this year you
had an awesome shock and you also
tweeted quote yes I'm open sourcing a
software platform that automates attack
surface enumeration we chatted Brad it
briefly with Mel over by the
lock-picking station tell me about the
technology of lava lamp and like what
brought it on and and how you came to
now release it to the open source
community yeah
yeah absolutely so my background is the
knight Network penetration testing I
really like breaking into things I kind
of found throughout throughout the
course of getting better at depth and I
was doing a lot of manual information
gathering like running and mask and
taking that throwing it over to iwitness
using Metasploit to gather information
about SMB servers all this stuff and I
found that it wasn't really whether or
not basically if you just looked harder
all you have to do is find the stuff
that everybody else is missed and so I'm
pretty good at that and my comment I've
spent pretty much half the time of all
these engagements gabbing all that
information and that's what enabled me
to be very successful
so what website is is just that
automated at scale so it runs never
extend that does domain name or I could
look up the subdomain enumeration it
does application layer fingerprinting
and take screenshots of web applications
crawls web applications it tries to
identify the frameworks with them it
exposes it all DNA API it's consumed on
the front end by a front single page app
written in angular but really the goal
here is to make it so that you can have
the situational awareness that you
require to either defend the
organization that you're responsible for
or to attack it wow that's that's that's
a whole lot and I know that there's been
several tools I mean you know you can do
this manually there's a ton of tools out
there what were some of the tools that
you were using to do this previously so
running nmap using zmapp I really like
Chris Junkers I witness you basically
just feed it a list of URLs and it spits
back to your report with a bunch of
screenshots because like honestly you
know this is 2017 the majority of your
attack service is probably in your web
applications and if I have a list of
5,000 URLs there's really not a good
process for you to determine what's on
those endpoints other than give me some
screenshots about that so use this
phantom Jas it also uses like Python
celery it outside of that there's also
another tool called scanner which is
some new like basically never service
fingerprinting tool written in Erlang so
I'm probably going to roll that in as
well but that's really kind of an Minnis
plate as well of course after all kind
of information gallery modules they have
right now you know here's the thing your
tool focuses heavily on automation which
actually a lot of other tools focus on
you mentioned nmap Metasploit and things
of that nature I feel like as hackers
we're very keen on
automate
in those mundane tasks whether that's
born out of laziness or boredom or just
you know wanting to make time for the
more important things in life like
counter-strike why do you think that is
so I mean I heard before that the best
programmers are the laziest ones because
you write something right once and then
it just does it right and you have that
free time again but when when it comes
to automation as far as this project was
concerned by the time that I was
continuing to get better at every pen
testing I found myself more responsible
for helping these organizations secure
their perimeters so instead of like I'm
only attacking now I'm kind of going
onto the blue side and really these
companies did not have situational
awareness it's like every single time I
got in you know I would show them how I
got like what where is that how did you
find that
and so automation in this sense like you
need to have situational awareness about
your environment about your network
about your enterprise and if you're only
using manual tools to gather all this
information by the time you put it all
together you collate it you create some
quick sort of cohesive understanding of
the environment have that data it's
probably stale I mean if you think about
how quickly an enterprise never changes
like if you looked at what's on an
enterprise network at 8:00 a.m.
at 4:00 p.m. and then at 10:00 p.m. in a
single day it can be completely
different
so if you don't have something that has
the ability to automate that information
gathering process then the fact that you
run it manually is too slow by the time
you actually have any understanding of
what you're looking at you probably are
looking at a significant amount of stale
data so that was one of the big
motivations for me
cool cool now I want to come back to
automation in a second but I also feel
like as hackers we're also compelled to
not only understand the complex system
which your tool seems to do pretty well
but also to create our own and I feel
like a business is really no different
so what were your key takeaways from
this experience building out this tool
as a business yeah yeah yeah so I've
actually I have it on my to-do list
right a post-mortem of kind of the
things that went wrong but so one thing
is if you're going to try and start a
company have a partner like I try to
students doing this as a one-man show
you will get you will read a lot of
things that say run and
we need as mean as you possibly can and
I did that and then I found out that I
was running too lean there are too many
things I could handle it in the
beginning but then as things kind of
ramped up there was there are more
things that I have to take
responsibility for so reaching out to
customers doing marketing building the
website building the front-end user
experience user interface when you know
this was all detracting from my ability
to continue building out the product so
that was one really big takeaway another
really big takeaway is that you need to
have a product that actually is
basically going to somebody and telling
them there that their house is on fire
when they're very much aware of that is
not very helpful so I would go to people
and I would say look I'm going to give
you the situational awareness that you
need in order to strategize properly
upon how you can actually defend this
network and they're like we already know
that everything is bad like we are
already so inundated we have too many
problems we don't have enough headcount
we don't have enough staff whether they
need is water so a lot of the feedback
that I got was like okay this tool is
great but how does it start
detracting for my problem skin it's
going to tell me more it might enable me
to prioritize better but what they
wanted was this is going to instrument
my vulnerability scanners this is going
to make them more effective is it going
to automatically get rid of some of
these issues that I don't have to worry
about them anymore and that really
wasn't within the scope of the tool that
I was building so those two put together
we're kind of two of the biggest
takeaways from what I would do
differently or what I will do
differently - next mmm no no I feel you
I mean and it's you know it's so much
easier to identify what's wrong than it
is to go and fix it kind of like it's
easier to break something that is to
build something yeah I feel like as you
know similar to brilliant artists right
I feel like brilliant hackers may be
something that you're just born with
well being at least good at business as
a skill you could just learn you
mentioned a very important skill
delegation very important one to learn
I'm so struggling with what skills would
you have learned that might have helped
you get the company off the ground
better outside of just having partners
and and people to delegate to delegation
for sure time management for sure as
well I think especially when you're an
engineer when you start dealing with
stuff that's kind of
the technical realm it's very stressful
and it's kind of my way of handling that
was like okay well I'll deal with this
for a bit I'm going to go back to
writing software because I know how to
do that so I'm going to keep building
this product now because of the products
good enough people will buy it but that
wasn't really that wasn't really the
case I should have it should have been
incremental improvements instead of
focusing on I'm going to make this as
good as possible make it as big as
possibly four before I try to bring it
to market in retrospect I should have
focused on getting something small out
the door that people would put money in
my hands for it and then iterated upon
that and so instead of doing that I went
too far as a solo founder and you know
kind of found myself in troubled waters
hmm well I mean so you did build out
quite a large system so let's go back to
talking about some of the technology so
if you're now releasing you know the
intellectual property of what two years
of your work so how can i as a hacker go
and use this today what what am I going
to need to know to spend something up
you made it easy or if there like a path
I can take it so it's quite complex it's
very dependent relating on my github
page there are three separate
repositories there's one for the
front-end code which is all written in
angular 2 typescript there's one for the
back-end code which is all Python so it
uses makes usage a rest frame where
python celery and realize upon rabbit
and to rise on elasticsearch post post
grass reddit so it's very complex to get
it all up and so the third repository is
I've actually docker eyes everything so
I would highly recommend that anybody
that wants to play around with this I
check out the dr. repository all you
have to do is basically set up your own
elasticsearch server and set up your own
Postgres server and then copy some
config files over till it can take files
out and then just build the docker
images and then docker compose up and
you'll have it run locally so it's in
that sense it's fairly easy to get set
up but then if you're going to run this
in production I would recommend getting
the two separate repositories and
getting it set up at scale Wow see that
actually leaves beautifully into my next
question and it kind of you know hits on
that point of like we're all into
automation and convenience right even
attackers and so and the docker image
yeah it does sound like a great way to
just like it get up to
but of course in production you want to
go through your own fun dependency how
so here's the thing the byproduct of
automation of unique skills this unique
skill of being able to understand the
attack surface on identify those
vulnerabilities that that being
automated you know makes that tool
something that anyone can become a
better hacker by having but some may
argue that this may foster a community
of script kitties
where just anyone can point a tool at
something and do something that had
previously taken human with a lot of
skill what are your thoughts on that so
so I wanted this English that I'm
actually not looking for vulnerabilities
by you know anybody that's seen an SS
report or well any any vulnerability
scan and report knows that there's
usually a lot of noise you know these
can be hundreds of pages long but it's
not usually all that helpful what I
found was that I didn't really need
boner ability scanners to tell me
anything what I wanted to know about are
what Web Apps are you running what
versions are they running what different
network services do you have open what
different SSL protocols do you support
so I'm not actually collecting any
information about vulnerabilities I'm
only collecting information about the
environment so that you can then
strategize on top of that and as far as
the whole script getting thing goes you
know the more we automate anything to
make anything easier of course there
will be you know bad actors that get
their hands on it but the goal of this
tool is to provide you with kind of the
I liken it is if you like Game of
Thrones you know you see all these
people strategizing for the battle the
next day and they're all standing around
a table and on that table is a map and
right now I feel like we don't really
have that map to strategize for the
battle that we're all currently waging
and so I want to provide that map if you
aren't skilled and somebody gives you a
map then you're not really going to know
what to do with it but if you do have
that information in hand and you have
the skills as well having that
situational awareness is going to enable
you to be far more effective well yeah
no it does definitely seem like one of
those things where you know especially
with the screenshots being able to see
like what are those 5,000 websites
actually look like leaving that
information into a skilled professional
that can add a glance no like oh that
that's where the good stuff lies you
still do need so maybe your target
market was actually read teams and not
companies it was it was though that was
another so so going back to your
question earlier about you know how
would you improve upon this I'd known
your target market I thought I was going
to enterprises I kind of want to blow
this up big but the people that were
most interested in is where
consultancies because they saw you know
they're doing all this internally like a
lot of teams have actually tried
building tools like this internally they
rely on this information so yeah it's I
had built it originally as a Red Team
tool but then when I heard through some
blue teams they like oh yeah if you can
just tell me literally to just tell me
where all my wordpress apps are that's a
huge benefit so I'm starting catering
towards that or at our time as well yeah
do you know where that mp4 server is in
the closet like you're seeing packets
from it but we literally have no clue in
the data center where it is yes so just
like all that different traffic we call
it a day yeah yeah nice nice yeah and
then the ethernet cable ran into the
wall sorry shoulda try to go stories
listen where can people find more about
about website and and how can they
contribute to the project going forward
oh man so I my check out my github repo
so my username on github is lava lamp
with a dash after it that turns out that
when you're handling lamps you can get
that name on friggin any social media
site because they're all taken up by the
company you know but whatever so they
can go there and they can contribute to
those repositories I wrote a blog post
on this as well explaining kind of my
motivations behind it and how to use it
and how to get it set up although all
the code repositories are heavily
documented I've actually already gotten
some issues from people that are trying
to set it up and so I'm very much you
know this is kind of a labor of love I'm
still very much involved in this you
know at my current position I get to
continue contributing to it so yeah
check out the github repos check out the
documentation if you know if there's any
questions anything like that I try and
respond as quickly as possible check out
my blog which is la da la MP it's pretty
happy to get that one forum post on it
and yeah just go from there Chris dude
thank you so much for joining us I
really can't wait to check out your post
mortem on your blog as well and just
thank you for taking your labor of love
and that two years of intellectual
property and pouring it out into the
open source community I just know that
when you put good into the universe
good comes back and I wish you all the
best thank you so much Mike really you
know I can't stress enough and
especially in this industry we are
standing on the shoulders of giants like
we could not do I mean there's so much
good open-source software this community
is you know by the time that everything
had failed
I had no qualms releasing it because you
know I'm here because what people have
done before me so I love to put it for
it and thank you guys so much for having
me thank you I really I applaud your
efforts and I applaud everything you're
doing for this community thank you thank
you Cheers got a great idea
bring it to the web the way we do and
head over to domain.com we've got a
slick domain discovery system and an
easy checkout process so your site will
be online in no time and the domain.com
guys have been supporting have five
beers and they want to celebrate with a
massive promo code use a JK jumbo for
thirty five percent off new domain
registration now through November 30th
it's a limited time offer so when you
think domain names think domain.com
lately I've been really digging into the
humanists approach to InfoSec and one of
the people that's really delving into
this as well for academia is Brittney
posnick off a case tres over on
Twitter's you can always find her over
there she is over at University of
Waterloo working in the cryptography and
security and privacy lab Brittany how
are you doing today
very well thanks how are you doing I'm
doing awesome thank you so I really
wanted to delve into this because I
think this is sorely missing from the
InfoSec industry as far as how do you
take these projects that a lot of people
are working on in academia and you
actually turn it into something that you
know companies and InfoSec a culture can
actually use so the big thing that I
started talking about is how researchers
when they're building you tools the
tools
Arthur focus tools aren't science tools
help you dude that's it right and so by
the time you have a master students or
PhD student that's been working on a
tool four to five to five years for the
science the right draw that by the time
they're done like honestly that's a long
time super fee on one day but isn't even
your major focus it helps you to meet
your focus so by the time the done they
just kind of want to draw it in most
cases and while you're doing your master
and PhD usually you can't let people
help you a lot of tools this is
something you have to do yourself right
depending on it set up whether it is a
is for your thesis itself and you can
have at help the fixing you I really try
and promote is joining up industry and
academia and make sure that partnership
there is the research is done they have
somebody top it off on to because at
that point you know the person might be
going on to PhD and a new topic if
they're messaging or they may be going
to industry or the may be going to that
job so they're really just done and the
other thing I really try and show it's
like your so these tools aren't made for
just for anybody else to see it is what
can I program superfast to make sure
this pool is done I finished my thesis I
can move on with my life right so
sometimes it's kind of broken or like it
just does the thing and there's no notes
in the code but I'm sure that industry
professionals would also be able to get
some use out of these tools as well
right
very true but the big barrier here is
that people are really embarrassed by
their code sometimes but it's really
hard to put it public and spend time is
cleaning it up when you're just so done
with it hmm so the basic people in
industry but they want to offer to take
over tool it suggests like hey I will do
a code review I will clean it up for you
I will make sure it's preventable I get
you're okay with it before it goes on
github Beauty credit so what do academia
experts and people that are creating
these tools for you know their for their
final exams or whatever it might be what
do they need to do to really get these
tools out into the industry so that
everybody can make use of them
it really just is that partnership um
you know having somebody in industry
who's read your paper and if they're
super but excited about it and one kid
just to email the academic person say
hey can I can I help put this tool in
market how can I get this out there
around doors and then it is just yeah
I'll French desk over to be offering to
get a code awesome stuff so these people
aren't embarrassed and they don't fake
like I hope in it can make some more
difficult get a job it's not your baby
right not only offer to all these people
is huge so of course us InfoSec
professionals who are out of school
right now we need to focus a lot more on
taking people under our wing networking
with them from the academia side are
there things that they could do better
as well to make sure that their tools
are being used so we love it enacted
a.m. registry people have open source
tools like oh my gosh it makes
everything so much easier when there's a
tool that will like generate fake
chocolate for you or when it will or if
there's tool that will let you do that
one specific thing and that's the big
thing with academia the students
industry like get the tool out there
makes it obvious that it's out there and
one person adopts it in a paper you see
that tool collaborate so fast through
academia like everybody's using it the
next year so we're huge proponents of
like gay that thousand source software
for sure
now you mentioned papers and this is
something that I also wanted to ask you
about a lot of times when I do research
for my own shows I run into paywalls
online I can't find the direct research
that I need although I can find plenty
of articles about those things but I
prefer to go straight to the source to
find out the information that I need so
that I can make sure that it's extremely
factual is there anything that I could
do from my end to make sure that I'm
getting their information out there like
straight from the facts as opposed to
running into these paywalls
sure so the thing is is as academics our
whole life is centered around citations
right where people as you can get using
your information the better like it just
helps our career - so the thing is is
like people kind of heard us - yeah so
the big thing there is honestly just
approach the academic who's written a
paper like if you do Google scholarship
search and find the paper you want and
you see the list of authors check their
web page most academics will be posting
their work on their web page like PDF
copies you can just grab it there
the other day say just asking them
directly because there's a chance you
could help about by inviting them to
come do a laptop or inviting them to
help with an article or something else
that's they can also put that on their
CV which is really supporting too so
this approach people taught them this is
the community you like helping each
other out 7 140 characters on Twitter
and another line of work before so it
just yeah approach them I'll need to say
hey this is the thing I'm working on it
this is why I really like your paper I
will give you a shout out if I will you
know give you some way to reference this
in your own CV tweet tokyo's and onion
honestly if you love for your
information shoot we're there to help
each other so yeah yeah absolutely I
love it when I hear that other people
are trying to get things open-source
trying to kind of include everybody in
their research as well I think that's so
important especially in InfoSec because
it's growing continuously I did want to
make a slight tangent I know that
conventions are a great place for people
to network especially not just to find
jobs but also to share the research that
they're doing in talks like the talk
that you gave at b-sides but also just
to talk to people on the show floor do
you recommend going to conventions as a
good way as well definitely I actually
brought my own first year this year and
she actually did both back development
and I was talking about how much he
loved info spec and how great the
community was for supporting me and
making me just grow faster and she came
and if you lower away how supportive
everybody was but all much people were
willing to talk to her and I was
definitely suggested just because it is
an opportunity to meet people get out of
there sharing research and just like
geek out with bunch of other people
totally I completely agree with you I'm
on this like convention high right now
just because of the amazing week that we
just spent in Las Vegas and I'm so happy
you got to meet you as well
is there anything that we did not
include in this interview yet that you
would also like to include yes a I'm
really trying to support out there is
idea that if you're in industry and want
to write a paper approach in academic we
are like willing to collaborate help
raise that paper and get work basically
a formalized that paper stays there
forever so if you ever need any help
renovate or reach out to your like from
the academics yes find some mentors in
the industry Brittany where can people
reach out to you if they have any
questions or if they are looking for
somebody that can help them with their
papers as I said earlier is a definitely
approach key and I'm on twitter with
straight ftra I Phe perfect thank you so
much Brittany it was a pleasure speaking
to you and good luck in your career well
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of pack five but before we get
going I want to thank everyone for what
is that sending Dicker's we have
speakers we also have some gifts from a
fan but I'm going to leave those for the
next coming weeks we have several that
I've been waiting for you to get back
into studios that we could open that
we're gonna have a mail time it's going
to be fun yeah are going to have mail
time so if you want to send us stickers
or gifts from fans you can send those
over to hak5 org slash address that is
our current address that you can send
products or stickers to we love
supporting everybody in the industry so
definitely let us know we have a bunch
of new sticker so let's do a little fast
rule yes dude what's up on this match
this might be my favorite it says NSA
monitored device I got that from a dong
life okay now oh yeah I you know I kind
of want to put it on my laptop here
because it is an NSA monitored device
but then again what isn't and let's just
put it on the wall I want to give a
quick shout out as well to this one
which is Armistice Brewing Company which
is a brand-new local brewery in the East
Bay in San Francisco or San Francisco
East Bay area so if you are in the
Richmond California area check them out
they're brand new they have really
really good beers and they grew them on
site so you know what we should all get
together at a brewery and launch a new
hak5 product that sounds like a really
good idea we should talk to them to see
if we could do it there oh wait hey
speaking of awesome high five gear you
