by Netflix as always we value your
feedback so it's time to check port 110
goo it's still popping our mail right
you're still wearing those two aren't
you I might be okay I took them off for
my segment alright let's get into some
emails okay Mike in Michigan writes I am
studying for my a plus certification and
have become interested in learning how
to program good for you Mike what would
be the best language to start with and
what should I move on to you after that
I've started looking into Python but
I've heard others say to forget Python
and learn Java Perl Ruby etc any help
would be greatly appreciated good
question yeah well I mean if you talk to
a Java developer he's gonna talk to tell
you dude forget Python learning Java to
talk to a ruby developer he's gonna say
forget the Java try Ruby honestly any of
those languages languages you pick up
are going to teach you the fundamentals
of languages and it's just like speaking
you know English German French whatever
the more languages you can speak the
more fluently you'll be able to like and
quickly able to pick up additional
languages because they all kind of have
very similar constructs I personally
think that Python is a good beginners
language you could probably grab a book
you know from your local dead you know
dead trees store and and you know knock
it out in a weekend just kind of have a
really really good concept with had to
do that stuff I know that you learned I
learned Java when I was in college and
it was pretty good starter it got me
some general ideas of how to understand
other programming languages I'm not a
fan of syntax it's quiet kind of gross
yeah yeah I don't know
so there are some good options but
really as far as what language to go on
after that it really depends on what it
is you're going to be doing with it if
you're you know looking to write like
you know shell scripts maybe you should
learn you know TCL or or another
language that is apt for that if you're
if you're looking to be a web developer
you might need to you know look pick up
PHP so I guess it really just depends on
what you're looking to do with it
if you're in the 90s you could learn
HTML well I mean that's still valuable
or a poor transcript you'd learn Fortran
occur in the eighties Pascal what you
learn emails I wanna know what you
learned
Thomas writes our second email can you
go to the CMD and make up IP addresses
and then pain
them to see if someone has it or if
there is there a faster way to come find
company IP addresses yeah actually there
is you can you can do it that way it
might take a while or you could do and
map tak VV for very verbose tag locates
s capital P and then give it an IP range
say on our network 10 73 31 0/24 because
its last 24 Network so it's gonna do 10
73 31.1 through 10 73 31.2 55 go ahead
and enter and I don't have an AMT
installed because I can't type so an
m-80 though will totally go ahead and do
a host scan and that's how you do that
also check out Xen map if you're not
really interested in the command line
stuff it's basically a GUI front-end for
that ok cool yep interesting you do all
that in backtrack well you can do in
backtrack you can install in map in
Windows as well and Zen map it's great
in Windows I love it ok cool and our
next email JD writes could upper tooth
potentially be used as a remote key
logging tool for wireless mic and
keyboards absolutely that's the whole
idea right now it's I mean the thing is
the uber tooth is a development platform
right so while there isn't a module that
currently does just that
you know with just coming through the
packet capture which we're going to show
you guys in next week er than a week
after how to do exactly that it's just a
matter of somebody putting together
again a script a program whatever
language you want to write it in to go
ahead and find that data and parse
through it and you know probably reverse
engineer whatever protocol they're using
to transmit that stuff yeah not exactly
the idea here ok cool and our last email
is from J boo 92 he writes and not a
huge fan of the new format of splitting
up the show into segments hope this
isn't going to be a continuing trend we
actually split it up my block our show
has always been done in these you know
distinct block blocks yeah sometimes d
right now you're watching the C Block
and we just tweaked to the format just a
bit so that we can continue putting our
stuff out on YouTube and
in these playlists now so if you're
watching on YouTube you may notice that
there's like a bumper at the end where
you can click to advance to the next
video if you're downloading this you
have no clue what we're talking about if
you go over to yeah downloads are still
the same it's just one complete episode
and one a little bit yeah that's
revision3.com
but yeah on youtube it also makes it
easily searchable if you're looking for
a specific segment it might not be in
the normal title that we used to put
into him but now each segment will be
split up into its separate little video
so you'll be able to search it easier
helps and we're gonna take a quick break
