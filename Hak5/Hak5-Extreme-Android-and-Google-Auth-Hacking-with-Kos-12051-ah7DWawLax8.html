by domain.com
hello and welcome hak5 my name is Darren
kitchen and this is your weekly dose of
Technol us great show I'm Shiva smart
Hasek show this week there's a drink
your water yeah water Hey
hello and welcome to season 12 season 12
cheers to that salon chairs uh roast
roast mmm pot roast
what what are you from dude we are
talking about physical security you know
how I feel about this it's like cool
this is a cool security all that's it's
irrelevant
it's a revelant I think it's one of
those it's not a reverent though um
we're talking about physical security
this time in the context of Android and
you guys know how I feel about like USB
switchblade USB rubber ducky like all
those fun attacks typically against
computers and servers now we're talking
about on phones what next time you're
you're at drinks with your friends and
you leave your phone at the you know at
the table and you go to the loo and
you're all like oh what happened when a
Kimbo you know somebody did that when I
was at Stephanie cheese wedding this uh
personal are you kidding and somebody
left their Android phone on there and my
somebody got from their phones Oh see
you too they have uh they didn't have
like a unlock thing or did they use face
to unlock and you it was unlocked
it was totally unlocked so I had I had
some good times that's awesome yeah to
be honest about the unlocking and what
now this is an idea that I've had for a
while here is like we've got these
phones that have NFC right right um if
you've ever played with face to unlock
on five or whatever in it okay whatever
um if you've ever played with the new
stuff in I think it was introduced in
Ice Cream Sandwich there's a face to
unlock rather than your like Swat slide
or whatever and so since they understand
the technology isn't completely proven
with like holding the camera faithing
going and trying to get yourself in a
little circle in LA they have a backup
where if within so much amount of time
it's not able to recognize your face it
just asks you for your second you're not
second factor but a different
authentication mechanism it defaults
your pin code
and I've always thought is since there's
NFC in this guy and as we met with the
as we talked at torque on about you know
getting RFID implantation yeah yeah
imagine if you had a ring that was NFC
and you you hold your phone and then
suddenly you've got a layer of
authentication oh you know I could do
that I mean it's something you could
lose like chip it in there yeah yeah I
don't know are you sure there's not a
chip and your engagement ring he might
have put a GPS in there thanks oh now I
don't think there's one in there but I
could totally install one just solder it
a little bit you would have like Robocop
ring or something happy awesome but
anyway yeah that's what we're talking
about this week we're getting into some
physical security I'm really stoked
about it
we've got some fun toys coming to the
hack shop for this and if you're going
to Derby con you're gonna want to be
there for causes talk I am so excited we
have so much stuff coming up for what's
on the radar Shannon so we have plenty
coming up first office September 20th
the e FF pioneer Awards I've never been
to those and I'm pretty excited about
that it's going up got on in San
Francisco so we'll definitely be there
if you're in town check it out next up
after that is Derby con yes I am so
excited
didn't you enjoy Darby Calma every gun
is great it's a it's the perfect excuse
to go down to Louisville Kentucky and
it's going on this September 7 27th
through 30th I don't know what the best
part about going to Derby con is yeah
hugs grits and sweet tea over there and
OH Louisville Kentucky I thought it was
that that relic would give you man hugs
that's who that's why I go wow that's
why Paul goes um and we're so proud to
be saying that we're actually sponsoring
this one so come on down we're also
gonna be shooting some segments for
bringing out the hack shop so come join
for that one definitely check it out
yeah I'm gonna be over there at the
table the entire weekend so you can see
me over there and then October 2nd
Darren is holding a hid hacking workshop
at noise bridge in San Francisco another
noise bridge a workshop so if you're in
the Bay Area come out you know you know
what's really fun about the Bay Area
hackers is is I'm kind of in this unit
of people well yes but what a
fascinating is I'm an interesting
Shamir only because of the show and I'm
just like a hacker like the rest of you
guys but what I find is that is kind of
a hub-and-spoke model in that you guys
already know me and I want to meet you
so come out to this event but the the
awesome hackers that have met in San
Francisco is super cool and that it's
like kind of a hub-and-spoke and I'm
trying to make it more of a mesh so
there's some really awesome stuff going
on in the Bay Area so if you're one of
those likes to tinker with the the tour
and the bitcoins and the other waves and
the microwaves for sure and all those
other 2.4 microwave is cool all those
other fun stuff come out to newest
bridge on the second it'll be a great
chance for us all to get together do
some HID hacking and then see what other
kind of table flip and fun we can have
we could have a very early Halloween
costume party at Noisebridge on the
second we could in fact I think you
should come and costume could be the
only one I will wear my BSG costume so
say we all
what's coming up so say we all I don't
know stay tuned because next up coming
up with Kyle oh poor Kyle oh born oh boy
okay caused harm caused I oh and he'll
be joining us for some fun Android phone
to phone hacking but first a quick break
Burke demand a calm guys know how I feel
about domain names are essential for
showcasing your blog your portfolio your
business let me tell you something about
choosing domain names you can get a
dot-com that's what I should have
registered when I got hacked five over
seven years ago that's right I'm not the
TV I nod the org the doc comes the one
you want that's the one that's
universally known it's remembered it's
the best is globally understood it lends
credibility the best part is coms only
affordable at domain.com the whole hak5
crew uses them domain.com because
they're so easy to the best they're
reliably you don't have to you know get
gouged and you know hit up with the
relevant upsells or anything plus you
can't go wrong with a company that has
an awesome human approach to business
just seriously tweet at domain.com and
you'll see their customer support it's a
breath of fresh air so do this check it
out go to domain.com they are huge fans
of hack 5 they're gonna hook you up 15%
off they're already
affordable domain names and hosting all
you have to do is use the coupon code
hak5 it checked out that's 15% and big
savings at domain.com so don't forget to
use the coupon code hak5 when you think
domain names think domain.com you guys
know how we feel when it comes to
physical access all bets are off and
that's why causes here hey hey that's
going cause we're good how about you
talking Android physical access get this
there's this we just covered this on TNT
the other day there's a diner in New
York not a diner there's this restaurant
they do like family style restaurants
and as such maybe they're a little
annoyed by people playing Angry Birds at
the dinner table or whatever they're
offering a five percent discount if you
leave your phone with the receptionist
Oh scary
so would you do that not at all it's
almost like asking me to leave my lock
or my wallet with them yeah or your
Google Wallet in the case of Android
yeah so what is this awesome project
you're talking about at tor camp and are
you're talking about your extend cool
stuff with a derby con p2p ADB we're not
talking about friend a friend file
transfers here oh it might be friend a
friend yeah there is some friends friend
going on friend to victim
so p2p ADB is a phone to phone ADB a DV
is Androids development debug bridge
it's useful for developing applications
and debugging you know it basically
gives you shell on your Android device
who doesn't love a shell it's like it's
like the serial port headers on like
embedded electronics are like JTAG you
know absolutely um how did this project
come about so this project actually
started completely benign and I was
driving over the hills over to Santa
Cruz to walk go see a concert and I
rebooted my phone and I accidentally
screwed something up right before I
rebooted it and I was stuck in a boot
loop yeah
the zoast so I had another phone with me
and I had root on the other phone and I
had a terminal on the other phone and
all I could think of is man what if I
had the right hardware to plug one phone
into the other and I had the right
application to interface
with that phone and act it act as a host
for that phone so it's not like you had
a laptop with the microUSB cable in
around what you had was two phones at
the same time yeah one of them not
working one of them working and I knew I
knew that I would be able to fix it I
knew what was wrong I just did not have
the preparation to do it some might say
you were on the go tell me about these
OTG cables so the OTG cables are great
they basically transform anything that
you plug them into into a host mode
device it is specific to hardware but
the Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus 7
actually support it along with a bunch
of other devices so it basically turns
your device so we have we have the USB
go right here so this device is now
acting as the host device for this
device so this device doesn't know that
it's not plugged into a computer as far
as its concerned oh yeah
it's this computer exactly what's a
computer but porkchop saying is awful
I'm sorry
anyway continuing on yeah so so as far
as the Nexus 7 is concerned it's
connected to a computer right now and
it's actually so USB also you can't tell
I don't think on the video but it's
actually charging mine is next weekend
from my phone but to cat literally this
is like this is some hippie stuff man is
the transference of energy that's that's
what we're talking about next time it's
gonna be power crystals anyway umm
that's fantastic so this is great
because there are lots of you know we'll
get into USB charging but there's lots
of opportunities for charging and mayhem
or leaving your phone up at the counter
while you go to charge it yeah not
mayhem what does this allow you to do on
the phone and what is the requirements
on the phone I'm wondering like okay
cool I can keep this little OTG cable in
my pocket I can have your awesome
PTP adb Android attack framework on it
but what what my victims have - what's
the use case or and what are those those
what's my attack footprint if you will
yes so the the people that I'm looking
at mostly are going to
the developers or the more tech-savvy
group of people I'm looking at the
people that are probably going to be
modding their phone often be swapping
out roms and all that because the idea
is that the people that are going to be
more tech savvy are going to have more
access to things that I want access to
they're going to be the IT people on a
company or they're gonna be some sort of
in some sort of management system where
they have they literally have the keys
to the system or maybe not even that
maybe they just have a s/mime
certificates or something or gbg keys on
their device but those are the people
the more tech-savvy sort of people that
are probably going to have a DB enabled
and that's really what I'm looking for a
DB enabled on your device with a DB
enabled you're running around with a DB
enabled we can do something like this
and and so as far as like you know what
we're used to seeing on our phone this
is when you check that box that says USB
the bug mode I know that I've actually
used this in segments before I did one
years ago about you know tethering a
Linux laptop to an Android phone to get
internet access through USB and it
required you know USB debug mode I think
I even had to have it routed back when I
used to always route my phone just to do
cool like Wi-Fi tethering stuff
eventually I got paranoid enough to just
get myself a Nexus put a lock screen on
it call it a day
not so much sort of so if you are using
ADB but you're not rooted there are
still quote this it's still very much an
attack platform that we can take
advantage of they're still out there
that we can get to but not only ADB
there's there's other things I'm looking
for so let's say maybe maybe I just want
to steal a device maybe or maybe I don't
want to steal device maybe you left your
device with me while you gonna need
dinner if that device has a recovery
partition like clockworkmod or even if
it's an unlocked bootloader like the
Galaxy Nexus in the Nexus 7 there are
among loaders monitors
they're locked but you can unlock them
with a very quick command oh and to
unlock them that's basically how you
route it you just unlock it and then you
don't lock it because it's a pain in the
butt because it wipes your data when you
you know when I think about when I've
rooted android devices and I'm just like
you know following the tutorial like
what's the thing where the dessert rush
or the whatever it is it's always like
get the clockworkmod install this update
the zip have fun yeah
there's no like go back and and lock
things down and it's it's actually kind
of dismaying checking out like all the
the forums on android routing and all
that no one ever mentions relocking your
bootloader getting rid of the recovery
partition because quite frankly it's a
pain to do
I mean you lock your bootloader and then
you have to read you have to unlock it
later and in the in the instance of the
Galaxy Nexus in the Nexus 7 for good
reason it wipes your part data partition
it wipes all of your user data smart
unlock the device and that's
specifically so I can't just unlock your
phone and run my own on site image I
mean this is the equivalent of rebooting
somebody's laptop onto like a live CD
and dding their hard drive exactly but
then the thing with that is because it's
such a pain a lot of people don't bother
to re walk there we lock their device
and if there's a lot of there's a lot of
suggestion on those forums and you
shouldn't do this you shouldn't ReWalk
your device you shouldn't worry about
getting rid of clockworkmod and you know
what's interesting about this is you
know we talked about the the attack
footprint this is actually our audience
is you guys I mean if you're in the
audience right now raise your hand if
your phone is rooted or you use you know
USB debug mode for any kind of weird
application because we're hackers it's
what we do right and yet also we work in
these organizations where we have the
root access to the sequel server or
whatever it may be and so we take these
same devices to the office connect them
to the Wi-Fi network there if you are
able to you know get access to my phone
for a few seconds with your with your
tool and push a application over to this
you could potentially pivot through this
just like you would with like a
meterpreter shell right right and that
is actually why it's a secondary reason
that I designed this application because
as soon as I realized oh man I can plug
one phone into another and fix it I also
realized well if I can fix it I can fix
it in the way that I want it to be fit
so after putting this little application
together I decided pretty quickly that
well you know I've got this neat little
framework set up I might as well just
start building out app or scripts to you
know automate some of the hacker related
applications that you might use against
it that's what it's all about script
this stuff you know it's like yes we can
do this but let's make it easy let's
make it okay that you know if you've got
a few seconds you can get the job done
yeah and it really is all just a shell
script it's there's nothing fancy about
it that's true underestimate the power
of a shell script yeah it's just SH and
it all it does is it pulls in a few
other shell scripts to automate
everything it's very easy to expand and
write more shell scripts and because a
DB is all command-line and you can
transfer stuff over a DB it's really not
difficult to automate whatsoever give me
example here so here's my phone I use a
lick one of those slides not a slide to
unlock but a swipe unlock screen guy
here so if you've got your attack phone
over here and you plug my phone in we've
got this phone right here so I've
started up PWD it's waiting for device
to connect so it's going to detect the
device there we go so it's detect advice
and you started charging mine thank you
oh yeah no worries so you've got a what
do you want to do today well I want to
check if your route I am NOT route
oh it doesn't know what it is bummer so
because of that you know you're not rude
I can't go in and can't easily steal
your Google account I can't steal all of
your application data because it's uh
it's under slash data / dat and it's all
pretty secured using UNIX file
permissions however taking advantage of
some api's on the android framework I
can simply go ahead and install an
application and then unlock your scope
weird the swipe then go yep so these are
built in at api's into the android
framework that i'm just really taking
advantage of all i did was write a small
roll application apk compiled it forced
installed it not even force installed
because you have a TV enabled I can just
install your application and then run it
and once it runs oh okay so this is just
running on top of my lockscreen if I hit
the home button or something if I if I
press anything I'm going to get the
lockscreen again right so hitting the
home button will actually bring you back
to the lockscreen
but if you go ahead and hit the back
button it'll actually bring you back to
the app that you had open before they
add the lock screen or if you hit the
application program and it'll bring up
all your current applications so since I
have an application on your phone right
now I figured I might as well just take
you know take that into consideration
and actually have some fun with it
so I just have a few applications here
or a few buttons here so the first one
just brings you back to the previous
application but if you go to hit
launcher launcher what actually brings
you back to their default launcher so
you've completely disabled their their
lock screen and now you are at their
launcher and just like you know what
install an application do whatever you
will saw navigation we're talking about
physical access again yeah so so say you
are if you are route you have the super
su or Super User apk installed those
actually require you to grant access to
elevate to route permission so if you
have a lock screen and I'm on here and I
don't get root immediately because it's
trying to prompt me to grant it it's
actually popping up behind the lock
screen so now I can just go in and
disable the lock lock screen hit grant
to root and suddenly I have root on your
device love that and you could use like
some of those other automated tools to
get yourself root like Zerg rush and
exactly other ones you know I also love
this because you've done the swipe
you've unlocked you could do two nexus
is you could potentially just touch
these guys together over NFC pop it up
your play store and and how we install
yeah there if there's a lot you can do
with this and then easy to get rid of
just simply uninstall it and it relax
the screen and so now that application
that you'd push to it and why you gone
yep I nice nice Gethin rid of those
those tracks yeah and since I'm running
an application on your phone it's a lot
easier to do
to go through the Android API than it is
kind of through the command-line in a
lot of instances so basically what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to create
an apk that has every single permission
ever mmm and that sort of stuff includes
getting accounts generating tokens
setting VPNs credentials installing
certificates doing lots of fun stuff
there so since I don't care about
permissions I'm just going to add them
all and start building out attacks
through the API which is fun what I love
about that is now you've got this
application on there that halves all the
permissions maybe it's hitting back to
your command-and-control server and you
can you know when they take it to the
office you're like hey I'm on a new
network let my master know start
pivoting through on the network from the
exactly and it mean it's even better if
you have root to because then you can
just drop it into their root
applications this folder and is running
as a system application so it doesn't
even show up to the user yeah you can
hide it you can do lots of fun stuff and
I actually did create an application an
apk that had every single permission and
I tried uploading it to Google the
Google Play Store they probably have a
red flag like immediately like you know
check if they hit check of their cause
ya know yes and leave this to say didn't
actually get published I tried doing it
was it just a hello world that had every
single permission uh pretty much and
when I hit when I uploaded it it goes
warning when you publish this when a
user goes to install it they're going to
be notified about a hundred and twenty
seven permissions that they're allowing
access yeah so you'd have to like as the
user the use cases you're like scrolling
rolling to get to the accept yet okay so
you know I know a lot of people like
will just be like whatever just install
the app right when there's like three
four five seven 127 yeah they might they
might be scrolling for a bit and think
twice when they get to the part that
says install VPN and write certificates
but but since I'm on the device yeah I
don't really even need to worry about
that course not go ahead and push it
that's brilliant I love that so you have
a whole bunch of other options antara
mean i love the really quick unlock the
screen are you brute-forcing the screen
how are you going about that
so in this instance I'm actually just
using the built-in API functions it's
there is just a in application the
application I wrote is called anti guard
the interface that you see right here is
actually called key guard so I figured
anti guard was a kiss nice little name
for it but in this case I'm just calling
some native functions to disable it
temporarily as long as the process is
running I actually have a pre generated
key for basically a gesture key file on
my device I generated every single
possible gesture possible so you can't
hit like one one one one a bunch of
times you have to do one two three four
and there are certain limited you can't
go like one two and then back to one
exactly been accepted exactly so I had
to figure out how to get rid of those
and all in all there are about three
hundred and ninety thousand possible
gestures on the device which seems like
a lot yeah however it's only three
hundred ninety thousand not very many
bytes each so I actually through each
one of those into a file a three hundred
ninety thousand lot of lines long file
and I generated the hash for every
single one of those so if I didn't
actually want to just disable using my
application I could just pull the key
file which requires route I could pull
the key file and then just look it up on
the the file that I have and I suddenly
know your password the beauty of that is
that now not only have you unlocked it
but you actually know what the past past
why there are certain it parts of the
phone like under security settings to
change certain things you actually have
to provide the password that is so cool
you've got like a rainbow table for all
of that is gestures yes I love that the
pin and the password unfortunately well
fortunately and are salted so you can't
actually oh crack those easily all right
but that's still really ridiculously
cool so if you unlocked my phone you say
push route to it what are some of the
other options you have to do here with
p2p ADB so the first thing I was
thinking about when I started is oh well
if I have root I can just grab all their
application data and all their
application data you've got their
databases and their shared preferences
because I don't want cached files I
don't want libraries I don't want all
the thumbnails of all of my friends
Twitter exactly so because I can do that
if if your route you can grab everything
under data slash data which is where all
the application data is stored okay and
that includes your all your saved
offline Gmail email it's all your
regular email stuff your contacts your
calendar your Angry Birds saved sessions
pretty much everything is under there so
you'll know what to level I can't get
past all so you've owned all of my
contacts and calendar and everything
right true perspective here people and
if you aren't root it'll go into your SD
card because some application data is
stored on your SD card and there have
been a lot of apps that have actually
been knocked for storing sensitive data
on the SD card and an SD card is just
like a /tmp or something it's like an
all-access like this exists every single
application can I have access I love
that yeah how does that change with the
the Nexus in particular or some of those
newer phones because I know that a lot
of them now don't have micro SD card
slots so and yet you'll still see a
slash SD card folder exactly so the
slash SD card there is just for
backwards compatibility the SD card that
you see is actually part of just a
regular data partition and that's that's
that is actually that's the partition
that's wiped when you unlock your
bootloader and that's the person that is
encrypted when you encrypt your your
phone that's nice because be previously
you wouldn't be encrypting your SD card
right we'd want to take your SD card out
plug it into computer load it up with
movies and other stuff so now all of
that is encrypted yeah yeah so there are
some trade-offs like now you can't use
USB mass-storage
and well that's why we have other
protocols so it used to be usb masters
that's how I get my photos my videos my
music on and off of the device how does
that change now what's the protocols so
with at least a Galaxy Nexus actually
4.0 introduced MTP and basically got rid
of USB mass-storage
and what's MTP MTP is media Transfer
Protocol and that's exactly what it
sounds like it's just for transferring
media it's a protocol for transferring
media when you plug in your device your
device turns into
an MTP server you have an MTP client on
your host and your NTP client checks
whether you know what what the server
has in terms of files and what it'll
transfer over so there's actually a hard
set or not a hard set the server defines
what file types can be transferred over
which is why sometimes when you plug in
your phone into a machine you will only
see like mp3s and photos and so this is
also why it makes it work like natively
with like rhythm box or something in
exam 2 you know it's like my Android in
and it's like I'll hear all your albums
exactly but I didn't want that I wanted
my video so you know right but yeah so
there's some trade-offs but that also
means that it is pretty ubiquitous it
works across every platform as long as
that platform supports MTP you're set so
more than just the Android correct okay
so we've got an iOS device over here
what can we do with this
so iOS also uses MTP when you plug it
into into a machine so since it uses MTP
and it IO s is MTP second is actually a
lot faster than androids MTP stack and
because of that you can do neat things
like plug your iOS device directly into
your android device with with the USB
on-the-go table and then suddenly you
have their photos on your device and
that's that's the same one how you do
this there we go how do i how do i OS
know I
I suck at iOS and help me out here there
we go
ah aha aha so so the nice thing about
this is that it's really fast yeah and
see it's actually built directly into
the gallery application on Android you
even have to code anything then even out
the code I think and I'm pretty sure
it's part of the Android API so that
application that I installed earlier the
APK yeah I can just use that you don't
need any permissions or anything no this
is brilliant so you could add this into
the p2p 83 and just have like an option
to just suck down all the photos because
the only we know what photos people keep
on their phones oh yes the only
issue there is that if iPhone or iOS and
Android is the same if it has a lock
screen that has a pattern or password or
whatever it won't allow yeah like this
yeah so that the one that you just
cracked Lee exactly okay so I would say
we show up immediately you have to
unlock the phone to get the MTP data but
the nice thing about that is that once I
have this I just select all import it
and you're just copying all my filters
are popping just like that is over
yeah take usually takes a few seconds
and I've grabbed all your things that is
wicked okay so we've talked about using
it with the OTG our attack footprint how
we can unlock the the swipe screen using
the anti guard and what kind of stuff we
can steal off including the iPhone what
I'm really excited about are the
possibilities when it comes to our
Google authentication so why don't we
set up for for a different demo with
your laptop and then talk about how we
can steal your Google off right off your
Android phone in seconds without needing
to know your password stay tuned we'll
be back in just a minute
