weekend and then after that down to
Sydney to see stab should probably let
him know I'm coming
protip to my YouTube red followers that
loves fly internationally you definitely
need to set up the us BPM collision
because it can be really disappointed in
the hip stay Indonesia - why Open VPN
connections check out all the episodes
on that this trip has just brought me
the coolest aircraft from the longest
haul flight on a Dreamliner
now the new a 350 at when the strange
sound rating 370 which means basically
it can fly for six hours over six hours
when we put only one engine and it was
one of the first to ever be like ecomp
180 plus before ever went into service
so this thing is like a really new
aircraft and I'm very excited and then a
lit entertainment on my first ever stay
for endlessly on the scuttling feeds in
YouTube red roses American VPN and
that's actually my ID card holding my
phone oh it looks weird just think watch
an episode that I'm not on but we're
trying this so I think this will be the
fourth episode yet that I'm not on that
I'm really excited about the attack
before some Shannon and the thumbnails
looks like I'm in it I don't know how
she did that
how about finishing up whole country
okay I just have me to do right she was
just directories maybe c'mon give you
information will rival major attention
Shannon you had me absolutely cracking
up on that episode that intro was
brilliant wonder if anybody knows Tara
and Jasmine are those are the posts and
behind the scenes making the hack shop
happens I love you guys miss you okay
guys turn my phone off now can I get a
grid to toss time life is encrypted
Oh
you
so checkpoint Singapore always make sure
your phone is encrypted and turned off
before going through the customs okay so
this one's a completely new one for me
I'm used to like USB drops I mean I'm
very familiar with you a few drops but
then the card drops seriously it just
found this SIM card playing around I
don't know whose it is should I plug it
into my phone chittering that these
things run Java and have like all sorts
of cool access like part of me just
wants to get a SIM card reader and plug
it into a computer and dump it the other
part of me is just going to return it to
the information desk so that's awesome
time to take care of it but really of
all things to find laying around at sim
card alright so they wanted my like name
and address and phone number and
everything to drop off the sim card is
like the finder of it what does that
makes no sense
so anyway another pro tip is just plain
American ignorance and smile and not and
say no thank you that seems to work
similar to always asking to use the
bathroom no matter where you are on any
sort of social engineering ops just
because people open doors for you to all
sorts of sensitive places
there's a point to this episode by the
way I'm going to find it supposed to do
with this yeah that before well anything
for it was trouble we can get into
when in doubt tenant are also Pro sip
make sure it's not a vapor that went
well many excitements are happening I've
got epic b-roll shooting right now I've
finished all my morning meetings and
most of all that's really dark I'm
downloading the latest version of the
bash planning 1.1 firmware sub sending
it to me right now you know what the
Wi-Fi gods I you know knock on wood are
behaving damn I shouldn't have said that
like literally as soon as I said the
Wi-Fi gods are behaving of course my
fear is that since I'm using netcat to
transfer this that I'm going to get it
check the md5 sum and it's going to be
350 Meg's of useless by the way pro tip
Windows finally has an md5 sum built-in
I should probably use microphone to this
Windows finally has a md5 some sort of
thing built into PowerShell get file
hash and then your file and algorithm
and in this case md5 subset 911 EB ah I
think I got the file awesome got the new
firmware from said can't wait to test it
out another pro tip feel like this
episode is just pro tips especially when
you're thousands of miles from home one
is none which is why that's turtle two
is one oh yeah don't mix them up don't
mix them up so you know that moment when
you spend all that time waiting for
something to download over a Wi-Fi
connection that keeps fluctuating
between 800 kilobits a second and 8
megabits and really fun and then like
right afterwards you notice that on the
desk the entire time was a little
clapping you're like wait isn't that the
internet and you're like oh but if only
I had a USB Ethernet adapter for my
laptop did I leave it in San Francisco
right but in your cute little bag of
tricks you also have a
and hurdle which is a USB Ethernet
adapter hindsight it's like 40 this is
my firmware flashing face this is my to
started blinking green face not blinking
anymore
I'm Way too amused by this LED there we
go
new and improved blinking pattern for
four more flashing like the police are
after you doll the blue and red we see
it whatever they're called hair flip
side it's 3:30 I haven't left the room
yet I've been at it for eight hours the
new firmware works great but there's a
bug and it's not with subs code it's
with my extension now I'm fighting the
bash I'm sure Singapore is beautiful the
hotel room is nice
Oh bash believe me the drink cheers to
bash
actually cures two windows and new lines
so this is a bug that I've run into
numerous times over the years and I
can't believe it got me again but it has
to do with the fact that Windows and
Linux do not create a new line the same
actually they both Street new lines the
same but windows because of its thoughts
legacy also inserts a carriage return
before the new lining those carriage
returns are represented as the hex value
0d while a new line is 0 a linux machine
will interpret all of those 0s is going
to the next line but they'll also say
that 0d and interpret as well you can
see it if you open up the file and buy
it it'll show it is like a carrot admah
and that's just going to break
everything so what I ended up with doing
is just a super simple extension just to
test this to see hey will this payload
be able to use this extension which just
types hello world and it doesn't work
basic simple code should work as such
the LED attack mode no sets the LED sets
the attack mode ahead and then issues
this hello world which should call this
function here hello world which all it
does is you know types with hello world
right as an example if I take a look at
this run extension that have been
working on in bye
I can see that it could be just horrible
carrot MS at the end of every line which
is preventing any of this from running
just frustrating but that's my fault for
using Windows actually no it's something
that I just have to work around because
I'm kind of trying to make the bash
money accessible for Windows Mac Linux
whatever so
you need to work around it you win short
here's to das here's to the carriage
return and here's to direct your easy by
the way OPSEC says I'm double-fisting if
you have a great idea bring it to the
web the way Shannon I do and head over
to domain comm with an awesome domain
discovery service and a quick immediate
checkout process you'll have the perfect
site up and running in no time
my guys over at domain.com our syntax 5
bands which is why hak5 will save you an
extra 20% at domain.com or just send my
tweet and say thanks to scorn heck 500
of these years so when you think domain
names think domain.com
go
and suddenly I'm in Sydney I'm on my way
to see stab which is so exciting I
haven't seen the guy in months in fact
it was about a year ago this time that I
kind of lost him here in Australia so
that's a story for another time point
his I'm so excited to see that and as it
turns out he's fixed my code would you
good he's a good coder awesome being
directed to this place called a JB hi-fi
where I can pick up DJ I also I'm being
directed to this place called JB hi-fi
where I can pick up a gimbal stabilizer
so no more shaky video I shouldn't do
that because it makes it shake more true
yeah well has the stabilization I know
it's pretty bad it's a seven ok this is
Sam you guys know that I love your man
Oh baby
oh I should probably get that stabilizer
button on the bag
I have goodies from the US hmm oh my
tetra is here this isn't this isn't what
you typically get enough pack top pouch
but hopefully it means that my camera is
not going to be no that's not it it's
not going to now that's not it either
dang it okay I have to buy a stabilizer
which means I have to pay 500 Australian
dollars and steps 300 American dollars
ouch this is a spinny do oh the finger
camera on it yeah I mean who attends but
uh he says it also medical yeah yeah
yeah those charges on micro USB and then
Oh try to have a song that's even tongue
here oh that's yeah that's perfect
fab
I feel like there's something between us
is jaywalking I'm not because I just
came back from Singapore and instilled
in me no jaywalking I'm I'm actually
even wondering if I should let you guys
know where we're going because this
place is so amazing in September we're
going to keep it to ourselves we're
going to let them know about the shady
thing they should keep okay it's quite
Shady
it's called Shady Pines and that's all
you need to know if you ever in Sydney
you have to Shady Pines you'll see why
the part where you say something
insightful
oh my trying desperately not to get wet
this is where I lost step last year and
I I see what all the fuss is about
among other reasons okay so we updated
winco's for upgrades on recovery plus it
is a fun one because you don't actually
have to specify the color anymore
you can specify like what you're
actually doing so if your script is
cleaning up things you can do LED
cleanup and if your script is finishing
you do LED finish similar with setup and
attacks yep I go down a bit alright so
so what else is new we've got the LEDs
which I'm happy about
yeah we fixed a whole bunch of stuff
where the storage we cleaned up a lot of
the leftover also massive amount of bug
fixes yeah that's first from where on
the bunny and I'm very excited about
that many many little things book yeah
yeah so we can have that I'd say one of
the most exciting things for me is the
fact that the language is extensible
through obviously names extension yes so
bunny filling out how the folder we have
the funny helpers or but we now folders
I just get automatically source
everything that's in there which means
that you know people by extension the
language the way we have crack right now
yeah so it was a real example right I'm
constantly doing things in the Windows
run line right and that requires like
four lines because you got to you know
pull up the run line you've got to wait
you got to type you get hit enter so now
that's just run and then whatever you
want rumble any OS and I don't know
notepad.exe and it's a little snow path
or a peak or run OS X and some website
and it's going to put that into
spotlight net or unity go ahead unity
and so those can also be updated because
there is our own file so you can send a
pull request to attend a live in I live
in the payload repository so they're
just in a separate folder they're
holding
tensions at just any follow up in there
if somebody wants to do like run KDE or
run haiku or run GLS yep you could bring
back the OS nut smooth this is seven of
natural habitat and that is not plugged
in anymore here we go so that's that's
the exact kind of behind the scenes that
they that they never get to see to this
exact discussion because it's like do we
put read-only storage and cd-rom into
this firmware or do we put into the next
one it small yeah
because this one's like ready to go but
like we can just keep adding features
and adding features until silico now
that's medically minute
it's definitely she's hacking - like how
ha yeah hard about what do you level
they probably want to figure that later
yeah yeah because if it isn't mine
flashing to one point one in the
Platinum or point - yeah I mean what
we've got right now is great tools to
ship it cool and then we can make one
point - even better
with those features and then also all
the feedback in 1.1 so yeah yeah
definitely material thing yeah yeah I
can just be like if you change your vid
your pit that's great because you can
spoof any device but if you could also
change the serial number well then
there's you know less data points to be
used for waitlisting because that's fun
to bite us yes
also it's still sexy doesn't this thing
doesn't work if I don't actually put the
phone on it what do you know why are the
pineapple d'aww mix no why because the
don't booting the operating system I'm
just going to be let's just let's just
ship bigoted busybox reboot now do we
get the blinky links whether you called
it a pineapple you're just so used to
that
oh yeah there's the police pattern how
do you how do you say it in German 25
bullets light so I'm close I was close
yes you pullets i mode run seriously
just come out of letting me get to novel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
