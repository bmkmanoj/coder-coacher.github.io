grep the latest news on PSP homebrew and
much more on this episode of hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by godaddy gamefly Squarespace and
viewers like you hello and welcome the
hak5 my name is darren kitchen i meant
less stock and we are joined by the
infamous gin with 2 n's from canada oh
I'm infamous now air oh and we are now
30 seconds in when we have our first day
um yeah it's pretty common and then if
you don't remember was the one that
invented basically gaming internet
television back in 2005 I wouldn't say
invented but I'd like to think I
contributed something to it shira find
it quite a bit down with the you know
podcaster oh geez I'm saying right
before the ipod head video and all that
fun stuff oh yeah definitely oh yeah so
how's it going up in the great white
north not bad it's actually really
really hot outside it's been 30 degrees
the last little while so I've been
outside hiking getting a tan it's all
good okay yeah nice well it sounds like
it's a great time of year for us to head
up to Toronto I know that it's lily's oh
yeah it's it's a little tight um we've
got yeah we got too much traveling I got
new york we've got the San Francisco
treat uh-huh we've got south or north
carolina north you're on that trip with
harrison anyway we don't do that that
fun trip north get so we're going like
North East style just not far north yeah
we'll get there I'll be there soon yeah
you guys are really racking up the
frequent flyer miles there right we
don't fly we know we drive everywhere
well I road trips yeah that had the hak5
hacker budget oh speaking of hackers um
there's an interesting article actually
Jim lauterback sent me about the mcafee
Purdue co-sponsored like documentary
about what mcafee calls H commerce yeah
which is the business of hacking you are
on our friend Johnny long is in it in no
ways one of the speakers at that thing
yeah I so want to go to this it's just
it's not a speaker oh but it's
it's a watch it as a documentary yeah
yeah I really wanted to be talked about
phone phreaking and all that stuff and
how was called the Pope dude you just
mentioned all the right words Johnny
long phone phreaking yeah hacking Jim
ladder back when were there so i think
it's i think it's just stop h commerce
calm if you wanted to go check out there
really some episodes and stuff like that
sorry i just i found it interesting last
night at like 2am what sorry hey nice
back to the show yeah yeah that's what
we do yeah i'm playing with i'm playing
with monkeys and and gripping packets
and network stuff low later on I know
you're talking about some storage
solutions storage solutions fought we
got a Twitter about building your own
San appliance there's a couple different
ways to do it so we're going to go into
some of that not exactly show you today
but give you some options that you can
then research a little later before you
actually dive in and figure out what's
the best option for you some people are
more hands on some people aren't so this
is something that I can you know like
build tomorrow for like what a grand 2
grand oh yeah nice oh yeah love that
much easy yes and on the much freer side
of the fence it's homebrew for the PSP
red gin oh yeah good old school PSP
stuff gotta love the homebrew stuff
we've you've been you kind of like the
Queen a homebrew back in the days of 1.5
remember you did a lot of stuff on call
for help on g4 tech TV with Leo about
that maybe you could kind of give me a
little idea about you know what's
happened since then the evolution of the
PlayStation Portable and where we are
home brew wise oh man so much has
changed I kind of wish I kept up with
the scene a little bit better but I've
been having a little too much fun with
my ideas to play with my PSP recently
like so I have got the old fat one I
remember the huge little brick that they
used to have that's the PSP 1000 so
since then they've released the PSP 2000
which was the slim one and even now
that's been replaced again by the PSP
3000 okay it improves so much it's got
the better LCD there's less ghosting
going on which is very important
especially in nob pixel games it's got a
microphone new buttons new logos the
whole thing and this is slimmer uh-huh I
don't know if it's that much slimmer but
just looks way better it's actually
pretty sleek and I might try and pick
one up just I can play newer games
because I'm never updating my PSP 1.5
everybody right because they will pry
that firmware from your cold dead hands
right pretty much it's a relic and I'm
gonna keep it that way nice um so what's
happened as far as the hacking scene is
concerned because I know that there was
a little it was her stagnation cuz I
mean I didn't really keep up too much uh
there was a little bit like with the
3000 there were problems getting home
for running because of course there's
new firmwares all the time cuz Sony I
kind of understand their position here
they do have to fight the homebrew
hackers because otherwise they're gonna
you know lose a few developers that they
have left because piracy will just be
rampant right that's just an unfortunate
truth is that when it comes to when it
comes to the homebrew there's always the
chance for piracy there and that's not
what we advocate here but you know
definitely nice and fun indie stuff give
everybody a chance and ease where it's
at all right so what's the latest and
greatest when it comes to hacking the
PSP now uh well a little while ago there
was a new tip exploit release so they
showed you the proof of concept you can
find that on youtube if you search by
point oh three tiff exploit you know you
can add in hello world there if you want
to see the actual overflow taking place
and this is going to be the back door
for the new for the new homeroom enabler
on PSP 3000 ok and this lets you do all
kinds of cool stuff so we mentioned two
things here the the enabler the tif
exploit can I draw some analogies since
we've been talking about a lot of wii
homebrew lately would the tap exploit be
akin to say your twilight hack where the
homebrew enabler or the hen more like
the homebrew channel if you will uh yeah
that's perfectly app like even when
you're running a tip exploit it's
basically it's a file that you copied to
the root of your memory stick and then
once you're in the PSP you go to photos
and you have to have about seven or
eight photos in there and you have to
scroll down while the thumbnails load
and once you get to the tip exploit at
the bottom it will boot right into into
hello world or later on on the
twenty-fifth when the the new hen is
released you'll be able to go and change
your firmware and then return to all the
ooh goodness got it so you know just
it's your standard fare a little bit of
an overflow that causes code execution
and then you're in know how does that
differ from how it was with 1.5 uh 1.5
things were pretty idiot-proof you copy
something you run it you go away for a
few minutes make a sandwich come back
and then I start loading stuff onto your
memory stick you lost me at sandwiches
but sounds funny oh so the homely in a
blur the check hand what's when can we
expect that and what is that all going
to do well teen Thai food announced they
to push back the release date of the new
home brew enabler and they're expecting
it on the 25th so that's a day to check
it out and and start playing with your
PSP 3000 again nice all right so does
this mean that when this is out and we
can actually test it and see gorgeous
screenshots of it and whatnot do and
come back and show us all the goodies Oh
totally can't wait nice little thanks
for that Jen I really appreciate you
coming on looks oddly you want to stick
around for the rest of show we're just
gonna get in some little hacking and
networking oh I love to awesome all
right but before we get any further I
know that we've got a bunch of fun stuff
when it comes to the the network
prepping and the storage solution stuff
but Matt does want to mention that we
are playing some video games this month
it's on land game yeah that's right
we're going to be playing goldeneye
source which is a game the developers
who are fans of the show have been very
vocal keeping us updated and stuff like
that we're gonna be playing in a May
thirtieth which is of course a Saturday

I'm going to be showing you guys a
little bit about gripping your network
traffic but first we can take a little
break here
lately we've been talking a lot about
filtering and sniffing and looking at
packet captures or live data across the
wire basically what do we have Rob down
mobic says you know or 80 we've talking
about network minor and netwitness tcp
extract I have another fun tool that
kind of goes in the same category I want
to talk to you about today and it's
called n grep or network graph and if
you're familiar with grep for unix linux
you're going to be very familiar with
this tool already so i have kind of a
little demo situation set up for you
already as you can see here i am sitting
in ubuntu and i've got my happy little
network monkey getting his groove on and
my gorgeous assistant mat here and we're
going to be doing some some fun stuff
with packets Thank You vana so let's
just go ahead and get right into it what
is this tool well it is grep for network
traffic and what that allows us to do is
input either live data from an interface
in this case our interface will be tap 0
because we are tapping into the monkey
using an openvpn session and we can also
use this to grep packet capture pcap
files which is which is really cool
because not only it so we can input that
things and and we can either output it
to standard output or we can output to a
packet capture file which gives us a lot
of flexibility for example you know
since we have standard output we can
take this and put it right into you know
pipe it right into another application
so if we're trying to build something
custom here we're lurking looking for a
certain thing within a packet capture we
can use this right on the command line
to take info in and pass it to whatever
program we're building and whatnot or we
can take a giant packet capture and say
okay we've got like 90,000 packets that
we got you know the good stuff at the
fun plays with the happiness and now we
want to break it down to something a
little bit more manageable maybe we have
you know maybe we're doing a little
spear fishing maybe we have some target
right in mind and we just looking for
this noob aardwolf so we could do that
so as you know grep is something that's
just going to sort through a file and
find just what you specify and we can
specify with
regular expressions and strings and all
sorts of fun stuff so let's just go
ahead and get some examples on I think
you guys are really going to rock how
grep works so I'm here in ubuntu and
first thing we want to do is fire up and
grep with tac h and you can see all
those gorgeous options there you know
and the the ones that we're going to be
focusing on right now is we're going to
do a little tack d and set our interface
and that's tap 0 for our monkey and as
you can see oh yeah we got a little
monkey action going on there that tab
happy fun stuff there and I'm just going
to say let's also oops hang on i also
want to put an attack q4 quiet mode kind
of a nitpick thing but if you don't it's
just going to give you a hash or pound
for a lot of packets and we're just
going to clean some stuff up and use the
TAC q option there anyway so we've got
our end graphtec cute abdi are tapped 0
interface specified and let's specify
that word aardwolf because you know we
got a were either live on the land or
wither pineapple at the coffee shop and
we know aardwolf this douche is totally
in brown the corner and we're going to
own him right so we got aardwolf and
let's put in quotes here tcp port 80
just to specify that we're looking for
web traffic here and I go ahead and fire
that up oh one other important thing is
that you need to do this with sudo so
sudo bang bang bang bang them dead all
right so we've got our filter set for
TCP 80 and our match is aardwolf now if
my gorgeous assistant over here goes
ahead and tries to log into the hak5
forums using the aardwolf account there
we go we have all of this gorgeous data
here that we want to grep through and
you know we weren't inundated with a ton
of packets when he loaded up you know
the header at the top of the screen and
all about HTTP crap we just got the
packet with the good stuff and we could
either output this to another pcap for
later processing or to another program
you know pipe it to some fun stuff and
you can see clearly that right down here
the username is aardwolf and the
password is what it is so there you go
now I have another example here where
we're going to use a little regular
expressions and let's go ahead and end
grep again and with tak WI we're going
to be looking forward regular
expressions and the I the lower case I
is for case insensitive I know I'm so
insensitive and we're going to use tack
d for the tab 0 again and in quotes
let's put user pipe pass so we want
either those right and for this one port
21 you can guess where we're going with
this again sudo ok I'm going to get used
to just I just need to run as root no I
don't anyway so here we are again
filtering for this you can see what our
match is and if my gorgeous assistant
tries to log in you can see I didn't use
the Q option there so I got a bunch of a
bunch of pounds here but yeah as soon as
he tries log into that ftp action types
in the username and the password there
we go and we can see that to our noob
here actually put noob in the password
field instead of the username field but
you know that's okay I did it for both
you did it for both ok the username is
noob the password is lame password you
suck I'd well I told you in
pre-production you said it's the same oh
I was saying it was the same as before
when the other one before we changed it
regardless a little bit of fun there
that that's that's what we call live to
tape regardless you can see here as Matt
tries to login we get in some more
packets and user noob and password lame
sauce it's actually not letting them in
there because it's lame password but
that's because Matt didn't watch season
one of hak5 so he's not down with that
is our default new password regardless I
think you guys are getting the idea of
the power of net grep it's it just like
grep for unix we can take our peak apps
or our live interfaces in and this is
perfect for something like a monkey or a
pineapple or just any kind of man in the
middle just break it down so that you're
only looking at the good stuff data and
I love the idea that we can just pipe it
over to another application tcp extract
whatever you can build on this so for
more information about about a neck wrap
go ahead and download it over at n grep
sourceforge net and find full write-up
in my show notes at hak5 dot org now a
little later on our lovely assistant
here will be speaking about building
giant expensive very happy hard drive
dealies I'm expensive no no sans storage
area networks and why you should
actually consider I scuzzy over fibre
channel mmm stick around for that but
first we do have the details on this
week's trivia it's not even a trivia
it's a contest we are doing map your own
network we've had a lot of excellent
submissions as you can see here you guys
are really getting into this and there's
a couple days left that you can go ahead
and submit your network and be eligible
to win a whole bunch of awesome hak5
goodies from our newly opened hack shop
I also want to make mention of our very
own viewer raku Dave's awesome tool it
is Java it's cross-platform it's called
Jay net map and you can use it to map
your own network now this isn't exactly
what i would call like enterprise-grade
but if you just want to put together a
cool map of your network and see like
what nodes are active you've got you
know your red lines new green lines for
what's up and stuff you can even I think
this contest in fact inspired him to put
an export into jpeg option in there so
anyway you might want to check that out
it's a cool alternative to your glue
fees and your videos and stuff like that
i know of course we support it because
it's for more beautiful viewers like you
guys so you can get all the details
about this contest over at hak5 org
slash your land and we also want to
thank one of our amazing sponsors Go

guru.com I think at this point I'm gonna
go ahead and kick it over to my gorgeous
co-host Matt and find out a whole bunch
of fun stuff about sands um yeah sands
what do we call a Sam Sann is a storage
area network right so how does that
differ from an ass well I'm gonna play
idiot here but I'm actually like okay
well an ass is basically just a dumb
file drop okay it's just SMB shares NFS
what a drobo be like is that an ass um a
dribble with the network add-on kind of
sorta um it's just a big bunch of hard
drives on a network basic Nass is just
going to be SMB share some disks okay
you know when we talk about storage area
networks we're talking about terabytes
of data okay so what I mean is it just
the amount of data that differentiates
or is their different architectural II
know I mean makes a difference between
San and that's you know an ass is going
to consist of what four drives you know
your home system that you're going to
buy from newegg for maybe six drives
something like that you know in an ass
or in ass and you're talking 8 12 16 32
storage area network really is its own
network it's it's own fabric outside of
your so this doesn't run on the same
like the same switches the same lands as
you would run again if you're extremely
you know the monetarily tied down to you
know what you've currently got but it's
recommended always do to bottlenecks
with gigabit ethernet and you know so on
and so forth that you always separate
the fabric you've got your storage
fabric and you've got your networking
fabric what we're gonna actually talk
about today is the ability for you to
create your own storage area network
there's no reason that you guys need to
spend fifty thousand dollars sixty
thousand dollars on a equal logic or a
left-hand networks unit unless you
actually need the features that they
provide however that being said if
you're running two three four five hosts
in vmware or a zen infrastructure it's
possible for you to get away with your
own custom modeled storage area network
there's a couple products that we're
actually going to highlight today that
are going to accomplish it now everybody
has different storage needs and so it's
recommended that you either go to the
Zen or the VMware capacity planner and
see exactly what you're going to need
but think about it this way Darren you
run Active Directory at the office yeah
of course how much is your Active
Directory server taking up as far as
hard drive space goes nothing 20 gigs
yeah seriously so it's actually pathetic
that is running on its own physical box
but that's about to change ages I just
finally you know what they actually
gives someone some money oh my god and
what am i doing I'm virtualizing there
you go see ya so this is so that I start
getting into the sand territory when I
start talking about more than just like
four or five VMs on a beefy machine I
start talking about like crazy stuff
like I've gotten a giant rack I mean it
all depends if you're gonna be doing hi
database I oh and you're going to need a
whole lot of I ops then you know yeah I
10 Gigabit Ethernet with you know 15,000
RPM drives in a raid 50 is going to do a
cake okay and you're going to show us
how it can make that like homebrew like
without going to like the big boys and
just find a solution off the shelf
exactly okay so the first we're gonna
start out with some home solutions and
those are being you know pre-configured
don't have to worry about it just go out
you buy it and it's got an I scuzzy
target now we're talking I scuzzy
because I discusses a whole lot cheaper
than fibre channel you don't have to buy
new switches you don't have to buy new
interface cards you'll have to set up
you know blah blah blah all the
that goes around with fibre channel I
scuzzy IP interface much easier to
implement and then separate as you need
so qnap is the manufacturer I recommend
for pre-built solutions that have I
scuzzy targets built into them these are
enterprise glatt class devices the
storage build you know the build quality
onam is great the storage management
software is great and you can hook it up
with a nice cozy target directly into
vmware or Zen in it just works so that's
the beauty of going with us with a stand
and having the ice guzzi is you just
hook it right into your VMware whatever
your structure is and bam right you got
a storage exactly how come how does how
much is this going to hurt here you know
well for let's say you
wanted to rack up a unit full with you
know eight drives or so so we're going
to go check out the 809 you are p if
this will ever load here so it's got
eight drives and it's got its own
customized main board and software and
all that other stuff so everything's
done for you you just got to set it up
as far as the webinar is inserting this
is going to run you just for the case
about two grand okay okay so it's not
bad when you consider the fact that you
can load it up with two terabyte drive
cheap yeah I mean you're gonna pay what
250 bucks for a two terabyte drive
nowadays and you've got eight to 16
terabytes in a server or in a San so so
for like four thousand dollars i could
have like it did say 16 terabytes yeah
yeah go I mean that's going to be a
thumb drive soon enough exactly so what
we're going to do now is instead of
going with pre-configure we're gonna
actually use some software to configure
our own now there's been a great debate
online about freenas and open file or
freenas or open father what are you
going to choose both we've used both
however we switch to open filer because
freenas appeared like it was dead okay
there were no updates there was no new
features plan all of a sudden it's boom
boom boom with the releases and the last
one was at least April twentieth
openfiler on the other hand was released
last year now they do do updates and
stuff like that but freenas is actively
trying to compete in the market of
openfiler openfiler as commercial
support freenas community freenas just
recently exhibitions ever seen a couple
versions ago introduced I skazhi now I
scuzzy is the big component you can use
NFS but we want to use I skazhi because
NFS is a pain in the ass to set up some
say NFS is higher performing some say I
scuzzy has better reliability blah blah
blah whatever reckon test if we can hook
it right into vm infrastructure though
exactly like that so freenas org or
openfiler com openfiler documentation is
a little bit harder to find because they
lock it up with payment button anyway so
the other thing that you could do is we
can build our own I love roll my own and
I know if I had you know the amount of
money that you
oh I needed to mmm I see what you're
doing oh yeah yeah little like go ahead
a little technical I yeah boy so what
we're actually looking at here is an
Intel barebone storage enclosure so it's
just the chassis but this is just the
chassis the motherboard and has support
for xeon processor so it's a bring your
own processor it's a bring your own
processor bring your own ram but the
nice thing about these is it can use SAS
or SATA drives okay you just plug them
in their hot swappable the raid card
supports whatever you want you throw the
raid card in there blah blah blah 3com
or three wire is I think I said that
right three wire three where I don't
remember well it's one of those two they
make really really really good network
raid cards okay screw your adaptec screw
your High Point screw your promise three
really have no love for the root 3 where
I think is the company damn it if I can
remember is the one you want to go with
they support J bod all the way up to
raid 60 and stuff like that lsi is
another good one if you can actually
find our control raid 1 plus 5 in a raid
50 configures now raid 6 with remember
how I explain feeling like 50 but with
like weed parent I see ya yeah it's sick
but so this is so what you're going to
need to do is you're going to need to
get one of these but we're also gonna
need to install the operating system or
whatever solution that we're going to
use that we grab for this grab this in a
Zeon and
an operating system we're going to buy
one of these rays because we could just
run like openfiler or like you're saying
freenas on one of these or you can run a
more specialized piece of software life
and melody which is just software bring
your own appliance we give you the
software we give you all this kind of
great technology I scuzzy snapshots
replication so on and so forth that's
how yeah you push it off site and you
don't have to worry about this a little
commercial doesn't it it's commercial
but this allows you to roll your own
hardware package which you're not locked
into you know 12 drives or 16 drives you
can expand exponentially these that they
have packages up to 32 terabytes for you
know and then they have centralized
management and so on and so forth and it
gets plugins for VMware so we want to
later on we could take that same Intel
chassis dealy and just keep adding more
to our rack exactly and since it's just
you know twisted pair we don't need to
worry about any expensive infrastructure
over and writer so this would plug into
our ide controller we install our
operating system this is this the the
replacement to the proverbial bootable
USB Drive Bing yes it is so what it so
for those that aren't down with the
specs what is this guy it's a 4 gigabyte
flash solid-state plugs right into the
IDE port and he just looks like another
hard drive to the system gorgeous you
don't have to worry about it you don't
have to worry about jerry-rigging some
hard drive elsewhere in the system it's
it's it's really a really nice piece of
hardware they range the sizes from 512
all the way up to 32 gigs so depending
on what you actually meet you yeah for
some of that open stores stuff you mean
you only need like 200 megs if that
exactly now I just got an email that
VMware vSphere for was just released and
available to the public I'm going to be
playing with that and showing you some
of the differences between networking
your current physical infrastructure to
your networking infrastructure future in
the next couple episodes we'll go over
that and then we'll actually start
building I've got a great website as to
how you can build your own white box for
esxi the free version because there's
only certain brake controllers and
hardware and stuff like that's that's
supported we're actually going to build
one out show you how to build a sand
and virtual infrastructure of it sorrys
your stuff Matt thank you so much for
laying down the info as far as sands are
concerned I hope you guys really enjoy
that of course if you have other
questions about your infrastructure or
your other IT needs matt is the man when
it comes to architecting these systems I
feel like I've kind of fallen into that
you know that there's two types of
administrators either you get your
architects and your maintenance right
