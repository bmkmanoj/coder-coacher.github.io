Android apps on your PC and monitoring
your computer remotely with Dropbox I'm
Shannon Morse
you're watching PAC 5 this episode of
hack 5 is brought to you by goto meeting
Squarespace in domain.com got a great
idea it all starts with a great domain
domain comm hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is Darren kitchen and this is your
weekly dose of Technol us and by now
it's quite obvious that this week's dose
is kind of late so my apologies for that
you guys have been following hack 5 for
awhile you know that it's an ever
evolving project that's been going on
for the last five years just following
the lives of anybody crazy enough to get
involved and over the last five years
has been one hell of a ride so if you
haven't tuned in for a while or if
you're new to the show or something I
figured I would just kind of wrap up
what's going on this season in a
nutshell essentially Shannon moved back
to Missouri to take care of her dad take
on the hack shop be with her family and
she'll be out here soon enough but she's
continuing to contribute with her weekly
snubs report segments and well then I
put the house on the market so if you're
looking for a slightly used hack house
you know email me that'd be cool and
Paul's still back east taking care of
the house and I'm sure that we'll see
him soon enough and that's when I hopped
on a motorcycle as I am right now and
rode across the country in what I dubbed
hack Across America meeting up with some
awesome fans and family and friends
along the way and we have been so
thankful to have contributors like mu
bik's and Jason Applebaum Jen cutter
even a tea from dual core along the way
so very thankful for that and I guess
for the last six weeks or so I've been
here kicking it in the East Bay and
since this show really does just follow
our lives I figured I'd go ahead and
check in again and I'll let you guys
know what's up so I've been super busy
with the launch of hack 5 she's an 8 we
also have a huge party that we're
throwing here in the San Francisco Bay
Area on August 15th so if you can be a
part of that that's going to be awesome
picked up kind of a part
gig / revision3 doing some IT stuff and
I've also been contributing on some
mother the favorite podcasts over at C
net and twit so if you're into like buzz
out loud or tech news today well you can
find me on tech news today on Monday so
twit dot TV slash stands for that but
that said you're probably wondering
where all the techie stuff is and well I
had this ridiculously awesome android
hacking segment planned I seem to have
bit off a little bit more than I could
chew and that's why this is late if you
do want to see some droid hacking I did
it live on CNET's Android Atlas last
week so I'll have links for that and but
you know long story short I'm gonna have
to push it back to next week and let's
just say that the Droid is one of my new
favorite packet sniffers but we do have
an awesome show for you guys this week
I'm joined by hack 5 IRC zone archiver
and you know he's from Dublin Ireland
great guy great to have him on you know
on camera and I think it's it's awesome
that we get some more community and even
international representation on act 5
Hey so there's that going on Plus
Shannon has a really sweet hack for
remote access using Dropbox of all
things one of our favorite tools so I
know that you guys gonna love that also
next week or I guess this week if you're
in LA for the SIGGRAPH conference hit me
up on Twitter or something I'm gonna be
there checking out all the latest
computer graphics stuff and then the
next week in Las Vegas for Def Con got
some really really cool rubber ducky
stuff to show you guys so anyway on with
the show let's go ahead and kick it over
proper to Shannon for some trivia and
I'll see you guys next week this week's
trivia is the rejected original Star
Trek pilot the cage featured Jeffrey
hunter as who enter for your chance to
win over a hack $5 org slash trivia to
get some killer new hack 5 stickers
we'll be right back after a brief word
from one of our sponsors
are you registering domain names in the
shell again don't forget we cluster
means you have duck zero it sugar that's
right dot Co domains are now live though
the biggest domain sense calm and you
can get them now over at domain.com and
while you're there check out their
Virtual Private servers they provide
unrestricted root access on Windows or
Linux they're easy to manage with cPanel
and Plesk
and they're capable of hosting just
about any size website you may have even
heard our very own hack 5 org is pimped
out on a domain comm VPS no matter where
you are your next idea remember
domain.com is the place to save 15% off
a check out with coupon code hak5 got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com
Rob it is so good to have you thanks for
coming on not a problem there it's nice
to be here nice actually be on the show
rather than behind the camera fools
yeah no no kidding and for those that
aren't familiar archiver as you're known
on IRC coming to us from Dublin right
yep sitting here in Dublin it's yeah
it's 2 p.m. here but with you know
GoToMeeting we can get together and
collaborate and this is great so let's
get to we've got some awesome stuff
going on in the Android world and I kind
of figured with the the angle of the
show this week let's go ahead and kick
it talk about some of the latest Android
stuff maybe do a little software demo
you down yeah so it's gotten a lot
easier to unlock phones recently
especially if you're on HTC have you
seen revoked or Unruh vocht that is oh
yes I have definitely seen this myself
as you can see there's quite a few
phones there
err I had the hero the Evo 4G go 4G
networks gotta love that the area and
the desire it's the incredible that the
desire is the one that I'm interested in
more than anything else because that's
my phone I have one right here
I might have to spend about half an hour
rooting mine the old-fashioned way
making go right hard changing the hex
code on it etc etc and here right here I
have a week after it first Reuters you
can do it a click is it really just a
click how do you do this do you just go
to this website on your phone and is it
like the the old iPhone unlocking with a
TIF file or what well no what do you do
is you download the file for Windows for
Linux or for micro West's great do you
guys all revoke they have it for all
three you connect the phone to your
computer with its cable now it's Windows
you might need to install a driver
that's the only thing Linux or Mac OS
you just plug and run the file for
Windows it's an executable it'll go and
shove your phone into recovery mode
flash a custom image that you've already
downloaded from
like XDA both you've got Rouge that's it
painless simple no gold cards no
wondering do I have the right route file
no it's just taken care of so Rob aside
from the open source principle of just
having root on your device what would
you say are your favorite apps and come
on that's really what it comes down to
that need root for me it's gotta be
wrong manager ROM manager like once
you've rooted your device which I think
some revoked is easy rom manager is a
must install it's available for almost
every Android device in the market and
what it does is it lets you go on from
within to the program go online grab a
custom ROM download to your phone and
installed and even backs up your
previous apps your previous ROM so if
something goes wrong you can always
reload so have you been using this to
try out some of the different mods like
cyanogen tor bug less beast this island
doesn't have one yet for my phone there
own it's still in the alpha stage i want
to get my hands on it because well c'mon
silence the man when it comes to Mali
for Android you just gotta get one of
his roms I've been walking around with
some of the other ones including the one
called open desire guy called Adam G
built from source from the Android SDK
specifically refer the phone it's lean
and unlock stuff that the phone doesn't
cover doesn't come with originally it
turns out the wireless and and turns on
the HD camera mode so I've been playing
around with a couple of route apps and
right now the thing that I'm having a
lot of fun with is the obvious you gotta
have it
Wi-Fi tether turns your phone into a
wireless access point for you and five
of other devices and you know it even
runs a little DHCP server and you can do
you know you can change the SSID you can
do MAC address filtering you can set up
encryption if you want but I've just
been leaving it open and I've been
having a lot of fun with that and
another app that I just love called
shark who has an icon very similar to
Wireshark and it's just that it is a
packet sniffer and you can go ahead and
fire up Wi-Fi tether you can get on
maybe your friends can get on and then
you
shark it does the packet capture saves
it to a regular dot pcap file on your SD
card and then maybe later you could pop
that into Wireshark and do some actual
analysis and see if there was anything
interesting there that's starting to
make a mark three pineapple perhaps well
it doesn't do the Karma bit of that but
but yeah you know it's kind of fun in a
pinch to play around with for sure a lot
easier wandering around with a phone
doing that then it will be with the
pineapple of the airport right so what
about running Android apps on your PC
I've been hearing a little bit about
this have you played around with the SDK
I have actually have a running over
machine because of you
you know experimenting a bit here and
there it's a little trickier than
getting the apps normally as you would
on your phone but it's not that hard
once you know what you're doing
so you've got that on your computer now
yeah yeah I do indeed all right I'm
gonna use the GoToMeeting change
presenter thing here and let's see if we
can take a look as you can see I've got
the Android test set up here named test
roid simple enough thing this is part of
the Android SDK very simple to set up
install it takes about five minutes
start to finish together to this point
cuz it just needs to do a lot of stuff
in the background but once it is it's
just like having the standard Android
phone it could pad - laughs into the
write as you normally would
this particular one is Android 2.2 also
known as Froyo or frozen yogurt it's got
all the settings so you can see even
gives it a bit of a you know I'm running
Android 2.2 my kernel my build the whole
lot and of course if you have any apps
they'll appear here on your home screen
this is the basic set up this is just
being set off but putting an app on it
is simple enough what you do is you
download your apk file now you can get
them or from a few places online just
Google download apk files and you'll
find a lot of them you will want to set
up you drop your Android here to let it
you use other applications on site
occasions like you just go into
application settings and make sure
you've unknown sources taked here
otherwise you won't be able to do this
what you did you download your apk file
stick it wherever you want it doesn't
make a difference
me I've stuck it in the root folder
amusement for this to install it then
open up your good old command prompt go
to your tools folder and run the ad be
done exe install I'm pointed towards
your apk file I've got WordPress here
because we all like our WordPress blogs
press Enter give it a mount or two it'll
stumble through it eventually and when
it's done it'll say success go back in
to your Android annulation there you
have it
WordPress and yes you can settle up and
you can go online from within the SDK
settled so you can actually test it
fully before you ever ever put it near
your Android phone that sounds like a
great way not only for software
developers to test out applications that
they're writing but anybody that's even
just remotely interested in Android to
just go ahead and play around with it
before they're willing to actually
commit the you know hundreds of dollars
it's going to be to you know buy a
device that's true I mean I would hardly
recommend anyone who likes Android or is
just thinking maybe get the SDK it's
it's not a case of oh this is only for
someone who's really technical i 5e for
my wife messin with this she uses Linux
bullet she wouldn't dig around under the
kernel all too much but she needs Jesus
finding no issue with it well thank you
so much Rob for joining us today this
has been so much fun and I'm looking
forward to you know seeing you again in
in Dublin next time I find my way across
the pond it's great to be on nice John
to you Jana

already side the bomb to soon as well
right until then we can always you know
go on by IRC to hak5 Oregon say hey to

there are plenty of times when I like to
leave my computer on and I go run some
errands and there are also plenty of
times when I like to go run those
errands and be productive and come home
and have an evil progress bar completely
finished but what if I want to monitor
that while I'm running my errands
there's this thing called the remote
desktop monitoring with Dropbox you guys
know Dropbox it's the program that had
five uses to share all of our video
clips and all of our screen captures and
it can also monitor computers so this
would be really handy if you need to
check up on the status of your computer
check what your kids are up to on your
home computer or even make sure that
nobody's on your work computer while
you're at home sleeping so this is how
it works first of all if you haven't
signed up for Dropbox go over to Dropbox
comm and sign up it's free so no worries
next download screen grabber for Dropbox
here over at forums Dropbox comm screen
Giger is going to capture screenshots
directly into your Dropbox folder and
also if you have Snagit you can use that
instead unzip the files and run the dot
exe once it's running you can find it in
your taskbar so right click on the
little icon and open it the settings
disable toast to run quiet screen
captures this way your computer will
show any notifications change the image
format to JPEG for small files so you're
not taking up a whole lot of space and
then choose your folder and leave all
the options the same okay next thing you
want to do is use this autohotkey for
regular intervals it goes loop send
shift e on f10 shift up and then sleep
for 300,000 milliseconds or something
like that it's like five minutes I think
and then this script is going to run in
the background and it'll hold down those
keys for you add a set amount of time
or if you've never used hotkey you can
also download this compiled version over
at image ravenel org either of these
will press Shift + f10 which is the
default key combo and screen grabber for
every 5 minutes
and then you run this on your PC or
laptop that you want to monitor and
you'll get a whole bunch of JPEG files
and your Dropbox folder like here for
you to keep tabs on so there are a
couple of things that I noticed when I
checked out this application first of
all if you have more than one monitor
it's only going to set to screen capture
your primary monitor it won't do
anything on the second everyone also
don't forget to turn off your script
when you get back home or you might end
up filling up your Dropbox folder with a
whole bunch of images and well you don't
really want that to happen but all in
all I think it's a pretty cool program I
like being able to check out the script
that goes along with it and it gives me
some experience with that kind of thing
email me back at feedback at hack 5 org
let me know what you guys think and
we'll be right back after a brief word
