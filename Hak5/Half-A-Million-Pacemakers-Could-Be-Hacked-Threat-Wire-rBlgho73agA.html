million Instagram accounts had their
data leaked over 700 million email
addresses were exposed by a spam bot and
almost half a million pacemakers could
be hacked all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for
September 5th 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom if you haven't checked
out a patreon yet please do so we have
lots that we want to do for this show
but we can't do it without your support
patreon.com slash threat wire is the
place to support the show and the link
is in the show notes now on to the first
story a few days ago hack 5 was tagged
in this Twitter post saying the FCC has
released a statement regarding Ajith PI
and net neutrality with a link to a PDF
document on the FCC gov website luckily
the user included a screen capture on
Twitter so clicking on the link out of
curiosity was not necessary and also not
suggested for anybody out there the PDF
was hosted on the FCC's public
commenting database API which is called
the electronic comment filing system API
which allows the public to upload any
files alongside their comments but that
is not all apparently the dot-gov site
could send anyone an API key as long as
you have a legit email address to
receive it at you can then upload PDFs
gifs exe files mp4 Zug - 25 megabytes in
size that includes malware that could be
used in a phishing campaign as purported
by the medium post on this topic the FCC
has since removed most if not all of the
publicly uploaded files but a demo API
still works as of recording date
according to the original files owner
the filing database creates a link for
any files uploaded before you officially
post a comment in that it requires you
to use the robust filing system instead
of the express option he was able to get
the upload link through the comment
system so he never had to apply for an
API key by email which awesome means he
never had to check Atos keep this in
mind the next time you see a legitimate
looking letterhead on a gov website and
always try to reach out to the source
for clarity on the
last week Instagram was the target of a
large data breach containing users phone
numbers and email addresses originally
the hack appeared to be just a verified
accounts of celebrities but after two
days of a very slow lead it was reported
to be six million total accounts hit
which include verified and non verified
as well verified accounts on Instagram
are those that have a little blue
checkmark next to their name usually
they belong to politicians celebrities
and other people who may be forced to
deal with fake accounts made in their
name this can be super useful for
normies like me and you to verify that
you are actually following the Nathan
Fillion that you think that you are
following yeh Browncoats
it turns out Instagram had an API flaw
that allowed for the leak of data via
the password reset option in a JSON
response a criminal could see the user's
mobile number in email address Instagram
has since fixed the bug and has
contacted verified users but not non
verified users the six million accounts
with data leaked was put up for sale on
a site called Doc's a gram for ten
dollars per account search but the
domain is continually being removed by
registrar's the leak was verified by Ars
Technica and roy hunt when ten thousand
listings were sent to the publication
and were verifiable now while Instagram
has over 700 million users a six million
user leak should not be taken lightly
the scary part is that with a phone
number in hand a criminal could try to
social engineer a mobile carrier into
releasing that phone number to a new SIM
card thereby receiving any two-factor
authentication codes
now while Instagram suggests using 2fa
codes on your account and this is better
than having nothing they only offer
codes sent via SMS not set up in an app
now since social engineering carriers is
becoming a common occurence I think now
is the time for Instagram to set up to
FAA via an application instead to kind
of ward off criminals I think that would
be a good idea on August 29th the FDA
posted a Safety Advisory on their site
titled firmware update to address cyber
security vulnerabilities identified in
Abbott's formerly st. Jude Medical
implantable cardiac pacemakers
specifically this morning is for
patients who had a radiofrequency in
old pacemaker caregivers for folks who
have these pacemakers in doctor surgeons
and physicians who have used these
pacemakers as treatments devices include
the accent anthem accent MRI accent ST
assurity and Ellora pacemakers
manufactured before August 28th 2017 in
total half a million pacemakers in the
United States are vulnerable to being
hacked allowing a criminal to reprogram
them on-the-fly modifying a heartbeat or
drain the battery down very easily
luckily none of these pacemakers require
new installation they just need a
firmware update which can be done over
the air with a health professional after
the firmware update is completed an
external device would require
authorization before being able to
connect with it and data will also be
encrypted this vulnerability has not
been used in the wild yet but it was
recently included in a study in June by
security researchers at white scope who
analyzed them and found that you could
intercept RF signals with as little as
$15 in electronics allowing a criminal
to read private information stored on
the pacemaker along with threatening a
patient's life using any of the
previously mentioned attacks it was also
included in some investment drama which
happened way last year which made st.
Jude stock fall to which st. Jude
replied that security vulnerabilities
and pacemakers was false and misleading
many health industry professionals
downplay the need for security on
devices such as these even though this
is not the first occurrence insulin
pumps for example were found to be
vulnerable to hacks way back in 2011 and
other medical devices could become
targets of hacks in the coming years
the reality is any connected device
could be susceptible to a hack and with
IOT botnets running rampant it's
something that should be taken seriously
I also want to mention thank you so much
to Jo for sending in this story and if
you are a patreon you can send stories
your favorite ones over to me in the
community tab on patreon.com slash
threat wire thank you to Michael for
sending in this story over on our
patreon community tab no one likes spam
well some of us might like to go to the
grocery store and buy spam to eat or
whatever you do with spam that you buy
at the grocery store but
most of us I'm gonna say don't like
Digital spam and now it's even worse
over 711 million email addresses have
been publicly exposed for who knows how
long from a spam bot server that's been
node to publish tons of spam to users
the server hosting the list of email
addresses was open and accessible hosted
in the Netherlands without any secure
credentials needed to access it so that
means that anyone with the link could
get into it
unfortunately the spam bots also had
listed millions of SMTP credentials
stored on it as well this spam bot which
is called the online err spam bot was
used to serve up spam alongside banking
Trojans to user since 2016 the SMTP
credentials totaling 80 million are used
to then send spam to the remaining 600
million plus email addresses by doing
this the spam bot bypasses any kind of
anti-spam measures that are used on a
mail server so the email ends up in a
user's inbox instead of their spam
folder some email addresses in the list
were also found in data breaches from
LinkedIn from MySpace and from Dropbox
and 2 million were found to be from a
Facebook phishing campaign
Troy Hunt who runs have I been pwned or
have I been owned calm verified the data
and added it to his website and of
course later that day I received an
email from have I been owned calm saying
one of my public email addresses was
found in that breach no surprise there
now since so many email addresses were
included it is advice to change your
password for your email address
turn on two-factor authentication and
ensure that you are not using the same
password on multiple sites
the sad truth as hunt points out in his
blog post is there is not much you can
do if you find yourself in one of these
spam lists while it may explain spam
that you are receiving it is relatively
hard to figure out where someone got
your email address from either way
change your password and if you don't
already use a password manager so you
don't end up using the same password
across multiple sites big thanks again
