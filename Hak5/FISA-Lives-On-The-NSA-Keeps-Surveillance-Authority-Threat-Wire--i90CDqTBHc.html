communications some Google Chrome
extensions were found to be malicious
and oneplus had a credit card hack all
that coming up now on threat wires
greetings I am Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for January 23rd 2018 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom our patreon
is over at patreon.com slash threat wire
and that is always the best way to
support the show and will help us reach
our next goal and now it's time for the
news now the week before last the House
of Representatives of the United States
voted 256 to 164 in favor of
reauthorizing the FISA mass surveillance
program without any reforms or reining
back of powers for the NSA on Thursday
of last week the US Senate passed the
FISA Amendments reauthorization Act in a
65 to 34 vote with 43 Republicans and 21
Democrats in favor allowing section 702
to live on even though it was originally
set to expire on Friday
this bill will continue on to president
Trump's desk where we will most likely
see it signed into law so what is FISA
well let's do a refresher course it is
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act effective in 1978 and since amended
with new acts such as the Patriot Act
and the Freedom Act the Patriot Act of
2001 signed into law many different
provisions allowing for surveillance and
wiretapping without warrants while this
part of the Act expired in 2015 the USA
Freedom Act of 2015
took its place and renewed much of the
surveillance through 2019 the Freedom
Act did remove the NSA's ability to do
mass collection of data via phone
carriers but it did not repeal all of
the provisions the FISA Amendments Act
was born in 2008 and later on included a
provision to be extended until 2017 this
section known as title 7 and section 702
allows for monitoring foreigners abroad
while this section is only for
foreigners reasonably known to not be in
the United States it does have some
loophole
that American citizens have been
concerned about and rightfully so and it
is a big part of why we are hoping the
Senate in house would reform the act
before extending and passing it with
some kind of call to force the agencies
to need search warrants for data being
the biggest plea now to parts of section
702 in particular are important there is
the backdoor search yes it really is
called the backdoor search which allows
for agencies to monitor Americans in
contact with foreigners targeted and
about collection which collects data on
an American that just-so mentions
contact data about a targeted foreigner
section 702 allows for the NSA to
collect data from telecom companies via
their fiber-optic lines where they enter
the United States
now while this should only include
non-citizens that are of concern to the
government this coincidentally also
sweeps up huge supplies of data on
unsuspecting Americans as well there is
no good way for a telecom to divulge
just the data on a suspect while not
including huge treasure troves of data
on citizens as well and according to the
law American citizens are protected from
warrantless surveillance so section 702
is a huge ugly sore with a huge problem
the section also allowed for prism to be
a thing and in 2017 open tech Institute
found that the FBI and the NSA had
clearly violated the surveillance
stipulations at least 200 times over the
past decade now with regards to the vote
several different lawmakers who had
previously called for reforms did not
offer any kind of debate and then voted
for reauthorization with a well rounded
list being available via ZDNet linked
below five different senators did
attempt to filibuster the vote but
unfortunately they failed and this vote
allows for the surveillance to continue
until 2024 four different extensions
found in the Google Chrome Web Store
with more than 500,000 downloads
altogether were found to be malicious by
researchers at Network security vendor
iceberg the extensions include stickies
light bookmarks change HTTP
header and new goal hopefully I said
that right all but new goal were removed
by Google after being notified by the
researchers iceberg originally found one
malicious app on a client's computer as
it was sending an odd amount of network
traffic to an outbound connection the
extensions could use that connection to
inject and execute malicious JavaScript
code on a target computer
now while Chrome extensions do not allow
for code from a JSON format externally
if an extension requests it using the
content security policy and then enables
a permission called unsafe eval which is
like an evaluation permission that code
can then be transmitted from an external
point the researchers suspect that this
is part of a clique fraud scam which
makes money based on the clicks of a
target computer so the extensions were
making the target computer visit add
related websites it could also be used
to spy on the target machine without the
users knowledge obviously now since this
browser owns 60% of the market share and
is used widely in internal business
networks extensions allowing for
external script access they do create a
concern another extension was found to
be malicious last week by Peter R nits
at malwarebytes Arnott's found an
extension called tiempo and Columbia and
VEVO that redirected a user from the
normal Chrome extension list which is
found in your browser menu to a page
that looked like the list of extensions
but actually bypassed a user's ability
to manually remove an extension the app
was removed in 19 days after being
disclosed to Google now while the
extension simply clicked on lots of
different YouTube videos which inflates
viewership numbers it could be used for
more malicious acts since it did try to
keep users from deleting it by
redirecting users from the actual
extension settings menu our nits
recommends using malwarebytes free to
automatically remove it now if users do
use extensions it is always important to
only download extensions that are from
trusted publishers or just not use them
at all
one plus those are the makers of the
Android phones originally dubbed as the
flagship killers they have confirmed
that they experienced a breach of their
payments
systems after several different
customers reported fraudulent activity
on credit cards previously used to
purchase phones from the company on
Friday customers received email saying
that credit card numbers expiration
dates and security codes may have been
compromised the email goes on to say
that an investigation is underway and
the system is currently suspended the
company is also looking into offering
credit monitoring to users who have been
affected now to be clear this is a
breach of the payment systems on one
plus dotnet so if you ordered a one plus
phone through a third party you are not
going to be affected so how did this
happen according to one plus the website
had a malicious script installed that
could capture and send data straight
from a browser from mid-november all the
way through January 11th so that means
up to 40,000 customers were affected if
you use PayPal to purchase one of those
phones you were not affected nor were
users who already had a credit card on
file so the malicious code was sniffing
out credit card information as it was
entered into the site oneplus does
recommend users pay attention to their
credit card statements and report
fraudulent activity to their bank this
is not the first problem with oneplus
and security though last year is
security researcher found and disclosed
a debugging tool that was left on the
phone that could allow root access to
the device another researcher discovered
oneplus was collecting personally
identifiable data on users and a bug
last summer caused phones to reboot when
making an emergency call so needless to
say it has not been one plus year thank
you again to all of the wonderful people
