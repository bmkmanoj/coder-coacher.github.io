keys how to anonymize your anonymous
surveys a million-dollar bug bounty and
radio hacks on a balloon what could go
wrong all that coming up now on threat
why greetings I'm Shannon Morse and this
is the Brett wire for September 23rd
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
there has been a lot of news this week
so let's get right into it so first off
whenever you install a program it's
usually going to ask you if you want to
allow that program to make changes to
your computer you'll get a verified
publisher in the program name and a
fancy little pop-up and that verified
publisher has to sign a
cryptographically secure and key that
proves that they are who they say they
are it's not so secure if you
accidentally share that private crypto
keys so yeah d-link the company who
provides networking equipment did just
that whoops this happened back in
February onda links GPL source code
sharing website where they posted for
sign private keys one of which was still
valid when found up until sep tember
third so just a few weeks ago so since
then it has been updated but if the key
was used to sign any programs as valid
before that expiration date then a
computer would see it as legit even
worse so the key hasn't been revoked yet
either so this means that while a
private legitimate Keys public anyone
who wants to make a keylogger or a
program with a Trojan installed could
potentially use this key to make their
software look like a legit trustworthy
d-link program and as of time of
recording symantec has not revoked the
key yikes you've probably filled out a
survey or two online right if not they
are abundant and many say that they are
anonymous a professor at Cornell Tech
Raphael paths started looking into this
and found that identifying information
exists when people take surveys and felt
that these anonymous surveys are not
actually anonymous pass with the help of
fellow researcher chalat built an ax
nice a cryptographically anonymous
survey site Annan eyes or maybe it's
anona
is is a mobile app that generates a
locally stored secret key and a public
key similar to PG p's usage the app can
sign the submitted answers with the
secret and the public key combo each
survey has its own public key so the
matchup is never duplicated the only way
someone would know your private key is
by breaking into your device since it is
stored locally the app will be open
sourced eventually to allow for auditing
and research Apple has just released iOS
9 and with it came an announcement an
exploit vendor called zoo rhodium is
hosting a month-long bug bounty hunt for
the operating system for anyone who
creates and submits an exploit for iOS 9
20 diem exclusively they'll pay out 1
million dollars three million max over
the course of the month so according to
their statement the missions must quote
include a full chain of unknown
unpublished in unreported
vulnerabilities and exploits and must
lead to and allow a remote privileged
and persistent installment of an
arbitrary app eg cydia or a fully
updated iOS 9 on a fully updated iOS 9
device they also say it has to work on
all newer models of iPhones and iPads
and source code must be included so I
say good luck to anyone trying to do
this bug bounty a group of technologists
aka technologists called critical
engineering have developed a device that
they hope will be able to record radio
frequency data of devices such as
government drones satellites and
high-altitude planes the device and the
project called deep sweep is made out of
an acrylic orb with a bunch of radio
equipment inside tied to a weather
balloon and filled with helium the probe
includes three software-defined radios
three antenna a GoPro camera a GPS
module temperature and pressure sensors
a SIM card and a battery and it works
with an Arduino and some open source
software so once it flies into the air
and hits around 17 to 18 miles high the
balloon burst and the nylon parachute
floats it back all the way to land or
water depending on where it is an SMS is
sent to the group to signal its location
and the data is available for download
and can be viewed on their site the
group hopes that they can pick up
conversations between government
agencies and drones and whole
fully recognized the spy devices
overhead when they are actually there
but the data that they carry is most
likely encrypted which might be an issue
so moving on remember to share your
thoughts on today's topics down in the
comments I am curious what you think of
the deep sweet balloon probe for
starters is this a good idea is that a
bad one and what about zero diem kind of
weird huh and before I go I want to give
a huge thanks to everyone who has
supported the show so far on patreon hey
if you can share a spoof spot the spew a
few cents an episode please consider
becoming a patron over at patreon.com /
threat wire we may even feature you're
adorable fur babies like this adorable
dog who has the best chew toy ever and
that cat who just keeps on showing up I
think he's a spy in the next episode
they're really cute so keep the show in
D keep it ad free it's because of you
guys we do plan to do the show three
times a week as a milestone goal with
rotation of Darren kitchen Patrick
Norton and myself we are on our way
there and we will be creating an RSS
feed for threat wire once we hit our
next goal so keep it come and find out
all the things that threat wire net and
with that I am Shannon Morse and i will
see you technologists on the internet by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
