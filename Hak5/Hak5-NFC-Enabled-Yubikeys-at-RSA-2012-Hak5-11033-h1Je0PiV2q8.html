carbonite Brock 5 i'm darren kitchen
here RSA 2012 talking about one-time
passwords with my favorite integrator it
is stina you baku how are you stina
thank you know what you guys just moved
out to the bay area it's been what like
six months how has that been for you
it's been great always sunny in Palo
Alto and a lot of awesome stuff has been
happening with you because since we last
spoke in the studio what's going on oh
yes the most exciting things is that now
have a Yubikey with integrated NFC
support so you talk about like the near
field communications that you find in
cell phones and in smartphones not
standard cell phone smartphones and some
tablets and during 2012 you'll see the
range of smartphones and tablets
supporting the NFC yes I'm actually kind
of imagining that eventually we're going
to start to see that kind of stuff find
its way into our laptops and then it'll
be really fun when you know both your
laptop and your smartphone have that
what are you demoing today oh I'm
demoing an application where you take
your Yubikey to login into an
application on your smartphone and the
NFC initiatives have now been driven by
the payment providers like Google Wallet
and paper land and they're really
excited but they haven't thought about
the security I'm inputting a payment
your your credit card data on the phone
and the phone is no more secure than a
laptop we want to add that extra factor
of sent occasion to it that is so
awesome in fact that was one of the
things when I first started playing with
you because like this is great except
now when I want to log into that site
like like act 5 for example I actually
need a you the key to login to act 5 org
now and in minutes so great but I can't
do that over my phone because my phone
doesn't have a USB port to plug my
yubikey into how does this work now with
the NFC so this Yubikey with NFC has
both standard capabilities a USB port
for a computer and the NFC that is on
you just literally tap it to the phone
you put it on the phone and the phone
opens a browser and a URL and takes you
to the website and in since the OTP the
one-time passcode and you securely log
in in a single tap it's super easy then
and that happens without any software
installed what's
ever just stock like you're running ice
cream sandwich here on the Nexus and you
didn't have to put any special you bacot
programs on here no it's a client's
clientless literally is because it
opened the browser you can go to the
website it sends out the OTP but the
Yubikey has to be programmed to go to
that website i see i can imagine this
being great for like say an example a
bank that has an online banking app and
they want to make it more secure so they
know oh you lost your you lose your
phone oh no right but your prime not
going to lose your phone and your keys
at the same time your you bikies on your
keychain you put those together and you
have your second factor of on it ten
occation there yeah the big vision we're
seeing is that you have your nfcu baqi
hai to your bank account you download
the amount of money you want to have on
your Yubikey just like a prepaid card I
now want to put twenty dollars on my
nfcu Vicki then I go to these n minus
see payment providers I've seen that
pizza now have these NFC readers which
is a coffee shop in the Bay Area yeah I
mean they're they're coming more and
more these NFC payment and instead of
going with your phone which even you
don't want to lose you don't want have
all the secure credit card data on your
phone you just got your single Yubikey
or you can have your phone and then you
type your Yubikey with your phone so no
one will steal your data okay there you
go now actually you have two NFC devices
you've got a second factor of an
occasion for NFC that's really fantastic
especially with like lately a lot of
stuff coming out about how Google Wallet
is actually tied to the device and not
your account and if somebody steals your
google phone and you don't have a pin
code and they can reset the app and get
access to your money that's a really
interesting way of using that now as far
as like consumers are concerned though
how can they use this with their phones
today you know I know that a lot of big
corporations integrate yuba key into
their products and especially internally
for logging but what about a consumer
that wants to use it to log into their
social networks and things like that so
the first consumer application I'm
supporting our NFC initiative is
LastPass it's a cool single sign-on
service that has made an appt in this
case it's any nfcu baqi will work with
that yeah and you tap it to the the
phone and
you're securely log in to all your
online services through this you can use
the same Yubikey to log into lastpass
through your computer and on your
smartphone that's awesome and so people
can just go ahead and sign up with last
pass today grab a Yubikey over at
ubicool calm and and they're off to the
races yes and so when can we see the NFC
one coming out oh it's already out in
pre-production so we have a limited
number that we're actually already got
few hundred orders off we launched it
just the other day we are putting it in
the production now here in California
nicely you got robots hard at work right
now so yes we r we gonna have this in
full production before this summer but
it's actually available on the web store
already today that is so great and also
I'm really stoked about this so for just
your standard USB you baqi tell me about
this guy Woolsey what was the idea
behind this this is the cutest smallest
one time password token in the world
it's too small you can't you know if you
drop it you lose it the reason it's
actually some clients of us once you
have the Yubikey as an integrated part
of their computer or they want to use it
with ipads and then they wanted to be an
integrated part of the camera connection
kit which is um so then you plug this
into the computer and here this is now
integrated in the camera connection kit
it's really simple and then you put
press the button so now you have a
Yubikey finally for the ipad i have you
be key for the ipad you didn't have to
go to apple and license the 30-pin dock
connector and do all this crazy stuff
you're just like hey use the camera
connector yes that's what we started
that's awesome I congratulations on that
one and then you can plug it into the
any computer and then it becomes not
really strong two factor authentication
because it's tied to the computer but
for some up occasional you can take it
out if you've got really fine
fingernails or some tweezers cuz that
thing it just sinks into a USB port yeah
and there are some use cases you want a
machine identity you want to identity
for the computer with you sir presence
see I like those like the the bluetooth
USB dongles or some of those smaller
memory sticks like the
fit where you can literally just leave
it in your laptop and you don't have to
think about it anymore but like you said
you're right you lose the the second
factor if because now the the laptop has
it built in you have it built in but you
should always combine it with a pin or
password so I think for some
applications is great my favorite is
putting on the keychain III and I think
the you bikini Oh is gonna be the big
difference for us because now we got a
key that works across smartphones that
and all smartphones will have NFC
shortly and he can actually also it will
work for physical world to open doors
and covers we're starting a project with
the school's gonna have it for lunch
badges oh that is so cool yes it's a
k-12 school here in u.s. actually for
the kids and it is because it's like
it's NFC and it's open and it's in
anybody can go and get dev kits and
start programming for right yes Fanta
we're kin are hackers go and start
playing with the new NFC stuff now um we
will have a all the code available it's
sort of coming with very willing you but
technical documentation will be you can
find it under you be coded calm /
Yubikey dash neo and that's where you'll
find everything and it's in the progress
so don't be disappointed if you can't
find everything today well hey we are
gonna have to get you guys back on with
the engineers to talk about some of the
code and how people can integrate this
with their own products in studio I'm so
