welcome to minutes late minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me movies
today we're gonna talk about sleep one
of the most wonderful things in the
world but in in this sense
we're talking about it inside of
interpreter one of my most coveted
features of all time I've been waiting
for this thing to actually be in side of
the turret for a very very long time
so we're gonna show and go into one of
the sessions we already have sessions -
I won sleep - Shh alright so you're
thinking this is just sleep all this is
doing is going to tell it to go to sleep
for a period of time why would anybody
want this well I'll tell you why if
incident response is coming at you and
you see you know TCP view or process
monitor pop up all of a sudden in your
process list you can tell meterpreter go
to sleep no more communications to
happen for the next 5 20 minutes
whatever you can send it just go to
sleep for an hour two days however you
wish and meterpreter will just stay
there the the binaries still running but
it's not gonna make a peep which is
awesome
so watch sleep it's so simple sleep 20
seconds so this is telling the instance
of meterpreter to go to sleep for 20
seconds now what's gonna happen while
we're waiting here and i'm talking to
you is that after 20 seconds it's just
gonna come right back again this might
seem like a very simple thing but it's
incredibly useful you can tell things to
go to sleep for however long you want
and just tell it to go away
and there it is welcome back and we can
continue on with our session from there
after incident response has come and
gone or the user has come and gone
whatever we just want to make it
disappear the communications disappear
for a period of time so that's really it
tell me what you think about this
episode it's a really short ones we're
