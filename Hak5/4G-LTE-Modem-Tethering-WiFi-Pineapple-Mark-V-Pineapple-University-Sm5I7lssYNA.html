3G 4G mobile broadband getting your
Wi-Fi pineapple connected to the
Internet while it is out and about and
it's a pretty complex topic because
there are so many choices and because of
that there's a lot of different
configuration options but today I want
to show you the simplest way to get a
Wi-Fi pineapple online with a managed
mobile broadband solution so what am I
talking about here well first of all as
you guys know this little critter loves
to get on the internet and provide
everybody else with the packets but what
you really want to do is get it
connected either through Ethernet or a
nearby Wi-Fi connection tethered Android
phone or a USB modem and USB modems come
in a couple of different varieties first
of all we have our more traditional this
is just like I guess you could consider
it a USB dongle modem and these are kind
of great when they work and that's the
thing here's another one from there's a
Vodafone branded but this is a wall way
and this these are pretty popular they
work generally pretty well and a thing
about it is it really depends on if it
is supported not just by the operating
system but also if you have all of the
parameters that you're going to need to
configure it so to make things a little
bit easier we've gone ahead and put a
page on the Wi-Fi pineapple wiki you can
get over to Wi-Fi pineapple college
modems to find this and here we're
documenting some of the success success
cases some of the unconfirmed success
cases and I'd like to take this
opportunity to show you a few in my
collection that I know work great and
we're going to come back to these guys
because a little bit more complicated in
fact today I want to show you a
different kind of 3G modem and that is
what I guess you could
of considerate as a managed 3G modem in
the sense that what it sold us as a
personal hotspot the really cool thing
about personal hotspots right now is
that they support USB tethering so
here's my favorite right now it's
actually from Samsung product it's right
now sold through t-mobile here in the
United States and it's called the mobile
hotspot Pro pretty simple this is what
it looks like essentially what we're
looking at is a very slim device that
has a battery similar to what you would
find in a in a cell phone in fact and
this screen it's not actually a
touchscreen but it is kind of nice that
it does give you a little bit of
information about the connection quality
and things of that nature but what's
really great about this is this device
is actually managing that connection for
me so I don't have to worry about you
know being really attentive to the link
quality and doing redials and dealing
with all of that lower level networking
stuff the beautiful thing is this has a
micro operating system on it that is
taking care of that and they sell it as
you know I mean it essentially it's a
Wi-Fi router right but they sell it as
is like Oh connect up to eight devices
or whatever it may be what we want this
for is its ability to tether and
sometimes this feature is called
Ethernet over USB and what's really
great about this is no configuration
necessary in fact it's very akin to
using an Android phone in fact it may
even be running Android under the hood
so this particular unit I have already
plugged into my Wi-Fi pineapple over the
USB cable I'm actually not using its
supplied USB cable that came with it
because I've noticed that that one was
not working whatsoever but maybe that
was just me so your mileage may vary
however this guy is in fact plugged into
my Wi-Fi pineapple here over USB and so
let's go ahead and switch over to our
web interface
in fact I just booted this pineapple
here so the SSH in
great okay so if I say ping an IP
address yeah I'm already online okay so
I'm gonna have to show you the setup
procedure for this one and so we'll come
back to so what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to go ahead and unplug this
modem there we go
and we can come back here now that this
is unplugged and run that command again
and yes network is unreachable so I'll
go ahead and plug this guy back in and
it's simply micro USB and what's great
about this is the connection will
maintain because this is actually being
powered by the pineapple in fact that's
one of the things that I like about this
particular unit is that its power
consumption is kind of great I mean look
at that it's five volts but it's only
using 475 milliamps so it's well within
the 500 that the pineapple can provide
and so the draw is actually somewhat
better than some of the other CDMA Ori
video modems that I've seen that have
caused USB problems in the past all
right so this is plugged in and if I go
over to my pineapple let's go ahead and
take a look here and I'm going to go
ahead and run see if I can move this up
for you there we go alright so no I'm
going to use logger to put a bunch of
O's in the log now when I do the log
read I'll be able to tell that's when I
unplugged the modem and so now the only
trick to this particular modem is you
actually have to tell it to be a USB
tether and for that it's simply a matter
of coming over here to our browser and
I've actually already this is I'm in a
Windows machine right now doing this
recording but any machine whatsoever
just go ahead and connect to this in
this case it's a SSID is team little
broadband ten and of course you can
configure all of this stuff or
make it hidden or whatever have you but
I've connected to that Network and so
now I can actually browse over to its
admin page which is at 192.168.1 so
you'll just go ahead and log in the
password of course is admin wonderful so
login to the web portal here and this is
very much like any other wireless access
point or wireless router all you need to
do in this particular case is come down
here where it says USB connection and
check this box that says USB tethering
now as soon as I do that let's switch
over here and do log read you'll notice
that there's a lot more in this log in
fact let me make this a bit bigger so
that it looks a bit better and run that
log read again and you'll see here in my
OS and what it's done is we've got a
head and new device connected its HCI
we see our USB here manufacturer Samsung
in fact hey was like did I color what
the product is Samsung Android so it is
a micro Android device and you DHCP hey
check that out we're sending a discover
what are we sending a discover on USB
and we got an IP address of one and two
one six eight four T 2.1 fourteen and
there we go we have a new interface
called USB 0 so if i clear this and do a
diff config you'll notice now very much
like i have my you know eth0 interface
and my wlan0 interface and now have a
USB 0 interface and this one in fact has
an IP address and what's fantastic about
this is if I come over to my Wi-Fi
pineapple interface and click on network
I'll see that this has automatically
become USB right there has become so I
can make that a little bit bigger for
you has become the default gateway for
for the Wi-Fi pineapple so now anybody
connecting to the Wi-Fi pineapple is
going to have an
that connection through this and of
course as I've done attic now ping IP
address and hey look at that we have a
connection there and it was that simple
and what's so great about this is I
don't have to worry about micromanaging
any of this the pineapple seriously just
received an internet connection just as
a would if say it's Ethernet connection
was set up for DHCP and you just plugged
it into a router somewhere so that is
why that particular model is kind of my
favorite at this very moment but I hope
to follow up with this video real soon
with some of the others on my desk and
show you how to get started with that so
thanks for tuning in if you have
questions let me know in the comments
and I look forward to bringing you some
more tutorials soon Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
