favorite terminal tips this time on hack
five hello welcome back five my name is
Darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us I
had a lot of fun on the last show yes me
too
um and it's good to see you back I know
thank you for bringing me back out of
the boy that is devil will get it I
didn't like leader it was black I mean I
shared with everybody how it looked but
seriously like it kind of stuck I think
that you should start doing segments
from the devil to share with us your
unique experience that but it is another
time a black hole even if I'm trying to
express myself all they see is darkness
just like your cell where it happened at
the Last of Us I know if so I'm talking
about is this dark as your soul so we're
gonna move on drew we're actually
talking about our fun happy times and
Linux on this episode we get into our
some of our tips and I know that last
week we were talking about ways to kill
processes kill them dead yes make gen
male make them die really is that Noah I
guess it is a with the sword indeed my
coat is brown so and many were quick to
point out that in addition to the kill
all command that we know and love that
there is another another MP kill check
this out this is pretty cool so I'll
fire up trusty old G edit everybody
loves you uber by the way I know right I
wish that I could put it out there I've
got another version of it that I can put
on the web I'll do that so P kale and
then I just in this case you know I know
that the title of is G edit so it will
in fact if I think I do that it'll do it
as well will it yes so it can it be a
little bit lossy in the whole idea here
is that P kill will look up the signal
process based on the name or any other
attribute so you know running P kill G
at it obviously like I just did will go
ahead and do what you expect and kill it
it will figure out its PID or process
identifier and if you don't even have to
know the pin number no and it has more
advanced functions to it has the ability
to do pattern matching and check groups
and sessions and so anyway I just wanted
to point it out
because it is pretty cool I also wanted
to point out that that there's another
way cool thing that we can do with PS ox
like we did last week with grep to find
running processes on your system get
this similar to how we did last time
except with the tech V option and grep
we can say show me everything that
doesn't match something so for instance
and this brings us to a fun command I
love this command because it's just kind
of silly it's called Who am I and that's
what it will tell you actually if I run
Who am I on my machine this is DK but if
we switch over to Shannon's machine
that's not well there you go
as opposed to snobs which we'll get to
later on so by pairing these two
together though we can have it actually
tell us you know with the tag the option
everything that isn't our user calls
because PS aux is going to show us
things from everything so get this if I
for instance were to use PS aux and then
pipe that to grep with tach V and
remember like last time we did this who
am i thing we put it in the dollar sign
parenthesis so runs it as a command and
uses the output okay so I get a lot of
stuff right but it's all stuff that's
running as root or UUID or corn ops or
anything right and what's fun about this
is taking it a step further we can
actually use the tack tack sort option
of of PS and in this case if we sort by
equals negative % CPU what we'll end up
with oops let me try that again and the
reason why I got too much because it's
sorting it by CPU but I'm actually only
interested in say the top 10 so I'm
going to a do a grep tack m and say 11
because it actually has a little bit of
a header right oops
actually I can put this back here on
this line and no sensing grepping it
twice so tack M 11 so it's going to give
me the first 11 lines and then that tack
v to say everything whoops everything
that does not equal and in this case DK
so because this is just shorthand for DK
it's just going to give the output of
that what I end up with
a nice little listing of the top ten
processes running on my system that are
Chu and through my resources which isn't
in my particular case anything that
exciting it's like x11 and you know
normal stuff Wi-Fi that's pretty cool
but if you had like some crazy processes
running amok in your systems really if
you're on a multi-user system for
instance you're like who is tying up all
the resources like that roommate that
was using all the bandwidth but we're
gonna name names yeah I also wanted to
mention that this particular example
goes into that command substitution that
we've been using and that's when you see
when we use the output of one command in
place of something so for this
particular instance
Who am I became DK Shannon when she runs
Who am I that's going to equal snubz
yeah and that's because it's surrounded
by a dollar sign in parentheses there's
another way that you may see this
actually online in a lot of examples and
that is using the backtick which on a
u.s. keyboard is what you will get when
you hit the tilde key the one right
above tab um if you do it without
hitting shift the the thing is and you
know I should probably also point out
the English majors before you comment I
understand that it is a grave accent but
are you sure it's not girl they yeah you
know what I'm not sure maybe it is grave
a we will find out in the comments I
call it a back tick personally or that
fun thing you can use an ASCII art but
that's a different story
I call it the little thingy sure so the
little thingy has turns out is shorthand
for also doing dollar sign parentheses
but it's deprecated okay so it's like
not the best way to do that but I'm just
going to point that out because you will
see it in a lot of old commands I
actually can't do it on my system really
yeah so if I try to do like that exact
command but instead of this Who am I
here in parentheses do the back tick oh
look at that whenever I hit tilde I get
a I get a console check that out weird
because I'm awesome like that and I love
quake 3 and it's console like stuff
mm-hmm
that's a gnome extension uh you know
there's also one that I like he called
it shopped
at least because you like yeah I knew
that you'd love the one that has to do
with shopping of course well it doesn't
really have to do with shopping here let
me run it for you
so it's spelled sh opt so not
necessarily shopping do that and then
tack s and I'm gonna do CD spell which
is another you're gonna cast spells on
me so what is what is shop doing here
okay so it's turning things on and off
or aka its setting things or unsetting
them so basically I can turn this this
this thing off or I can unset it with
and that would be shopped tech you CD
spell but I'm going to go ahead and turn
that back on okay so that one's very
very simple what is what a CD spell
so CD spell this is pretty cool if it's
set then minor errors in the spelling of
a directory component in a CD command
will be corrected so if you spell
downloads as Allen loads
it'll correct that and still put you
into download wait so it's gonna be like
a loss in like like snobs you're when my
in my bash I try to type the name wrong
and it's all like Darren you're drunk go
home right yeah that's a bad man I
always get your Teta because I forget to
capitalize things or stuff like that so
with this and then I always you know
misspelled my might directories so the
error is checked for our transposed
characters missing character and if you
have too many characters so if you put
two O's and downloads or three O's I
guess it would be if a crushin is found
then the correct path is printed and
then the command proceeds so if I write
in now CD on loads loads it's still
going to put me into downloads ah pretty
cool right yeah I know so there's
another one called dir spell and this
one will make bash attempt to correct
the spelling of a directory name so for
example if you CD to download instead of
downloads it'll make the best guess for
you instead of telling you that
directory doesn't exist less nice yeah
which is a pain in the butt so the other
one that I really like and this is for
capitalization I'll turn it on shop
tack s no case glob
so I'll just turn that on so this one is
quite possibly going to change your life
because you know downloads are supposed
to be capitalized all the time if you're
used to case insensitive nature's of
like das for example setting no case
glob will make CD downloads with the
lowercase T still put you into downloads
so it works on all file names and
directories so for example I'll go into
CD downloads with no upper case and it
still puts me into D downloads with the
uppercase one oh my gosh you just made
Linux case-insensitive
oh great I know no n when whenever
you're trying to share commands on
Twitter and your phone automatically
capitalized RM tech RF and makes you
look like a dumb-dumb oh right right
because then it takes me off cuz
everybody's like you know you don't have
to capitalize the R and R that's not
actually a command yes so now I can be
like actually it still works with no
case glob news so we're gonna have to do
a follow-up of this segment now and
figure out how to get emoji commands
working in Linux cuz that's just what we
need
obviously yeah so I thought it was
pretty cool and at the same time if
you've been working in Linux for quite
some time this might be kind of annoying
to you as it is for Darin and also it
probably is best to learn the right way
but if you want to be lazy it's there
for you so there you go you're welcome
oh man and should we should probably
also point out that if you just do
shopped it gives you all of your screen
settings so so if you look at either of
ours yeah you see an entire listing of
all of our things that are either turned
on oh my gosh so much fun you can change
your history at it and verification and
last pipe and so many fun things to to
get into there and that's a built into
so you don't have to download and
install anything it's just built into
Linux alright so in just a bit we are
going to go into our favorite silly
Linux tips because you know everybody
likes to troll but first a word from our
sponsor when you get that great idea
you're gonna need yourself a great
domain and if you're like Shannon and I
you'll love using domain calm because
there's nothing simpler they haven't
into
of domain discovery system and an easy
checkout process that I get your website
up and online in no time and they've
been supporting hak5
for years now so you can show your
support back by using their coupon code
just for us it's hak5 or hack five drop
that in that check out to save yourself
an extra 15% off or shoot them a tweet
at domain.com and say hey thanks for
supporting hack five when you think
domain names think domain.com oh hello
hello my name is miss one for like
you're here it looks it you're doing
this one on the podcast yeah we're gonna
get some live comments I tell you for
sure for dollar okay here's a dollar
okay good I tell you fortune fortune in
amusia
have an Adair to scores okay so for
column as one when he were a boy and one
when he were men Connor
Chenin I have a cow a new fortune for
dollar like ow okay what's dis I tell
you fortune fortune hey look have tail
pipe to Carol
Kelsey there's a phone call for you yeah
okay yeah show you something I got pipe
it okay Kelsey okay all right Shannon um
you've officially broken on the podcast
but thank you you're just yes yes
totally not being racist by the way just
look up like miss Wan SNL from the 90s
because Oh Huggle arias was SNL I
thought it was uh maybe it was Matt Matt
teenie MADtv that's one of those anyway
what's the guy who would jump up and
down and be like I could do anything no
clue although I will say mango mango is
my favorite thank you so much for your
dog yes of course
you went then no actually I do thanks oh
you know what I figure I will be just as
silly back to you okay in that
do you like the matrix okay I love me
okay then you're going to need C matrix
which is not supposed to be capitalized
oh yeah yes you press Q to quit and
there you go if you want to you can also
do attack s which we'll put into
quote-unquote screensaver mode so that
any key will quit out of it and it'll
look like this okay that looks exactly
the same but I'm pressing any key
actually I didn't press the any key I
think I think okay oh you know what I
wonder if this one works like most yeah
ctrl + shift by the way whenever it
anybody tells you press any key hit ctrl
+ shift and then look back at them as a
beta tester and be like your programs
broken you're welcome
so another fun one is that we can we can
do B for bold so we can put those both
together and do tack BS and oh now it's
in bold but get this it gets even better
because there's a capital C option that
lets you do color and just few snobs
magenta yes I know that's so pretty is
your is your brain not completely blown
it's so amazing yes these are some of
our amazing Linux tips because we're
having fun in the terminal as we wrap up
season my side community matrix your
said computer is running like like
Ubuntu 1204 or something no seriously
dude you take a thing breaks it's an i3
with a 5400 rpm hard drive I feel like
we need like a sally's others kind of
thing here for for just 10 cents a day
you too can help a poor starving
podcaster with an i3 and a $5,400 my
goal this year is to get a new computer
so I can run dual boot Windows and Linux
on it cuz I carry my carrying set it
just is not working for me and I need
Windows for tech thing so so somebody's
got a scale at skylake laptop coming in
their future and what are you what are
your recommendations you know goes both
ways
see now you get to tell us what machine
you're rocking that is just owning right
speaking of owning I will thank you it
was a lot of fun to meet all of you guys
at the pier
premiere which i come to yet guy
recording that's on Friday but anyway Oh
so before we go I also want to let you
guys know about some really really super
cool happy fun things happening InfoSec
training so we got lube exploit minutes
Sebastian - who is one of the Wi-Fi
pineapple developers and Darren who is
hosting another pen test with hack 5 the
class is March 11th through the 13th
it's very hands-on it's training very
different from any of the other ones
that you might have gone to so if you're
keen on the class you want to learn more
you can go to pen test with hack 5 calm
that's hak5 calm seats are very limited
they're selling pretty quickly so we're
gonna sell out quick so I hope that
there are still some when this is airing
but if you can't make it to the class
you can also get all of the awesome pen
test gear which is included with it and
you can get that from our very own hock
shop comm including the new Wi-Fi
pineapples the Nano the tetra we've got
the USB rubber ducky in the land turtle
and all that other fun gear and thank
you so much for supporting us directly
with that it is keeping hak5 going do me
so coconuts mmm Oh x9 the coconut a UH
I'll show you later I was talking about
legitimate coconut oh no I don't think
we're uh I don't think hak5 is actually
registered for any sort of fruit export
although it's not a fruit it's very
complicated is it a legume like legume
egg you little egg you if you guys have
any feedback or you want to tell us how
to properly plant pronounce words like
glue you you can always email us
feedback at hak5 org and that is also
the website hack five work where you
will find all of our other shows like
threat wire Metasploit minute pineapple
university
I believe Darrin's link to the snubs
report and dance log so everything is
over there yes and if you're doing like
what we're doing and you want to just
support it really quick and easy you can
just hit like subscribe wherever those
things are you can leave a review on
iTunes you can tell your friends all of
that goes a long way and it's what has
been keeping hak5 going for the last 10
years it's awesome
so thank you for that we will be back
actually next week with some more of our
favorite Linux stuff as we wrap up
season 19
then we're gonna head into season 20
with drone building should be really fun
are you gonna help me build my first
drone I'm gonna help you build your
first drone that does not require any
sort of FAA root registration which
should be a lot of fun keep an Islander
250 grams so stay tuned for that also
leave your comments with your favorite
Linux tips we will do a follow up to
these a lot of these are based on your
wacky ideas so thank you so much
everybody that's been sending us cool
ideas to feedback or in the comments
about their favorite terminal foo and we
will do a wrap-up with that i'm darren
kitchen
trust your techno west quick v what am I
supposed to do to you am I supposed to
like and these nubs now I kow say that
doesn't even work
