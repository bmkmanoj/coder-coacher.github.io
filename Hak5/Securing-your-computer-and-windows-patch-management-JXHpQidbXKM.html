updates turned on but how do I know if
my computer is really up to date first
thing you can do is likley post your IP
address and I'm sure somebody will again
give us your IP address we'll put it in
the next show and I'm sure the viewers
will take care of your computer real
quick but if you don't like that idea
then once you go ahead and check this
out okay well that's a very interesting
question that you passed in fact I think
it's a question that pretty much the
entire security community is still
wondering and had nobody's really come
up with an answer as far as how to
secure a windows machine no they don't
make it easy um no people want to get
give windows hell but I mean there's
some basic security practices you can
follow you know a lot of times it's not
necessarily the operating system you're
on it's a services you're running
programs that you're running I mean
Linux can be just as insecure as windows
it's just the way that it's exactly and
I mean the big problem with windows the
biggest problem with Windows is that
when an exploit or vulnerability comes
out you're at you know Microsoft swim to
come off a patch it is not open to
public scrutiny you don't have anybody
in the world who can come up with a
fixed submitting a fix you have
microsoft coming up with their fix
that's going to be on the second tuesday
of the month so you know in the case of
the wmf exploit i think they released it
a little bit early because of the
severity of the attack but nevertheless
you're still dependent upon them and i
think that's the problem that's the
thing that really turns off a lot of
security consultants and you know people
are in the know in the note as far as
digital security because you've got no
access to you know customize the
operating system now you know you've
already done the first step and that is
to make sure that you've got automatic
updates enabled but there's another
thing that you can do to make sure you
know I why why you love it because you
totally sane oh hang on the directors
telling us to keep going the control
room guys are like you're doing fine
keep going there's enough there's
actually an application that Microsoft
release that will allow you to scan your
system and not just your system but any
other
system on the network that you have
administrative rights to and it will
check it's called the Microsoft baseline
security analyzer and it will check
facts not only if you've got all the
windows updates and office updates but
if you've you know followed best
practices not just with Windows but also
it scans SQL Server 2000 is there's even
one specifically for Microsoft Exchange
2003 okay so here we've got microsoft
baseline security analyzer opened and if
you go through here and set it to scan
right now I've scanned in my local
system it will tell me that you know my
windows updates are up to date my office
updates are up to date oh look I've got
a guest account open and that's why I
got this little red X here and this lets
me know that that failed it's a critical
vulnerability and I can click here to
see what was scanned the pop-up little
thing saying hey you noob you know
you've got your guest account opened and
I can click over here how to correct
this and it'll actually walk you through
the steps involved in in fixing this
action so you're not you know open to
two vulnerabilities of course it's not a
silver bullet it does scan a lot of
things and it's going to give you a much
better idea then then you just by going
to the windows update site and seeing if
you got the green light or the red light
you know another thing you might want to
do is is there's a couple of websites
that have that are that you know publish
known vulnerabilities for example
security focus exploit tree all odium no
warm all of those and what you can do is
you can just go to those websites and
select like for example not necessary I
is or a particular version so like I'm
running Apache exactly and you want to
go and find out what vulnerabilities are
yet public for that particular version
of that software program so both running
Apache 1.33 you know a world one point
three point three or whatever it is i
would go to security focus select a
patch you select that version and see
what vulnerabilities are out for the
version and then and then you also might
want to try testing it out and that's
the beautiful thing about penetration
testing is the fact that you know if you
can't actually penetrate the box
yourself it's probably not you know the
crucial vulnerability you know
oftentimes the biggest vulnerabilities
are the ones that are the easiest to
perform like the wmf exploit as soon as
it came out I mean everybody could do it
because it's so easy so that's why don't
really like I don't really like
answering this this kind of question
they go it's really great there's no way
to secure a computer because at any
point you never know when a new
vulnerability will come out or which
ones are out that are not public right
but this monogram is a great way to
check this what you can do is yell a
rather than saying how do you secure
your computer you say how do I make it
secure enough or the best that I can do
right because a lock is only there to
deter an honest person well yeah I mean
there's I mean everybody in the security
world i mean i think this is made famous
by Bruce and I are when he said
basically you can have the best lock on
your door and a thief is just going to
break the window so it's it's it's not
necessarily that you have all your
patches up to date or that you're
running you know some super secure
version of Linux at the NSA is you know
p.m. free a DoD whatever you want to
make sure that all of the different
facets of your network your personal
network are pretty secure you know what
I mean like you're not you don't have a
billion ports open on your firewall
you're not running like oh just tell
them it yeah if you don't have a windows
98 bucks on your local network on the
DMZ or something like that so you know a
tool like this is great also try some
open source tools or some tools you can
download publicly like a nickname is a
great one Nessus is a great one very
good one there's a lot of tools you can
do you can download it will put a few in
the show yeah they'll be at the bottom
of screen want to mention them okay I'm
good and you don't wait a while what I
think is great is that these tools are I
mean you could read you know you could
spend like weekends reading white papers
on best security practices what when it
all boils down to it most likely if you
run a home network nobody's really
interested in what your computer has you
know I mean though he's gonna be trying
to break it I had to say it but I mean
most likely nobody really cares what's
on your computer and they really don't
care about breaking into it but if you
would you like a 20 gigs mp3's that I'm
sure the hackers one yeah maybe yeah all
that j palmer and yeah and
get it yes and I guess the last thing
you can do to make sure that your
computer secure is go ahead and publish
your public IP address on forms all
right haha dot org slash forms and I'm
yo yo yo find out very quickly
under D will let you know real quick
quick if you're good so thanks so much
for the question I hope that helped
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
