Netflix welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morris and
today I'm checking out an alternative to
VirtualBox called VMware Player in the
episode 10 of hack tip we went over
virtual machines what they are why you
would use them and what they're good for
but you don't necessarily have to use
VirtualBox to try out a vm there are
plenty of virtual machine programs on
the market but not all of them are free
and easy to use VMware Player is both of
these with a whole bunch of awesome
sauce built in as well this program
available over at VMware com lets you
run several operating systems virtually
as well as give you the comfort and
safety of trying out new software in a
vm because sometimes software you might
download is just downright janky crap
we're over 200 different operating
systems are supported including various
versions of Windows Linux and even
Chrome OS yeah pretty cool when you
first download VMware Player you'll need
to register for a new VMware account
they ask for your name a password some
geographical data but that's about it
the installation wizard is your normal
process of yesses next now pawn opening
the general layout is just about the
same as VirtualBox I'm going to go ahead
and open up mine real quick on the right
hand side you can choose to create a new
VM you can open one and you can upgrade
to the paid VMware account or you can
choose help click on create a new
virtual machine and choose installer
disk image file dot well ISO so I'll do
that choose an ISO and to choose an ISO
all you have to do from here is browse
to your ISO for the operating system
that you want to try out I'm going to go
ahead and browse to my Puppy Linux ISO
and choose open on the next screen you
just click Next and this is where you're
going to choose the Linux and in the
drop down menu you'll choose other linux
2.6 kernel also if you choose a
different kind of linux distro just find
it in the list and click on it and then
you
choose how much space is allocated for
the VM so I'm going to go ahead and go
with eight gigs so I choose Linux and I
chose 2.6 kernel which is next and it
asked me what I want to name it so I'll
name it number two number two and click
Next
and this is where it asked me for the
eight gigs eight gigs store virtual disk
as a single file makes it much easier
that way don't want to do any
customization so I'm going to go ahead
and click Next and start it up once
you're done you can boot up into your VM
and test it out so let's see if mine
runs currently booting
but it's going so that's good sweet mine
looks to boot just as it should but this
isn't all there is to vmware player
after the break I'm going to show you
some really cool extras that come with
VMware Player and who I chose as my fav
VMware Player or VirtualBox stay tuned

I'm back and before I reveal which one
was my favorite between virtualbox and
VMware Player I like to take a moment
and mention some little extras VMware
Player comes with some handy tools such
as this one called VMware Browser
appliance which can be found on their
website right here you download this zip
file from the website and you extract it
then in VMware Player you choose to open
a virtual machine and browse to the
folder so I'm going to open a virtual
machine and I've already browse to the
folder it's called browser appliance vmx
and i choose open then i can double
click on that and i can browse on the
internets in deliciousness the browser
appliance allows you to securely browse
the internet using firefox to protect
against adware and spyware and you can
safeguard your personal information as
it can be configured to reset itself
each time it's booted up so that no info
is stored also available is this wide
array of
virtual appliances found over at
vmware.com these applications can help
you with information in the cloud
storage IT administration networking and
much much more so now that i've checked
out both VirtualBox and vmware player i
have to say I think I like VirtualBox
more hmm
while both are free to use and work with
all sorts of VMs VirtualBox seems to be
a little bit faster in the guest OS as
well as the host OS also VMware Player
only lets you use one virtual machine at
a time while VirtualBox will let you
open many at a time so that's it enter
your comments below I want to know which
one was your favorite VirtualBox or
virtual VMware Player and why virtual
machines are actually pretty easy once
you get the hang of it also I want to
hear your feedback what programs
commands have you found what's cool in
your world
