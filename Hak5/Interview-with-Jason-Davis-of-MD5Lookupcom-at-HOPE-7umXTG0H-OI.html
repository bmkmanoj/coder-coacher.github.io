just finished a panel on password
cracking and time memory trade-off and
you're working for the site what is this
md5 look up look up com yeah Oh so can
you tell me a little bit about uh to
somebody that's not familiar with time
memory trade-off you know the basic
example we're all kind of familiar
audiences with password cracking but how
this differs from your standard brute
force and dictionary attacks with time
memory trade-off compared to brute
forcing brute forcing you have to go
ahead and you have to compute every
combination for your certain key space
every single time which is sort of
ridiculous because if you do on 13
password it's going to take you forever
and then if you do that on one password
you have to do that for all your
passwords so why not just generate them
all but store them into memory the first
time and then make it quick recall all
the other times that's what timer
trade-off is applied to password
cracking basically now I think a lot of
people are also familiar with the
popular rainbow crack software or
rainbow tables and from your panel I
understand that what you're doing is
similar yet a lot different so can you
tell me what those differences are
rainbow tables use rainbow mathematics
which is basically pattern or interval
oriented when you do that you lose
accuracy so your tie that's why rainbow
tables have 90 and 7.3 98.9 and when you
really get into the 99.999 percentage
the tables increased drastically that's
because they have to generate all those
intervals all those patterns still don't
think in in hash databasing which is
what I do basically you generate all
combinations and you store them and
there is no pattern oriented anything
like that for whatever character set you
generated for you're gonna have a
hundred percent accuracy for that
character set so but at the expense of
disk space yeah but as I said in panel
we're definitely working on that we've
got a lot of new techniques that are
coming up I had some people just mention
some stuff to me you know and there'd be
emailing me and hopefully I can work out
some more stuff to help reduce that
because right now we're relatively
competitive with the same size as
rainbow tables but I'm hoping that we
can we can beat that you know
definitely push the envelope when it
comes along so what kind of what kind of
tricks and you know ways are using to
reduce the size of the current tables
what's your technique right now
generally speaking what you do is you
store you store your text and your hash
well if your hash is 32 there are 32
characters which is 16 bytes you know
text is for you know you're going to
have 20 bytes there well what we do is
we take the hash we cut it down and we
see our see it and then that cuts it
down to about six six characters which
is about three bytes and then you store
your clear text with that you see or see
that as well and what happens is you're
going to run into a bunch of collisions
and then you group those so you not only
reduce the roads but you shrink the size
and everything it's basically like a
really pimp way to use crcs as a
compression mechanism so yeah and
anybody can try this at home they can
just go to md5 look up calm and punch in
a hash yeah we I have a ton of the
research online that explains everything
in more elaborate motion than you know
what I did with the panel but yeah they
can they can use the the regular single
search online right now and then
eventually I'm going to have the the
multi engine which can you just put in a
list of patches and it'll just crack
them all and give you an output on it so
and when you did your demonstration it
was really amazing to see that even when
you would give it you know five or more
hashes it was able to compute those
matter of seconds so what is it on the
back end that's making it still
optimized basically the one of the
problems with well it's not really
problem but rainbow tables uses flat
files and you can't you can't really
build a web interface for flat files so
what we did was I put all of it into a
real my sequel database and we index the
whole thing and then I mean the index is
large but it allows us to break
passwords and literally from that
database server we can break them in
point 20 of a second so that's that's
one of the things that were database in
that flat file and it's it's web
oriented so a lot of the overhead just
flat-out is in there so what kind of
issues have you had with storage the
original database was wasn't too huge
so like I had one like I to 160 gig
drives now we we basically the
limitations I'm up to 1.8 terabytes now
and you know I'm already like at 1.5 of
that full so I definitely in order to
add more characters to the database make
it more effective statistically you have
to have more space so right now I'm just
looking into funding for new hard drives
just you know new compressions that type
of thing and it's all research and we're
just feeling it out working out you know
whatever comes comes so you were talking
about characters what kind of character
space have you been able to put in your
index right now our new one which is 1.5
will break 1 through 5 everything all
255 printable six and seven alphanumeric
8 alpha lower and zero through ten
lengths numbers what's what's the
eventual goal the ate everything ate
everything would be cool because then
we'll will literally hit about seventy
to eighty percent of all passwords on
the planet and you have any idea as to
what the size of that might be 14
terabytes Wow 14 terabytes so now you're
just doing this on your own or is this
for a company this is basically have
separated myself for my company for this
one I'm self-employed and it's been it's
been funded on my own pocket and
everything right now I've done
everything myself and I've had a couple
people have me with testing programming
stuff like that so well we definitely
understand how that is here at hak5 so
is there ways that people can support
the project maybe even yeah can they
submit their own hashes or values
anything like that or um I mean they
could eventually when I when I put the
new one online I'm gonna see if maybe if
I can start taking donations because
then I can start building another server
with a better database and since I'm not
a big fan of charging for the service
you know I'd rather just have people you
know okay cool i use this i do 300 a day
you know i'll give them ten bucks or
whatever so i might look into something
like that but you know other than that
it's just gonna be self-sustained so
right you also said in the panel that
you're a fan of open source so that
you're giving up the source code for
this so anybody can do this themselves
everything right now is currently just
open source you can go to the website
download the utils the only problem is
that I haven't thrown a lot of a lot
mutation and with it there's basically
just some key notes inside the utils
what source code without documentation
yeah well it's it was sort of thrown
together you know because I'm not
exactly a C+ programmer I had to
basically relearn it force myself to do
it and you know I didn't really want to
put it up there because it's not exactly
a hundred percent stable you know so it
still needs critiquing and with the next
release once i'm done with the new
database probably in about a month or
something to throw up the new utilities
which are a lot more stable and then the
new one will be online so and then
anybody can make these at home but what
kind of aside from the storage
requirements what kind of cpu time does
it take to generate these databases
because it's written in real see it's it
basically takes five days to run through
the process and I do it I did it in five
runs so you're looking at about 25 days
for the one that I'm building now so 1.5
terabytes in under 30 days it's pretty
good that's amazing considering it's
only going to take a second to crack the
password after that exactly I'm
willingly going to give up one point
five terabytes in 25 days basically just
on a server that would be idling anyways
to be able to proactively audit anything
I want so and right now it's just md5
right yeah I had a few questions about
that and the algorithm can be easily
adapted in the sources right now all it
does is include the md5 headers and run
the basically the md5 function you can
change it to whatever you want because
the way that the compression is set up
now at CRC oriented not algorithm
dependent so okay and as you see this
evolved uh where do you uh where do you
see md5 look up going in the next year
um I'm gonna finish the new database in
about a month I'm gonna leave that
online for about a year and if I have
the funding to move up the character set
to the next one then that's where I'm
going to go and it's free for anybody to
use now that obviously must put a lot of
burden on the server on the back end so
is that something that may change or or
are you running into problems with you
know load on the server um digg com
which is a popular like bookmarking site
we got hit on there and that basically
broke my server so I'm definitely going
to split it up have a database server
and then to web servers and but that's
an eventual alidade oh come around so
that's I yeah definitely because if we
got slashed at it I wouldn't be up for
week so okay and so that means be nice
guys so where can they find any more
information about your research and then
try it out themselves everything's on
the site and there's a lot of research
out there right now on just basic timer
trade-off people that are there taking
the ideas and that's what I want people
to take the ideas turn them into
whatever they want i want to see better
versions of what I've done and you know
I really think timer trade-off is the
way to go with password cracking now
because storage is so abundant why not
you know it just totally beats the pants
off of brute forcing so great especially
with you know hard drives the stupid say
our day today's well thank you so much
for taking some time to talk to us and
we'll be checking in and seeing how
you're doing okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
