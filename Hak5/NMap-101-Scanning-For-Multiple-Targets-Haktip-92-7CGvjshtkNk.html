you by fresh books welcome to hack tip
the show where we break down concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and i chi ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and
today we're scanning multiple targets in
and map aka de network mapper last week
we discussed the simple task of
installing end map and scanning for a
selected target pretty easy I chose to
scan my Synology Nass to show you a
quick outline of what to expect whenever
your scan has completed now let's say
that you want to scan multiple targets
all at once
instead of scanning them one at a time
you can do them all in one command such
as this first off you need to type in
end map and then your three four or five
or however many IP addresses that you
want to scan so I know that I am in the
ten dot 70 3.31 range so I'm going to
scan ten dot 73 31.1 I'm also going to
scan ten dot 73 dot 31.58 and I'll scan
ten dot 70 3.31 dot let's say 100 let's
see if anything's on 100 then you start
the scan and it'll print out anything
that is going on through and maps so
this will list each of them in the same
order starting with your first IP
address and then the second one and then
the third one if you had a third the
list will look similar to just scanning
one target except you'll have one target
the second and the third very simple
also if they are all on the same subnet
you can also type your command like this
one such as and map and then you can
type in another IP address 10.7 a 3.31
dot let's say I'll do 115 and 255
probably nothing up there but we'll see
and then it will output all of the same
information now if you want to scan a
range of IP addresses that looks a
little bit different and this will scan
pretty much everything on your network
if you want it to you could simply type
in something
like this and map and then type in your
IP address 1073 31.1 and I'm going to
say through 100 so this is actually
going to pull up whatever is going on
it'll output any and all networked
hardware that is currently on and
connected between those IP address
ranges so if we keep it going there we
go
okay so we're starting to see all sorts
of things now this one's probably my
favorite one if I scroll up right now
you are going to see let's see there's
something on 99 HTTP and CS listener if
I scroll up 75 is right here 75 has a
bunch of open ports I wonder what those
are curious mmm curiosity 74 is open 73
so we have a whole bunch of things on
the network going on right now it's
obviously a work neck network plenty of
things going on now if you want you can
also change this to a different class of
subnet or a range of networks by doing
the same thing but changing around a
couple of the numbers that you put in so
instead of typing in and map 10 7330
1.13 100 i could also put 10 dot 73 dot
and then i could do 1 through 100 dot
star so it looks a little bit different
that wildcard the little little asterisk
at the end remember that from our linux
terminal 101 series yeah it works the
exact same way here it will scan all
ranges from 0 to 255 in that subnet so
I'm going to hit enter let's see what
happens hopefully it works so we'll let
this go ahead and run real quick and I'm
going to let it run in the background
after the break we will try scanning an
entire subnet but first let's take a
quick break for our sponsor freshbooks
is the simple online accounting solution
built for small business owners just
like you who want to skip the headache
of tax time it is tax time and if you're
not using fresh books your life is a
mess right now you're hunting for
receipts and digging through invoices
and going through every record one by
one it's the worst FreshBooks is the
simple cloud accounting solution that
will make tax time
Brie's seriously I know this because
guess what my taxes are already done you
know why I was able to keep track of
each and every receipt for the entire
year through their expense page I can
group and I can sort depending on what
type of expense they are so that when
I'm filling out my tax forms
it's really easy for me to find specific
receipts to be honest it kind of helped
me save a little bit of money this year
on taxes because it totally helped me
keep organized and I didn't lose
anything it was wonderful now with fresh
books you can create
professional-looking invoices as well
you can capture and track expenses you
can get real-time business reports with
just a couple of clicks plus you can
work anywhere with fresh books mobile
app for your phone and your tablet it's
really useful the sooner you start using
fresh books the sooner you can start
focusing on the work that you love and I
love focus on your work not your
paperwork for a limited time you can try
fresh books for free for sixty days to
get started visit get fresh books calm
now and enter hack five and the how did
you hear about us section right now
fresh books is giving away to our
viewers and extended 60 day free trial
to make tax time a breeze and hurry up
because tax time is almost over again go
to get fresh books calm and enter hack 5
and the how did you hear about a section
when signing up thank you so much fresh
books for supporting the show and we are
back and ready to scan an entire subnet
now back in the terminal let's go ahead
and start typing our next command this
one starts again with an map to begin
the command and then we type in 10 dot
73 dot 31.1 looks a little weird slash
24 okay I know that looks a little weird
so that slash 24 is the thing called a
CIDR notation of the network address and
the subnet mask in binary bits again
okay so this command will give you a
very similar information as the long
list of outputs but here's a really fun
one you can scan a list of targets from
IP addresses that you had previously
entered into a text file that's pretty
to cool too now I'm going to go ahead
and enter this so 10 dot 73 31 1/24 and
go ahead and start that so this is going
to list out everything on my network but
it's much easier than typing out 1
through 100 or 1 through 254 255 or what
have you
now speaking of that text file that I
mentioned this is kind of cool putting
all those IP addresses that you would
previously entered into a text file you
can do that simply by using the cat
command and we also mention that in our
Linux terminal 101 segments previously
in hack tip so you can use cat space
list txt and then we'll enter a few IP
addresses that we want to scan and this
time we're going to add its syntax to it
so let me go ahead and try this out so
I'm going to type cat space list txt and
this is going to show me the IP
addresses that I had entered into that
txt file
so I did 110 73 31 145
I hit enter to bring it to a new line
and then I typed in 10 dot 73 31 1 1 6
and I just simply saved the file in my
route now this time we are going to go
ahead and add a syntax
gets a little bit funky but not too bad
and map and then we type in tack I
capital L capital L not lowercase
list.txt now when we hit enter this time
and map will scan the IP addresses in
the list of targets from list txt it'll
read each line as a new IP address and
then the scan will look just like all of
the other ones but it's cool because you
can put in a text file it's neat I like
it now I want to know what you want to
see about net and map it's a very fun
tool and we can do all sorts of things
with it we can even use it with net cat
and that can be really really fun now
send me a comment below or you can email
us over at tips at hak5 org and be sure
to check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this not to
mention also mu bik's has been doing
some great stuff over with his show
Metasploit minute definitely check that
out over at hak5 org and of course I
will always be over here over at the
hack 5 studio entertaining you guys
