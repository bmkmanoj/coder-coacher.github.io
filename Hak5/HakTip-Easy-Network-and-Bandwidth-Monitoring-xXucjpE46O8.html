carbonite
welcome to hot tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Shannon Morse and today we're
talking monitoring now I'm not talking
about monitoring your PC's health or CPU
although both of those are very handy
indeed but I'm talking monitoring your
bandwidth and network usage there is a
handy tool called networks that does
just that on the go it's portable yeah
awesome this program does exactly what
it should it charts your bandwidth logs
it and measures the speed of your
Internet's networks can help you
identify possible sources of network
problems ensure that you don't exceed
the bandwidth limits specified by your
ISP or track down suspicious network
activity which is characteristic of
Trojan horses and hacker attacks oh ha
ha ha you can monitor several
connections or just one and make it tell
you when the network goes down or if
there is something fishy going on
it features clear graphs the ability to
export info the ability to notify or
disconnect a user after a certain amount
of bandwidth is used there's a speed
meter to time downloads and it works
with all sorts of connections and it's
completely free I love free stuff
awesome to use that simply download the
link from their website which is at soft
perfect calm and you can get either the
portable or the Installer you pop it on
your computer unzip the folder and
double click on the program now you can
monitor all of your traffic download
speeds control bandwidth of users and
more now let's take a look after the
break but first here's a word from our
sponsor computer disasters eventually
happen to everyone but if you get
carbonite online backup before your
disaster then no need to worry because
your files will be backed up
automatically and safely off-site it's
really easy to get them backed up - you
can access them from anywhere from any
computer your smart phone or the free
iPad app

to buy find all the details at
carbonite.com and be sure to use the
offer code hak5
to get two months free with your
purchase and we're back and now I want
to take a closer look at the actual
program networks so it's very handy and
it just kind of hides in the background
for you you can click on this little
icon down in the bottom and it will show
you your current transfer rate of your
download and your upload speeds you can
also right click and change all your
settings configure things two things
that I wanted to check out were the
graph that shows all your connections
and the speed meter so I've had this
speed meter running for about almost two
minutes now and it gives me my current
transfer rates the average transfer rate
for all of my all of my uploads and
download speeds the maximum transfer
rate total data transferred and then it
gives me the time and date that I have
started it the networks all connections
graph over here shows me my download
speed and my upload speed so let's see
if it changes when I start up a download
of a hack 5 episode so I'll choose 926
hour DEFCON episode which was awesome
and I'll download the mp4 Save Link As
just right there on my desktop okay Wow
okay now we see my download going up to
point two and the graph is going crazy
let's see what the other of it says and
even the current transfer rate and all
that information is going up as well so
this is a very cool program it's a
useful program that Darren has used in
the past and I am interested in playing
with some more what programs do you use
hit me up in the comments below or email
me at tips at hak5 org and be sure to
check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff than just like this
I'll be there reminding you to trust
your techno West why not okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
