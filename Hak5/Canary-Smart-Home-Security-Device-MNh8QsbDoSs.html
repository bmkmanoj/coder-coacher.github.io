by Toyota frag 5 I'm Darrin kitchen here
at CES 2014 checking out the latest in
home security
from canary Andrew what's up Matt hey
it's good to see you again Darren yes
the canary is kind of smart home
protection so even more than security
it's gonna prevent fires it's gonna look
out for you it's gonna kind of give you
a better idea of what's going on at home
on a regular basis and if I were
spelunking or going into some sort of
cave this would be the device I would
want to take with me always I carry one
in my backpack all the time now the idea
is basically like how do we create
really simple security for somebody
who's living in a one or two bedroom
apartment somebody who has a new home
maybe just a couple or a three person
family and it's plug and play so
literally you take it out of the box you
connect it to the wall you download the
app you set up Wi-Fi you're done and so
this has got like motion sensors and
cameras and it notices my cat running
across the room and it's gonna tweet me
or photos of this yes it has all the
bells and whistles so we've got an HD
camera that does 1080p video we have
audio we have a siren we have night
vision we have an infrared motion sensor
we have an accelerometer we have an air
quality sensor we have in temperature
sensor we have a humidity sensor all of
these different things that we've kind
of packed into this really tiny
form-factor and made really smart and
then turned it into a really simple
application for anybody to use okay I
was gonna ask why I would use this as
opposed to just setting up my webcam
with all of the different free software
out there that's available to snap
pictures of movement and email me but
they also don't monitor or co2 did you
say does that does it change things
bringing out a product and being able to
say like we're a co2 detector like what
kind of regulations are there to that
and what kind of Hoops have you had to
go through to come out with something
like that well I actually just started
with a company so I haven't quite been
involved with the FCC regulations and
all that they go into seee devices but
what I can tell you is
really it's about thinking about home
security in a different way it's about
really giving a way to connect to your
home that you've never had before and
certainly your audience knows all the
gadgets knows all the devices knows all
the tricks and ways to set up IP webcams
and and use these different you know
maybe raspberry pies or things like that
but for a typical 20 or 30 something
who's living in an apartment all their
life they probably never thought about
or maybe we love the the raspberry pies
but sometimes we just want to turn a
plug in a thing and have it do the thing
that's true yeah sometimes it's nice
when my power goes out or when my inner
it goes out is it going to do the thing
so right now it will do the thing and it
will send you an alert saying hey we've
lost power or we've lost internet
connection and then of course it can't
do its thing anymore but it at least
lets you know that the thing that it was
trying to do can't be done anymore and
what is the thing I mean is it going to
text message me is it going to call the
police what is that going to call so
it's totally free you buy the device
it's available for pre-order at $1.99
right now and the idea is you download
our free app there's no monthly fee it
alerts you with a notification and if
you're not there to get the alert you
set up a couple people that you trust
like a family member neighbor friend
girlfriend boyfriend whatever and they
can get the notification as well then if
you want that added security of hey I
had three people not get this
notification you can sign up for a
monthly monthly service where we'll send
the notification to one of our team
members and they'll review it and send
the police call the fire department
respond appropriately to whatever the
situation is okay and so as a hacker
oh why exactly do I want one of these I
mean I think it's always you know one of
the quotes that I really like is Linux
is free only if you consider that your
time is worthless so as you said you
know it's all about getting something
that just plug-and-play super easy
maybe it's the inspiration for another
solution that you build yourself maybe
you add on
hack together extra webcams extra
sensors using our API to build something
different that's what I wanted to know I
I mean I assume iOS and Android apps of
course but if I want to add to this
system or if I want to start hacking at
it what do I do
so we will be building a set of aap eyes
I think right now we're really focused
on creating a great kind of initial
experience for an audience that maybe
isn't that tech-savvy but down the road
we certainly would love for this to talk
to the different devices in your house
be able to work in conjunction with the
other stuff that you already have
awesome Andrew where can I find more
about Canary ww canary is canary is yeah
an area dot is you can fill in the rest
domain name games that we're now playing
yeah you didn't get the dot canary what
is that like a hundred thousand dollars
now probably something like that you
never know
thanks Pat your hope thanks once again
to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
