Equifax is not having a good month and
blue Bourn attacks Bluetooth devices all
billions of them all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for
September 19 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom if you haven't checked
out our patreon yet please do so we have
lots that we want to do for the show but
we can't do it without your support
thank you so so much to all the patrons
that do support us over at patreon.com
slash threat wire that's the place where
you can go to support the show and now
onto some news so first off don't freak
out
this hack does not affect all downloads
of ccleaner and a new version has
already been pushed to users ok my work
here is officially done right all right
maybe not jokes aside if you downloaded
ccleaner between august 15 to September
12 your computer has been compromised by
a supply chain attack that affected p
reforms application
CCleaner was created by p reform which
is a company acquired by Avast Antivirus
ironically and it was built to help
consumers clean up their Windows
computers it deletes temporary files it
deletes cookie files and more random
crap that just takes up space on your
hard drive and it is recommended as a
solid optimization tool now Cisco Telus
found a vulnerability in ccleaner
version 5.3 3.6 162 and C cleaner cloud
version 1.0 70.3 191 for 32-bit Windows
machines which was released on August
15th and continually distributed until
September 12
if you've already downloaded 5.3 for
that version does not have the
vulnerability the malware written
version did have a valid certificate
issued by Symantec for the software
which makes some people think that it
could have been an inside job since it
was legitimately signed the malware
would have been added before signing to
make matters a little bit worse a
compilation artifact was inside the
executable so it was probably
compromised before being compiled it was
hosted directly on the ccleaner download
server
as well now Cisco Talos identified the
vulnerability while working on a beta
testing for their own product
researchers believe this to be a pretty
advanced attack due to the malware
including DGA or domain name generation
algorithms which allow attackers to
predict domains the malware will contact
and then register those in advanced now
the 32-bit version of CCleaner 5.33 had
a malicious payload hidden inside of it
and once it was downloaded the multi
stage payload would steal data from the
infected computer and send it to a
remote server the data collected through
the backdoor was encoded and sent via
HTTP post requests to a hard-coded IP
address it would steal the computer name
a list of installed software and Windows
updates a list of running processes the
IP and MAC address and whether it was
running with admin privileges and if
it's a 64-bit system at time of
recording it is not known what the
collected data would be used for but
Talos created a black hole by
registering any domains associated with
them hours so that the malware could not
reestablish connections in the future
from victim computers and as such the
second stage of the payload was never
run by the attackers now piriform
estimates to point to seven million
people were affected and users should
update to version 5.3 for the ccleaner
cloud version auto-updates
and a new version of it is already
available as well and BTW the version of
CCleaner is the free version not the pro
version in total those ccleaner is used
by two billion people worldwide
alternatively you could also use the
open-source bleach bit for cleaning up
crap files on your machine now this is
not the first time we have heard of a
supply chain attack happening to popular
software this is exactly how the not
Petya ransomware was distributed and it
does seem much more common this year
than usual and I also wanted to mention
props to deci matrix on patron for
sending in this story really appreciated
as a follow-up to our story last week on
the Equifax hack we now know what caused
it in the first place so it turns out
that an Apache struts framework flaw
that was patched over two months prior
to the timing of the incident was the
culprit in the Equifax hack so this
vulnerability was CVE number two
17:56 38 was fixed way back on March 6th
by Apache but it was not implemented by
Equifax at that time the framework is
used to develop web apps in Java for
front-end and back-end web servers and
it is used by a lot of different
companies now on a slight tangent Cisco
is also starting an investigation into
their own products due to the recent
vulnerabilities not just this one that
also affect Apache struts equifax posted
this news on a September 15th update via
Equifax security 2017 dot-com on that
website now alongside this more came to
light about the 200,000 or so credit
card details that were also stolen
apparently these were sniped via the
same Apache struts framework attack and
covered transactions made on Equifax a
site from November 10th 2016 all the way
to July 6 2017 Visa and MasterCard
published notifications to affected
banks in their networks and according to
PCI standard security council any credit
card data that is stored must be
encrypted so either attackers were able
to decrypt stored data or it was held in
clear plain text the data stolen
included credit card numbers expiration
dates and cardholder names in the
meantime oh yes it is not over more
investigations are happening to Equifax
the FTC warned consumers about scammers
calling and pretending to be Equifax
employees and asking to verify
personally identifying information the
office of the Privacy Commissioner or
OPC of Canada is launching an
investigation into Equifax as well since
some of the data lost affected Canadians
at time of writing Equifax plan to
notify impacted Canadians in writing now
the Justice Department is also launching
an inside trading investigation aiming
at the three top officials at Equifax
that sold stock right after the company
discovered the breach so those people
include Equifax CFO John gamble the
president of the us information
solutions who is Joseph Lo Rand and
president of workforce solutions Rodolfo
plaughter now while these three are
still at the company the CIO and the CSO
the
chief security officer are retiring
Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts also introduced two new
bills to Congress in response to the
hack one is to let consumers freeze
their credit free of charge and another
is to ban employers from using credit
reports to decide whom to hire now with
all of this currently brewing it sounds
like the storm is far from over so we
will continue to report on it as more
news comes out patrons remember to link
me to your favorite stories during the
week via our patreon community tab this
one is from Joe and Michael so thank you
to both of you for posting this on the
community tab if you subscribe to our
shows you already know this but in case
you are new just turn off Bluetooth
right now just turn it off and keep it
off unless you absolutely need it but
then turn it off after using it so
security firm Armas announced a new
vulnerability called blue born which
allows for Bluetooth devices to be
attacked remotely through
implementations of Bluetooth on
different software and operating systems
including Windows Android Linux in iOS
the blue born vulnerability was patched
in iOS 10 in 2016
Microsoft in July and Google devices
running OS as older than marshmallow are
currently vulnerable
lastly Linux is currently working on
fixes for their devices and their
software as well so blue born also
affects Internet of Things devices that
require Bluetooth to work and that
includes Smart TVs light bulb speakers a
sector etc in total eight
vulnerabilities across different kinds
of platforms include Blu born
vulnerabilities in them so Blu born will
scan for nearby devices that have
Bluetooth turned on and check to see if
they are vulnerable the hack takes about
10 seconds and it's flexible depending
on the system devices actually running a
victim would not need to connect to the
attackers device and even if bluetooth
is already paired to something else
Blu born will still attack allowing an
attacker to gain control over the device
and also snoop on data it also has the
ability to spread from one infected
device to another to jump from one
device to another Blu born uses
Bluetooth 5's Bluetooth mesh capability
an attacker would also need to be within
range of Bluetooth so probably 33 feet
or so would be
distance if patches are available for
your Bluetooth enabled device make sure
to patch immediately thank you to all of
the wonderful fun amazin people out
there who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow the show and in
return you will get extras a bunch of
extras over on patreon.com slash threat
wire which include an audio RSS feed for
baby pictures little extras from me and
tons of other stuff we might even
feature your fur baby like these ones in
an upcoming episode check out the perk
levels on patreon and thank you again
