this time on pineapple University
hello and welcome ma'am darren kitchen
still here in little box doing some
videos on some awesome tools for the
Wi-Fi pineapple today we're taking a
look at whistle masters SSL strip
infusion which implements Moxie
Marlinspike awesome SSL strip utility
which if you're not aware of is pretty
fantastic in the realm of allowing you
to find credentials and other such post
data on HTTP sites so what does all that
mean well basically I have two machines
set up right here the one on the left is
my virtual machine running Kali Linux
that's directly connected to my Wi-Fi
pineapple and then I also have this
boring Windows box over here and the
boring Windows box is over at we're
going to use facebook.com/ as an example
and I'm at the same website over here on
the linux box but you'll notice that
there's a key difference in that is that
if I take a look at the address bar I'm
actually at HTTP colon slash slash
facebook.com whereas on my client to the
Wi-Fi pineapple I'm just at WWF
facebook.com so why is that
well that's because if I come back over
to my browser and take a look I'm using
the SSL strip in fusion by whistle
master you can grab these from the Wi-Fi
pineapple bar it's pretty quick
over-the-air download and then you
should be able to get up and running and
it's really simple to use
all you do is open it up and it's start
I've already done that and on my client
now when I go to say log into a website
with the username dead be coffee at
whatever that whatever I don't know
that's a new TLD and my lamp ass word
and go ahead and hit login now I don't
want to remember that well notice that
over here I actually see dead beef
coffee at whatever dot whatever and my
password is lame password so this is
pretty simple now now we can stop this
we can save this we've got a history
where we can actually
you and download the different
credentials that we've captured
throughout the times and it's a very
simple tool that literally just strips
HTTP s out it strips SSL that's a very
aptly named utility it does a lot to
hopefully trick the user into thinking
that they're actually a secure website
like for example the fav icon you'll
notice in the top right right at the top
left of this VM right here it's actually
a lock icon even though it's not
actually secure and so that's pretty
much how it works there's of course
technology that thwarts this like HSTs
and you know it's a cat and mouse game
like anything else and we're going to
see some interesting developments as
this continues but right now pretty much
just download SSL strip click go and
Bob's your uncle so if you guys have any
other questions or if you'd like to see
us cover other things in the future on
pineapple university let us know in the
comments and I will see you guys on the
intro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
