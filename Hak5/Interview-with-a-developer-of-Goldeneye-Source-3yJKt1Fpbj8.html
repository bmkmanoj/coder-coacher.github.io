game developer that's working on the
wildly popular goldeneye source
half-life conversion now goldeneye 007
has a place in many gamers heart since
its original release in 1997 on the n64
Erin thank you for coming what can you
tell us about the golden eyes source
gold my source is like you said total
conversion for half-life 2 our goal is
to recreate every aspect of the original
nintendo 64 version and how did you get
involved in this project someone
mentioned about mentioned it on some
forms and did a little research on it
seemed great became part of the
community and posted some of my own work
and I actually pick me up as a team
member and what do you do what role do
to play in the game development I'm a
modeler and I make anything from weapons
to props to map objects and what kind of
experience do you have with modeling
what's your background they started
modeling Court recently I started
messing 3d studio max and just picked it
up and if you ever worked with game
development before other any other mods
a little bit of experience before I had
worked on a battlefield 1942 mod called
galactic conquest ok and how do you guys
collaborate with this mods install
online I assume right communications a
little bit limited but we do have IRC
and the forms and we do have teamspeak
dev member sessions and we could quite a
bit done so what's it like developing a
game online rather than the traditional
sense like I said communications a
little bit more limited we don't have
the benefit of being an office together
things like that but I think we managed
now there's been some other mods that
have had a commercial success most
notably counter-strike or day of defeat
is this something that you're pursuing
professionally professionally I don't
think is something i want to take
anywhere but it is a side thing i think
it's great and I really enjoyed doing it
but there are definitely are people in
the model community who want to take
this to the next level and become game
developers so what would you say to any
aspiring game developers just find a
program and comfortable working with and
practice makes perfect just just takes
time really you'll get the hang of it
okay and as for a golden eye sores one
can we expect to see a playable version
of this right now we're pushing for a
Christmas release beta release for the
public and it's going to include a few
maps some weapons and character models
what do you guys plan to include like
the final release I mean can we cease
with some of the more fun features of
double-oh-seven like that the paint
balls slapping us big heads all that
stuff is going to be in there it's just
going to be a ball play awesome now you
are able to pull some strings you've got
with you hear some exclusive game
footage right talk to a few people put
together some game footage and great so
let's take a look what are we seeing
right here we got here is a brief run
around of the back so no facility just
to give it a there is an idea of what
we're trying to accomplish and what
we're working on now it looks like with
the hafla 2 engine the increased
textures and everything it's really
making this game vivid and pop but at
the same time it looks like it's pretty
much staying true to the original
facility as far as I can remember it
yeah we're keeping it representing the
original and every aspect I mean it's no
different and this of course is just
Egyptian I'm sure a lot of people will
recognize this already Egyptians one of
our pretty much finished up maps it
looks like you take and you know put
your own creative flavor in here with
that little pond of water yeah the pond
rapper added it we you know we felt the
the original goldeneye engine couldn't
give enough life to the to the map so we
figured we'd add our own little things
and help it along give it more life yeah
definitely bringing out of the old 1997
technology and enabling you guys to make
it has def game that I love my flat yeah
so Wow in this lighting is it absolutely
gorgeous yeah athlete to really the
engine really enables us to give it a
lot more life and feeling than
previously possible and it's great yeah
it's going to be some great multiplayer
Aaron that looks amazing thank you so
much for coming on thank you for the
exclusive footage where can anybody find
more information
about goldeneye source I'm going to find
out more go ahead and head over to WWE
my source com we some very active forms
and new contents actually posted quite
frequently great well we are looking
forward to the playable demo definitely
