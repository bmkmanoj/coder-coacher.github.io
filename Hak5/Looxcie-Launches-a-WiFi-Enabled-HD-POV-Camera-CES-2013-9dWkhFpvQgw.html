go further Brack 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 with jay mohr at look
see how are you Jay I'm doing great
pleasure to talk to you today you know I
must admit I'm a huge fan of POV cameras
in general and I did try out the look
see because I'm sorry this is probably
your spiel but I will tell the audience
guys
I love POV cameras I love like you know
anything that you can strap to a
motorcycle helmet and do some video
blogging and things of that nature and
the look see one really cool cuz
bluetooth on your phone you can see what
you're looking at Clips your ear like
Turk turn to the left
isn't that neat yeah standard definition
I can't tell you man I actually came
over because I saw the booth and I'm
like dude I got it I got a grief you for
a bit for being all standard-def what's
going on well so we've got a couple of
great things going on standard
definition works great for people who
want to conserve bandwidth so we've
always had that capability but we wanted
to give our consumers a little bit more
so we've got our brand-new
high-definition product 1080p 60 frames
per second it's got great features like
a user removable battery use a removable
SD card and you put a little rubber
gasket on the back and it's duct hold
down to a foot so you get it weight
great thing about it records Full 1080p
and all its glorious color and detail it
also streams so everything that we do is
streams live to the internet streams
live to your Facebook account so does it
stream via bluetooth Wi-Fi and and how
does it get to the Internet
sure so the LX 2 is a bluetooth device
so it connects bluetooth to a Android
thingy or an iOS thingy and then uses 3G
4G or Wi-Fi out to the Internet the Alex
HD connects via Wi-Fi to your iOS or
Android thingy uh tablets phones
whatever if it runs the operating system
it works so you get much better frame
rate you do 60 frames per second
and then it uses 3G 4G or Wi-Fi back out
so you can get a big pipe with the HD so
tell me what's the battery life on this
guy like better rely upon this for full
streaming is about two hours which is
about equal to any of the other point of
view cameras if you're doing continuous
recording but unlike others their user
removable battery means that you can add
more plus it's got a little micro SD
connection on the back which means you
could use any one of the USB external
batteries that you could wear on your
belt you can record in real time while
that battery is connected and as far as
the recording onto the card you put 32
gig SD card on there record for hours
and hours hours and hours at full 1080p
it's about eight hours and you can
always replace it so tell me about this
one of the really novel features of the
first look see or the look see that
you're wearing right now what's the idea
that you could set it on a continuous
loop and then press a button to say hey
something that's happened in the last
five minutes was cool let's keep that so
our instant replay mode we've got the
continuous buffer if you're in that mode
there's a little button right on the
bottom here you press it and you get the
last 30 seconds of whatever was recorded
into a clip so your highlight reel of
the goals scored at a football game
that's special moment with your children
or the messed up that your friends did
where they fell off the roof because
when your friends are drinking and
they're playing with ladders on the roof
you really need to be wearing one of
these
record that forever so tell me about the
unit that I'm wearing right now sure
that is our new unit it's the tough
model it's a part of our enterprise
solution that we're announcing today
it's a new brand called Vincey by
looksie and that unit fits on a variety
of different accessories like fancy
safety glasses it's designed for
industrial use the product is connected
to a tower full shift battery for say
police work or on the factory floor
or in industrial solutions the cameras
also ruggedized and it's designed for
low-light conditions a little more than
100 lumens so you could be that night
with a squad car and be able to get the
video you need for being used out in the
field we've partnered with taser and
it's being used by local and state
police forces nationwide right now so
that's great I'm an officer I've pulled
someone over for swerving or whatever
and rather than just my dash camera you
know this whether it's mounted on my my
glasses or save my you know epaulets or
well and then I'm wearing like a
backpack or a belt pack or something
there's a little battery that fits on
your belt a little wire that goes up
it's a full shift thing and more
importantly it can connect to the
internet afterwards I know that taser
has their evidence calm peace connection
and uploads all the video to evidence
calm for use in litigation that is
really cool how do I get my hands on one
of these ah you go to vid c-calm VI DCI
e calm or Luke C calm lwx CI e and we
can hook you up so what are these what
are these running what's the price point
and the availability of the HD HD is
available nationwide right now at Amazon
Adorama being H photo the Luke C website
itself and will be available in Europe
starting in two weeks at Apple stores
and Apple online it'll also the L x2 is
available all of those plus at Verizon
stores nationally awesome thanks so much
I really appreciate it thank you
we continued coverage of all things C as
2013 be sure to head over to
revision3.com
I'm here at the Ford booth at CES 2013
with Edie how are you doing at Erin
house young and we're checking out the
TDK what is a PDK I'm just do an SDK
we're ready to decay TDK is a technology
development kit that developers can get
for you no app link enabling their apps
instead of you know buying a vehicle or
if they already have one they can use an
existing one so this is a TDK you
basically have all the same interfaces
as you would a normal vehicle you got
the screen you got a center stack with
all the different buttons preset bond
scored back as well as some car
simulation toggles so you can turn the
car off open doors set it to go forward
and reverse have it parked or not park
so what kind of partners have you guys
teamed up with to enable apps to come to
port right so I mean everybody knows you
know a lot of the music streaming apps
like Pandora radio slacker and PR we
also did some navigation base F scout
from TeleNav we have our own sink
destinations and I'll be at bat a whole
slew of more coming out you know every
every few months awesome working our
hackers find a developer network to
start from coding up some awesome stuff
is pretty easy just like everything else
developer for comm there we go alright
and with all of that I want to thank
once again fords for powering our CES
