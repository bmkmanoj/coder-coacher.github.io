Coast here we are in Washington DC for
our favorite hacker con bitch shmoocon
seven years now do you believe it and
we're having such a blast this is the
hacker con where you see the brightest
minds in our community and we had the
pleasure of speaking to so many of them
this week so we thought you know we had
so many last week we had so many this
week it's just ah such good stuff I hope
you guys really enjoy it I will see you
guys on the other side
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by the ben heck show building modding
and electronics culture brought to you
exclusively by element14 go to assist
express support smarter with go to
assist express and domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com what exactly would you
do to my phone to turn it into a zombie
on your botnet well most likely it would
actually what would you do oh what I do
you as the user would download an
application that has a built-in
vulnerability that can be exploited or
takes advantage of something in the
operating system same way with the PCA
it's up to get a lot of the same attack
vectors a lot of what you see is client
side and that would be the main attack
vector for any sort of malware on the
phone as well right is really the sea so
much more client side than like a remote
exploit on Android how do you just put
something in the marketplace put it in
the marketplace or outside of the
marketplace um there's been applications
in the past where as I we can't put this
on the marketplace because it's so
awesome download it and install it
directly as root and then you don't even
have to do any exploitation it's all
about fooling the user into thinking
this is worth the risk right I mean you
don't really get a whole lot of warning
either when you install an application
on Android it just tells you oh it wants
to be able to use your phone what's
available you open your contacts and
when you're talking about exploitation
though I could make an application that
doesn't say I need to use SMS or I need
to use your phone and then once it takes
advantage of a vulnerability and
exploits and then has root it it doesn't
make an API call it works in the base OS
so you wouldn't know that i was using
SMS at all so even though security
functionalities wouldn't apply well what
if I hadn't rooted my phone I mean it
granted if you got it into the
marketplace and it's not like an apk
that you would download separately so
you don't have to like tell them oh go
into you know enable debug motor or
enable third-party sources but what if
I'm just a regular Joe user I don't have
a rooted phone I get your application
from the marketplace is a game over well
if your throne has a
owner ability locally than yes like for
instance the sin page colonel
exploitation was actually 2009 but
people still haven't upgraded and that
worked on Android as well full versions
i believe it was 2.9 and below 2.9 yeah
cheap i think what a 2.2 is froyo 2.3 is
thinking that european group okay yeah
but but is so even modern versions
though like yeah it's sad though because
so many carriers don't upgrade I mean
I'm stuck on it Claire because Samsung
won't get around it exactly it broke it
doesn't upgrade very quickly so even if
a security patches put out a lot of you
just won't get it immediately so there's
a large window of opportunity there if
something is found alright so once
you've got it on the phone and it uses
an exploit like you were talking about
what are you talking about the base
layer of the phone I don't get that
because wouldn't I you know detect oh
hey it's accessing my contacts or doing
whatever it's doing right now all that's
based on the Java API calls in your user
space stack but underneath there's on
Android anyway it's really just Linux
down there kind of dumb down and iPhone
mac OS is down there and there's windows
mobiles the windows platform it also
makes it really easy for malware writers
to move into the realm of smartphones
because it's very similar to what
they've been doing on PC just program it
and see and compile it with an arm
compiler and you can do all the same
things so if you have a gsm modem that
you can take advantage of so it's just
extra functionality with less security
and okc well yeah but it's like totally
different though because it's you know
like it's mobile it's like not in more
mobile than like on the scale of like a
laptop because this guy is always on
right exactly it's always on and you can
think of a smartphone it's like a server
public IP no firewall no filtering
security of 15 years ago your phone
number is basically a public IP that
anybody can access through the GSM modem
like friends yeah give it up now yeah it
would go to spam if spam filtering has
gotten pretty good but if I send you a
spam text message with the link that
says here go download this you're going
to receive that message just up to you
whether you click on it but you receive
every message
yeah so it's a big weight it's like BAM
well it's like email in the sense that
you know you don't have to sound like
you know if we were Facebook friends you
know you could only message me if we
were friends on Facebook email is like
an open system you're right the phone
system is based on an inherent trust
that you only give your phone number to
people you know otherwise why would they
be calling you I mean eventually is
sometimes you get that like oh sorry
wrong number right but I mean aside from
that nobody calls you that doesn't know
you yeah I mean numbers are possible to
be gotten okay you put your phone number
in when you go to a website and sign up
for the or view there's anything so are
you saying that you use the phone number
as your method of controlling your
zombies on your botnet actually I do
have the phone numbers of all those
zombies the master would but none of the
other zombies know any numbers it's all
different cryptography a public/private
key system because if I single zombie is
compromised by a security researcher
yeah I wouldn't want them to be able to
find out anything else about the botnet
so no numbers are stored okay well how
do you communicate with the zombies 3r
SMS well then I would I just you know
notice that I have you know a text
message saying turn on camera locate gps
i mean i'm assuming those are the kind
of the functions that not at all you
would not see those messages because i
have my botnet program sitting in the
base OS level it works as a proxy
between the GSM modem and the
application layer and sees all the GSM
traffic that goes through and it's just
able to authenticate messages as part of
the botnet this is about net instruction
it's from a ballad master and then it
just swallows the message does the
functionality the user never sees it if
it's a regular text message or a phone
call or anything it just goes straight
on through so the user won't notice
anything is up how do you filter the
text messages before they come through
it just sits at the proxy basically it's
it's we have the modem I have pictures
of my talk and then there's the serial
line that connects to this user space
and I just stick a little proxy layer in
here
so when the message comes in it hits me
first uh-huh I'm like what is this and
send it up if it's not mine and grab it
and not send it up if it is and tell the
modem it was received and everybody
think morning's fine aren't there text
messages that are like that anywhere
that carriers uses there was a big talk
about that how about black had to go
where you know there was like the they
would show up on your iPhone is like a
couple of squares or something where is
exploiting forget the name of them but
they're basically SMS messages used for
control right that the carrier uses
rather than for you know hey what's up
it goes to a local port on the phone
that tells the phone what to do ya
canary sauce those yes it's a very
similar method what I'm trying to do one
of those called I believe something
about important they're like a whole
mess yeah their control messages but
they go to a port on the phone yeah I
looked so do you use those would you
just send it in a regular sm I just send
it in a regular SMS so do you just send
the commands from your phone for many I
well you um well I mean you got your
phone right now you'd want to be a
little sneak here right prepaid Sims
stealing phones google voice skype a
modem gsm modem hooked up to a computer
possibilities really illness if you can
visit your freaking this is totally
focused it is we've gone full circle
because there are estimated to be 2
billion cell phones in the world by 2012
and that's a lot everybody's gonna have
one yeah and they're getting more
powerful every day it's always on and
toys on you and it has so many
capabilities like what are some of the
capabilities of your botnet well what
i'm actually going to be demoing is i'm
going to send spam messages it can also
do details but really like to show that
because yeah it's a deed ossicle they
only has one nail has one purpose and
malicious yeah that's not as fun to show
it's more interesting to show it's more
interesting for the crowd to see the
spam but what i'm actually going to do
is one of the master phone and slave
phone and some random phone that's going
to receive the message from the master i
right to the slave send a message
and killing it to send spam nothing
shows up on the slave phone because it
the proxy grabs it but then even when it
sends out the spam it doesn't show up in
their sent box or anything out it's all
done from although all of that and then
it will show up on the other phone
that's just you know there but it'll be
received from the slave phone I put them
all in the address books together so it
will say weeks late button master but so
the other like underlying features of
the phones because you're talking about
you know Android and specific with this
all android phones at least most have
cameras you know all phones have
microphones all your most phones
nowadays of Bluetooth and GPS well the
code I'm releasing is going to be under
GPL and I've taken all the payloads out
so but people can make their own so if
that's something you want to do turn on
the microphone turn on the camera those
would definitely be within scope of what
I've done you just need to hook up the
API call in the payload that's crazy to
think that it's not something where it's
like oh you've got to you know burn this
custom rom it's just an application that
takes advantage of a vulnerability so
maybe the vector of attack is is you
know much wider than you know i don't
know may i'm just always a little
paranoid about you know and I know
cyanogen must be a great guy but you
know some of those you see them on the
XDA forums and stuff Oh check out this
rom image yeah when you install a rom
image I know someone from some from
someone right someone if you download
their rom image after tomorrow could
have my botnet code are you in it yeah
and then they could be using your phone
to send SMS spam yep straight up just
like that nice never know about it no
what about other platform this is my man
right now well I I had an android so
that was what I worked on and but since
I started getting some press about this
I now have three android phones so
someone gives me an iphone I've written
the iphone code that i haven't tested it
because it doesn't have the same
emulator kind of things and it's hard to
emulate with the GSM modem
anyways because the emulators don't hook
up differently they're not a real modem
so if I get an iphone I will test my
iphone code and release it but the same
thing will work for windows mobile
platforms and iphone well just what are
you saying like the underlying the
principle of it just the principle of
using the proxy and grabbing messages
that will work i have tested it that
much that i know that it will work it's
just writing the code the naming scheme
is a little different on each platform
and then decode it a little differently
but what about the carriers isn't there
something that they can do to like Fort
this you know can they say oh well all
of the you know all of the spam that are
coming from these zombified phones out
of the same SMS header and we're just
going to block that at the source or
something right well the SMS headers
will actually look the same as any other
message so as they do that they could
indeed crackdown and whatever they want
it that's a lot of on the flip side it's
only the carrier's you can see these
messages it's not like I pee where you
know you put blogging on your firewall
and then all the packages coming in and
out what is it there something that you
might be able to like is there not
software for android that will allow you
to see like you know what's going on
under the hood in that regard like you
know a packet sniffer of some sort I
mean I've always thought you know
there's all of these applications they
get and you just say I agree whatever
when you install them and they could be
phoning home and then some have been
discovered to have been right I talk
about that as well but um that is
something I talk about for mitigations
it something a small trip wire at the
base OS level because the phone could
just say you don't need to be doing that
because you're in user is a lot of them
don't aren't going to be fooling around
and that's not everybody roosts it so if
it sees a change in the OS leave a red
flag there something's up and alert
someone so that would be one way also
you know the carrier's would need to be
in on na takedown of cell phone ball
nets over gsm because they're the only
ones seeing it so could you could you
spread the worm by SMS somehow could you
send like payloads
yes um one way the SMS spam put a link
in it hey click on this class I'm like a
regular contact lee and also there have
been examples of remote exploits that
let's root iphone the iCub de was one
that was a so it happens yeah an
especially when you're sending it from
someone else's phone it does it does the
SMS message show up as from their phone
number yes well then you know already
have errant trust right so if you have
it send to say everyone in the contact
list then though yo I just found the
coolest game its exact that it's like
Tetris put on crack you gotta try it so
it's likely they will then click on it
and it's the same as pcs there a lot
this is like a macro spam from the 90s
exactly it is or it's like securities
gone back to the old days because now we
have blown that just like the old server
yeah firewalls no filters we don't have
any of the technology for it yet it's
coming into it though and everybody's
using it it's like a computer now yeah
we just aren't in the same level with
security we don't have as much
experience with it and new technologies
with the GSM so hopefully my talk
tomorrow will help get some more
conversations started on that yeah
that's absolutely my body just it makes
me so happy as you know somebody who
grew up with like the red boxes in the
beige box and stuff to see it come
around again you know freaking having a
resurgence just because our phones are
getting so sophisticated but it really
is hacking it's just you know whatever
the device may be and that's just so
cool where do you see it going next with
the botnet stuff I'm you're just doing
this as proof of concept right I'm doing
this is proof of concept hopefully to
get people thinking about if I can do
this bad guys can do it too and can you
write something that would mitigate this
could you write a piece of software for
android that would check to make sure
that you haven't been owned yes I could
write something very similar you know
use the code that does the attacking to
do the defending the attacker can watch
the defender can watch too so yes I
could write something that you get this
particular attack but
as that gets mitigated a new attack you
know that's how it goes okay so is this
is it's open source it is yes I'm
releasing it under GPL tomorrow where
can people get their hands on it they
can get it at my website it's a
germany's trm noobs with zeros and
others com ajaan putting that out
tomorrow my talk is it noon so it'll be
up I think right before then I right
after very very cool thank you so much
for coming here is it as you guys know
there are a variety of tools on the
market that will allow you to do remote
assistance on another person's computer
the only one that I rely on is go to
assist Express brought to you by Citrix
the reason well the exceptional
performance the ease of use and the
security there's no I T maintenance or
updating required it's fast you'll be
viewing your clients computer and
troubleshooting just seconds plus it
supports clients computers even when
they're away from their desk you can try
go to assist express free for 30 days
for this special offer you must visit go
to assist calm / hak5 again that's go to
assist calm / hak5 or a free trial for
those that are not familiar with katana
can you tell me a little bit of
background about it I can it's a
multiboot tool so basically you put a
bunch of different distros and you can
boot during a once you've actually
loaded the USB plug in USB boot from one
of 10 possibly or 12 or it's a lot more
now very many options for different
distros and that's one side and that's
the side people seem to focus on a lot
but there's actually another side of a
bunch of Windows tools I've probably
about 300 ish windows tools on there so
you basically pop in your thumb drive
and you can load them automatically
without installation so that gets really
fun for a quick stuff on on any PC what
are some of the tools that you have on
there I have the basic stuff like unison
Firefox and openoffice for whatever but
I have a lot of other tools i finally
got metasploit working on the USB Drive
I hadn't seen that anywhere else before
and it's a little bit of a pain to get
working but it it does work on this you
can load metasploit into you know
whatever computer on and then take that
route little slower but no other than
recently putting meadows
wait on there what else is new with
katana since we did our segment on it
yeah the biggest thing that I've added
is actually a new F of application
called Forge which allows you to add new
distros like it with a point-and-click
interface before forum I know I know
before there's the forum and there were
like 12 posts and this is the correction
for this new version it was a big pain
and you had to manually do a lot right
yeah and nobody was happy I wasn't happy
because I had to go back when i was
updating it and do them like this is not
right so i decided to try to write some
bash scripts to automate the process so
what it is it's like a front in for a
bunch of bash scripts oh you you you
know download the ISO image and you
click you know this is the version I
want to install this is the image
through my drive is and go and then you
know you wait for a couple minutes and
then poof it's on there so the next time
we load it up you've got you know
whatever new destroy your easy portable
X yes yes how did you get started well
actually I I had you know I'm sure
everybody has is you have the case of
bootable whatever oh yeah everybody got
that kiss and disks and disk yes tries
anyway you have that yeah exactly the
yeah when you guys talked about it is
the flash drives and disks and so you
know you learn them out to people or you
have this case in this case it's the one
for work and some one for home and ray
comes a big pain yeah so I got tired of
losing the one that I wanted so I was
like how can I get this all on a flash
drive it to make it easy and the first
way I did I released a beta and you know
it's the kind of thing I did it all
wrong it worked but it was always all
wrong all right know it you had to
manually change a lot of stuff like in
order to Boonton to the other one you
had to boot into whatever one was
default change some file configurations
and then reboot into whatever when
wanted wanted so it's a big pain it was
really a big pain so I'd to figure out
how to change that around a bit so this
makes it quite a bit easier yes a lot of
long easier did you have any like
inspirations for when you created katana
it was mostly just to save myself some
time understandable to get the multiboot
now I hadn't really seen anything to get
it working on one partition was the big
thing for me because I hate having that
wasted space because you know when you
have your windows and linux partition on
there you've got all this you know you
have to partition it out and you've got
the space you're not sure where you
going to use later on right and I didn't
want to have that was an easy way out
was just a partition you know but
you're gonna have 12 distros on there
you have 12 little partitions on your
flash drive and that's kind of
cumbersome yes so having one flash drive
you know all the space you need and
everything on there running live or
however you want it was a lot easier you
know keep it in your pocket you've got
your all-in-one suite of tools did you
use any other like multi boot boot
security suite type things or is this
the only one this is the only one there
are other ones out there this is the
only one I've seen for USB so there were
a couple people who had packaged them
together to boot from like a DVD or CD
but I really wanted a dynamic
environment what do you even use as DVDs
anymore yeah what's you we all moved the
blu-ray right everything I have is a
blu-ray oh wait yeah I don't have money
for that kind of back I don't either but
I really wanted to be a dynamic
environment and that's one thing that
I'm still trying to push the people is
that you can configure it on the fly
where's the CD you know you okay maybe
you create new image you burn it you
have your cool new tools but then you
know the Sunnis you get an update you
know you have to reburn everything yeah
so this option you can just update all
your tools however you want and it's
dynamic if it's there and you know you
know the new version the backtrack comes
up just plop it on that you're good to
go it just takes however long it is to
extract the yeah so do you have any
future goals for your project well I
have as I mentioned the the installation
stuff is for linux only right now cuz
I'm pretty good with bash scripting but
batch and the windows environment is not
quite as easy to work with and you know
even talk to some people trying to
figure out how to get thats why
everybody uses yeah every of course
everybody all the viewers use linux and
our masters of linux oh yeah so it's a
bit of a pain including me yeah just
kidding so I'm trying to convert it over
to the windows side because it you know
to automate the installation of stuff on
Windows would obviously be a big benefit
to yeah a lot that's good for me because
that's all I use is windows really i'm
not a huge linux user so so you can
install katana and whatever just the
United States you kind of but the other
options like boot into one of the
Disco's and then install additional ones
there it's like in to backtrack and then
use it that way but yeah more windows
side stuff ok I'm going to try to get a
bigger tool base for the it's called
them the katana toolkit is the windows
application that will launch all that
stuff so so that kind of works into my
next question like where do you see
tana going in the next couple of years I
really did want it to be an all-in-one
portable kind of you know doing pen
testing and stuff you can just get a
computer somebody gives you a computer
you've never touched it before you have
your thumb drive and you go from there
so it's not like I'm writing lots of
tools I'm trying to gather the tools to
make it into what however I can get a
portable environment together and then
just hand it off to you and you can
configure you can say you know oh I
don't want all the forensic stuff or I
don't need all the pin tests and stuff I
really want to make it as dynamic as
possible so though you think it isn't
working in to this day yeah yeah takes
put in quite a few hours yeah every
distro and then like the new version of
a bunch of comes up and the way I had to
install it before design it all sounds
like a refrain every and then different
distro switch from different Ino like
the new version backtrack switch from
sloshing bun too so you know having to
swim all that up so it does yeah well
those upgrades I know every day this
neighborhood oh no go fix it have to go
change yep yeah so this um open source
can our viewers work on it at all uh
it's it's weird to say because I'm
mostly using stuff from other people the
biggest help i need is if anybody's got
a distro out there that they want to
meet for me to add I'm get in contact
and I can you know help them so that we
can automate the installation things
like that or suggestions for tools
portable tools to put on there or but as
far as like coding is concerned there's
mostly stealing most of these things you
know I really I'm just packaging them
together stealing them I'm not taking
credit for the ideas like I I put
firefox on there i made Firefox no you
know I'm just packaging stuff together
but yeah yeah especially the distro some
people out there want to help with that
well be well if they want to help where
can they find you where can they find
katana it's that hack from a cave calm
and that's the best place to go and get
touched me through there and there's a
forum and all that good stuff sweet
anything else you want to mention um no
nothing you don't know what happened
yeah yeah trust your technol is all
right thanks man thanks for coming on
thank you
running your own server doesn't have to
cost a fortune domain.com virtual
private servers start at just 3495 a
month and include all of the tools that
you need to manage any size website in
fact our own site hak5 org is running on
one nail take charge with cpanel plesk
or even SSH in with root access as a
hack five view where you can get fifteen
percent off your order at checkout when
you use coupon code hak5 got a great
idea it all starts with a great domain
domain com so Joe Fox News tells me that
we are the internet is over where you've
come to the end of the internet as it is
right I thought I saw that cartoon about
ten years ago yeah I've clicked through
the internet all now at the end actually
we topic for another conversation but I
know someone that just did the entire IP
for Internet well let's not that's what
that's why we're talking about right
your your big proponent of ip6 obviously
rockin the colon colon 1 the 127 da 020
that one equivalent if you will yes it
is fox news right are we is the internet
/ mol we have is there's specific
authorities for addresses I n is the
root Authority for address allocation if
you're an international company if you
need big address space that's where you
would get it so if you're setting up a
large server farm that all has to be
exposed to the Internet if you set up a
you know a new cell phone network or
whatever you have to get these large
large addresses yeah the problem right
now is we're four days away based on
when you see this we're four days away
from iono having any additional dresses
so the impact from a security
perspective is that we should end up
seeing a lot of people are not qualified
trying to implement ipv6 networks which
are going to leave big vulnerabilities
open because all they do is a turn it on
and don't they're not aware that their
firewalls are wrong their ids is are
wrong their management tools are wrong
so there's a real impact on the security
of a lot of operations if they're not
extremely careful during that deployment
phase so a lot of these
the equipment out you know the old
apartment doesn't even support this
stuff or order let just let the IP 6
traffic go through like doesn't care
yeah there's a specific vendors out
there that say that they support ipv6
products unfortunately all that means is
they've allowed protocol 41 through but
then doing a real filter any
manipulation it's kind of like saying we
support web there's actually there's
actually the ipv6 Task Force has put
together a set of links that talk about
ipv6 ready devices and they've been a
third-party tested so you can see what
versions of the operating systems router
switches software truly supports ipv6
voice over IP as an example allow the
proximal support ipv6 so if you're
expecting to use that to do end-to-end
for your organization when we would like
sit bones and such so there's a lot of
implications of this but from the
running out of address standpoint we
have the security problem now we've only
run out of it from the Vienna at this
point we also know there's there's more
than just I way there's there's our IPA
there's like all of the or am I get
those are all using those are called
rirs okay those are regionals all the
different countries have their own rir
right and each of them have their burn
rate that they're going through some
burn rates as an example we're expecting
september-october in the North America
to be out of addresses so you're saying
that it could be potentially like North
America runs out of addresses but
there's some like island nation that
totally has addresses and is making bank
off of them right actually Africa is an
example okay it has a slow burn right
now of addresses so well so people just
start buying IP addresses from Africa
well that actually messes up the routing
tables even worse as we have more larger
address space res we have larger address
spaces and we break it down the smaller
the core routers to have to route this
information those routing tables become
larger and larger so we could be talking
10 gig 15 mm
Murray gig 20 gig with routers and
that's just have to keep the memories of
the no makes it very difficult to keep
in memory so route ability is
potentially a problem probably not do
the same thing with IP 6 is there not
like Oh anything starting with you know
this hex is you know this continent and
then the next tax this country or
whatever is the same kind of like you
know where even like where we can
identify something by you know the IP
address can kind of geo-located to the
area maybe the city ish that was just
that was actually something that
occurred only within the last 10 years
prior and address can be allocated any
place in the world really yes so yeah so
now the cable companies use that like
ESPN has like some service or during the
Olympics there were you know different
traditional television carriers that
would like broadcast their stuff online
but only if you're in the US and that
they know you're in the u.s. because of
your IP address right of course we were
just you know setup proxies or whatever
you will but is that that well you know
how hackers are but woodham does that
apply type 26 uh actually the same
things apply it's just not as many
proxies out there for ipv6 yet know that
you know of all right so anyway yeah
what we're seeing is we're going to see
an exhaustion at the carrier level
annexed so we basically go from iono to
in North America Aaron and then the
carriers the big impact right for this
is if you're a company and you're doing
business you're stuck with that carrier
because those addresses become bound to
the carrier yeah it makes like very
different temple Shannon's about to move
to the bay area and she's going to need
to get you know high-speed internet
through my you know Comcast or whoever I
is you know once they're exhausted she's
going to have a problem even getting
online well Conda guesses her comcast
this unique comcast has already started
their process of rolling out ipv6 so
what you'll typically get depends on
where in the country you are you're
going to get by default an ipv6 address
and you'll be toning ipv4 over ipv6 two
gateways to connect out to the ipv6 the
impact of this is things like DNS SEC
can't truly map with the ipv4 ipv6 how
do you if that was the case if you got
one of those where it's like they only
give me an IP 6 address they've got like
one of those older linksys you know
wireless routers I mean what would it
offenders love they get to upgrade it oh
great well so I hope will spin it yeah
well that's essentially what's happening
is we're seeing most of the vendors
haven't been supporting ipv6 up to this
point and it's going to require a
complete change out of each of the
carrier's end devices their customer
premise equipment right the whole ipv6
thing i mean it's it's there's it's big
enough for just us geeks to grok but
well how is this going to be sold to
consumers you have any idea if there's
like some sort of like initiative to
brand it a certain way and dumb it down
so that you know the general immunity
the average American understands why
they need to update their cable modem or
their router or whatever it may be yeah
that's why they call it the new internet
no the new energy get onto the new
internet you get to replace your routers
and switches that we saw this with
internet too yes exactly okay so that's
what we've seen over the last couple
years but again this could potentially
cause some problems Yahoo just announced
that when they go to dual stack which
means ipv4 and ipv6 talked about that
blended exactly what we're going to end
up seeing is a lot of customers because
their premise equipment doesn't truly
support ipv6 or their dns doesn't
support ipv6 that they won't be able to
get to yahoo is an example so and it's
only small it's like one percent or a
small percentage of but that's a million
people right there's going to be lots of
fragmentation and that's going to happen
also for a lot of businesses if they
don't have a dual stack environment
running v42 v6 now what happens when
when we run out and you know there are
companies organizations whatever have
you know because back when they're just
throwing IP address you know here have a
/ 16 whatever
what do you predict is going to happen
with the people that have an abundance
of IP for that aren't really using them
all there's a market right now on ebay
being formed oh so ebay is going to be
the chaser like a new market there's a /
16 going for a million dollars at this
point if somebody wants to so that's the
going rate right now today that was and
that was a rental property so think
about the the IP we said you rent the
yes you rent it you don't buy it yeah so
it's expected that IP rates are probably
gonna raise pretty heavily for ipv4
we're talking maybe thirty-five dollars
per IP address okay as a rental Wow yeah
per year hmm okay so if your new
business or if you want to just
experiment and some yeah actually I
talked about with carriers where you
need 9p for all of your customers what
about all of those unused IP there's
tons of IP addresses that aren't being
used whether they could they call them
like bogan IPS you know right both
bogans are basically address ranges that
haven't been allocated all those
addresses are now going to be allocated
except for like separate not use as an
example 1 dot one dot one ok 1 dot one
dot one actually really can't even be
allocated one because apparently for the
last 15 years in a lot of the rallying
books to do experiments and to try
networks and such people have been using
those addresses so right now that
distress when you dirty this wasn't in
the RFC so we have we have 10 address
blocks that are dirty that actually have
website set up on them they have email
site set up and people aren't moving off
that properly so you're saying people
are squatting or squatting on 10 major
loss right now can you just squat an ID
on the internet just be like i'm taking
this I'm you know I've claimed this and
if somebody else tries to its like
apparently they've succeeded Wow and
then as long as your IP makes it into
the routing table it's like you just say
understand kin it's the cyber it seems
like the cyber equivalent to to be
considered like a oh gosh I'm so
forgetting the term here sovereignty
it's kind of like sovereignty you know
it's if everybody agrees that you exist
and you know you're identified as such
then then you are it's it's going to be
real challenging I mean think about all
the potential problems somebody can park
themselves they get route ability they
can park themselves in somebody else's
address range what does that mean well I
mean security problems because now say I
park within your IP range and I set up a
I don't know spambot you're the one that
the law enforcement going to come visit
to say why are you spamming right so you
have those kind of things and is was it
something electric the company you like
provide p 60 hurricane electric
hurricane-like great my company it's
still your favorite yes actually I have
a hosted web server on at this point
they have dual stack by the way this
isn't an advertisement I don't work for
the company but they have a dual stack
they have the most connections they
support multicast internally they have
big pipes they have lots of locations so
you're saying it's easy to get online
through them very easy to get online and
very good host on them because most of
the ISPs that we've talked to don't even
have ipv6 hosting services which means
that cell phones and other devices as
they start being ipv6 only devices
people weren't even going to know that
their customers can't even get to them
because state the ipv4 and ipv6 are
totally separate so this is does that
not cause problems when if if like
everybody goes oh well the easiest way
is to go through hurricane electric and
then boom we've got an IP 6 or online
good to go right exactly yeah yeah we're
a lot of vendors don't do that right now
what do you prefer as far as the vendors
are concerned for IPC ipv6 hardware not
just oh it works with it but what were
you like yes i have a modified version
of linksys oh you linksys modified
linksys i am
the open wrt with all the ipv6 patches
not flawless but it's getting there I've
also used the Mac extreme I guess is
what's called from Apple unfortunately
it was being rebooted or forced itself
to reboot and crash every day and they
finally patch that problem after eight
months Thank You Apple I've also played
with a lot of the cisco equipment with
newest iOS okay which is real good and
also juniper with AAA on juniper with a
current iOS I understand d-link has a
new ipv6 router I have not tested it yet
and a lot of the big no names don't have
it at all right I'm a big fan of like
youryour untangles your mana walls or
smooth walls your pfsense have you
played with any of those yeah they've
all started implementing ipv6 and some
of them are more mature than others mono
walls pretty cool manalo yeah I got to
sway the wall need to bring lob used
smooth and i'm using untangle right now
and they need to just got a new
subscriber line from comcast i need to
bring it online with IP 6 and right now
it's running on a linksys and if it's a
piece of plastic it's a toy is my way I
feel okay especially when you're doing
you know hundreds of clients and stuff
like that oh yeah yeah for sure so we'll
have to set you up with multicast soon
oh that's going to be fun yeah uh-huh so
is um is it overblown in media uh I mean
uh Fox News I'm sure you saw the article
that everybody was raving about yes yeah
and then they like nicely just kind of
swept everything under the rug with a
update to the article I didn't get to
see the good version unfortunately the
concern is that if you're if people are
doing business online and they don't
support ipv6 that customers aren't gonna
be able to get to them okay so there's
an economic value to move at this point
that's the business justification
because as an example if I go to your
website in your only ipv4 and ipv6 my
transition down to ipv4 is going
make your website slower than somebody
else's website so all of a sudden that
becomes a problem especially when you're
trying to serve up the page that's half
a second or one second or whatever so
you have the transition costs from this
performance standpoint and also if you
have the other issue of people not even
be able to get to you I'd imagine if
corporations are making you know these
kinds of big changes there's also I
wonder how that ties in with the other
like political concerns about things
like net neutrality you know and how ip6
plays a role in that actually it's a big
implication because companies that don't
support ipv6 carriers there could be
some concerns that if they don't support
for ipv6 multicast things like that that
they're not actually abiding by net
neutrality but i'm not a net neutrality
expert and these are mine but i just
find it fascinating yeah well thanks so
much Joe I mean it's always a choice
code few wits in here now yes a lot is
reflective yeah and for any of those
that missed we had a great episode with
Joe you need to go and check it out got
links in the show notes and yeah
fascinating stuff if you're new to ip64
breaking it down Thanks join modding
wizard Ben Heck and friends as they
build and modify a host of amazing
community inspired creations the ben
heck show is brought to you exclusively

engineers in the latest episode Ben
takes the Sega CD X classic gaming
system and shrinks it down to make it
portable so that's just about wraps up
part two of two of shmoocon 2011 thank
you so much to everybody that spoke to
us all the fans that came up to us to
say hey we love that and the Potters for
having us out here love shmoocon it's
good to be on the East Coast even though
it's snowing um well I wouldn't let you
guys know if you have the technology on
69 does with his kick-ass gaming rig
overclocked of course go ahead and send
your photos over to feedback a hack five
dot org and they will show it on next
week's show also when it's let you know
you can subscribe to the show for free
easy it's a great way to support the
show on iTunes YouTube hak5 org select
subscribe has all of the details and
there's probably a little announcement I
should make about the hack shop it's
actually in transit right now because
next episode
18 26 which means the episode after that
it's season 9 which means Shannon's in
the Bay Area and as you guys know
Shannon doesn't hack shop so the hack
shops probably in a u-haul right now so
anyway hak5 dot org slash store though
you can still order stuff and it'll be
shipping right out to you get your
t-shirts get two pineapples all that
good stuff and and yeah this has just
been a phenomenal time here at shmoocon
I couldn't be happier about the way that
everything went and and yeah that that's
pretty much it if you have any questions
comment you know you know you can find
our show notes of rock 5 org and you can
email us feedback at hak5 org and until
next week I'm during kitchen in the
freezing cold looking for dating back to
the west coast trust your technol us
dannon eat snowball Eiffel ends
hey you know I just I got louder you got
angry at me I get excited okay so tasty
thank you it's the beard in the hair
right that's what ya like hot doggery
died poor lon no no you gotta do a Jack
Bauer style 09 to that 168 Don 536 348
