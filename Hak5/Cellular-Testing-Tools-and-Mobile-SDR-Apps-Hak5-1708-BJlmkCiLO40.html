by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol astir
and this is not our studio oh this will
eventually be but in the meantime it is
the warehouse in the midst of build-out
it looks really nice in here you know
it's very clean there's a toothbrush on
the floor it's it's a bit messy but it's
gonna get there yeah it's a little
echoey right now too so I'm gonna try
not to get too loud so the reason why we
are over here as opposed to our old
studio is because currently we're having
the security put in yeah so we're just
we have to be here while they actually
set up everything so in the meantime
this was also kind of an interesting
challenge in that the security system
relies on an internet connection and so
that kind of prompted me to go ha wait a
second if the if the security system is
being installed on the 1st and the
internet connection is being installed
on the 7th I had a second he already
needs internet to learn and then it was
like oh wait we've got the perfect thing
right if only we had I don't know like
like a Wi-Fi router or something that we
could plug of mobile broadband system
into it kind of is I figured we haven't
touched on this in a while but and have
been meaning to do a segment on how to
mobile enable your your Wi-Fi pineapple
and it turns out all you really have to
do is plug USB cable in between the
pineapple and your phone and then you
just go to settings and then under
Wireless and networks you hit more and
then you go to tethering and portable
hotspot and you just check that box that
says USB tethering and that's it not a
single other piece of configuration
immediately USB 0 will show up on the
Wi-Fi pineapple and this is pretty much
similar to any Linux device it's using
what's called our NDIS I forget exactly
what it stands for but Microsoft came up
with the protocol then there's a
alternative protocol called CBC ether
both of them are basically the same idea
which is to create a virtual Ethernet
interface over USB and so one of them
enumerates as a USB 0 device on linux
and the other one just shows up as an
ETH but either way it's the same thing
you do an ifconfig wlan0 there's your IP
address so it pretends to be Ethernet
yeah
it's have you ever used one of those USB
to Ethernet adapters oh yeah unlike it's
it's exactly like it's exactly the same
thing so you know to the pineapple it's
just another network interface and since
as a cellphone it already has a you know
LTE connection in this case to t-mobile
over you know with the 4G and all that
good stuff it's done and so we just
plugged it in and magic yeah I said that
kind of got me thinking like wait a
second we haven't really ever talked
about our favorite Android networking
and other geeky applications that we
kind of rely on and and as we are in
this transition phase I've been relying
on a lot of them because it turns out
like our best bet for network
connectivity until the Comcast line gets
run or trenched I should say that's
gonna be fun um we're kind of relying on
a lot of different technologies cuz DSL
is only gonna be our fallback well
hopefully I can get mobile reception
while I'm over here ok you know you
don't I'm getting dude look at this ok
so actually that that prompts me to
start off first so my first app as far
as bars are concerned you see yeah ok
you can look at like how many bars your
phone says it has but what does that
even mean right you mean you have good
yeah well actually no you could have
full bars but not necessarily have
Internet connectivity because is that it
I mean what is a bar even mean my phone
will show me full bars but if it's white
that means that it's working if it's
orange that means that I'm not actually
receiving any yeah no so how is this get
yourself a copy from the Play Store of a
network signal info Pro I love this
application I actually spent the like
whatever it is 2 dollars to get the pro
version but even the the basic free one
is great and what
shows me is not just bars but actually
my signal in DBM so I can actually tell
right now I've got a negative 98 a
because I just started watching Mike's
Osmonds thing about decibels and bells
there you go it wasn't the best way that
my jaws were explained decibels Wow and
then Mike's brother Mike's brother is
really tall you guys have to see this
have we mentioned again how awesome my
husband's software-defined radios here
is there we go so I can see my DBM I can
see you know the protocol type I'm using
GSM network type is LTE I can see data
connectivity I can actually see what
cell tower I'm connected to if we go
over here and see cell location I
actually see on a nice little open map
yes and it'll actually tell me I am 630
meters from the cell tower which is
probably why I'm getting such a great
signal and there's a couple other
features in this app I really like like
you get the ability to you know get your
external IP address kind of like going
to like what is my IP comm or any of
those other services in addition to
notifications so here I can actually see
like have it make a chime when it loses
connection and gets it back kind of cool
as well as what they call refresh
signals there's a lot of crap apps in
the marketplace for like signal boosters
and really all they ever do in fact you
don't need an app for this you know a
signals really low go into airplane mode
come back in because when you first turn
your phone on or when you come out of
airplane mode that's when your radios
going to be using you know the most
power at its disposal to scream out to
the network saying is there are towers
around essentially and and that's in
fact it even spells out here in this app
the guy is like this is what all booster
apps do so he's got a button where you
can do that as well yeah otherwise well
it's pretty but then the pro version is
like two bucks and gives you access to a
bigger database of cell towers kind of
like you know wiggle net that's another
great resource WI G GL e net is
as a community-based resource of of
wireless access points as opposed to the
like commercial skyhook service which is
kind of like the same idea yeah you know
the Google car drives around collecting
all of these things or actually we all
anonymously give that up if you check
that box on install sorry I just thought
it would point that out it's a fun
little app I like to kind of get geeky
about my signal strength and that's one
I rely on a lot otherwise for testing
speed I use speedtest.net just because
it's kind of like I don't know the
industry standard yeah although I did
just find an html5 version of it that's
a speed of dot me and it's an html5
speed test that's really gorgeous the
way that they do two graphs and
everything yeah I was on backtrack and
backtrack doesn't have or sorry
backtrack I keep saying backtrack I was
on Kali Linux and they don't have flash
in iceweasel so I had to go and use this
and it's actually pretty fantastic as is
my 40 42 is that's like the universe and
they're really good for the US if you
don't have fiber and you're okay that's
really that's that's huge for mobile
data yeah Paul you're gonna have to get
like a close one of that because that's
that's a legit right there 42 is really
good for 42 is super good especially
considering the fact that the DSL modem
that we're having installed here is 1.5
maybe bits per second and I say maybe
bit because it's a DSL yeah I forgot to
tell you that they they quoted on the
website they could give us 24 megabits a
second and turns out it's only the lines
been tested at one and a half we're
gonna figure something out
I think we're gonna bring back the
project with the parabolic antennas
pointed at ya we might have might have
to be doing it the other way around
instead of hilarious is instead of like
getting getting Wi-Fi from the office to
the apartment it's gonna be the other
way around gonna triangulate going to
make this place work
I'll just rely on my cellphone
yes yes yeah well we're gonna be that it
will probably lead us into a fun project
of bonding so stay tuned for bondage
with multiplexed modems Sprint t-mobile
AT&amp;amp;T all of them why not just him that's
a good stuff right no I'm just saying
it's it's like have you ever seen the
backpacks with all the 3G modems and you
can plug your cameras into it yeah we
did this I talked to one of the guys
that do this on hack across America so
maybe I could get in touch with them and
get some but it's more fun too anyway
yes load balancing and bonding soon that
will probably be in our future so yeah
that's been test and then the last app
that I use is land roid and I pretty
much use it just for one reason it's
good it's got all of the so much stuff
in here probably I don't even really use
like you can look up your public IP and
do a traceroute and check out your DNS
and do it who is and all of these things
but essentially what I use it for is a
first check signal info and signal info
will say like yo Dawg you got LTE and
I'm like that's great look at how great
my signal is but then I go here and I'll
just put in an IP address to ping and
I'll be like you know dude exactly and
then I'll get ping replies and I can
actually see the time in milliseconds
its its ping but it's ping for Android
and I am that guy that's constantly to
check his connection will open up a
terminal and whatever operating system I
am in and just type in ping space
8.8.8.8 maybe I should download that and
try it because I lose my connection at
my house all the time well it's just one
of those things really like look if I'm
not getting any King packets I'm pretty
sure I'm offline yeah and if 8.8.8.8 is
down or google.com is down we probably
have bigger problems where there's
probably an apocalypse going on yes and
if I'm pinging Yahoo it must be the 90s
what are you ping let us know in the
comments so that's those are the apps
that I rely on awesome yes oh and Wi-Fi
analyzer which we used pretty heavily in
the development of pine ap for the Wi-Fi
pineapple just because we get this one
shows you all the different channels up
to what is it 14 right now it will seem
that there's nobody on channel 4
because of course that would be right
reserved only for Japan yes and then you
can see how many people are on each of
the channels and their strengths right
and you get a nice little signal
strength based on you know so the higher
the little bubble here the the you know
better the signal strength is and you
can actually say hey look at that it's
in DBM you know and so these are all
hanging out about negative 70 so do you
have the ability to change your wireless
channel on Android well what it's nice
is kind of like to do a site survey so
right now looking at this I could say
we're best putting our stuff on channel
6 because there's only one other access
point on channel 6 in this area which is
actually really surprising because over
at the last hack 5 office the 2.4
gigahertz spectrum is just devastated
with stuff so it's also really fun when
you run PI ap and then you check it out
with one of these and you just happy
like a giant waterfall of thousands of
access points being created yeah because
oh and an amazing feature of this app is
the Wi-Fi analyzer thing that allows you
to if you're connected to a network see
your signal strengths to the network and
then you can walk around with this
little meter and it goes beep beep beep
beep and as you get closer to the access
point goes beep I got that great that's
awesome
death so that's kind of fun for like I
don't know find the router but yes it's
good stuff well I've been having some
fun with some apps should we take a
break before we jump in let's do that ok
so those are my fun and app Z's of my
choice and we'll be right back after
this it doesn't matter if you heard the
dogs barking or not or if you have a
crafty idea of how to make anti sound
now with dog genes its genetically
modified pets coming T you could take
that idea and put it online if you had a
domain names anti dog barking sound
repellent genetically modified spray
comm could be yours and you could get
the domain name and the web hosting
really quickly over at domain.com
they've got a quick domain discovery
system which will suggest other names
that are more appropriate or easier to
remember than my recommendation and
their checkout process super simple so
you'll have your website up and running
in no
time and I've told you guys before how
much I love domain.com mainly because
they're affordable reliable easy to use
and huge on social media they're really
fun to do business with you can tweet
them at domain.com and see why it's such
a fun place and the guys over at
domain.com get this huge fans of hak5 so
they want to hook you up with a coupon
code hak5 use that at domain.com
checkout and get an extra 15% off so
when you think domain names think
domain.com thank gosh what are you up to
now
nothing well you've got some extra bits
on your don't know that's the OTG
adapter there we go because i have
android devices too that i wanted to
talk about today so first off i'd show
you SDR touch back in the day right a
couple weeks back and pretty cool up
yeah it's a free app you can listen to
all sorts of different frequencies with
it straight through your android device
as opposed to having to plug it into a
computer and I love that it works right
out of the box with the rtl-sdr dongle
your favorite without really playing
route yeah it's really really make sure
that that's set up on your computer
under the developer options and then you
just plug it in it automatically knows
that it has the correct drivers and
everything so you just you're ready to
go so SDR Touch was recently updated
with new GUI interface so it's slightly
more detailed they have a few more
options in there so I highly suggest
checking out their updates yeah it's
like a 2.0 update they even increase the
waterfall colors so that you have a it's
a little bit different of a range so you
can see more of a range with your
bandwidth so really cool with that and
this week I wanted to go into detail
about two different applications which
include a DSB on your android app as
opposed to just SDR right on okay got ya
fan of the flight tracker
application which is like community
based kind of service where basically
you know flight track 24 I think is what
it's called yeah where you can see
airplanes in progress but a lot of them
are alright one of those but a lot of
them are delayed by like five or ten
minutes from the FAA which is like
stupid because you could just turn on an
ad SB receiver and see in real time and
we've been able to track that just fine
on our computers I didn't know but
apparently there are a couple of this
means that you can run this while you're
on a plane oh that's a great idea yes
you could actually watch you as your
legality and everything got really cool
because like it's not a it's not a
transmitter no so you're totally legit
your phone in airplane mode plug into no
rtl-sdr okay so the two apps that I
found one is a dollar fifty and that one
is called a DSP on USB SDR RTL wonderful
name and the other one's called a ver a
DSP so both of them pretty much do the
same thing the very one is free as
opposed to a dollar fifty so you might
want to check out that one as well so
they both do the same thing you just
plug in your dongle it recognizes it and
it allows you to open up these apps when
you do that it's gonna start collecting
data and it'll show you on a map all the
different flights that are going on in
your area so if I plug this in with the
OTG cable okay it's gonna give me an
option of either running USB a DSP RTL
or a ver so I'm gonna hit USB first and
it's gonna tell me that it recognizes
the USB so I can click on that I can go
to settings I can see all the different
packets that are being translation
Romines
and stuff I'm seeing in place right now
any antenna yes so then I click on the
map and the map does take a little bit
of time to update I noticed it's for
some reason it takes like five minutes
for it to actually start showing you any
flights but once it does start
recognizing them and accepting and
downloading the information for you so
the flights will start showing them you
showing them to you on the graph okay
cool and that's not a regular Google map
either I'm noticing that looks like it's
a
Oh or something map yeah it's built into
the computer or to the app so you'll see
there's one flight right there yeah if I
click on it it'll show you the
information about 9,800 feet at a speed
of 281 so it looks like it looks like it
just took off from Berkeley hey did that
give you it squawk there's another one
let's see the bottom fifty 705 what is
the walk hey we should do a segment on
tuning into and listening to the pilots
talk that would be fun okay so I have
two planes on here so I have one coming
out of Napa and one coming out of
Oakland that again is a DSP rtl-sdr
wait a second you just pick that up with
this yes that's like this where houses
are every magic seriously I just got 42
megabits on my phone and now you're
picking up airplanes in Napa inside the
warehouse with this isn't that cool Wow
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and close out
of this application and I'm gonna unplug
this so I can restart it plug it back in
and I should be able to open up a ver so
I'm gonna open up a fare I'm helping
with your polarity here you're doing a
great thank you so much no no run the
same way it gives you the automatic
packets that are being transmitted from
the antenna into my phone so I four
packages 32 frames 36 38 41 so it's
getting them pretty quick and then it'll
also give me a percentage of bad CRC I'm
assuming that means bad packets
basically there's just the thing at the
end of a packet is a checksum and the
CRC is a very basic checksum where you
say do this little bit of math and if it
doesn't come true then the packet must
be malformed and so disregard this
packet that reminds me Wireshark hey you
can do it you can check your CRC's in
Wireshark watch the series it's pretty
cool so in here you can look at your
data so this will give you a nice little
listing of each and every different
plane that is receiving the latitude and
longitude the altitude in the ICAO for
each of the different planes if I go
back and I click on map this is going to
show me a similar map on this one you'll
notice that I also get the same two
planes
but it's over a Google map it's over a
Google map yep and you can also click on
each of the planes and see more
information when you click on them as
well so it look it's very very similar
as well I noticed that there is also a
plugin that you can download called
a very internal IO plugin and this will
let you look at the status of all the
different air traffic that you're
receiving cool but this doesn't give you
a map or anything it's just basically so
with status so you can link it click on
them and find out about what they're you
know where they're going
ok so so you can do things like let's
see I can click on status and I can view
all the different ones that are coming
in I can click on bluetooth and that'll
allow me to connect to GPS or a DSP
units on Bluetooth so I have the option
of changing how I'm connected to them
interesting yes so I like turtles one of
the other options I have in here is if I
click on let's see play I think this
will actually play a recording of
whatever map that I decide to download
so it says you can hit start and it
looks like it's going to download the
map quite possibly and then I'll be able
to play it from here so a lot of bunch
of options on here some of them I
haven't quite checked out just yet and
there's a third one that I can show you
too and this one is just called a ver
and this is another mapping software but
this one has a whole bunch of different
options in it as far as what kind of map
you want to look at so you can get into
yes so if you are a
oh nice so if you're like a pilot this
could actually be an interesting
resource yeah I think that this could be
a way for say general aviation people to
get an inexpensive gads B receiver on to
their craft without having to buy some
really expensive unit oh that's good and
that's just good for air safety
everywhere I just like the fact that I
can just easily take this with me and it
doesn't depend on any kind of wireless
or data connection it just requires this
and your phone to be powered the one
thing I didn't notice is both of these
different apps they take up a lot of
battery so they're you're gonna your
batteries people you are powering your
rtl-sdr dongle off of your phone right
now
we should pop that thing on a port pilot
when they get in in a couple of weeks to
see how it's really doing you know you
can get those as well as all sorts of
other fun goodies at hae shop comm which
will soon also be occupying this space
with us and that's how you can support
us directly I would really value that
weight do you mean we're gonna have
space we might we might have spit I can
just where we're standing right now will
soon be a workshop with the laser
cutters and the 3d printers in the
halfpipe a couple of vert ramps yeah
we're gonna see how many OSHA violations
we can make yes we were gonna build in
Tennessee a lot of fun also don't forget
to email us feedback at hak5 org if you
have information if you want to send me
over your favorite ADSP
android application or if you want to
let us know about other android
applications that we just can't miss
because there's so much networking
goodness and str goodness you get to put
those in the comments and then we can
all enjoy that'd be fantastic oh I
should mention to you guys as well if
you're running ser top touch on your
Android device as well so does SD a DSP
software
applications you might have to uninstall
SDR touch whenever you want to use the a
DSP once because apparently the drivers
conflict with the two applications I had
that issue I uninstalled SDR touch and
it works just fine so you you don't know
the special hell until you've dealt with
irq conflicts so those anyway pack five
dot org slash follows where you can find
all the ways to find us on social media
and with all of that said I think that's
it until next time thank you for
excusing our mess and allowed warehouse
yes and until now which is about to get
a lot quieter when we move into the
proper studio section but until then I'm
doing kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
dress for techno last I'm gonna see if I
can create an OSHA violation them up
what's that going to be a fun one know
what happens when you do things really
worried from don't do it I can do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
