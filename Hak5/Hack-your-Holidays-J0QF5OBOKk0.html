holidays I feel really weird coming to a
bit recursively I guess you could say
here in my own kitchen but I wanted to
give you an awesome update about three
big things happening at hack five right
now we've got the biggest sale we've
ever done hack Shop calm we're gonna be
live streaming on Sunday and there's a
little bit of an easter egg just for you
guys are awesome hack five YouTube
viewers so the field kits are a big new
thing in this sale it's like up to 60%
off a lot of these things like get this
hack five elite field kit I love this
thing this is our dual zip guys so it
just like keeps going if you're like me
you're probably carrying around way too
many cables this is literally the kit
that I carry on a day-to-day basis and
then we also have of course the
essential field kit which is perfect for
getting started and this is really cool
because now haha a book for each of
these awesome tools so if you're looking
to get started this is like the way to
do it and I love I love the art that
we've got that we've got like comics
going on this is just the coolest thing
I love doing this stuff so check out the
books those are pretty cool and then
actually we did an update on the Wi-Fi
pineapple kits so I'm really excited
about the boost kits it's available both
for the Tetra and the Nano let me show
you so we've got these sweet flip out
cases to carry all of the stuff all nice
and neat and the big deal about the
boost is like here's it on the nano one
that we're including this third Wi-Fi
radio which you can just go ahead and
plug in over USB and what that does is
adds a third interface that you can use
to piggyback off of other connections or
tether to your phone things of that
nature and this guy is pretty sweet
because it's got integrated amplifier
pretty high gain antenna so I love this
thing it would look like raw frame
injection and monitor mode and all that
stuff I use it on my Kalibak
so anyway that's kind of the big deal
what else do we have here we've got well
actually this is my girlfriend's awesome
sweet potato pie so you can't have that
there's no coupon code that are gonna
get you one of those but there is
another kind of pie that you can find at
the hack shop maybe I don't know maybe
we're open the 90s and you're like
little Easter eggs
maybe you should go hunting for it and
find yourself some free schwag
just saying good stuff abound and with
that I'm going to let you know Monday
live streaming for Cyber Monday it's
gonna be a lot of fun we're going to
announce the hack 5 gear giveaway
winners and I'm going to be doing some
QA and it's just gonna be all-around
good time I hope you guys can join me so

you haven't already because then you'll
get notified when we're live-streaming

new videos and I hope you guys have had
