music with netcat we homebrew on four
point 0 and mu Bix visits the hack house
with never tap analyzers you get to
kbecque all that and more on this
episode stay tuned
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by godaddy Squarespace click it or
ticket and viewers like you pawpaw
casares hey since these guys aren't
paying attention welcome to hack five
this is darren snubs and me muaks we got
an awesome show lined up for it yeah we
did we are doing well I will be I will
be playing with all sorts of fun stuff
okay yeah awesome right and then shannon
has the skinny on what's going on with
more Nintendo four point oh four point
oh can get hanging to me yes nice we
would said that would keep you informed
and for all those people cuz the thing
is the episode that came out when we
started that series was the same exact
day that Nintendo decided to release
four point out so you're not screwed yes
or no anymore thank you right so if you
were like watching the show and you're
like no I just don't y'all get okay and
then uh we're doing some fun network
analysis yeah we're gonna take what in
eighty did last week and we're gonna
step it up a notch are you trying to
show up indefinitely okay come on my
show and show off some cool hacker stuff
walk around see you guys have like you
know like a rap battle no I love it ya
know now I guess we should explain that
Matt is not here because he turned into
a dog and got evicted by aliens again no
not virtual machine okay that is for
real he's not a Cylon he actually is
like he said two episodes ago he bought
a house he just came back in Florida he
was away on business and today he's
moving into his new house we're excited
awesome hold on opens lose nuh he's
leaving a hack house but we're gonna
install cams in there and set up a video
wall we will we will be stocking Matt
with you yes so he'll be here next
episode and you know we see but I will
be gone that's
I'm going back to Missouri my brother's
graduating from high school I'm very
excited for him yay be good time not
flying american right now i am not
flying american like lady yes hey Ken
there's nice so um it's uh speaking Matt
anyway you had a like a net pick a crowd
well okay so there so he is he's not
here so everybody might sound like he's
watching oh no he's yeah anyways so he
mentioned that since I've been already
in the field that getting a job in 80
hours of us was easier for me you're
referencing when we we we talked about
that the video that you did Jojo sec
there's a preparation and presentation
the video yeah yeah we talked about it a
couple episodes good good good
presentation so the the skinny on it is
that anybody can do it but it's the
basics that I taught not not how or why
it only took me 80 hours it was the
basics of how to go from sitting on a
couch to actually getting into a job and
getting on that life cycle to a career
mm-hmm so I it's just a little tweaking
me a little bit when he said that and I
just want to set this so would you say
you know going from couch to IT job or
in my kiddie hours ymmv ymmv your
mileage may vary no no no no it really
isn't okay because you just have to eat
it doesn't require superpowers that move
it says no hell no okay you just have to
push it correctly yeah you just apply
some of the basics that I taught in the
you know in this I the feelings is part
of it is social engineering yes
definitely ok but is like a social
engineering that goes into interviews
and things so since you in goes and
everything is just varying degrees yeah
it's like you know do you do you propose
at your restaurant or do you propose
well you're you know a thousand feet up
in a blimp or not a blimp but a hot air
balloon because you know what are you
gonna say you know it's a thousand feet
down a poem he's telling you how he's
gonna propose to you Shh all right sorry
bromance it's coming out my ass group oh
sorry for the monkey let's see one other
thing Oh
get to before we start talking about
some other fun that cuts stuff you're
doing some exotics work later see ya
tomorrow we're going to actually i'll
actually on the exotic liability podcast
which is an excellent podcast by Chris
Nickerson and DJ Jackalope DJ Jackalope
is the main DJ for Def Con and if you've
ever seen Tiger Team the the show tiger
team Chris Nickerson and yeah Luke
gentleman from that I can't remember his
name at the moment yeah it did the sense
they're doing it works out how they did
the social engineering work out sure but
they're doing a podcast they have 14
episodes out right now that I know of
and they're pumping them out real fast
like nice three or four a weekend wow
that's that's hardcore yeah but they're
really good they're really well done and
i'll be on recording tomorrow yeah i
will be there I awesome okay well I
think let's go get into some netcat
stuff since it will be the only cat on
on the set for the interview okay yeah
well Kirby decided to level actually do
you want to win a why because Mike Kirby
doesn't want to get anywhere near this
um i was gonna do some more work on this
guy for this episode and I mean there's
really not much to it he's not as agile
as Kirby do right it's just ok so the
hack house were over i got like some
updated code and fun stuff on the back
end and then i'm still going with like
like trying to do it very very on the
cheap so I've got a 2.4 gigahertz
Wireless micro camera you'll notice that
this particular wireless micro camera is
is connected to a tether this is
actually a cat tether they'll call me so
horrible it's only one ounce in my
defense one ounce because i was using
this is so cool lithium polymer
rechargeable 9-volt batteries these are
the best we use them in our wireless
mics they work like a champ and they
weigh like nothing so even powered and
everything the whole setup is like an
ounce so sure that yours there's a
little donut me the harness is actually
made for cats yeah what's behind a car
yeah it's just but you know we just
decided to put a wireless Mike Rowe
camera on it and she was wearing it
earlier today and you know it's this
awesome put the camera on the cat and
that was fun but don't end up putting it
on the rover and then updating the
netcode and we'll have some fun with
that later I think I'm gonna integrate
the Shiva cloth but i just thought i'd
let you guys know where that is and and
why Kirby was freaking out earlier today
go plug us Kirby yeah no cute boys I'm
not doing the Kirby moms and gold
unmonitored ah the d-block so I think at
this point though let's talk about the
other cat and that is netcat right he's
going so that she doesn't often okay um
this was actually sent in by viewer it's
an interesting an interesting technique
that you can use to do cool stuff with
netcat yeah that is gone okay it was
really cool on the so when we did that
cat we said hey send us in your cool
tricks right this is one of those cool
tricks and it is using that cat to
stream mp3's using and yet using a nifty
program for linux called MPG one two
three okay okay so MPEG 123 basically
just allows you to play mp3s right from
the console dead simple that's about it
right and if we just do like a net cat
listen on port 1 2 3 4 hypernet to pipe
it right to there ok so we'll go ahead
and pipe it there right and it's just
sitting here waiting for something to
happen and since I don't have another vm
set up or anything i'm just going to do
it on localhost but what I'm doing is
catting or or taking a look at the like
dumping the the contents of the hak5 mp3
the the theme song mp3 file right in yes
standard in standard out and Piper right
over to netcat to 127 001 the local oh
so back to myself so when i hit enter
and tab right back over to my other tab
here you'll see that oh there we go it's
ashley wit tannhauser calm it's the hak5
theme it's labeled under genre of jazz
jazz there you go so you can pick up the
mp3 at hack my dog on the wiki and you
can find out about how to set this up
yourself in that CAD know
notes and bad props you guys are sending
in the you know techniques and stuff we
encourage that feedback very cool what
about using steganography I think you're
getting a little ahead of yourself
because we are doing another hunt here
soon but but that's not this episode
that's like next episode okay yeah yeah
because I'm not any stuffing yeah here's
the thing about the hunts they're a
little little FYI pay attention to
episode your pack 5 this one in
particular you might learn things that
you can use to apply later in Easter egg
hunts and win awesome stuff so a little
later we're gonna be playing with this
but right now let's go ahead and head
over to Shannon and see what's going on
with this week's land party hey guys get
ready because this month LAN party is
gold and I source we're playing over at
GES hak5 org on Saturday May thirtieth
get ready to own and we would like to
thank our sponsor Squarespace you can go
over to squarespace com hak5 land

on I'm going to be telling you guys
about the wii homebrew on four point oh
but first i'm going to throw it over to
move explore some network tap analyzers
so last week we had 80 down from dual
core and we were talking about TCP
extract and some fun ways to pull some
cool stuff out of packet captures and
this this this compelled the move ex to
come down and show me okay fine so let's
show them up real quick and I'm showing
it up with windows with windows again
you've got some cool tools to take a
look at packet captures and take a look
at like man and metal stuff we've got
the monkey going here in the middle in
fact I'm connected between it and your
wireless he hooked up to it so i will
play your noob for this segment mix up
and on repeat yes oh come on and and so
what are these tools what are these
things are gonna make like this enormous
amount of data that we capture when
we're doing these pen tests and this
this kind of stuff easier all right so
you can do packet captures or on the fly
analysis with these tools so either one
work and we're going to start off with
wireshark everybody knows one or shark
everybody loves buyers I mean you just
click and go but you don't really get
that good of information like what are
you getting come get me awesome
information right yeah yeah I mean but
if I just uh you can't tap here can't
really look at it and say hmm oh there's
a JPEG in there somewhere well yeah it's
it's like the UH neo and the lady in the
red dress I mean you can't read that I'm
gonna show you how to be new okay cool
let's let's get our neo on how do we
digest this all right so let's stop that
for now okay but I do want a little
hammer home and we're gonna reiterate
this at the end mm-hmm but always get
packet captures oh yeah because you can
send them through all these tools they
all take like import packet or open
packet right so you're saying you know
if your app if you know you've got your
monkey at the corporate network or your
pineapple at the coffee shop and you're
having fun don't just you know bring the
fun home just wire starting yeah just
want to just save it to a file i see be
dumb wireshark whatever you want to do
unless you're trying to do something on
the fly that might be IP specific like
cookie jumping or cookie stealing yeah
okay sure but that would require that's
other too long yeah we're talking about
now
add some other time so what are these
tools that allow us to easily digest
these packet captures or even live info
ok so the first one we're going to show
you is network minor now this is a free
tool you can get it off of source boards
and it's 0 point 8 7 we're starting off
with it's real simple you select the
interface either the socket or the twin
peak a penny unless you have a wimpy
captain mm-hmm so you can do this
without when pcap okay on it and we're
gonna go with our little tongue hit
start and it's starting to go great
thing about network miner is it has p 0
f integrated into it he has something
kind of like TCP extract into it so
here's all the images that it's pulling
right now you can see just it's just a
thumbnail okay but you can get it so
this expect to the image much in the
same way that when 80 was down here
showing us how to extract executables
when I packet capture but this isn't a
GUI right and and we leave our
signatures are suitable will come via on
the files tab as well the other cool
thing is this credentials then
credentials ya know what kind of
credentials as you can see here these
are easy standard credentials this is a
HTTP cookie so you can depending on how
that cookie set up you can sometimes
steal it from home and just go at and
login free right or you know there are
better tools for that yeah look I'm just
but play I hear ya okay the other the
other awesome thing that network minor
hats is it pulls any DNS lookups so when
you're looking at for a forensic
standpoint or an instant responder long
times out of ten these days malware is
doing DNS instead of doing straight ip's
because you can block an IP real easy
but like just letting us can change its
just like we were showing us you know
few episodes back about tunneling our
own stuff like at the airport through
DNS ssh actions so we can you know
bypass the filters the bad guys are as
well so this is a text that right it
says any DNS queries what kind of query
it is what it resolved to which is the
witches of the bread and butter of it
the other cool thing is you got
parameters anything that doesn't
specifically look like a credential
it'll still pull and
show you so it might see WordPress
settings right there and then you'll see
your parameters in there okay so
slightly interesting data but not sure
but some of it anyway highlight it
keywords we can do keywords so if I want
to look for darren going through the
wire yeah so you can get pretty specific
yes you can get very specific okay okay
and then this I could put filters on it
I could you know yeah that's what the
keywords are nice and then there's
anomalies but great the other great
thing is that you can just file open you
open a pcap here's our demo mm-hmm all
right so we got an essay password for a
sequel query or see you later so essay
on sequel is like yeah once you got that
got root yeah the great thing about
network minor is that when it does all
this when it extracts the file and
winning attracts the image it actually
puts it inside of network miners folder
under the IP that it's doing it and
under some folders so I'm pointing that
out for a reason our next tool does not
do that you have to specifically go and
pick out what you want from it okay so
what is our next tool so our next tool
is an enterprise tool called netwitness
it's actually just I think in the last
few months maybe three or four months
went free oh I like free fries good but
you have to register like yeah I can see
you have to register and it's you have
to put but this is very specific you
have to put it in a valid email address
or you're not gonna get an email oh well
not the register yeah man we needed uh
so but this use this is enterprise level
stuff I mean this is going like you know
big bucks just previously so what I just
doesn't have to all right so let's see
some I mean I I expect some whiz-bang
features if it formerly was expensive
definitely all right yeah and like the
thirty thousand dollars Wow okay so this
is like enterprise so let's step it up I
mean obviously prettier in your face but
that's not telling me so far what do we
got so we're going to go with the demo
collection again I've already it's
called a collection in inside of
netwitness right but it's basically a
pcap yeah yeah so you double click and
it shows you this interface which is
kind of kind of
what's the word it's like that map it's
kind of intimidating yeah cuz you don't
you I mean there's a lot of info in here
there is but I see I see lots of you
know graphical goodness so I like that
credit cards text though yeah that looks
good so so attachment and it has a
little image so for example somebody
emailed someone with an attachment with
credit cards that txt it would write so
the first the numbers next to it is how
many times it occurred the the link on
this specific item lets you drill down
okay so say we want to look at all the
JPEGs now it shows a drill-down image so
that we can see okay they all came from
source 1021 they all can't I went to
destination 64 whatever but let's go
back real quick and let's look back at
that credit card text okay but not one
next to it this is the cool feature that
I like all right so you can actually see
a full like reimage of this email that
was sent to from subject just as if
you're looking at it really nice i like
the ability to reconstruct it and see
how the viewer right so down at the
bottom mm-hmm no well okay so that's
that yeah the others top attachments
right there credit cards text how would
you like to open it so you have some
options on how you'd like to open the
file and let's just open it in our
default and there we go and there we go
all the credit card for all those idiots
that email each other with my
coordination credit card information
attached beautiful so one of the one of
the more difficult features is the live
capture and it's only difficult because
they kind of hide the option I mean it's
not anywhere right because right now
we're just playing with the demo thing
but you're saying that we could just
turn this on and see the same kind of
information in the same kind of gooey
fashion with all the like the the big
blinding like headlights saying this is
the good stuff I found the you know the
pop3 account or whatever so how do we
see this live I mean we have the monkey
going right can we just sniffing to the
monkey you're scaring me okay all right
so you kind of think okay let's well
let's let's just do this let's start
new collection all right call it hak5
demo and connect to its into the local
connection but nothing's happening so
you kind of look around for hours on end
trying to figure out how to get it so
how to actually get it started it really
feels capture bar okays capture bar
click it and it pulls up a bar down here
say you want to send it to hak5 demo but
before that make sure you set in your
options under your capture you got to
sit make sure you have the correct
adapters day and there's our tap win32
adapter from the Interceptor so while
we're still in the options i kind of
want to show you something yeah
application processors look at all these
things that it can parse through so it
knows these by default we don't have to
create any signatures yeah so this is
the strong point of netwitness it knows
more signatures this is this is your
thirty thousand dollars a year right so
you look at this and it's it's got
everything mm-hmm and even audio codecs
no way silly us avoid call you got a
VoIP call skype call you see a skype
call go over you can you can double
click and play it back nice or a lot to
like gps em cuz i have kind of you have
to have the whole capture of it oh
really from beginning to end a file yeah
okay first guy call because it's
decrypted ah because of a the with the
handshake and the fun stuff yeah so but
avoid phone you can avoid call you get
anywhere in between nice so these are
all the codex and you can you actually
extend this because this is based on
your codex on your box ok so is if you
have the codec it will show up right all
right okay so we got our we got our
adapter set and we're getting okay we're
going to go down to this start about it
being about a broom you start alright so
if i just log over to the forms and let
me just log in here with my form account
and since it's live you should see it
already then it doesn't actually show up
until you're done captain okay so we
have to stop the capture so really you
can't see it like populate as it's no no
okay well another point but but here's
the thing right you could be running
multiple I mean you could have this on
one box doing this you could have
Wireshark in another doing live you
could have you know a network minor
running live as well so there's no
reason why we have to just use this so
let's stop that it'll analyze it and
weighs 110 packets it's gone through we
double-click and we got all our cool
stuff okay so do it does it does it
really highlight the goodies though Oh
user oh yes it's me all right it does
highlight the goodies you can actually
see the page and everything is here's
the get what you want to put together to
the page oh hey look at there that's it
yep password laying password there you
go so viewing web I should show it I
don't know man it might might require
some sort of session stuff there it is
oh yeah that would be the HTML but of
course all of those images are cash so
it's not really showing up that pretty
but yeah that's so cool you I mean I
like the idea of being able to easily
digest all of that just so much packets
man like you know when I go on fun
expeditions with a pineapple or a monkey
or something and I have and I have fun
while I'm there and I never really think
to take it home and really analyze it
because I'm sure there's just so much
going through the wire that there's no
way you're gonna see it all in fact I
probably going to lead to so many other
fun attacks that they include social
engineering melty go like you name it
right so what my best practice is to
actually just go wireshark capture TCP
dump whatever however you want to do it
you you just get on and dump the package
get a pcap get a number one rule number
one rule number two use all your tools
use TCP extract I gotta give up to nati
hate tcp
correct I was able to work the Mojo yeah
gave Linux two are these are these
cross-platform no both are windows only
I see there just isn't but like you said
there's no reason why you should just
put yourself in a little box where you
only use certain tools because if these
are good they run on windows wise just
run windows right exactly I hear you so
run your pcap through air cap ettercap
can take P caps running through
netwitness run it through network minor
they all get different results no one
gets it right and if you just do one of
them you're you're missing something
mm-hmm so definitely just go with the
pcap and and work from there unless
you're trying to do something live mix
as always man you impress me with your
tools like all the time like you're
still doing the tools thing over room
362 of highlighting all that that's
where you get a 9 coming out soon nice
that's where you got to get the good
stuff room 362 calm Rob thanks so much
now listen you like trivia like the
Easter egg hunt stuff we got a fun one
gotta step it up me well God that we've
got another we've got another Easter egg
hunt coming up right now but but first
we have another contest it's kind of
kind of a little geeky fun artistic
stuff and I let's head over to Shannon
see what's going on with this week's
trivia last week's trivia was 80 got his
start at Nanak on three what three
Cincinnati 2600 members went with him
and you could find the answer over at
the dual core music com website and one
of the Lost reality songs the answer was
bomb Remington Fords and anonymous and
this was correctly answered by Matt hey
Matt congratulations not our met but
another much just FYI matt is winning
the signed copy of loss reality by dual
core and you can find more of dual cores
music over at dual core music com

land to enter your submission next up
I'm going to tell you about some
Nintendo packing do you know regular
seat belt use can pretty much save you
from any kind of fatality in a motor
vehicle crash and still one in five
Americans don't do it they don't put on
their seat belt you can actually
increase your odds of survival actual
survival in a crash by nearly eighty
percent just by putting on your seat
belt I mean what it takes like 30
seconds remember seatbelts save lives
and if you want to save your own life go
to ww NHTSA govt we home brew for polio
that's what I've been excited about ever
since we started the whole waste
homebrew hacking series at the same time
that intended decided to you know give
it sdhc support and like all bunch of
like cool new features for the poor
planning system menu we have been
waiting waiting for some sort of
Twilight hack for we four points yeah
they killed Twilight hack the fourth
point so r.i.p you know tip it for my
homies but what do we have now one just
came out yay it's called banner bomb
okay pretty much basically the twilight
hack for four point oh and it's super
super simple you just have to have an SD
card and then you put a zip file onto
the SD
hard you get your what's it called boo
DOL or elf right and then put that into
the route you go to your wii and you you
know just go over to the SDM the SD menu
yeah sure up and up insert your card and
it starts installing it automatically
whoa no game right yeah that's the
beautiful thing is game people have to
own all it does yeah you don't have to
own Zelda you just to get it you don't
have to put in the Zelda disk you don't
have to walk backwards this link all you
have to do is go to this SD menu and it
starts up cool and we've got you know
notes in the stand well instructions on
the show notes I'm going to get the file
how to put it in there and in stuff like
that really really easy instructions I
haven't tested it myself because we both
have the three-point Oh versions but
this will still work on three-point
knows right so if you haven't updated
and you don't have the twilight princess
game so update 4 knots well I'm happy
damn who brew for the weed now they are
saying there's still some difficulties
there's still a couple of bucks because
this banner bomb is brand new so you
know it freezes and things happen with
it with certain weeks so is there like a
certain version of the banner bomb we
have to use um there are different
versions of it for each each kind of way
that they've been coming out with
simultaneously as they figure out these
new bugs they say that you need to start
with a certain one which is at like the
top of the list on the site and then
work your way down if the first one
doesn't work try the next one try the
next one trench so I got a question is
there any chance of breaking possibly so
everything I've read has it like it's
just gonna freeze your wii and this to
try this one I'm glad you brought that
up see a butta need me to yeah but--my
beta 1 also just came out on the what's
it called the hackneyed version 0.1 we
talked about this before it's basically
the loader that starts before the
nintendo system menu and allows you to
run homebrew before you even boot up
Nintendo's ok you know it's like dual
booting your wii the problem with this
though is it's only been tested on 10
wees only been tested on 10 weeks before
they actually brought it out into the
public and they said hey have at it but
the theme was this one the thing was
this new hack me with the boot me on it
that they've they've made it so that it
it runs so well and it tests so many
things before it actually installs that
if there is anything about your way that
will make it not install or will make it
possibly brick it won't install it just
it'll just stop it just won't work so
there are certain ways that it's not
going to work on but you know I might
work on yours so it's worth a try
especially if you have four point oh
yeah okay so stay away from boot me well
you know try boot me at your own risk
word i'll reserve right boot me at your
own risk right now i'm a little reserved
they do mention you know they think it
works but there are bugs there might be
is you know some bugs in the installer
there's still a lot of stuff that's
incomplete after you do get it installed
so i'm thinking i'm just gonna wait
until the next version of it comes out
just in case you know yeah I don't want
to pierce my way since both of our ways
your way in mind we we both have hacked
using the twilight princess yeah we have
stuff their nails realization yeah they
say if you upgrade to 4.0 you're still
gonna have the homebrew channel on your
on your week so there's no point in us
trying yet to react do it unless there's
a way to get homebrew channel off of our
week I don't know there's like a factory
restore so there's no way there might be
like for us to like get video footage of
this for you guys because you know we've
already hectic but you know maybe we can
maybe there's some sort of restore but
if you guys know hit us up I think it's
a really cool fact that we can just do
homebrew even on the antibiotics without
Twilight pretty much now no matter what
kind of version of the wii that you have
you can install the homebrew channel
that's the cool thing about this coming
out so you could go buy a wii weight by
weight tomorrow right you could never
buy a game forever you could use this
you know that's what homie we want it
and you know what nintendo would still
make money because it is is it on the
console it's we're can people find out
more information about 440 x um you can
go over to the heck me.com website i
think it's common yeah that's it okay
and and i'm sure you'll have it in your
show net yeah i'll have this in my show
notes there's beaner bomb QA us
you can go over there for the banner
bottom information and I'm also going to
have all the show notes in snubz ecomme
and seen our show notes high five don't
work yeah and I yeah I love it yeah we
do well you sure yeah sometimes the very
tedious so I love the fact that it's
it's just an exploit of the banner image
right so it's a buffer overflow right in
the eye mean that's cool yeah yeah
explain this to me cuz I was just like
dude buffer overflows for the win listen
I could explain but if you've had like a
glass right here I could I could explain
a buffer overflows everything see wait
more years ago yeah so yeah buffer
overflows it goes like this and she was
about to overload all right so um wow
