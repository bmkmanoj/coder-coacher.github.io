started we've been getting a lot of
great feedback so thanks so much for
that it's awesome but one of the things
that we've been seeing reoccurring has
been kind of the noticeable lack of
methyl alcohol onset and I assure you
nothing has changed in that department
you know it's just podcasters
prerogative considering our our
demographic yes all right the word
younger demographic and I promise you
I'm not on the methyl alcohol either
right now I'm just Jeff got that surgery
show must go on and Wes has been getting
it on with the custom cocktail cabinet
try saying that three times that size
what's up with this now this was just
something we thought of a long time ago
and I finally got around to doing it was
a pretty much inspired when you threw
the cold cathodes behind the liquor
bottles and was like oh that looks cool
and I that's when I got the idea to
build a cabinet to fit in that window
and do the same thing only using LEDs it
would be prettier mm-hmm and so what are
the the material is real quick that
we're using here and how this all works
well we're using a pine for the wood
we've got a merlot stain polyurethane
bunch of screws LED some resistors
switches stuff like that you know basic
basically it's a basic stuff to do an
LED circuitry and what would you say is
the total cost of a behemoth like this
somewhere in the neighborhoods of a
hundred 150 dollars somewhere in that
neighborhood give or take you know local
prices and what you actually decide to
build it out of this we made it out of
select pine which is the cheapest of all
the woods you can get and that was like
what 15 bucks a board right now why pine
pine it's cheap and it still looked
halfway decent you can make it out a
white oak red oak poplar but red oak was
almost $30 a board so we wanted to pine
yeah and this is soft - yeah soft easy
work and easily work stuff like that and
it's not a whole lot of carpentry
involved it was just all butt joints or
you just nail it all together stain it
finish it sand it okay so the standing
that's what's really made this pop I
mean it's not like you know a I mean I
guess everybody remembers the arcade
cabinet before we put the
well that was MDF and MDF just kind of
looks like garbage by itself MDF is
designed to be painted or covered in
some sort of way now with pine with real
wood grain like this you want to set it
off and that's when you'd use a stain
like this right here and this is Olympus
Merlot colored stain olimpic excuse me
and that's why we decided to use it of
course it's all a matter of personal
preference
mmm now what are the steps involved if
somebody's new to the idea of staining
wood how does that work
you just rub it in with the grain put it
on fairly heavily and then 15 minutes to
an hour later you come back and wipe it
all down and that'll smooth it out and
make it look really good and if you
decide you need to you can put multiple
coats of stain on to darken the color
okay so sand wipe down the stain with
the grain correct and let that sit for a
little while now you're gonna more or
less sand it down again after that's dry
it's gonna take about 24 hours to be on
your eye and then you use not sand paper
anymore but steel wool like this right
here and this is what's called Faurot
which means for zero gauge steel wool
which is ultra fine and all that's gonna
do is smooth it out and then you can go
on and put your polyurethane on which is
actually which gives it this nice shiny
okay you know if it gives it a nice
glossy feeling and this is polyurethane
right you gotta love the shiny in fact
my goats feeling a little Brown right
now shiny you do it on sale yeah I got
it on sale bet you did but this is
polyurethane right here and this goes on
just like paint and or stain goes with
the grain mmm let it dry you want to rub
it down with the Faurot again and put
you could put in at least two coats on
so what's the trick with applying the
poly you want to use something like this
sponge right here this sponge brush
because it's very very cheap it's a
couple of cents a brush and with that
once you're done you throw it away okay
once you use polish you can treat are
those ratchet awesome now the coolest
aspect and the geekiest aspect of course
is the fact that we've got these LED
glowy stuff at the bottom illuminating
our cocktail bottles or right dark
bottles but yes tasty beverage bottles a
superb rotisserie and that is work on a
really simple two by six parallel
circuit okay so how does that work
it sounds more complicated than what it
is
but I've got it set up on the breadboard
here assuming that there's a power
source coming here your positive would
go to the anode or the positive side of
an LED because LEDs are unidirectional
the real positive in a negative ones an
anode and then the other being the
cathode
yes a node positive cathode negative and
you just run from pot positive to anode
cathode to anode cathode to resistor
back to negative okay so why the
resistor the resistors there because
we're using a 9 volt power supply and
these are three point two volts an LED
with a 30 milliamp usage okay so how do
you figure out what size this is a
hundred yes resistant resistor and how
do you figure out what ohm resistor per
well we found this really really good
website it's a great utility a great
tool risa resource that's what I was
looking for if you're doing any kind of
LED circuitry because all you have to do
is tell it how many LEDs you're using
the forward voltage three point two
volts and the amount of electricity 30
milliamps and supply voltage and it'll
give you the best layout mm to do it
which that's where we got the six by two
or two by six excuse me one of the other
sure just like to get kicked in it
doesn't matter and resistor it'll tell
you all that it will tell you exactly
how to do it it will give you a
schematic or a diagram and leave them
pop it out Nancy if you so desired
answer for the win
sure whatever floats your boat but it's
really simple and all you have to do is
you do this circuit and then you lather
rinse and repeat to finish it now that's
not matter domes is only for our 9-volt
battery it move okay yes and then we've
even added a little switch Macabre here
yes which a little rocker switch kinda
like that she's over here so it can turn
on and off
yeah and there's things single throw a
single pole and what would you say life
expectancy is on these LEDs about 1100
hours so assuming they might run for
four hours a night hmm you know a for
four hours for every night they're
actually assuming that we're using this
every night with the cocktail
I don't think that yeah I'm saying that
you know and we have our big party on
the nights on the night that's going to
be awesome Williamsburg Virginia hak5
kicks it off no they'll be running for
like what ten hours mm-hmm something
like that it'll look good any other
resources that you want to mention for
anybody that's looking to do something
similar for anybody that's looking to do
some really good or get their hands on
some really good led projects is this
one gentleman that goes by Allen I can't
pronounce his last name he's based out
of Canada he's got amazing amazing led
projects and one in particular is he
actually installed ultra-bright LEDs and
his stairwell to illuminate it when
you're broken infrared barrier why bomb
is this because it was a really dark
hallway and today just it would be easy
that's awesome okay and of course
anybody with crazy mod ideas or wants to
shoot stuff by Westley's please email me
and let me know I want to hear all about
them hit up the mod section it's the mod
slash hack slash code section on the
forms right because we was like you know
you finish your mod go ahead and uh put
some pics and tell us all about it there
hmm so that's pretty much it here let's
uh head over Dalian see what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
