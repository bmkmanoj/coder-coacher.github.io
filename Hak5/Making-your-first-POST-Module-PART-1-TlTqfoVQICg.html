viewers like you
if you get value from the show and you
can spare even a dollar please consider
contributing at Metasploit minute calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in
I'm your host Rob fuller but you can
call me Moo bik's today we're gonna be
going over post modules actually writing
post modules that is very exciting Moo
bik's hey how's it going welcome to
awesome to be here in the hak5 warehouse
I'm so excited to be doing a new season
of that minute post modules man like
recap for me a little bit because I know
that we've talked about these a bit in
the past but what exactly is a post
module so a post module is an evolution
from from scripts right so Metasploit
had meterpreter scripts that we're
basically lists of commands that you do
in succession which were were powerful
but not really repeatable so you there
was no libraries there's no shared
anything of it so a post module is
literally what you're doing after you
get something yeah shell right right so
the script oh it's like I'm in now I
want to have some fun maybe wreak some
havoc probably not and now what is it
like what's the difference between the
scripts and a post module so the like I
said the scripts were not very
repeatable right so it had a bunch of
things you wanted to do but then you'd
have to rewrite it in another script so
and as programmers we all hate you know
having to do the exact same thing every
single time it's all about having like
the least amount of code reuse right so
what post modules did is that pushed a
bunch of things into libraries and now
you can actually have like write file
and it'll be a write file command will
work no matter what kind of matter
printer session you had no matter what
kind of system you're on anything it's
awesome cool so sounds like scripts are
great for little snippets and such but
the post modules are really where what
you should be using in your post
exploitation right so what I use scripts
for is I use scripts quite a bit with
when I want to
start off stuff so we've shown already
with IRB we've shown in in season four
with how to use IRB now once you're in
IRB you can do a lot of stuff but you
can't really do for loops and ifs and
stuff really easily like you can but
they're not as easy to understand and
repeating that process every time so I
then move from IRB into scripts and then
once I'm once I have a script solid I
use I'm making into a post module and
that's what we're gonna do today so what
kind of script are we going to be using
so an example way back in in 2010 I
wrote a set wallpaper meterpreter script
and the set wallpaper meterpreter script
was basically a joke right so you never
really want to use it on on a pen test
or something like a unless you're trying
to be a little mean or say hi I'm here
so what it did was basically it uploaded
a bitmap a BMP file and then it used a
registry key to set the wallpaper and
then used an execution of run dll 32 to
actually make it refresh the wallpaper
so the reason why I'm picking this today
is because it has all of those steps in
it so we're gonna learn how to do that
in a post module since it has you know
registry rights executions and also file
uploads all right so we should probably
go ahead and first test script you said
it was for in 2010 so let's run this
five-year-old script and see how it how
it goes yep so what I did was I actually
took the wallpaper script from from the
link and I'll zoom in right here so
here's the wallpaper script way back in
2011 is when I actually uploaded it so I
saved it now let's go over to a
wallpaper dot RB saved it in Metasploit
framework and that's where I have
Metasploit installed slash scripts slash
meterpreter slash wallpaper dot RB and
you can name it whatever you want the
great thing is like once it's named once
that file is written you can just run it
so there's no loading there's no
anything that you extra you have to do
it just shows up so we're gonna go over
here to a session we already have
sessions si2
that's I'm already in it that's
doesn't make any sense to do anything
more so run wallpaper
it should autocomplete here a second
there it is wallpaper so before I do
that I'm gonna just make sure that I
have everything set in this wallpaper
script so let's go through here we're
gonna say okay session equals client and
you used to have to do that it's too far
you used to have to set a client in
session to make equals so you can use
the client dot whatever stuff just to
make sure that it was cross-compatible
this is long gone you've never you never
have to do this anymore you just use
session for everything so that's
actually saying what your which
meterpreter session yours alright
alright yeah it's just an object it was
it was referenced weird leave in the
past where you sometimes it would be
client sometimes it be session anyways
so our wallpaper is going to be Kirby
dot BMP and we're gonna upload it it
says it's gonna be in the file and this
is incorrect because it's not going to
be in our data slash wallpaper directory
but this is a great way to say save this
stuff because this is actually a great
way to remember how to get to the
Metasploit directory because you can
have Metasploit anywhere on the
directory and using the MSF config dot
install route will tell it where to go
so you can actually always know where
that is so this is something that you
just want to kind of comment out for now
and I'm gonna say Kirby BMP is the
wallpaper and based is in slash route
okay so that that's just solved and so
we're actually saying it since last
route because that's where you've put it
on your alright actually where I have it
installed ok so we're gonna go through
background color it's gonna set it to
black refresh command this is the
special refresh command that I found on
a stack overflow way back in 2010 and so
that just what refresh to the desktop
yeah so if you set the registry key um
it doesn't really do anything to tell
you someone logs out logged again not as
good effect right yeah so this option or
actually ins in some sense maybe it is
the right effect depending on the prank
true you know the delay might be good
right
when they come back from lunch log back
in this option stuff was actually added
to scripts to kind of get it more up and
up-to-date but we don't need that
anymore it's it was it was pre post
module so they were trying to get
options into all the scripts I so
there's a dot dash H and everything to
set stuff options so temp directory so
this is what this is good this is kind
of cool so this is actually going to
find where % temp is and that's a
windows environmental variable and this
is actually going to go to the remote
host and expand that out to what where
it actually is
so wherever percent temp is and it could
be different well why would you need to
expand out an environment variable if
when you passes through the Windows
system anyway it's going to enumerate
that that variable I mean that's the
whole point of a environment there well
isn't it right because not always are in
not all circumstances does the does the
this is the meterpreter session know
what that is right so you might not have
all those variables available to you in
the calls that you're making right so
meterpreter does a bunch of API based
calling right so when it's when it's
running and shell code so it doesn't
always have those variables either
easily accessible at the high level that
it runs at or the low level it runs at
so it expands that and I'm gonna scroll
out so you can actually see all this
makes a it makes a random directory with
with eight eight carriage character so a
16 character 16 character so and then
create temp directory it actually does
the make der make the temp directory ok
so that all should work so this way
we're actually uploading our BMP into
that temp directory so it's not just
sitting in there in slash temp ok so
that's fine then it says new file
wallpaper and it's gonna name it the
exact same as well bit like wallpaper we
have there
and then on the FDR it-- it's gonna read
everything from that directory and
upload it into the remote host so this
is this is all the complicated stuff
that scripts had to do to get things to
work so this all this is is just to
upload it into a temporary directory yep
so far okay and then we actually write
our registry key so if key registry set
Val all this stuff is setting a registry
key okay I see yeah and just I can't
scroll over to do so registry string
value wallpaper sets all that exactly
where in temp directory so these these
dollar sign brackets mm-hmm and I'll
scroll in so you see that that means use
this variable inside the string so it's
a way to append a variable inside a
string in Ruby I think it's a really
cool way to do it that's pretty cool
okay and then and then all it does is
set the valuable value data to tile the
wallpaper and then runs the command so
when it when it's done it actually runs
the command that way it's set up there
channelized and hidden so it's running
the run DLL 32 that refreshes that
wallpaper in a in a hidden command
problem basically oh nice so let's go
ahead and what so you've already got a
session on your target machine here so
you know and do have this script oh do I
do we now have to send this script over
to or do we just run it locally we just
run it locally okay and it does all
things all right well as long as a
little latest version is saved let's go
ahead and run it it happens but before
we do that let's just stop and real
quick and say a huge thanks to all of
the patrons we have at patreon
patreon.com slash musics we have awesome
awesome support that that I have I
forget how many people did it like it's
a lot people are saying hey we love what
you're doing with Vic's we love the
Metasploit minute we want to continue to
see this happen
all right such a awesome warm fuzzy
feeling to see that people can support
this directly and make it happen yeah
and while you're sitting here right now
right in season five is completely
supported by patreon that's awesome it's
really cool that this is actually happen
so people get value from the show and
they feel like they want to give back
even just like a dollar they can go over
to Metasploit minute calm and that will
list all of the ways you know that we've
got cool like other swag and stuff that
you can get if you'd like but also you
can just even for just a dollar an
episode just become a patron yeah and
help us achieve some of these epic
milestones with our sets video feeds and
live streaming the show and even
in-house training come in here and yeah
okay so I'm excited to see this run
let's get Kerby be on the desktop okay
run wallpaper see if this works
info read can't find root is a directory
okay that's fine so what's what's
supposed to be at this base directory is
actually you can see that it's it's
joining the dated directory with the
wallpaper variable so we can actually
just say curvy dot BMP here and it'll
work there we go all right so we run
this again now it should work you can
see that it actually created the the
directory here with random text upload
incredible at the APA and didn't work
why why didn't it work I don't know like
so the so the problem with the problem
with the execution of the run DLL 32 was
that it's it's an undocumented API call
so no one actually knows like the the
functionality behind it well I'm sure
people at Microsoft know exactly
everything but sometimes it doesn't work
on RDP and that's what we're looking at
right here but if we scrolled over to
the actual system that wallpaper would
about do it
I see is there another way to like force
it to or something
we can try logging out and login again
we should have Kerby hey there we go
there we go alright though so the
interesting thing about that is it works
perfectly on Windows XP and and I looked
so hard I looked trying to find how to
make it so that the update stuff worked
and if you read through the blog post I
actually made comments on on how that
was a pain in the butt but times have
changed I mean you're talking about
this was 2011 on an XP host and now this
is being applied to a Windows 7 machine
so yeah and and it's already PD actually
that's that's the difference here is
that the update preferences doesn't work
on our repeat ok so but let's let's move
this into a post module should we do
that right now yeah let's do that so how
do you do that well ok you explain that
the difference between a script and post
module is that the script is just like
snippets really and it's specific to
your engagement or to your target and a
post module something that can be reused
a lot it's like built-in to like explain
to me more about how it is just built
into your phone to your shell alright so
when we made auxiliary modules we
actually talked about putting it into
the dot MSF four slash modules directory
and that's actually what we've already
done already so I don't want to go into
that again since we've already done that
but I will say that I took a post module
delete users from the let's on singular
role in here so this is under modules
post windows manage delete user dot RB
so I just open that up in in sublime and
it's a pretty simple script like this is
all there is to it
it just says delete user and that's the
great thing that's that's the entire
process for that post module that's it
ok so that's the great thing about the
post modules are generally a library oh
I see oh so you don't have to think
about like all of that all of those
lines of code just to upload a file into
a temporary directory got to create the
directory and all of that stuff this
is going to simplify the process as it
were yeah and make it more uniform right
so I've already taken I've already taken
the delete user script we copied it over
to a set wallpaper RB over in modules
post msf bennett set wallpaper okay so
that's already there and I've made a few
changes so the first one is I'm going to
include the MSF colon colon post cone
cone file that means that I now have all
of the post module library for file
based things and we'll go into what what
you get because of that as well as the
Windows registry and I've made the you
know default changes to wallpaper set
for the name the description who who
made it on the platform and stuff like
that and then finally I've made a
register options so opt file or actually
it's opt path sorry I believe and then a
BMP and that's I'm going to be an option
that you can set now instead of the the
script that we had with no options it's
just always that same awesome kirby
photo yes I mean who would want to
change it right but now now you do have
that ability to change it you can make
so many different options in this now
that it's a module instead of scrap okay
okay so like similar to how with all of
the other modules within Metasploit when
I say show options that I can see like
oh this is what I can do and then I set
my options all over the same so if you
didn't want to use Kirby JPEG which I
don't know why you would not want right
you it really we should just bundle the
bitmap with the post exploitation module
yeah right but but now it makes a lot
more versatile than a single use single
single target kind of angry and that's
why that's why I go from IRB to script
to post module that way I can then reuse
the code very easily and it becomes more
Emma dextrous cool so then after that
that's that's pretty much it it looks
like I mean you register the option
right so I've registered the option now
now I've copied this over just so I know
that's the registry key and I'm gonna
scroll but so I know that's the registry
key I'm gonna have to set so just as a
as a you know note in there right so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take all
of the stuff that I had in the script
I'm gonna just literally copy and paste
it over inside of the run so it's
obviously I want to tab all this over
and make it all look all nice sure we
can make it pretty a little later but
let's let's save that and see if it runs
so actually I'm going to have to get a
new shell and I can do that real quick
and this is the web developer method
that I recommend for anyone doing dev is
because it's just so easy that you can
just now I have a new session so you
don't have to create it by I see right
so I'm back in here
I got a session and I'm going to load
path and we've talked about loading path
in the other modules so root MSF for
modules and that loaded our one post
module so it since it loaded correctly
that means that nothing in our code will
will mess up so far so far like we know
that the code is is up to spec so we use
post and then we did MSF minute and for
somebody windows nope
so the the thing that I fell into here
is that the post modules actually have
to have another layer to them and we're
gonna just make that real quick so the
actual architecture so windows oh you
actually have to if if you don't put it
in the appropriate folder it doesn't
load so so so it loaded so it should be
actually there's nevermind so use posts
and for some reason I'm not for some
reason it's not tab completing stuff so
post mfb in it set wallpaper weird Oh
opt files not yeah because this is why I
thought I changed it to opt path so
let's try again yeah there we go
alright so just so now just as before if
you say show options you well if you had
some text in there it would do that oh
just like that there we go alright so
let's change the wallpaper back
personalize let's get rid of Kirby for
now okay mmm good so let's change it
just to simple pictures why not so we
are right and so let's set our session
for some reason my tab completion has
gone away so think you're in session two
three so so since we're not actually
using the bitmap option yet we don't
have to set it right it does say
required though because we left this as
true right and you still have just you
know copied and pasted this from the
previous script so it's still kind of
hard coded in fact to Kirby exactly so
what we can do is we can set bmp-2 so
route if it is required since we left
that in as required and we're going to
change that in a second but it doesn't
really do anything so we're gonna type
run and you can see that it's completed
and then we're just gonna refresh and
that still didn't do anything so let's
try and see if this command actually
works so I'm gonna copy are you just
gonna do this locally yeah I'm gonna see
if it works just locally yeah see that
command doesn't work on Windows 7 and
RDP for some reason hmm all right well
you know log out log back in let's see
if that does the trick
yep
and so we go we know that our post
module works we know that we've gotten
close enough so that we can start making
modifications and it actually changed
back for some reason that's into really
yeah that's that's crazy
so Windows Windows Vista and above used
JPEGs and different things so especially
with its rotating stuff so you can see
that the I'll zoom in you can see that
it's a slideshow background alright so
that's why so maybe it's yeah in the
rotation right so but you know with the
right registry value there's a way to do
it totally yeah so once once we're done
actually getting further into this we're
gonna actually split this up so that we
can get a little smaller segments
because I know that all of you have
asked for for more minute friendly
Metasploit minutes yes so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna stop here
because it actually works right and
we're going to say that next time we're
gonna show up and start minimizing this
using those libraries mastering the
little bit
Awesome's down to an awesome little
kirby wallpaper nugget that you could
also use for other wallpapers if you
don't want my cat on your victims
screens don't understand why but
otherwise yeah that sounds rad and you
know we actually have a treat next time
because we have a trick that we're gonna
use that it's going to make it update
even in an RDP I like Trex Trex I like
you know what I like I like the all of
the Metasploit minutes in fact I feel
like all of these were winners and I do
want to again remind you that if you
want to become one of the people that
are supporting these awesome Metasploit
minutes as they were you can go over to
Metasploit minute comm as well as
patreon.com slash rubik's yeah you VIX
mu b IX awesome well thank you again Rob
this is very exciting stuff you know
again huge thanks to everybody every
dollar counts towards getting you here
making more shows so great I know that
you will also be here very soon yeah
because we're doing some exciting stuff
in in this year warehouse really yes
what
are we doing there well we're doing a
little bit of pen testing with hack five
a scene with hack five if you like pen
testing if you like hack five if you
want to come down and get yourself this
awesome bag of all of the fine gear that
you'll find yeah you know what I'm
talking about you're teaching one of the
courses it's so great that's right
training over at hack five you can find
all of the details at hack five dot org
slash training I'm just kind of throwing
this out here right now because it's
very early bird special right now is our
our very first course and we're super
excited to teach things like Metasploit
Wi-Fi pineapple social engineering with
three USB rubber ducky so some other fun
things in the works we can talk about
and later shows but yes yeah do we have
any idea how much that's going it's it's
going to be very introductory specially
priced for the first one okay so
everybody wants to get in on it right
now so not very many seats not very many
seats no yes so we just thought we would
let you guys know because just don't
tell anyone
yeah just keep it between us at the
minute the minutes a minute
minutes yes speaking of that Metasploit
minute comm is where you can find all of
the shows and again thank you for your
support so until next time I'll mix and
I'll be hacking till the cows come home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
