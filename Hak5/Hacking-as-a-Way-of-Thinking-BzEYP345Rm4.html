the 90s what we called phone phreaking
and it was like building these boxes
that violated trusts in the phone system
that let us get free long-distance if
you can remember what long-distance was
hacking is in criminal hacking is a
technique hacking is a mindset it's a
tool set it is hacking as a way of
thinking the tools of hackers and the
techniques of hackers can be employed to
commit crimes but a key is always about
like breaking things to make them better
we're making the world a better place
we're all fighting for the same thing we
all want universal human rights we want
the Internet to flourish as this
beautiful platform where everyone has
equal access so that we can all
communicate without persecution from
some big brother or some oppressive
government it's beautiful the world has
never known an infrastructure a land
that allows everyone to be equal when I
go online your your black text on a
white screen we're all equal and judged
by what we say and think not our
financial status or our religious
background or our skin color it's
beautiful I don't take it personally
when people use hacking techniques to
break things because ultimately what
it's gonna do is it's gonna make the
world a better place when good hackers
say oh hey there's the flaw let's fix it
like in the nineties like everything was
inherently broken and now we look in his
post Snowden World and all social
networks are employing the strongest
encryption possible and most sites are
adopting two-factor authentication and
other you know geeky techniques to
secure users we're in a really beautiful
Renaissance period of security and all
it's doing is empowering people my
purpose in hacking is much like
everybody else's purpose in acting
ultimately we're trying to make that
most secure system as possible we're
trying to implement the strongest
cryptography and other tools of math
that enable humans to connect to each
other without fear of prosecution from
governments or corporations or whatever
have you that's what I'm playing
well that's what it feel like all
hackers are fighting for is equal access
and the strongest security possible so
that we can all live in a place that
enables the fundamental rights of all
humans everywhere of that freedom of
expression without persecution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
