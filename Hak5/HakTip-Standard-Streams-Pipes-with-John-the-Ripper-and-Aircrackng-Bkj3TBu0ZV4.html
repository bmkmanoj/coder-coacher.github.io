welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down the concepts tools and
techniques for hackers network gurus and
IT ninjas I'm your host Aaron kitchen
and today we're getting a little bash
happy something called standard streams
and pipelines a practical example this
time we'll be breaking the encryption of
a WPA protected wireless access point is
going on who doesn't love a little
password cracking right but first it's
time for the terms standard streams and
unix-like operating systems and windows
to some extent are the inputs and
outputs between a program and its
environment
now our environment in this case is
going to be bash it's the born-again
shell my personal favorite there couple
out there like sea shell anyway
furthermore there's three kinds of
standard streams standard in standard
out and standard error now standard
input data is usually text that goes
into the program and nine times out of
ten it's just whatever you type in on
the keyboard
similarly standard output is where the
program writes its output data now this
could be it to a file to a comp or the
network quite often it's simply your
terminal or your display now not all
programs have input and output data for
example dir and dose or LS and UNIX
don't take any input you issue LS and it
outputs the contents of the directory
similarly issuing rename or mV to rename
a file doesn't send any output you input
with the keyboard the old file name and
new file name to the MV or rename
program using your keyboard and then the
file names change I mean nothing really
that exciting to write home about huh
now finally standard error is another
output from the program it's completely
independent from standard output and
it's used to send error messages which
are typically going to show up in the
terminal or your display it's just nice
to know that they're separate and it can
go somewhere else if need be now I
mention sending the output somewhere
else
exactly what we're going to be doing
today while the output of a program
typically goes to the term model it
doesn't have to for example if we take
the output of the LS or dir programs and
send them into the input of the Moore
program now Moore allows us to read the
output of a last dir one page at a time
and then we can use the spacebar to
advance by the way the Q key quits there
now this is what's called piping we can
run two programs together the output of
the first program gets piped into the
input of the next now there's a lot more
to redirecting and standard input and
output but I'm sure we'll get to it all
in due time I think we might be ready
for a nice little real-world example and
in just a bit we're going to be taking
the output of John the Ripper a
fantastic brute-force program into the
input of aircrack-ng the hackers choice
for all sorts of wireless mischief fun
now first let's thank one of our
excellent sponsors computer disasters
eventually happened to everyone whether
it's a virus a hard drive crash a fire
alien abduction whatever but if you get
carbonite online backup before your
disaster you'll be worryfree cuz your
files will be backed up automatically
and safely online it's really easy to
get them back - you can access them
anytime anywhere from a computer and
iPad a smart phone you could be a dinner
and just check in on them and see that
they're happy and safe carbonate

with purchase now if you're not familiar
with John the Ripper it's a fantastic
tool for cracking passwords you can use
it to generate or process word lists or
even come up with them on the fly with a
little bit of brute force and John the
Ripper is the perfect companion to the
aircrack-ng suite of networked tools and
fun you know it's all that fun Wi-Fi
mischief yeah
now I've already gone into my wireless
card and turned it and monitor mode of
set packet sniffing of deauthorize users
captured a bunch of traffic including
the four-way handshake and this means I
can start attempting to crack that
pre-shared key and if that all sounded
great to you don't worry about it we're
going to be getting into all of that in
an upcoming hack tip so the aircrack-ng
program wants three things the bssid of
the access point we're cracking the
packet capture file containing that
handshake and a word list or dictionary
file now since the password of our WPA
protected wireless access point isn't
actually in the dictionary we're going
to send in John the Ripper John's a
nifty little program has this really
cool option called incremental which
will try every password possible it's
eight characters by default you can set
it now with John we specify STD output
option and that will output the
candidate password that is generating to
standard output so using what we've just
learned we can take the output from John
the Ripper which is busy coming up with
every password possible right and we can
pipe it into aircrack-ng which will then
just go ahead and try them against our
captured handshake now in anywhere
between a second and sixteen years we'll
have cracked to this network rockin on
now stay tuned because coming up on hack
tip we're going to be cracking your very
first wireless network we're going to be
getting into all sort of nerdy details
about redirecting and a whole bunch more
until then I want to hear your feedback
what programs or command are giving you
warm fuzzies hit me up tips at hack five
org and be sure to check out our sister
show hack five for more great stuff just
like this I'll be there reminding you to
trust your Technol us
