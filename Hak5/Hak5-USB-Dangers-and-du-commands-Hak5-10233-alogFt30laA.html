by netflix it's time for port 995 isn't
that the port number yeah that's the one
for the email with the SSL and have you
tried monkey brand beer it's so good
haven't ya interceptor monkeys coming
back hard oh really oh yeah awesome
alright so the first email is from net
spider he said recently you talked about
all the USB drives that you got from the
show yes and how dangerous it can be to
just plug them into a computer this then
begs the question how do you make a USB
Drive safe to use well I know it's kind
of a weird situation because which one
of these is not like the other you know
oh it is rubber ducky this one is
actually legit one and this one is
actually here we go here we go they take
the blue pill the flash drive is be full
of data tick the red pill last Drive
will own your computer we get it but and
it actually gets a little bit more
nefarious so Jason just released some
new firmware for international support
we've got from we're coming around the
corner with like mass storage for the
rubber ducky so it could go both ways
where you could plug it into the machine
and be like oh it's a thumb drive except
it's got a time bomb where it waits you
know ten minutes and then it becomes a
USB head and starts wreaking havoc on
your computer you can use like a USB
analyzer to take a look and make sure
that it seems legit but honestly now
like this isn't even something I'm like
I okay I can see like one way that you
could potentially plug a USB Drive into
a computer and not be too worried yeah
and that is if you've got it bound to a
virtual machine but net ordered to bind
it to a virtual it's like we get emails
when people like hey Darren try this
shell script or hey how am i executable
it's great I wrote it in Visual Basic
you should run it and I'm like nothing
sure so that's when you boot up the VM
and put it in a sandbox and you're like
what does this do you know so I could
see maybe plugging in a
a suspicious thumb drive into a virtual
machine but then you still need the
vendor ID and the Product ID of it ahead
of time okay so I don't really know a
good answer to this but I'm gonna pose
this back up to you guys because I know
with Linux there's a way with live USB
and USB core and all those other things
where you could probably just say don't
execute I don't really know I just know
that the state of USB right now is that
at least society wise these are trusted
because all I have is files on them if
we've become accustomed to blindly
plugging them in and even though
Microsoft has gone through great lengths
to like not autorun stuff anymore thanks
guys
you know it totally changes the game
when suddenly there's a fundamental
break in the inherent trust that is the
the human and the keyboard computer well
yeah so I don't I don't have a good
answer to that because you know even if
you could pop it open this doesn't look
that much different from this they
actually look very similar I mean the
micro SD card might give it away but
actually you don't even need the micro
SD card in here yeah you can burn it to
the ROM but whatever yeah all right cool
well hopefully if somebody hasn't yet
hit me up because I know that there's
not gonna be like a kernel module or
something so you know right feedback a
hack 5 org and thanks for sending that
in and I'm sorry that we don't always
have you know
oh it's X it's sometimes it's but we
didn't go to school for that stuff I
don't know no nobody goes to school for
this stuff hacking is like you know all
right handy monkey related Dan g-man I
gotta go ship some boxes all right the
next one is from Matt he said thanks for
the awesome show gives me something to
do in the afternoons at work where the
days are slow I hope you watch it when
the days are quick - in the last episode
Darren showed us how to list directories
and grab the size of each each directory
with a long command I find that using D
you tack s KH has the same output
without the need for short sort
backslash cut back slash X Arg yes yeah
I mean I just did it
it's ok yeah it doesn't just do
so what I'm saying it works about the
same but it gets my files as well and
I'm sure that there's just another flag
to do that and yeah I think what I might
have been illustrating in that nibble is
that ridiculously awesome stuff if
possible when you pipe this thing to
that thing to that thing to that thing
and then you know said och unique Bob's
your uncle but you know there's also
that's just the fun way about Linux like
there's a million ways to do everything
so yeah thanks for sending that and
that's a lot of fun yeah hey stay tuned
