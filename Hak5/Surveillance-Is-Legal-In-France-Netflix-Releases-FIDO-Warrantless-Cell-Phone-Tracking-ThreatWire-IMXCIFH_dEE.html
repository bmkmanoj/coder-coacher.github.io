surveillance of its citizens a u.s.
court deems warrantless cell phone
tracking to be legal and unleash the
hounds Netflix announces Fido its
security analysis and response system
all that coming up now on threat wire
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire for Wednesday May 6 2015 your
summary of what's threatening our
security privacy and Internet freedom I
would like to start with a huge thanks
to everyone who has supported the
relaunch of this show we couldn't be
more proud of this awesome community if
you're new to threat wire on the hack 5
Channel this is the show that we did for
a year on tech feed and now we brought
it back so with that let's go ahead and
get started
halfway through 2014 privacy advocates
got a surprising victory in the world of
data tracking an 11th Circuit Court in
Florida said it was illegal to track a
person via their cell phone data without
a warrant because it violated his
reasonable expectation of privacy and
the Fourth Amendment this was during the
US versus Davis trial
Gus unfortunately that same victory has
been overturned as of May 5th by the
same Circuit Court deeming it within the
guidelines of the law to track a
person's cell phone without a warrant
they overturned this decision because
the cell phone location data isn't the
users property but the phone carriers
something that falls under the third
party doctrine the ruling reads Davis
can ascertain either ownership nor
possession of the third party's business
records he sought to suppress instead
those cell tower records were created by
MetroPCS stored on its own premises and
subject to its control while the
defendant in this case was using an
older model phone which lacks the
precision of tracking in today's
smartphones and this is pointed out in
the ruling it may be misinterpreted by
other lower courts and assumed to be
about all smartphones the
constitutionality of cell phone tracking
is still in a legal gray area until it's
brought up to the Supreme Court
apparently Netflix is into open-source
development as well as streaming all the
TV shows who'd have thought they just
announced the availability of their open
source system called Fido short for
fully integrated defense operation which
will detect analyze and respond to
security threats the download and
explain
is over on github but it's basically an
automated layer for evaluating possible
security threats and responding to them
accurately to lesson the manual workload
that these kind of flags are to network
admins Netflix robots mm-hmm and from
over the pond the French parliament cast
a sweeping yes vote on a new law
allowing intelligence gathering after
terrorist attacks in January left 17
dead authorities will be able to spy on
digital communications of anyone deemed
linked to a terrorist to the extent of
even being able to put cameras in
private residences and enabling key
loggers on a computer recordings could
be kept for a month in metadata for five
years yikes our featured comment today
comes from the aftermath who are in
response to Facebook's internet.org
announcement says how can this show even
suggest anything Zuckerberg does as a
good thing you are supposed to be proud
internet supporters and privacy
conscious individuals yet you mentioned
the scum that is Facebook in a positive
light it's disingenuous to your viewers
and I would like to say you've got a
point but here's what I think
facebook.com has had a long history of
meddling and data of its users and using
that information for profit via
advertisements and data collection their
Terms of Service changes regularly as do
their security controls we've actually
been delving into decentralized social
networks on hack 5 which I think you
might find interesting
but facebook.com/ is a social network
the company has been a supporter of a
free internet for all because it truly
is crucial to have that access in this
day and age internet org is supposed to
do this and I am supportive giving that
access to editing body who doesn't
currently have it of course as a
developer you're still going to have to
play by Facebook's rules have a look at
their technical and their practical
guidelines as Patrick mentioned as well
as their legal terms which you have to
abide by if you want your website to be
included they also mentioned your
website can't include SSL and TLS it
will work on the Android app but this is
a huge concern for up pretty much
everyone and we don't know if they're
going to allow VPNs as well this is
going to be something that I'm gonna
keep a very close eye on thanks for the
comment the aftermath and of course if
