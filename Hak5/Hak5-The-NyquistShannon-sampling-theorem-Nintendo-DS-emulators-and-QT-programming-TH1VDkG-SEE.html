and roms for creative types and
programming with the cute ide all that
more this time on hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by nokia go to assist express support
smarter with go to assist express and
domain com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
hello and welcome to hack five my name
is darren kitchen and this is your
weekly dose of wars what are you doing
aight Batman poo poo boom ha yes your
weekly dose of technol lust for sham hi
hey moved out here yet um yes I
hitchhiked all the way here and I just
decided to spend a couple of days here
did you know I'm staying upstairs yeah I
realize this yes daddy what are you
doing here in the Bay Area apartment
hunting as it were I know I found a
couple of places oh not the perfect
place but at least I have a general idea
of what I want now nice so yeah snow
apartment hunting in January and then
i'll be out here in February hey
february's also the beginning of season
9 yes perfect timing alright so also
last time we spoke I was talking about
how I was flying back to Virginia and
then it was gonna drive across the
country with deke I was like your car
yeah to the new viewers this is what we
do sometimes oh yeah yeah I got my car
Kirby's back yay cousin she's just may
be hiding gonna hang but she's still
adjusting but you know she's she hears
dogs outside it freaks her out she's
never been around a dog poor thing we're
conditioning her and adjusting her yeah
Julie she'll do all right and we brought
bracket brought back yingling brought
Brock Brock Brock the people on to the
east of the Mississippi this is why I
need you back is my goes I know that's
why I need to be out here so we can do a
blocks every week see then I wouldn't be
able to do a 40-second moment of silence
while I drink wine and try to think what
no I'd be too busy slapping you around
so that doesn't happen got ya yeah well
we've got a great show this week we are
having our wonderful yingling those who
are east of the Mississippi I'm my own
Dallas I miss it so much anger seems
okay
okay that's all right I don't get that
either you know what I have in Missouri
light budweiser yeah that's all I have
it's no fun sometimes landshark if I'm
lucky slim pickins anyway we are we were
talking about more than just beer and
kitties this episode actually we have a
little bit of feedback from the last as
you guys know last few episodes getting
really deep into a little thing that I
am so near and dear about phone
phreaking not necessarily getting free
phone calls but necessarily
understanding the fundamentals of the
way the telephone system works and some
of those interesting theories that
translate to so many different things
that that that you find in anything
that's analog-digital whatever the
internet yes so what kind of feedback
have we been getting uh well actually we
got an email from Keith right okay yeah
and I think he's curious about some my
quest stuff oh let's see what he said
here so he said in the last two shows
you were talking about sampling at 8
kilohertz correct however I did not see
you mentioning the subject of the
Nyquist rate with an 8 kilohertz
sampling rate you're limited to sampling
of a 4 kilohertz audio signal also when
I did my training in electronics the
acceptable audio right bit rate for a
radio telephone system was considered to
be about 200 Hertz to two kilohertz and
I was from Keith yeah there's there's a
whole lot of stuff that goes into this
and I figured why don't we just go ahead
and break it down in some more patient
so we did last time it's I've actually
got these new guys here that would help
out some of the colors here all right
we'll go with purple so what is Nyquist
right sparkles that's a that's really
it's supposed to be a cue people Nyquist
actually this guy he's an American
Swedish guy and I kinda Nyquist and
basically his theory law for Mila
whatever you want to consider it and
trust me I'm not putting the mouth down
on the board is essentially saying that
to to get a to get a good copy of an
analog sound and analog sounds usually
like you know wave yeah right you need
to sample it at twice the frequency that
it is ok so we first need to understand
what are these frequencies that we're
talking about because last week and the
week before we were talking about the
telephone network we were mainly talking
about 8,000 Hertz or 8 kilohertz and we
also talked about how there are some
others that we commonly see for example
CD audio which is 44100 hurts right
that's a lot so why why do we have those
well because of the human voice now the
human voice typically is at least in
telephony we're talking about 300 to
3400 hurts and that's that's what we're
going to hear now the human ear we can
hear anything from generally accepted 20
to 20,000 Hertz so what this means is
and you know it's kind of interesting to
read about the frequencies at which a
male speaks versus a female speed and
what the highest octave we got a bit of
a higher pitch yeah yeah it's like 165
or no 257 anyway like some operators can
like do some crazy stuff with their
voices but essentially what it means is
if we have you know if we have an analog
waveform say it's like you use a blue
it's good blue for analog waveform so
I've got this waveform here right and
it's looking like this okay and let's
say for example that is for kilohertz
right that's 4,000 Hertz that's that's
how many pulses a second that we see
here if we were to sample that at 4,000
times a second then what we'd see is a
sample hear a sample hear a sample hear
a sample here I feel like I'm a science
class again well I got five recently and
it's been fun but so you know we'd see a
point here and like last time we said
that this is like 255 and that this
would be like zero
128 in the middle and we've kind of like
come up with a binary equivalent of what
this rate would be well we're a sample
again what well we're over here or over
here wherever here and all this would
look like is 255 across the board or in
binary would be eight consecutive ones
eight consecutive ones and we wouldn't
get the tone at all that's completely
not what it is so what it's so Nyquist
this guy realized well if a save for
example for Hertz or four cups are 4,000
Hertz or four kilohertz if that's the
highest possible frequency that you're
going to have on your band with a
band-limited channel or frequency it
says that you're going to have to sample
it at twice the frequency so that you
get all of the fidelity and you don't
get what's called aliasing so we
actually to do eight thousand samples a
second yep on a four killer town we
would get this and then all of a sudden
we would say oh hey goes down there and
then up here down there and up here and
then digitally we can represent this a
lot better than we would if we were to
you know if we were to do a lower sample
rate okay and it's called oversampling
technically really we only have two over
sample by a little bit but but by
doubling the the samples that we do we
have a much better chance of getting a
better quality sound so when we look at
this 44 104 CD audio that's important
because and let's say let's move half of
this here so since human hearing is
between 20 and two thousand Hertz right
well this right here the 44100 as our
Nyquist frequency is this a Nyquist
sample of 20 20 50 Hertz so that's too
high for human hairs yeah that's
actually two thousand and fifty Hertz
over yeah over what we can here and you
know what that right there is what we
call the headroom it's just a little
extra room to make sure that when we do
our sampling we're not missing any
we're not getting any nasty aliasing
aliasing and audio is very similar to a
leasing that you probably already know
of if you have an LCD monitor or even a
CRT really because you've probably
always seen it with pixels and stuff
like that so if I were to draw an X
right we're to draw a pretty X here and
let's let's just imagine that's like a
like a cereth X or something I'm not
feeling the best X here but you know
imagine that's our font you know as long
as it's not Comic Sans you know who you
people are and we were to represent that
digitally well if we had a really low
resolution you know like if you're on
like an apple too or something like that
what you would end up seeing is its some
blocky representation that's like this
right each of these right being pixels
and man is that not pretty so to
anti-alias that like we've you know just
like we're doing the Nyquist rate and
sampling and multiple times over we see
the same theory going on here where you
know using another color here will
imagine that we have these lighter
shaded pixels right to next to them and
if these blue ones like those were black
and these that I'm drawing right here
with dots be kind of a grayish color
would be kind of grayish and then to the
human eyes it would look more pleasing
more it would look more similar to what
we're expecting and that's exactly what
we're talking about with the
digital-to-analog conversion there it's
just it's just a matter of sampling at a
high enough frequency so that you know
it sounds like human speech and in fact
I think there was a study done we
glossed over last time but there was a
study done that found that a bit rate of
like 400 I want to say clip it's a
second or something like that is is the
least that a human can can process and
understand like human speech yeah so you
know because human speeches is within a
very small frequency yeah actually you
want to talk about a frequency that you
may be aware of here
this is a fun one so we talked about how
20,000 hertz and and i don't know that
it really depends on a lot of variables
like who the person is yeah what your
environmental variables are this room
not acoustically great but we still
shoot in it we're pretty young so we can
hear a lot of frequencies as we get
older our hearing degrades right there's
one in particular I think it's about
16,000 hurts and you may be familiar
with that because essentially some older
CRT's especially televisions or the
cheaper ones will create that that
frequency I know exactly what you're
talking about yeah buzzing like a player
right now so annoying I'll play right
now it's gonna it's gonna really upset a
lot of like if you can't hear that yeah
then sorry you're hearing starting to go
but if you're if you're like dying in
agony right now I hate that noise but it
like it like grains my head and it makes
me feel all nauseous and you know I'm
not gonna throw up front from it but
it's just so annoying yeah you know
every time when I'm at home and my mom
goes in her bedroom and I'm in my
bedroom like separate rooms can't see
what she's doing but I can hear her turn
on the TV because it makes that yeah it
makes that loud buzzing sound and I just
yell at her I'm like mom quit using that
TV you know buy a new TV it's like how
do you know I turned it on sounds not on
yeah she needs to get naked here's an
LCD you know I know how to a flat screen
for Christmas or something that's really
nice so if for example we were trying to
take that it'd take a 1600 or 16,000
hurt analog waveform we would have to
sample it at at the very nice to 32,000
or 32 kilohertz and I don't actually now
that I say that I say that mid a block
imagining that when we put the episode
out that when I insert that sound people
will hear it but I don't actually know
what the audio bit rate or audio
frequency I think we I think we encode
at a high enough frequency that that's
going to come through for those of you
watching like you know I'm a class watch
your back and find out yeah that'd be
interesting but but that's why we have
44 104 CDs because that will cover
most of the gamma of human hearing and
that's why we have 8,000 for telephone
audio is because basically it's within
300 to 3400 meaning we have about six
hundred Hertz of headroom that's awesome
there's a lot more to it I can't get
into all of the crazy acoustical stuff
it's a lot of it's beyond me but there
are some pretty good articles i will
link up in the show notes for those of
you that are interested and thank you so
much Keith for sending that email by
because well I did gloss over it I love
it when you guys call me out on that now
I'll gladly explain that stuff and
having fun with a whiteboard I like the
whiteboard yeah it's fun and when we
redo this at and totally mounting a
camera above so I don't have like a what
is it called a keystone where the image
is anyway I'm totally getting off track
here as if there was one thanks Janet ah
anything else going on that's about it
yeah got it alright cool well then we
will see you guys on the other side
we've got a great show like I said Jen's
here talking about some emulation for
the nintendo DS jason's getting into the
acute ide it's very cute otherwise known
as cutie for those of you that don't
pronounce it that way but yeah that's
gonna be a lot of fun stick around and
we will see you at the end of the show

lot of letters asking me for help with
d/s and PSP homebrew that said exactly
one person has asked me if it's possible
to play DS homebrew without actually
owning a DS now in the beginning when
the DS launch people figured oh man it's
going to take them forever to figure out
how to emulate both screens it's going
to take ages and ages oh look it's been
ages now playing DS homebrew projects on
your PC piece of cake today we're going
to take a look at the no cash gba
emulator which is perfect cuz it's a
two-for-one you get DS and GBA homebrew
first off head to no gba calm then
download no cash GBA scroll down to grab
a zip file extract wherever you please
and run the executable you can use a
controller or keyboard for the keys and
a mouse or tablet for the touchscreen
and voila absolutely idiot proof of
course you're going to need something to
run with no cash GBA and I have got the
perfect thing to talk about today I want
to revisit colors now this is something
that first came out in 2007 but now it's
got a lot more going forward and it's on
the iphone as well so let's take a
deeper look colors was created back in
2007 by Jen's Andersen a former demo
senior turned pro gaming developer with
titles like chronicles of riddick escape
from butcher bay and the darkness
ignoring those games though I'm
definitely a fan of his after something
upon colors again recently I'm blown
away by the creations artists have made
both on the DS
and iphone versions from the App Store
you can grab the light or full download
but with the full one going for 499 you
have to really like drawing on the phone
or iPad or enjoy supporting cool
developer is in order to give it a go
now I know this is obvious thanks to my
gaming bias but I totally love the DS
version better than the iphone ones
shocking I know I know I know but I'm
all thumbs when it comes to drawing and
I don't even think an ipad would make my
line work any smoother the worst part is
that you probably couldn't tell whether
I used a pencil my thumb's or my
forehead to paint because I'm really
just that bad other people however just
rocked my world it's a really simple
paint program but people are putting
together amazing compositions I love the
ability to watch how they were created
from start to finish when looking
through the gallery being able to check
out the gallery from the d/s iPhone or
at colors collecting smiles calm is a
great feature and dare I say and
educational 12 now mr. Anderson put
together some smart code here since it
can actually tell which version of the
d/s I'm running it on I'm still using
the acekard for all my DS homebrew needs
but there is a difference between the XL
and the d/s light in my lovely nerf que
cette it's just fantastic and if you're
still using a light you should probably
get one the one for the XL is kind of
odd just because it's big enough as it
is but anyway if I put colors on my XL
it says oh no you have no pressure
sensitivity so you suck put it in a
light so if I put it in my light it will
then ask me to calibrate the stylist for
the pressure sensitivity and it will
continue to learn my strokes as I
practice more and more like I said it
doesn't make a difference to me but
perhaps you'll do better now you've got
your canvas go forth and play hey buddy
why the long face my fresh rain from the
evil darkness wait there's evil dark net
I don't know what we're getting for the
holidays I didn't realize is celebrated
oh who is he evil Frank hmm Frank eel
Frank he's an exchange 50 server from
Ontario oh dear God
sound evil Oh have you thought about
getting him a domain name like evil
Frank calm yeah yeah I did it for my
sister last year and she loved it you
gotta get your name before it's taking
man and dude you are in luck you can get
a calm for less than 10 bucks a year you
go to domain calm and check out with the
coupon code hak5 wait I do yeah well
it's the perfect gift for those who have
everything everything but domain name oh
yeah I guess get fifteen percent off to
Maine names virtual private servers and
hosting or even a nude on me domain and
enjoy domain com blistering fast DNS and
hosting infrastructure simply checkout
with coupon code hak5 got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
com want a chance to win a new phone how
about a quarter million dollars nokian
ATT have launched the 10 million dollars
calling all innovative North America
contest challenging mobile app
developers and game developers to create
the next level of apps for the nokia n8
and ov store using the new Nokia cute
SDK the contest will have two phases and
winners was selected by a performance
nuovi store by a panel of judges winners
will receive no key devices cash prizes
up to 250 thousand dollars and
potentially even inclusion in a 1.9
million dollar marketing campaign for
their app so over the next few weeks
we're going to be running down the ins
and outs of the Nokia cute SDK showing
you how to get started developing for
Nokia Symbian devices and this week
we're going to show you how to get
started with that SDK so you guys know
we're all about mobile applications
nokia has been kind enough to provide us
with this awesome any running the
symbian three operating system which
gives us an awesome opportunity to check
out the cute sdk really really powerful
piece of software it allows you to be
run right software for symbian my mo
linux mac and windows all on the same
operating all in same environment all
ready to go just with some compile
options we're going to take a look today
at symbian itself running your first
hello world on the Symbian device only a
few things you're going to need really
easy to get started let's dive right
into this so you need to head on over to
the Nokia forums and check out the Nokia
cute
sdk and download the Windows version of
it once you got the windows downloaded
installed you're going to head on to ovi
it's I believe its OVI com links right
here you're looking for the ovi pc suite
that's going to allow you to connect the
phone to the computer so once we have
those both downloaded we need to install
the track or Trk install our onto the
Nokia itself really simple to do head on
over once you have installed it's all in
your startup menu head on over to nokia
sdk symbian install TR cave to the
symbian device and then you're looking
for in this case because it is a symbian
three Trk symbian3 double click it it
will open up in the Ovi pc suite would
you like to install it on your device
it's going to install it on the device
once you have it installed on your
device you're ready to go you're ready
to start developing so let's go ahead
and open the cute creator same place we
just were except for top directory cute
creator so once you have the cute
creator open we're going to go create a
project we're going to create a mobile
QT application or mobile cute
application then we're going to choose
we're going to name it no space is no
special characters keep it straight caps
lowercase camel case it so it looks good
and then we're going to throw it
straight in the c drive because you need
to have it in the without your path that
you're going to have the the application
project in cannot have any special
characters in it because when it goes to
the cute q make it's going to run
through the q makes em beat the symbian
cumec excuse me the simian q make and
that cannot accept any special
characters need to be very very simple
path so then we're going to go ahead
we're going to uncheck my mo and the QT
or cute simulator and just leave symbian
device once that's done standard hello
world min just stick with the main CPP
the the window dot cpp window dot h
the header file for it and then what
we're going to be dealing with the main
UI and then the second one which would
be a HelloWorld dot pro which is the Qt
or cute project file once that loads up
really simple this is a drag-and-drop UI
interface this is dealing with the dot
you I file so for what we're doing we're
going to drag a label straight onto the
screen put it in the top left hand
corner it says text label and now it's
going to say hello world drag it to make
it a little bigger to fit the text and
that's it now all you do is hit the big
friendly green button it builds it
packages sends it on over the phone for
installation and here it is hello world
running on the symbian3 platform
beautifully easy done pretty cool if you
have any questions on this you know what
you're doing in symbian what you're
doing with the cute creator head on over
to the Nokia forms I've got a awesome
forms and great support team set up
their forms nokia com you know if you
have any other questions about this you
know kind of what we covered here or you
know what we covered in the past email
me Jason and hak5 org in the next
upcoming segments we've got more QT
going on we're going to get a little bit
more in-depth maybe some camera action
you know we're really going to dive into
the code so you know Darren back to you
the Nokia cute SDK brings the popular
cute creator IDE from the desktop and
embedded world to mobile application
developers enabling them to build native
apps for the symbian three devices like
the nokia n8 and developers can submit
their apps by january twenty eighth to
be involved so thank you so much to
nokia for sponsoring this episode of
hak5 if you've got the techni lest like
ondrea's who made this very sweet
wallpaper I like that wallpaper yeah
thanks so much and Ray thank you very
much show your pride by emailing us your
photos over at feedback at hak5 org you
can send us anything your hak5 sticker
on your laptop your evil server birthday
cake mm-hmm your hack fight pumpkin ooh
delicious that was one of my favorites
yeah also don't remember don't we don't
don't remember oh listen to me I'm gonna
hmm don't forget you guys can get some
awesome hak5 goodies like this this cozy
hak5 hoodie I'm wearing that looks so
warm and cozy it is it's lovely and you
could have one just like it but not this
one no not this one no but uh I sure
enjoying the ability um no anyway a hack
dog dog / store is the place that you
can find all the hak5 goodies just in
time to get that special someone not
awesome piece of tech nos tube rather
special hacker in your life you know
well I providian yeah yeah and also
don't forget you can support the show
for free oh really how can you do that
very easy just go over to hack five org
so subscribe and you'll find all the
ways you can subscribe on youtube and
itunes and all fun stuff like that
techno let's deliver it all the time
helps our numbers and that means that
you get more shows and as you might know
clean water is one of the scarcest
resources in the world and we need it to
survive and nearly a billion people
don't have access to it we want to get
involved so we're pardoning partnering
with charity water to make a difference
charity water is this organization that
don't donates a hundred percent of the
money it raises to building Wells and
bringing clean water to communities in
need which i think is very cool I mean a
hundred percent of the money that's
really good they're leveraging
technology and really creative ways to
mobilize people around the cause and we
want our viewers you guys to get
involved now all the shows on revision3
are actually going out and reaching out
to their fans to raise money because it
takes like five thousand dollars to
build a well and with your help we can
go ahead and achieve that so go ahead
and hit up revision 3.com / charity
water learn more about it get involved
and we just think it's pretty cool cause
we've actually had a couple of people
already donate and one of the ones that
i thought was really cool was the very
first donation we got it was for a
hundred and thirty-three dollars point
seven seventy cents 133 nivin yeah it's
kind of late yeah that was from a
matthew dixon and i was like dude that's
awesome now we just need somebody donate
3001
thirty-three dollars and seventy cents
yeah thirty one thousand three hundred
and thirty-seven dollars yeah i mean i
donated 25 bucks Darren did every little
bit counts I mean it twenty dollars goes
a long way it really does and I'm
totally down for helping out for a good
cause Oh warm fuzzies fuzzies cool well
with all of that said I hope you guys
enjoy the show I know it's a little bit
shorter than regular but you know it's
that season where we're just trying to
