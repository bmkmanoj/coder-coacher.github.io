command and this hack tip is brought to
you by Eero welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morse and
today we are talking about finding
things so last week we started going
into detail on all the different ways
that you can use find commands to search
for files information about files and
more now this week I'm going to finish
up that command with more options that
can be super handy for most scenarios
and of course as usual if you use this
command in some really interesting way
you can leave your comments below
because I love sharing all of the
awesome ways that you can use the Linux
terminal with our entire community so
first off we are going to talk about the
and and the or commands so these are
tack a and tack Oh
adding a tack a to your command will
allow you to search for a file or
multiple files with more than one
criteria so for example and I'll turn to
my computer I could search for a find
dot tech name and I'll use tech things
start ext as my usual example by itself
and that lists out any tech thing txt
files with that wildcard but if I do
that scene command and then at the end
I'm going to add tack a text size and
plus 14k for example that is going to
give me only the files that are over
that 14 kilobytes as well as tech thing
wildcard txt in the name now if I change
that tack a to attack oh so I'll just
erase back here and I pressed up to use
my previous command now that gives me a
whole lot more output so you will see
that fine now searches for files name
tech thing wildcard txt or it also
includes files that are over 14
kilobytes in size now I get a pretty
long list obviously it seems a little
bit complicated now for an even more
complicated command to go with it so say
I want to find every single file that is
8
kilobytes are larger but not ones called
tech things so I don't want to include
any of my files with the word tech being
in it for example I could type in and
I'll go ahead and clear this so it's not
all a bunch of garbled e gook in there
find period and I'm going to backslash
this first off open parentheses space
tax size and I'm going to look for
things that are over eight kilobytes
attack Oh anything that is also or eight
kilobytes in size so that means anything
over eight kilobytes including that size
eight kilobytes a space and then I'm
going to close out that parentheses
right there and I am NOT going to
include tack name put it in quotes tech
thing star dot txt and close those
quotes and hit enter okay so this time
it's also still very long but I will
break it down for you so first off if I
just search for any files of those sizes
it will find everything including the
tech thing files so I wanted to omit
those technique files and in order to do
that I added that exclamation mark then
the additional options so anything after
that exclamation mark will not be
included I'm also going to put the two
size options inside of those parentheses
like you can see here if I can highlight
that correctly there we go
and the backslash is before each of
those parentheses make sure that the
shell doesn't misinterpret them as being
a part of that search so they are not
included they're just closing in that
command you also need to put a space
before the parentheses and your search
options so that the parentheses are not
included again so that's pretty much
everything on how you can search
different sizes and use that and an or
command but we have a little bit more to
share on the find command right after
this break
when you are looking to improve your
wireless network making sure your entire
home has a strong signal is a must and
that is where Iiro comes in they are
launching their very first second
generation mesh Wi-Fi system that comes
with one arrow and one to two beacons
and these are mesh access points they
are not extenders they are smaller they
also plug into an outlet
they have an ambient nightlight and they
are more powerful than the originals but
of course if you already have the
original yo has you covered as well
these babies are backwards compatible
and they can be purchased separately
systems start at 399 for all three
components together but if you want to
just buy one beacon you can totally do
that as well you can and they're cheaper
than the originals at 149 each we've
gotten a chance to test these out in the
warehouse where our Wireless usually
does not reach from one end to another
the Ebro mesh does a really great job of
fixing that headache and it gives me the
speeds that I pay for from my ISP plus
it was really easy to set up and it's
also very reliable so Eero is also
announcing the ero plus subscription

and learn more at eurocom we are now
back with the find command now I want to
go into a little bit more detail about
that little exclamation mark that I used
which is the omit option we talked about
it a little bit before the nice thing is
that you can also use this expression
for options that are inside parentheses
so for example I can type in find period
exclamation mark and then I will use a
backslash parentheses space and I'm
gonna look for it Nazis size plus 8 K so
over kilobytes over 8 kilobytes and then
attack o including the size 8 kilobytes
and close that out with another
backslash close parentheses attack name
and we're looking for tech thing
wildcard txt again and hit enter it's
telling me permission and I don't worry
about that but it did find the correct
thing which is texting sort o 1 dot txt
which is the only txt file
with tech thing in the name that is less
than eight kilobytes so it totally works
in that case and it is only going to
find that one file another thing to add
with find you can always add multiple
options in between those parentheses not
just one or two and to take find a
little bit of a step further you can
also execute commands on any files that
find finds so for example I could rename
all of my dot txt files to end with
uppercase txt and vice versa so to do
this I would type in and for this one
I'm just gonna hit up a couple times
because I've already run this a few
times on my computer and in this case I
have lowercase dot txt s and I want to
change them to uppercase so I'll write
txt right there and change this to txt
and put this an uppercase like that and
then I hit enter and it should change
them all into uppercase txt there we go
so I now have a bunch of uppercase txt
files as opposed to lowercase text ones
so this change is going to take effect
immediately and it will change those
lowercase all the way to uppercase this
can be really handy since find is case
sensitive so sometimes you might run
into problems with that so I'm going to
go ahead and break down that command
because it is a little bit intensive so
first off fine looks universally right
here for the name and those are going to
be anything ending in star dot txt and
that's lowercase txt and I put that in
quotes then it executes the rename
option right here on txt now the next
thing it does is S stands for substitute
so I'm substituting lowercase txt s to
uppercase txt s and then that is going
to be globally on the entire computer
the brackets over here represent each
file that must be included which is all
of them and then we use the backslash
semicolon so that will escape the
semicolon the semicolon ends the execute
command and escaping it allows it to not
be misunderstood as its own character in
find so now I'm just going to reverse
that command back to what I had
originally put in here like so and hit
enter and then everything should go back
to lowercase
I actually just prefer lowercase because
it's less typing for me now the last
thing to share about find is using the F
print option so this is going to pass
the output of a file that you choose or
create or I should say to of files so
I'm going to type in find
tack name and again I'm going to look
for that star txt for any txt files and
I'll type in F print and I'm going to
put all of those printouts in a test
file dot txt document and actually first
off I want to change my directory so I'm
just gonna erase this real quick and
change directory over to my snub stuff
test folder okay so now I'll type that
in there we go so if I go over here and
click on test file you'll see that it
has all of my text documents out in a
test file and I could also just cat that
too so test file txt and then it's
written out into my Linux terminal yay
so that was easy
