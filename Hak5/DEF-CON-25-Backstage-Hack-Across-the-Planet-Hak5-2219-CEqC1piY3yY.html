has come together it's really exciting
to be able to see like you know the
tangible fruits of your labor there's
one of the things that I'm like most
excited about this year we did not just
a catalog but a comic book and it kind
of details so use cases in the ways that
the different you know fruits and
animals are used in the field so we've
got the ducky here and he's doing a
ducky drop and we've got a land turtle
here posing as a flower delivery guy and
he's like planting a land turtle in an
office and getting himself a shell into
the org and we've got the Bosch money
here social engineering people and hack
in all sorts of machines and yeah it's
great I'm just like I love it the way
all of this has come together to show
you guys all about that in a minute
and the most important part of the
morning has arrived
so something that may come is a huge -
huge yet party con so something that may
come as a huge surprise here at DEFCON
believe it or not the wireless situation
is a little iffy which is a problem when
we're trying to run credit cards through
our phones of course using OpenVPN but
yeah slow pan revealed so well as lose
the hack job stab so obviously we
weren't using the wireless in terms of
the Wi-Fi but we were easily LTE here
and double screwed to so we needed
Ethernet and we have an Ethernet drop
from the con so we can do Ethernet to
phone because we need phones which is up
to square a bronze on so we had Ethernet
- how do you use your nephew jab has he
persisted and into a OTG cable and a USB
adapter or not yeah yeah and then of
course for multiple phones you got to
run it through a switch yeah we're like
how are we going to make this happen
we're going to need like USB Ethernet
adapters and you know USB C adapters and
we'll need a switch and it's like oh
right we have all of this stuff so
little MacGyver moment what thanks to
seven
all right now the most important gig of
the day yeah
not looking the greatest I think we get
about two cons out of each pineapple you
know your laptop really isn't complete
without the stickers and I'm so excited
about the new stickers that we have this
year because these guys are just looking
so cute look at that
cyberpunk ducky I love it but I don't
know what's up with a pineapple he's
into some kinky stuff I think and then
there's the bash Bunny doing this little
bashful anything what oh there's the
land turtle found him just all we got to
get a turtle on the turtle doing their
turtle e things right turtle section yes
and then oh you know what here's the
packet squirrel oh I love this one so
cute because this packet squirrel is
just nuts that is a badge and the one
guy who I know partied last night
there he is right we're doing to tell I
know we're shooting in a weird angle man
because I don't want to get anybody else
in the shot because the Horde has just
come in and it's just on disclosures

core party is always the party to be at
