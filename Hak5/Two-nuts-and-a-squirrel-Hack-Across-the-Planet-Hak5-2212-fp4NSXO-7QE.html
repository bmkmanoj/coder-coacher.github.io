can't say I've ever been to an active
volcano until coming to Taiwan and how
cool is this that it's all pumped down
to Taipei City for the hot springs
really cool so sulfur is pungent so this
is the spot if you're in Chinese
medicine to get your feet washed

government that's connected to up there

you to bring your dinosaurs
