Lola the hack pod my name is Gerren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse
this is of course your weekly dose of
Tecna list hey great show for you guys
this week yes awesome ciao
kind of an odd one because I am on a
horse no I am on Josette I'm on a horse
hey my motorcycle Old Spice yes here are
diamonds and a motorcycle whoo why are
you on a motorcycle well I mean this
might be the last opportunity I have to
do an episode of hack 5 or at least in
this season where I'm sitting on a
motorcycle which is just ridiculous out
to do on the show yeah I guess so
it can't really get up steps can it no
no we could never have done it in the
hack house and it just makes sense to of
course at least in my mind I don't know
and also it's an honor of the hack
Across America tour which when this is
airing on May 11th that means one year
ago today we may 11th or whatever I will
have been in Toronto
good thinking about Toronto she can't go
without police and then to Detroit and
that was a bad of a different story yeah
yeah it wasn't a restaurant trip and
it's kind of hard to believe that it's
been almost a year now since moving in
there no kidding three months for you
guys but uh you're a true California boy
now well I mean I got some granola in my
I'm hearing about your health and stuff
yeah you probably didn't tune in to hear
about granola though you probably want
to hear about some hacker headlines and
that's why we're talking about our
favorite framework it just got a major
update yes we're talking about
Metasploit three-point 7.0 which has
been released in
with it comes some major back-end
back-end overhauls so you should see a
huge significant increase in performance
especially when handling multiple
sessions as well as a nice little update
to the SMB stack which will allow you to
perform pass the hash attacks against
Windows Server 2008 so for more on that
and the 35 some odd new remote exploits
check out rapid7 square yes square we
like square I love use a credit card so
I can swipe your card I have a credit
card with a kitten on it yeah hello
kitty square
oops backwards well it works better with
the magnetic swipe side section well
that's an HD now so don't don't show the
kind numbers too much right well square
has opted for encryption on their little
mobile credit card readers so in between
this guy and this guy the data will be
encrypted yeah fine choose what VeriFone
was all freaking out about right exactly
so square there a successful company
that enables just about anyone to be
able to take payments through their
iPhone went through a bit of a tiff with
VeriFone back in the day who recently
said that square was basically sending
out card skimmers to whoever wanted them
and it sounds like square deemed it
necessary to update their hardware and
decided to make it a new line of the
square credit card readers so it sounds
like square is becoming a real
competitor to VeriFone which I'm looking
forward to get a legit one they
partnered with visa and hey I just gotta
say whoo I've got the old version yeah
encrypted yeah no one else is still
isn't encrypted consolidated DB yes the
iOS 4.3.3 update has arrived bringing
changes to the way that that
controversial crowd-sourced database
caching file works consolidated DB file
was the one that had all of your
information about where you're you know
3G iPad or your iPhone yeah has been
yeah and well they've made some changes
to it reducing the file size of it so
it's like how long it's actually going
to cache because something goes up to a
year it's no longer going to backup to
iTunes when you sync and it's also going
to delete itself or it's going to be
deleted when you turn off location
services now Apple has acknowledged that
it's been storing as much of a year's
worth of data
even if location services were turned
off before and they claimed that to be a
bug now of course the database is still
unencrypted yeah it's a bug that they
decided not to fix until they started
complaining about it way yeah go figure
so okay I have some really really nice
news to hear about hey that's something
happy yes something happy Jeff Moss he's
the founder of the infamous hacker
Cochran change s con yes dark tangent he
back in Def Con at Las Vegas he's been
named as I can which is the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and
numbers their chief security officer hi
rod Beckstrom he's the I can credit
president and the chief executive
officer he said I can think of no one
with a greater understanding of the
security threats facing Internet users
and how best to defend against them then
Jeff Moss he has an in-depth insiders
knowledge and can only come from
fighting in the trenches of the ongoing
war against cyber threats so good job
Jeff that's awesome that's awesome man
we should have put that in the last in
the lineup because it is really on
uplifting and you want to talk more
cyber threats well at the time of
filming PlayStation Network is still
down following the massive data breach
Sony is claimed before the US House of
House Committee of Energy and Commerce

during their investigation and now the
file contains the words we are legion
Kia's oh hi Ari sorry I can pronounce
that chairman of the board of directors

we got an email from Chris G aka macro
hard in the hack five forums who said
this was the free bulk renaming software
I was going to try out I have a vendor
that likes to send me a large assortment
of fires with a lousy extension name and
I need to work on getting them to
process for a document retention system
bulk rename utility is available at both
rename utility co uk this website right
here and it lets you rename several
files with a click of your mouse this
free software comes in both 32 or 64-bit
for Windows after downloading and
installing choose a folder or a group of
files that you want to change for my
example I have chosen a whole bunch of
pictures from this nice little zoo crew
that we had going on some some of which
are kind of bad pictures after
highlighting all of your files so ctrl a
choose what you want to change so for my
example I chose to change the file names
all to zoo crew instead of IMG point 0
to 6 or whatever they were called and I
changed all the cases to the lower case
make it nice and easy for me and then I
added a numbering to the end of each
photo so it's not all the same name
because that wouldn't work out too well
so under numbering Box 10 I chose suffix
and starting with number 1 all of your
changes can be seen under new name in
the file box at the top right here
highlighted in green once finished click
rename and you will get a warning
telling you that the files are about to
be changed so rename and it tells me 140
files are about to be processed I'll
click OK and it's successful I'm going
to open these up in my desktop just to
show you what it looks like after
they've been changed oops wrong folder
okay and you can see here that each one
has been changed to zoo crew one two
three four what-have-you
click OK after double checking and tada
all of your selected files have been
fixed in a couple of seconds if you
choose to do this during an install you
can also have a Windows Explorer
extension included when you right-click
a series of files so it should show up
yep here it is bulk renamed here so I
can always just click on that to do all
my renaming this saves me tons and tons
of time renaming all of those photos
from CES so you guys have a tip will
share it tips at hak5 org and now hey
Darren I think it's time for your
segment alright guys we have a fantastic
treat for you guys this week because we
have none other than move X from room
360 to announce what's up dude what's
going doing so great it's so good to
have you out here you've been so busy
yeah I mean between room 362 and rapid7
and they keep me really bit like rapid
so yeah yeah yeah alright literally they
stay true to the name yeah maybe you've
been having so much fun with Metasploit
I take it the new 3.7 is out that's sick
you guys are gonna update doing some
really fun stuff like as soon as rapid7
took all of them now they got funding
and it just took off if you watch like
the SPN stream of like their dev work it
goes through 2003 up down up down up
yeah and then 2009 end of 2009 or I
think it's end of 2010 somewhere on it
just goes wrong well it's such a great I
mean just the framework itself is like
kind of a de-facto standard you know
player built into all of the good ones
you know so great to see that well we
actually have a fantastic segment for
you guys here we're going to be using a
little bit of meta split you know how it
is that we're still prepping for the
segment I hate to you know do this but
we're under a strict schedule here and
I'm promised that we will we'll get this
here momentarily
anything else you need I've got that
executable for you it's just in a
problem and I'm just trying to bang out
a little shell script here in the
meantime okay
hey could you get me a cup or put yeah I
think I had one open you know from
Thanks
and I got to resolder this
weird there's my problem
your password starts with EEF hmm 5 to 0
for D 6a underscore underscore pound
pound actually smart that's my password
yeah so smart Locker is a script that
Chris skates and I wrote for the
metasploit project and what it does it's
my password it gets your password but it
does it in a very interesting way how
did you just do that
alright so key loggers in general work
on loggers alright is it 1994 hey if
they work they work you know the usual
words iterate you did you get my hash
then crack that I mean that's a damn
good password wouldn't you say it's not
ok yes right okay the windows box right
so key loggers in general will log
everything right yeah but you can find
them they're binary they were running
they're always there right anybody
that's played with the Switchblade no
it's like every a/v under the planet no
matter how you pack it is going to
notice your key logger right because it
does special calls
well Metasploit or the mature / you know
payload actually has a key logger built
into it but what cool thing is is that
it's all in memory okay but the downside
yet still up side of it is it only sees
stuff that is in that process so if you
say tied it to Internet Explorer or I
explore that exe only see the stuff in
that process which is great because if I
went to log into a website for instance
you could see my password is correct but
in write correct and most key loggers
only key log when you're logged in go I
don't know and see how you wouldn't be
able to because when you log out you're
not in that active session anymore all
of those programs are like behind you're
in kind of a different user land if you
love when logon dot exe so when log on
the AC is where all the authentication
happens it's Gina or Ms Gina that's on
the back end of it but it's how you know
Fenne ocation happens when you're
logging into it so what smart Locker
does is it migrates your matter
procession into when log on even knows
if there are multiple sessions on that
system yeah to say hey there's multiple
sessions which do you want
oh so if it was like a terminal service
thing and like I got logged so how did
okay I understand that your key logging
win logon dot exe right so you're
getting my password as I type it into
the path but it doesn't it doesn't do
that like automatically it waits for a
specific idle time
once it's in when log wrong and once
once a specified log idle time happens
so you have to be away from the house
let's say are you going to like on a pen
test sit around all day and all night
waiting for them to come by the next
morning and login nope so after the
special amount of time it locks the
computer out so I haven't edited it yet
but so by the time this airs I hopefully
have this edited so even if the screen
server goes on it locks it out but right
now it just does it after a set number
of time so you could say three minutes
of inactive time go ahead and lock the
screen yep that wouldn't look too odd if
say you already had your setup to lock
the screen after 5-10 minutes exactly
you go and get a coffee you come back
you're like oh you don't think any of
the wiser because it's just a logon
screen and you were instinctively
trained like a monkey to type your login
you see a login screen so you know the
great thing about the key logger for
Metasploit is that our interpreter is
that it'll show you back spaces and
stuff like that just like a normal key
logger right as well so see when I have
held my pass all right all right so you
know it also stops key logging as soon
as it finds that you've logged in so it
detects when that when log on is no
longer active and then it's not memory
anymore I still don't detect it right
that is so super sweet how do I do that
in in Metasploit so I've already got a
meterpreter session with my victim what
do I initiate - to use this what are
they on right so first of all you have
to be an admin it smart Locker will
actually say you are not an admin go
away okay so get admin now settle your
privileges however you may be right so
you have to be admin or system level to
do this sure because what it does
migrates into when log on which is wrong
as system no matter how many sessions
are open when logins always run a system
causes something beautiful to do to a
terminal server you know and lots of
users on it yeah
okay so so once you've got those outside
real quick is Metasploit actually can BG
run or background run so this is really
great for when you get a ton of sessions
on a fish you can say Auto BG run like
automatically setting this to the
background and so every session you get
in automatically smart locks okay so
you're just like on your client of your
Metasploit client you're just like
sitting there doing your thing you've
got all of these just running in the
background wait and as soon as you got
passwords you get alerted or something
that is that's wicked okay so where is
this in the tree where am I going to
find this so all it is is a matter
prescript right now I should push it to
the post modules but I haven't yet it so
you just run smart Locker tack H will
give you the options and there's a bunch
of different options like how long the
heartbeat Hammel so how long to wait and
listen for idle times and in checking
for you know new when the password goes
in so if you had if you start smart
Locker at like 8 o'clock at night not
something you want to make the heartbeat
pretty long so you're not like key
logging for a while or whatever that is
so great and this is this is the reason
you use meta split this is the reason
why you know you get lucky and get get
cow every time you launch meta flow
right yeah so I mean the the power
behind it is all something called rail
gun and what rail gun is on on
Metasploit or meterpreter is a direct
access to the windows API so I call lock
workstation the actual call to using
rail gun other windows API to lock the
workstation ok so it's just function
built right into window yeah I love that
that is so neat lager for Windows by
Windows that's it you know that is so
great that it's just there for you for
the taking and Rubik is here to take it

last week I demoed the easy way to
install comm boot and way back in season
8 I had showed you katana katana is a
portable multi boot security suite with
all sorts of penetration and security
applications all built into one single
flash drive it had been updated as time
since way back when so I wanted to do a
quick follow-up on this lovely piece of
awesomesauce
version 2.0 first of all close down all
of your antivirus software it's going to
freak out when you download katana due
to all of the tools available on the
program so just if you don't want to
deal with it and it's a pain in the butt
just go ahead and close down the
antivirus download the torrent of katana
at hack from a cave comm and this is the
hack from a cave comm website right here
it's a hefty 4 gigs big so make sure you
have tons of room and an 8 gig flash
drive for the install make sure you
extract the dart rar to the root of your
USB stick and then open the flash drive
so - katana D folder open the root of
your flash drive open the boot folder
right here and right click on boot in
bat the batch file and choose run as an
administrator choose that go and try
again and it tells me it's ready to go
press any key to continue continue
setting up boot for D please wait
read the information above ok should be
bootable nail installation finished ok
so I exit that and it should be ready to
go it's really really easy to install
katana it really is now you have two
things that you can do first of all when
you start it up you can check out the
katana toolkit on your Windows machine
this application can run various tools
such as key pass and then stop Apple
copier second you can boot up katana
onto the boot disc on your USB flash
drive so I'm going to do that right now
and here's the restart
restarting so the first thing you need
to do is unplug your drive power down
your computer and then plug the flash
drive back in and you boot from it for
my computer I have to press f12 to boot
into anything other than the usual
windows hard drive go down to USB HDD
SanDisk my lovely USB flash drive that's
like huge it's awesome if it works and
it should you'll see the screen that I
have up here
Kitana with a nice little katana sword
going across you can use your arrow keys
to navigate up and down throughout the
various tools so I'll go down to one of
my favorites I'm going to boot into off
crack graphic mode off crack is a really
good tool for your really forgetful
siblings whenever they lose their
Windows passwords it's happened to me
before it has a built in rainbow table
and it can figure out the password in a
few seconds so when it starts up I'll be
able to show you that it'll take a
couple of seconds for it to read
everything and boot up ok so you don't
even have to touch anything on the
machine when you're running off crack it
will basically just go through these
Vista free and XP free small different
rainbow tables and hopefully find your
password so for example up here under NT
pad get my mouse running under NT pad
you can see homegroup user that's me
oops nubs that's me my password is game
the game that you guys just lost sorry
about that off crack was able to figure
out my really simple password with no
problem letting me back into my computer
yeah so you'll also notice in katana
that you'll have a problem with 64-bit
machines running comm boot if this is
the case first open up the boot
directory in the root of the cantana
drive then copy the files VESA menu 32
and chain c 32 from this directory into
the sis Linux slash comm boot directory
you'll have to go through a process of
choosing comm boot then booting the
second HDD then going back into katana
the main menu then you go back into Kahn
boot and select the next HDD choice
hopefully it'll work for myself I
couldn't get it to work I got all the
way to the Windows password screen and
it was not able to figure out my
password when I just typed in a bunch of
mumbo-jumbo so hopefully it enables
combo to finally work even though you
might have a 64-bit machine but maybe
you guys will have better luck this is
the general idea of how to get Kombat to
work as well on iron geeks blog which I
mentioned last week so hey maybe it will
help you guys out I also got an email
from the Creator Ronan he gave me some
really recent tips and tricks with
cantana
such as the fact that you can use the
katana toolkit from a lockdown Window
System of course you can right block the
katana drive for cheap using an SD card
which sounds really cool I hope to get
the notes on that one and you can use a
live CD to avoid needing to access the
password block bios to modify the boot
order for USB to boot that's really cool
katana is a very handy tool for anybody
interested in learning more about
security and penetration testing it's
also a great application to have in case
you ever need any of those tools
available in the tool kit several tools
have been added since the initial
release of katana so I definitely
suggest you guys check out version 2.0
you can check out more from ronin at
hack from a cave comm and you can email
me at feedback at hack 5 org with your
favorite security tools or boot kits now

that just about wraps up this week's
episode of pack five but before we get
going some great emails Tech lost foot
of the week right oh yeah yeah awesome
techno last photo of the week's idea
about this first off been rights
hey HEC five guys regularly at work I
use Firebug and HTTP Fox Firefox add-ons
do you guys recommend any other must
have security testing Firefox add-ons
love the show keep up the great work
did you gotta have Firebug uh you know
as much as I am a chrome puff that loves
you know the Google's Chrome yeah the
inspect stuff it's not nearly it's full
featured as Firebug so that is it like I
love it
there are a couple other extensions you
might want to get for Firefox we've
talked about some of them in the past
some of them are pretty obvious like no
script which is great or by default
turning off JavaScript on pages or not
just the site so like your area
example.com and then like example fubar
comm has like a script that's embedded
it will prevent that from running and
then like give you the option it'll
actually break a lot of pages because
the Internet's made that way now and
people right over time but don't do this
okay good stuff if you're gonna
especially we're gonna go to like a
crack key gen or serial site like dude
do that in a VM with I mean not like you
would ever go to anything like that and
the same if you were to actually PI just
do that in the VM anyway yeah yeah um
some others said I like though include
there's this one called bad pass what
was yeah it will actually as you're
typing your password some sites actually
do this themselves now but as you're
typing a password it will actually show
you the security level of your password
depending on how many characters Oh -
holes and stuff like that um is that I
bet that's Meerut more accurate than
what normal websites give you know it's
funny because some websites you'll enter
in like um like a 10 character password
and it'll say that's a great password
another sore like now that's crap
yeah you know and Here I am I like to
use like 50 60 70 character passwords
and then like some Bank sites only like
limit you it limit you dish yeah they
limit you to eight or something like
that well yeah I know some that we're at
Kay and now I know some they're like 20
and it's like come on you know what if I
wanted to have like a only 96 character
- remember that actually probably
couldn't remember that and if you're
having a problem with remembering
passwords or you want to have a
different password for every site like
we totally recommend LastPass or keepass
both have yeah Firefox extensions which
you should totally check out well I'm
also get on katana keep s oh nice now
another one that we've talked about a
little bit kind of like in the periphery
is you know how I'm a big proponent of
using SSH tunneling - you know tunnel
your web traffic well the easiest way to
do that I find with Firefox is to use
this plug-in called foxy proxy foxy
folks yeah it's nice things like right
click and just say I want to use my
proxy and then you know it just makes it
easier than going through the dialogues
and then last but not least speaking
about proxies and whatnot Fox tor is an
extension that makes it easy to use the
tour service which is the Onion Router
forum on amaizing stuff so that's you
know those are my picks but hey that's
not to say that those are the only and
the best just go ahead and email
feedback at hak5 or with the ones you
like we're big fans of you know keeping
a web browsing session secure yes or at
least using disposable VMS for when you
visit those sites anyway Jason T writes
hi Darren and Shannon Kirby the lovable
cat and mascot and doc bone of hak5
while she's the backbone I have to agree
she's a bit of a mystery to the hack 5
viewers at least I think she is if you
could spare a couple of hack 5 minutes
could we get kirby story whom's Kirby's
master what she likes and dislikes Oh
Kirby's uh cookies my kitty it's spelled
with an E
once upon a time for Bruce there was a
kitten named curvy and she likes hak5
she's a dude she's a big fan of like
she's kind of a camera or really she is
she likes to hop up on side at very
random times and I don't know what
holiday she's coming up on 10 September
2010 and she doesn't look it she still
baby she is and her biggest thing that
she likes is she likes to stand up on
her hind legs do this it's so cute you
feed her curvy snacks the little kitty
treats and she stands she was hounding
us for anyway we should get too much
into his really inside baseball but yeah
that's curvy your observation and yes
she's a friend we love her she's the
door go back to season morning crazy
shots
in season one yeah no kidding yeah I
remember that good old days okay anyway
Francisco writes hi hak5 I've been
meaning to ask this question before but
it goes what kind of upload speeds do
you guys get in the hak5 studio and to
achieve them what kind of hardware AJ
your modem load balancer do you have I
run several virtual servers in my house
and the maximum upload speed I can get
is around 100 to 150 kilobytes per
second whoo that's not a lot what can I
do to increase the upload speeds thank
you in advance all right so here at this
studio today we have what is it cuz it
changes so often we have 2 megabits a
second up and uh actually no I guess we
have more because I'm doing the speed
test right now and I'm getting 6g six
point seven
yeah so I'm Wow well I'm getting closer
to seven maybe it's maybe we're supposed
to have five anyway I'm getting uh some
damn good upload speeds and that's
because we use a like to call them a
real router rather than your like little
fake plastic box that you get at the big
box store seriously if your router since
I like it has two key little antennas I
wasn't going to say Linksys but now you
call me well my mom used to have a
Linksys from 95 and I exchanged it last
year when I was living at home it wasn't
from 95 it was from 2000 cuz it was well
it was from the 90s might have been like
maybe I remember was it's a she yeah
it's a B router so it's the WPE 11g I
had the Rings had dust bunnies cuz
nobody had touched it in so long I was
like no upgrade time it's not even just
about that like sure you could upgrade
it to another plastic router and they
sell is like oh it's gaming router knows
it's dude seriously a little plastic box
isn't going to compete with the power of
say having a real x86 PC and that's why
well ours is still just like a little
atom or a via board
we love our x86 based routers I know
that well I'm a huge fan of smooth wall
which we have running here hasn't been
updated in a while
there's also untangled which we've done
stuff on live season and Paul just
recently changed out a router which
might be explaining the six point nine
two megabits a second we got what do you
run now Paul yes he's a fan of
yes cool he's saying that mana walls
like I couldn't get it blah blah blah
and they just yeah I should upgrade from
our neck your router thank you got a
bill if you got to build a bangin router
yeah well it's not like we don't have a
plethora of spare pcs laying around no
kidding
anyway let us know what your thoughts
are what what router do you use at home
you know what kind of custom build stuff
do you like maybe there's something
obscure that we haven't heard of yeah
test out yeah so Jeff DJ Jeff and the
IRC Channel is saying right there that
he likes dd-wrt I like open wrt but you
know that's that's more for like
embedded stuff I'm thinking like okay I
guess we can do over the VRT on x86
anyway sorry wait not chocolate well
before you keep on rambling let's go on
to our techno les photo of the week I
think Darren likes this one because he
has a motorcycle on set Roberto as he
breaks my camera morbo sends us photos
of him racing his motorcycle while
sporting his set of hak5 stickers right
there on the tail so nice yeah that's
beautiful that ducky
that's so cool and I don't know yes
thank you and we're glad you're doing
better yeah all right dude the bike
looks great thanks so much for sending
that in yeah those clear actually I've
got a clear hak5 sticker right here on
my fairing you do is the transparent one
I like those all right now remember that
you can support the show for free musi
you don't have to stick a hak5 sticker
on the side of your motorcycle all you
have to do subscribe on iTunes or
YouTube or mirÃ³ or the plethora of
other ways that you can get the show
deliver to instantly every week so you
don't have to wait and it's great
because we like those day one download
numbers we got some Spanish music going
on outside the windows great but anyway
if you want to support the show in other
ways and stick hak5 stickers on the side
of your car your mom's car whoever's car
you could go over to hack five hat shop
comm to get all of your hack five
goodies or high five that organ click on
storage there - you can do that - oh
