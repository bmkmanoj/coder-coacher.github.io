running out of IP version 4 addresses
and that's why I sit down with joe klein
and get schooled on IP version 6 all
that and more this time on hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by go to assist express support smarter
with go to assist express netflix go to
WWF flexkom / hak5 to get your free
trial membership and domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com hello and welcome to
hack 5 my name is darren kitchen and
this is your weekly dose of technol west
coming to from a ladder with someone got
an excellent show for you guys as you
know we are back from tour con talking
to some fun people there about all
things hacker stuff under the sun
unfortunately well we did have planned
to talk to chris silvers about some
social engineering stuff unfortunately
the mic packs decided that that wasn't
going to happen so my apologies to you
although thank you so much for at least
mending the time to talk to me about
this and and yeah that's just a lesson
learned when you're going to do a con by
yourself or con solo if you will but we
do have an excellent interview for you
guys this week and you know what I don't
even think interview is even the right
word but we're talking to joe klein
front of the show about IP version 6 and
really i'm looking at it back in editing
just uh thinking like how how am i going
to chop this up and stuff and realizing
there's nothing to chop out it's really
good like I'm just getting schooled so
if you're you know if you know I p4 and
you've heard about this IP 6 stuff and
you're curious well then just join this
and watch this conversation and and hope
you soak some of this up there's a bunch
of links at the end for where you can
learn more and get yourself certified
and so playing with some fun ip6 stuff
so I think you guys are going to enjoy
that so I stick around it is i'll let
you know kind of long segments like okay
it's 45 minutes so with that all said if
you were looking for more of a shorter
episode check out season 3 episode 11
with the latter and i are having more
fun serious it's a short one with a
ladder otherwise
yeah I think that that's that's pretty
much it for right now I will see you
guys on the other side but considering
the length of it and how I don't really
want to chop it up and all that stuff
leave it completely commercial-free
interrupted whatever in the center so
let's go ahead and thank two of our
sponsors and i will see you at the end
of the show cheers if you've got a
creative idea or want to start a new
business i recommend getting a domain

when i thought i had grasped on the
internet joke lines here to make me even
more confused Joe thanks what's up man
man you you've been just blowing my mind
with the IP 6 stuff mimics was on last
episode talking to us about some other
IP 6 straight guy and yeah I just hope
that you can help me grok a little bit
better because it's just crazy to think
that I mean I understand that supposedly
we're running out of IP four dresses and
stuff but are we really do we really
need to good ip6 now because sound like
we have to learn a lot of stuff that's
hard yeah that is actually hard um
what's interesting is ipv6 was a rethink
it was not just to add the addresses and
it was a rethink so that we could
re-engineer the technology make it
easier for us to manage and secure
networks a lot of the stuff wasn't
available before they've added a lot of
this features we're gonna talk about
some of those because there's new
there's no features in like if you
actually dissected an IP packet like
four verses six it's it's a lot bigger
of a packet right and there's like a lot
more room in the header for more
features aren't they well actually in a
ipv4 packet the packet can be 20 off
texts to 60 octet an ipv6 packet is
exactly 64 bits which happens to be mmm
the same size as processor sizes today
Oh process or alignment yeah that's so
cool yes well so let's talk about the
actual why we're running out some of the
issues that were running into it was
funny back in 1992 IETF the internet
tackle our source yeah yeah they started
looking at utilization of ipv4 addresses
and they started projecting it out and
they said you know we're going to
probably run out around 2010 2011 2012
which happens to be pretty close yeah so
what they did was they started down the
process to finding everything though and
exactly we're going to talk about that
minute yeah so from the IP addresses
from 2000 we ended up going from barely
anything to almost four hundred percent
growth in 10 years it's a lot of
additional dress to say what you're
talking about the difference between
using like ten percent of the IP space
to
okay what yeah actually we only have two
as of this recording we only have two
hundred and twenty six days left of IP
addresses so get your IP addresses now I
know that it's actually a pain to
request more oh yeah I've had to do the
forums where you have to justify and you
say no I actually need please can I have
eight more i have this server the
server's it and you totally have to
outline it you can't just say can i have
eight and they're like why exactly one
of the things that's happening is the
maximum size the internet you know we
know it's below 4000 for four billion
everybody has more than one device I
mean how many cell phones and other
devices do you have just just within 30
feet of us there's probably I don't know
half dozen devices exactly i have over
30 devices in my own home that are all
IP devices yeah what's happening is the
average user right now only has two
devices so if we take just the amount of
use or us up in their cell phone yeah
exactly so if we only take the amount of
users out there and we double it that's
a lot of use of IP ranges okay now the
current projection by 2020 is 10 IP
addresses per user so all of a sudden
instead of having we have 22 billion
people online right now right already
we're at four billion addresses use
you're talking about okay sure my cell
phone has a public my my you know router
has public right but then I've got like
you know my tivo my xbox but all of
those other device I can see how you can
get 10 devices per user but they're all
within my home so they don't need a
public IP do that ah well you know
wouldn't it be nice if you're on the
road and you wouldn't have to buy say a
swing box and you could bounce through
your own server or watch videos from
whatever location because you live there
yeah what would be nice to have your
phone actually forward from your home
phone to here and doing it to me early I
know but I mean I'm doing like a lot of
ssh tunneling to make things work right
now right well this actually would be
done not the application level this
would be done to network
so this would be just be a configuration
wherever you go the setups done you know
you move on which is pretty cool what
happens in what I'm quote 229 days when
we run out and it'll just give out the
last type II you know yes actually they
do and then that's it and then anybody
at one says open a new business will
have to pay a higher rate there's
already a market forming where IP
addresses are going to be charged you
know maybe 35 2 107 later I pay per
month per month or per year depends on
who you're talking to like domain
squatter you starts like selling our
ip's yes people are already looking at
it now fortunately I got slashed 16 you
know you make like buku bucks exactly so
people are looking at that what's
interesting is if you get a single ipv6
address like you do in your home you get
to the 64th power home system so for
your one network you get more oh yeah
dice is that because it's not site or
net anymore it's not like no no size 24
/ 8 whenever there's how do you define
how many IP addresses your allocated ah
I mean like originally because I guess
to break it down to those that aren't
familiar you know with with ipv4 there
was the class a b c networks depending
on and then and then I was like whoa
that you know who need you don't need a
classy Leonida and then that's where you
know cider net came in is the / 8 16 24
all those different you know you're
biking I was just going to talk about
okay well I'm just saying yeah that was
break that down that that's why we we
have those because it's like you don't
need 254 but we'll give you six we'll
get the eight whatever it is that you
need if you remember him well you're
young so it's okay but the reason we
broke it up into ABC was it was easier
on the routers they didn't have to
actually figure out how to route every
single unique address range it with like
are you can do it it blocks so it made
it real easy ipv6 is has the same exact
concept the first 64 bits is now the
network section the last 64 is your
local segment so you get to to the 64th
devices on your segment and
have a number in here that allows you
silly when I trillion what is that I
don't know that's a large not rly in'
whatever that is there you go yeah so so
that's how many of I get a public IP 6
address I know many I allowed a single
ipv6 yeah now like you're having your
own internet pretty much yeah hey cool
if any I don't mind Internet so what
we've done is we've blocked it off so
everything to the right of the 64 is
your local network everything to the
left is then broken up into sub networks
and right now only an eighth of it has
been sliced up the rest of its actually
being put aside for later okay so how is
it being sliced up as it like Oh
Microsoft do you get this much because
well your Microsoft oh no organizations
are getting slashed 48 okay oh so there
is the side you're netting involved yes
they're still doing Saturn adding but
now they're stuttering and adding only
the 64 bits on the left-hand side mm-hmm
starting on the right hand starting at
this block right here cuz everybody gets
18 trillion billion whatever exactly so
as an example if i get a / 32 mm-hmm you
pretty much get the size of the whole
internet that's the size of the whole
internet so if you get it allocated for
your company if you get a 48 you get
that many bits so you get you know a lot
of the networks that you can have and
each network can be gigantic okay well
that's great that that takes care of the
address problem it's really hard to read
but I mean regardless of that I mean I
know that you can compress it with like
you know colon colon this and that you
know there's ways to shorten it no clue
how that algorithm works but regardless
they can be done but but how do I even
just go about like say like tomorrow I
won an IP 6 because I want my 18
trillion addresses to allocate to dark
net or something stupid
how would i go about just do I call up I
a na do i call up r.i.p at who's the a
provider provider well here's you you
have three different methods you go to
number one if you have a network that
allows tared oh that's actually assigned
by iono automatically so if you connect
in to it you're automatically assigned
that so you don't even have to have
today a commercial assignment it becomes
an automatic assignment of this gigantic
block of addresses so that's the first
type that's called a tunnel yeah cuz I
long ter do is just a tunnel right
exactly know several territories and
isn't that like the one that movie was
talking about providing my Microsoft
don't they like give you one essentially
based on dhcp know what it's the device
itself automatically calculates what its
own addresses how based on its backers a
little based on its depending on the
type of tunnel as an example if you're
using 624 which is another type of
tunneling technique it figures out what
the ipv4 address of your gateway is and
then it takes the last part and it's
your mac address hmm so that's one
method of tunnel tarot what it does it
breaks it up and it says here's my
termination point out on the ipv4
network that i found the server and it
takes your own ipv4 address and binds
that into it and then it has which is
usually your gateway device your
firewall device and then what port you
went out on and then some random bits
are shoved in there to make it hard to
discover and and by using a formula like
that you're not going to run into a
conflict where two people try to have
the same IP 6 address god no the size is
so large we're talking you know all the
grains of sand on the earth or larger i
mean it's crazy ok so there's what we've
established that there's plenty of them
and you can use a service like carried
out to get yourself one but is that the
only way I mean that's relying on some
other service provider granting you one
how do i you just show up on the
internet and say hey I'm taking
using this yeah it yeah there's actually
three methods one is your internet
service provider issues you a block just
like you do today companies like Comcast
are starting to roll that out to
consumers other things like the new
verizon cell phones will have those
allocated to cell phone automatically oh
yes exactly I think I have two with me
right now yeah so so that's the one
method is that your ISP issues the
second issue is you can get it through a
tunnel and through that tunnel there
again multiple different automatic
tunneling types you can get issued that
you can set up servers on those just
like you would on a static address at
your assigned you can set up servers
because numbers not going to change yeah
that's what they're gonna want you know
yes that 96 address 30s you can go to I
n if you want a large block like you
want to / 48 or whatever which is you
know pretty large you can go and
purchase it's actually cheaper if you
purchase by the end of the month or
excuse me the end of the year then it's
going to be next year they've made it
cheaper to buy IP addresses be six
blocks and it is to buy it before blocks
hmm so that's what one of the economic
incentives are is mmm I could go to ipv6
and I can have all these great range and
addresses and billions of addresses sure
but if you get your public IP 6 and you
put your web server on it how am I one
of the guys that still on an IP four and
well as the rest of the world couldn't
get to your website ah that's
essentially what a lot of corporations
are starting to realize is that if
companies like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon and
Comcast have run out of addresses that's
their customer base yeah I mean okay is
there if they can't add me more
customers you're sol well let me give
you a good c good idea about this okay
so i have an ipv4 web server out there
and my organization or my customer has
only an ipv6 they can't talk they can't
even do a DNS query to stay hey
I'm you know I need to talk to you so
what's going to happen companies are
going to get lots of help desk calls or
they'll just go elsewhere yeah so if
corporations don't move to dual stack
which is dual stack is native ipv4 and
native ipv6 is about that we're clearly
using IP four then doesn't it well no
there's actually a precedence which is
pretty neat within the RFC and all the
stacks that we have all the modern
stacks that we use today what happens is
ipv6 is always the default connection
okay once it fails they can't find an
ipv6 native it then tries to go through
the tunnels like on Microsoft it goes
through 62 for tunneling uses is't app
tunneling it goes through tere toh if
you have configured the ipv6 over HTTPS
over ipv4 for Microsoft it will then go
over that and then if all those fail it
falls down to ipv4 so for a business it
only makes sense to move to ipv6 because
their customers system has all these
opportunities to try to get to them even
if they only have ipv4 for those people
that are going to take a while to get
there those that only have ipv6 you'll
never even see that they can't get
connected it's invisible to them that's
it's it's like you know two ships I'm
just passing in the night it's kind of
like an alternate universe thing yes
those and and only the tunnels connect
them so at what point do we is your good
is there a point at which we all just
have to say goodbye oh type before like
at the same time just be like this I
don't think it's going to be in my
lifetime before I retire really yeah it
looks like we're gonna hold on to ipv4
for a while what we have today is we
were we have a ocean of ipv4 what we've
decided was to put up islands of ipv6
and then create tunnels across those
those islands start forming into larger
and larger networks what's eventually
going to happen is seas of ipv6 with
islands of ipv4 and eventually those
islands are going to shrink to the point
that they're none useful anymore
that's kind of the concept so the ITF
and many of us have worked towards you
know how do we actually get us you know
from the ipv4 to ipv6 range we have to
go through native ipv4 we'll have to go
through a ipv6 over ipv4 or tunnels of
some sort we'll eventually get to dual
stack which is ipv6 and ipv4 and then
some of the providers like Comcast are
actually providing ipv4 over ipv6 and
then eventually wound up with native I
guess if you were on it you need to go
back in okay that makes sense yeah what
happens is their router by default will
route to ipv6 so we'll try to go ipv6 if
it can only get an ipv4 address your
system will create a tunnel an ipv4
tunnel go over and connect to their ipv4
nat now and then connect out to the
network when you do when you do six over
for that you lose the features of six I
mean don't you you actually lose
multicast you lose some of the
performance because you are putting to
push more bits through the network
that's the reason we really want to go
to native ipv6 is start losing
performance but from a security side it
actually has some benefits because the
size of the bits tells us what kind of
tunnel somebody's getting to us so is it
easy to identify like on your on your
firewall you write or whatever are you
gonna you know be able to easily notice
that there's ip6 traffic going through
well that's the problem if they the
protocol is called protocol 41 so if
they did not block protocol 41 on the
router by default an organization is all
like Giri 47 GRE or IP or anything else
though they didn't block the layer 3
protocol they probably have ipv6 traffic
going in and out hmm okay from a tunnel
standpoint there's lots of things to
block and there's lots of things to
detect
the as an example taro is he was talking
about last week that is ipv6 over a UDP
packet with ipv6 crushed into it and
broken up yeah over ipv4 yeah so yes it
would still the native so when it comes
out the other end it's still the native
ipv6 packet exactly just I've been
crushed up and put in to multiply people
more packets exactly then it has to be
reassembled on the other side and it
shifts out but during that transit time
there's some problems some of the other
problems are some of the protocols
because we're using public anonymous
gateways essentially it just sounds like
a performance really suck um in some
cases it's it it can be a real problem
but native ipv6 actually has a land
speed record right now because of the
standardization to 64 bits because of
processor sites being 64 bits but we
also have you're looking at my neck
sorry that's looking at the your court
on the mic is hoping that it wouldn't
up against it oh I'm here it's fine yeah
we're all gonna put it up yeah yeah so
what the hell was I talking about you
were talking about at reversing
firewalls with IP 6 and then how you
when you split it up the performance
changes yes and that there are some
interesting complications that come
along with that yes things like your
empties change you know MTU rights of
everyone changes you changes toy ARP is
Garth is gone our buddy's gone our dhcp
is different but da cheese I chose it ok
so I bring an IP 6 a device on my
network safe and printer or something
I've got a 96 thing on my land how do I
go and find it well like I can't do it
just n map what do i do baby the nice
thing about ipv6 is we included
multicast ok multicast has allow us to
do a pain to FF 0 2 colon colon 1 and
any device on the network if I do an
ipv6 ping will actually respond back and
say i am here and here's my address so
you end up with a list of of everything
it's very much like broadcasters yes the
difference is on the local network it's
like broadcast when we actually traverse
the router we end up with all kind of
other cool features the ability to just
like this camera wouldn't it be neat to
not be forced to buy a
you know big pipe for everybody to
download yeah when your especially when
you're doing a live feed and we kind of
pay a lot of money for men with ya ipv6
has in this multicast capability has a
ability to point to a router define a
router as your rendezvous point
someplace out on the internet that has
tons and tons of Internet bandwidth and
then you provide that address to
everybody Twitter or whatever and now
you can have millions of people scale
and watch you at the same time life what
makes that interesting is the router
does the duplication of the bits and the
rerouting number one so I remember to
pay for the extra band was one bandwidth
one stream out all the ways at
rendezvous point in the rendezvous point
but then that router is doing all the
heavy lifting anything kind of you know
it's going to be expensive that's part
of the spec for ipv6 and we already see
hurricane electric and NTT doing that
for their customers there's several
hundred rendezvous points out there free
if it was if the best if the cost
difference between streaming media to
one person versus a million people was
nothing than and he must change the
landscape of who can be the media or you
know who can broadcast to like millions
of subscribers isn't that what internet
just did well yeah I did miss that way
Twitter just did not really though
there's still laying a lot of money that
goes into the bandwidth to provide the
bits for all of the downloads right well
it actually should decrease the cost of
live feeds okay that's the that's the
very cool thing and a lot of
organizations are looking at that some
of the IP TVs the ip-enabled TVs that
you can buy today yeah or ipv6 and their
default ready for multicast so instead
of buying 75 channels your television
has the ability to go out and talk fine
to the rendezvous point get a feed of
where the rendezvous points allow you to
select through it it then just connects
to a rendezvous point of wherever that
life feat is wherever on the internet
again changes a model yes sir the way we
think about you know broadcasting in
this case multi casting and the protocol
as
as far as getting IPS finding ones I'm
assuming that the tools that we know and
love today I have adapted so that i can
use like n math Wireshark whatever right
Wireshark has done it okay nmap is
allows you to scan one address at the
time which means that for every address
that you find say you do a ping ffo to
colon call one you have to then take
that and feed that into nmap all those
unique addresses and then it'll scan
those devices so so and we have time yes
so when it is on generate a list of all
of the IP addresses you would like to
scan before you start your skin
absolutely okay we also have things like
our neces retina pretty much anybody
that those were really scanning anything
that does you know network discovery all
of them going to have to be updated
unfortunately you know I've been running
around the community for the last six
years and tapping on people's shoulders
saying hey you guys need to prepare for
this and most of them now it's getting
to the end most of them are suddenly
realizing oops our products don't fully
implement ipv6 and that's true with a
lot of products a lot of the forensics
tools that I've been looking at some of
the tools you were talking about the
windows forensics tools last week you're
flashing and we do don't know you that
well yeah it does that if a lot of those
tools when you bring up to look at
network traffic only looks at ipv4 they
never upgraded the support ipv6 so a lot
of tools are going to have to be
rethought which good people want to
write programs
well so what does it mean to us as you
know curious individuals to be playing
with ip6 there's opportunities to learn
actually from a business standpoint I'm
not sure if you're interested in that I
suspect it a lot of companies are going
to frantically need people at no ipv6 by
probably January February March based on
the them running out of space so that's
going to be a big issue actually I have
a link if you're interested on how to
get a certification so you at least know
how to get on the internet as a home
user yes you can then leverage into work
but but realize we're talking you know
every business in the in the world that
needs to migrate to ipv6 pretty quickly
there's opportunity yeah we'll need to
migrate to IP 6 because there's no more
IP for available exactly but it's not
like we're going to stop using I people
or tomorrow you know no we're going to
keep on with the tunnels and stuff I
mean we're just human nature and don't
like change so we're gonna like keep
grasping onto ip44 as long as we can
until all the sudden it's no fun enough
has moved over time to 16 just exactly
what we have google already moved to
ipv6 facebook Akamai is moving so that
anybody that serves up anything that dr.
my serves up for patches and Microsoft
and a lot of the other vendors as soon
as they move all their content filtering
will be upgraded hmm which is pretty
cool we running out of power yeah you
gotta do that Oh we'll be all right so
cool so we're seeing a lot of
organizations move we've seen Wikipedia
move to it so we're seeing a lot of the
open sewers and bigger companies that
recognize there's a need unfortunately a
lot of companies that we do this with
day-to-day haven't moved also the cloud
has stopped completely move to ipv6 so
does it just really
because I mean it's pretty transparent
what your it shouldn't it be treaty
pretty transparent for your user I mean
once here on the internet with a public
IP 6 address what does that mean to you
you're still typing in Wikipedia calm
and it's a site to another ip6 address
for you but also have his dns know
that's kind of gene s right now we have
an a record yeah well an ipv6 because
it's four times that's a quad yeah quad
a record it now comes out as quod erat
your browser or so well not even your
browser your system just knows hey he
needs the address for this but i have an
IP 6 so I'm going to ask for the quad a
and if they don't have it allows for
what an egg an egg I'd sold and go
through my 624 tunnel so based on the
precedence we talked about earlier what
will happen is ipv6 will enable a quad a
lookup and a single a look up across the
ipv6 transport okay if it can't find it
there it then goes to ipv4 and tries to
look up that piece of information if it
fails there you don't you have no way of
getting to it at least it seems like it
gracefully degrades exactly exactly was
it is a good design strategy so what
have you found any plaus in the design
maybe yeah okay the tunnels are very
problematic right now some of the
tunnels they allow with Miss
configuration airs ways of listening in
and redirecting man-in-the-middle attack
type things that's why you want to go to
native dual-stack yeah I instead of
tunnel it's interesting the whole like
Tara ting but I still don't like it just
out of principle of I don't like to
bounce off someone other stuff mojetto I
mean I know ultimately it's like my
packets are going to go through other
people's systems to get where they're
going but if I don't have to rely on an
ISP or whatever it may be to provide me
with an address or a routing point and
why would I exactly exactly it's better
to go native when possible so that's
going to be the big problem the other
thing is a lot of applications
um haven't upgraded a lot of
organizations a lot of applications are
meant for 32 bits so the libraries are
using we're only 32 bit libraries so
when the operating system suddenly
supports ipv6 with 128 bits those bits
have to go someplace so as an example
for a while there were a lot of log
servers that when you received a log it
cut off it only showed you the first 32
bids as being an address so it actually
took the hex bits out convert them to
ipv4 and then took the rest of it and
look like it's a data set yeah yeah kind
of a problem so it looks that must be
really bizarre yes it is it's pretty
cool it's actually pretty cool to go in
and do it see an incident see wow it's
the same IP address over and over and
over but it's not exactly it has the
first like couple of characters that are
the same which is the same commonality
because the address range is so large so
yeah how large I mean like say like I
wanted to okay so say like nmap didn't
have the issue of having to specify
address my address in a text file or
however you want to feed it how long
would it take me to just better a scan
the internet because I know the
inaudible I know it's possible to do it
on the IP for Internet I know people to
have yes hundreds of centuries is what
it would take just to do your own
network your own subnet the single
subnet that you own say it your home
yeah if you were to brute force that
which is what that's called it would
take you know hundreds of years so well
this makes it kind of interesting
recently I you love this recently we're
noticing nothing the broadcast what was
the equivalent altogether multicast so
couldn't she just hit the multicast on
the internet and no it doesn't work like
that I I'm happen to be a feeling it
doesn't Morneau the routers actually
block that on purpose win for the
security yeah good
is otherwise it yeah early days I know
it has a whole nother discussion I know
cable modems back when they first came
out so much fun oh yeah they were hmm
backslash backslash anyway mega so from
an ipv6 standpoint the yeah the address
range string large hardest can but a
funny story is we're seeing in the ipv6
community people attempting to do it so
in a rib probably two or three times a
week I get calls somebody's trying to
scan my ipv6 network they're never going
to find us it we've we've calculated is
going to take 60 years for them to find
my first server oh okay we're taking
bets at this guy will probably keep it
going for weeks till he figures out that
he can't stand it so we're seeing this
23 times away it's hilarious as well so
is that why name servers are so
important when it comes I physics game
servers become critical to be able to
find devices what's one of the other
interesting attacks if you want to call
it is early on people were deciding hmm
I can make my servers named deadbeef
yeah oh it's hexadecimal because it is
so through F yeah or food or you know
things like that so people were actually
naming those so from a discovery but we
were able to use tools to do dns mapping
to try to find devices on a segment so
that made it a little bit shorter too
even so that took months to run it
theoretically because you know the home
network is 64 bits yeah you still have
to take all those names four times
across that range so food food food food
would be that and then dead food dead
food and all the variations okay so yeah
alright so so so scanning Brutus
scanning is not going to happen what
really is going to happen is things like
DNS queries yeah that's like an
essential part of any
it's kind of like one of those obvious
things you don't even think about you
just like all right what's on every host
or what we're almost out there but we
have other protocols that give up names
well you said the arps no longer there
so that makes that out of the question
well what do you get replaced with well
it's interesting think about it if I if
I have a divided devices still stacked
me your your second date only price is
still stacked all I have to do is look
up all the hosts under ipv4 yeah but do
a flaw as a transition thing I mean you
do it wide look up and then look up the
ipv6 devices so yes when its native ipv6
it's going to be if the pen tester has
no exposure to the DNS the internal dns
server they didn't make a mistake like i
don't know allow zone transfers on the
outside because that's still out there
oh yeah i know i know i'll tell you a
story later if you don't have access to
that all you're going to be able to get
to is anything that's publicly exposed
whether they looked it up in google or
whether they you know they're took
standardized names and went across it
you can't root for us a space it's just
too large so that not that kind of
changes the exposure from an attack
standpoint so new techniques are gonna
have to be thought about hmm hey you
know it sure makes harder for the
attacker I'm they need they said I held
a lot more confusing for system in as
well I don't know what is just so much
oh yeah space there yes there is well
what really makes it interesting if you
give me one second okay so one of the
big differences on ipv6 versus ipv4 is
by default on an ipv4 device how many IP
addresses do you assign yourself
yourself just one how many more do you
need / we toast free toast yeah you
chose me as one address ah funny it also
needs to know what the broadcasts in the
Gateway is me and right well when ipv6
we have some additional concepts number
one we have the concept of a link-local
address linked local is just for my
local network just it's that this
leveling of 127 001 are you talking
about but that's just silly rat that's
still a
ress that's different than the address
which is your global address okay and
you can have a static global address so
people can get to you inbound for
outbound you can either choose a static
or a privacy address to privacy address
privacy address they take the last 64
bits and a randomized it and you can
choose how often you want to randomize
it so you've got a different address
every time you make a look up if you
choose yes that's going to look to work
or not like port but that's just the
whole concept of like I've got a
different IP address every time I make a
query interesting isn't that break a lot
of fundamental things that we think
about the internet were like I mean just
just as simple as I don't say like a
voting site where you to like you know
there's like a pole and you can only
vote once per IP address now don't they
use cookies okay sure there's that too
but they don't use cookies than it looks
like you either those cookies too you
got to sing like way exactly or oh no I
got G line done this IRC server okay
reconnect now you're starting to see
some of the challenges 906 me too
difficult to like band thing that makes
it so difficult you know now we can ban
a whole subnet not just a unique IP
address we can say this home user is bad
we're gonna be bigger ban hammers well
what's also difficult is how many black
lists out there support ipv6 today I
don't know you're talking about the like
our BLS like RB else Oh like the sands
liked like all the other lists they
don't have that capability using spams
gonna get worse uh we've already started
seeing spam starting last year going
around 530-6 and what they were
attempting to do is but fortunately
because the way they gave the an address
not a static address they gave a
self-generated address which is based on
the mac address which we were able to
identify that it was a microsoft box
Adele box designed in whatever week
there was basically traceability back to
the center like that at all when your IP
address how
your mac address built can you reverse
that together that's what the prior yes
but that's what let's know but that's
what the privacy addresses about it so
that you can hide that but these
spammers they've been doing this don't
know about privacy addresses so yet yes
yes don't tell anybody so because of it
what's happened is you were able to
track back to the unique device yeah but
it still doesn't help you any if just oh
great it was a dell server what do you
do it was made in this week I mean okay
I'm sure law enforcement it's getting
giddy but really now what the hell was
that look giddy long law enforcement
giddy but they rattle their guns I don't
know yeah they waive them there and
there's a shoot of things okay just
checking sorry okay good oh yeah that
thing so privacy is new what does it a
couple the other things we also have you
know we had the nineteen eighteen
addresses or FC 1918 the ten the ten
addresses a 17 to 19 to s exactly well
we have the same concept on ipv6 okay we
have something called a unique local
address the unique local address you
would assign say you're in a corporation
yeah because I don't necessarily need
all of my all of my hosts on my giant
corporate network to have public edible
IP addresses that's just not good
practice exactly so what you issue them
is you issue them a UL a unique local
address which is routable within your
organization only which is very cool and
you get to to the 16 networks that say
everybody gets yes that's a lot and you
can ask for more if you want it's free
well it's round because everybody gets
them themselves it's not like are they
still unique or they all begin with the
same they begin with the first vs FC 0 0
okay and then the rest of it you have to
generate there's an algorithm to
generate you see an IP address that says
FC 0 0 that's the same thing that's how
you end up seeing a ten-dollar 192 dot
or exactly okay exactly but then that
last set of bids is all unique
and you use the time you have to hash or
time with your mac address you have to
do an md5 and several other things it
then generates what that the rest of
that route ability is for that network
and then you can decide the size of the
network in addition to that so say you
randomize you took the first four octets
and which is FC 0 0 you took the next
one and you may made that your network
now you have or the next two now you
have what 16 bits that's for your
network yeah I think for most
organizations it's plenty yeah which
then you may like to sub down your own
internet pretty much ready subnet it so
here the servers here that you know you
do your vlans out and stuff like that
it's funny you say that I one of the
services i use is hurricane electric
hurricane electric is a tunnel provider
real trusted great ipv6 DNS great
connections all over the world and such
no I'm not selling i own and the song or
anything but what they did was I wanted
a larger space so they allocated me a /
32 so for my home network I have the
size of the whole internet just in route
ability plus that large address space
fun is that great be fun to run honey d
on that okay yeah yeah come find me
you'll never fight that is it wouldn't
work because every reply it relies on
art and everything's broken already oh
well yeah a lot of the architects go
away but what happens is now that goes
to layer 3 okay there's a is there an
equivalent yes you said just listening
to that it's actually referred to as
neighbor discovery what happens to the
local system sends its sources source IP
so we're talking layer 30 and then it
tries to assign itself in a dress ajf
generator it generates an address either
random or not a baseball MAC address
because you send that not to hit exactly
because there's so many of them you
could just guess an address and
probability says that no one else is
gonna be using it and that's what this
does is if anybody else is using it goes
oops okay so let me change my address
and let me resend to see if anybody else
is on that dress
because you're not going to like hit
like me in the late insanity strike
twice you know it's right and that's
called neighbor discovery for a device
to find the router then performs a
router discovery it says hey where's the
router and then the router actually
replies back hey I'm the default gateway
here's all your configurations it can as
depending on how the router discoveries
configure the router is configured it
can also include hey by the way here's
your DNS you don't need to have dhcp
anymore if you choose so for setting up
quick networks say a show like this yeah
you put one wireless wired wireless
router in connection to the ipv6 network
everybody can connect in get an address
assign an address in seconds and be
routable with no changes no
configurations it's pretty cool that's
nice so yeah I have a slide here for
that there's the tools so you can find
out what your addresses what are your
unicast address with your multicast
address from linux and windows and the
second part is oh by the way for it to
the process we refer to as identifying
if there is a duplicate is referred to
as dad or duplicate address detection
yeah pretty funny and it goes through
the process actually sends an ICMP
packet 135 / I like 135 to ping it
before trial seal the address yes nice
yeah well how thoughtful it is yeah I
mean that's what you expect from your
dad right so once you've gone through
that even address you've route ability
again after you do the router
advertising discovery you're up on the
network at that point your router can
decide this particular device and we
only allocate link local address you can
only communicate local or hmm I'm in a
corporation I'm going to also give you a
ula address so you can route within the
organization or wow this is a this is a
desktop so we're also going to assign
you an additional global address so the
point I'm trying to bring up is
no longer do you get a single address
you get a scope to dress you typically
get five addresses by default wow that's
so changes away we think and by the way
from a penetration tester standpoint now
we've got five addresses to find out if
something's bound to it not just a
single one changes away again we think
yeah well not only all the tools broken
but the techniques should have to change
dramatically yeah I actually feel a
seems yeah it's going to be interesting
to see how those evolve as this is
adapted because I'm sure a lot of it
right now is relying on the the dual
layer or the link just have you said
that the dual stack have any night
before as well as ip6 make sure that
makes things easier but in a world where
it's only ip6 and a lot changes my mind
is blown and I think this is great but I
really just want to sink my teeth in now
and okay I just try to get myself in a
dress at home and start playing with
that where would I go to to learn more
about setting up a 96 network or we're
getting myself a 96 address online well
provide you a bunch of links but in
addition you can go to hurricane
electric and get hooked up and hooked up
and be on the Internet v6 in about 15
minutes nice so it's it's oh by the way
they also sponsor bgp if you decide you
also want bgp for your environment to
play with yes fun yes life becomes very
interesting in ipv6 that is so cool well
thank you so much I really appreciate
thank you taking the time to disco me on
this I'm sure I'll have plenty more
questions but I did you do the twitter
or any of those yeah I have a Twitter
ipv6 sec which is little security things
on a regular basis and I'll give you six
things and also have a website and I'll
provide you the website what is the
address there the website it's
address get to cuddle this it's one of
the sites google com / sites / ipv6
