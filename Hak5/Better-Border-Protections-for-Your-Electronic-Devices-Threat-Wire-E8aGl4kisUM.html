protection's did some mantech just else
the CIA and Wi-Fi networks can hack your
phone all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for April 11 2017
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom if
you have not checked out our patreon yet
please do so we have lots that we want
to do for the show but we can't do it
without your support my next goal is to
add a monthly Q&amp;amp;A exclusively for all of
our patrons and we are going to upgrade
our threat wire set patreon calm and the
link is in the show notes on to our
first story in the US a warrant is
needed to search your electronic devices
but if you are crossing through the US
Customs and Border Protection those
rights are basically null and void
because customs and border control
basically have the right to search and
seize your device without warrant detain
you and possibly deport you in recent
months there have been reports of border
agents asking for social network
passwords as well as unwarranted
searches of a NASA own phone belonging
to a US citizen some senators want to
change that by introducing a bill to the
house and senate that basically puts the
same regulations on border control they
would need to get a warrant in probable
cause to be able to search your
electronic devices this would only apply
to legal US residents though traveling
back into the US Senator Ron Wyden a
Democrat of Oregon and Senator Rand Paul
a Republican of Kentucky introduced the
bill together summarizing that it is
quote to ensure the digital contents of
electronic equipment and online accounts
belonging to or in the possession of US
state persons entering or exiting the
United States are adequately protected
at the border and for other purposes and
they labeled it the protecting data at
the border act what a cute name the bill
speaks to searches being unreasonable
under the Fourth Amendment and includes
fingerprint or biometrics as access
credentials that a citizen can denied to
hand over to an agent it also states a
cutoff time of four hours for delaying
entry to a US citizen this bill would
not change the warrantless
search for tourists visitors or foreign
citizens visiting the United States even
more from WikiLeaks vault 7 this week on
Friday they leaked 27 documents some of
those hundreds of pages logged codenamed
grasshopper which is according to
WikiLeaks a platform used to build
customized malware payloads for
microsoft windows operating systems
grasshopper provides flexible
customizations for mauer so a CIA agent
can build the software to work a certain
way depending on their target
grasshopper tools allow for persistence
on a machine which basically means it's
going to run as a rootkit and it will
keep coming back ignoring antivirus and
reboots the tool can include encryption
and allows for personal security product
avoidance so it's not detected by that
antivirus software one part of the
software which is called stolen goods
was pilfered from car burp a crime
rootkit that would can be found in the
wild and is used for bank fraud malware
and includes persistence as well this
grouping of documents gives us a really
technical tutorial in how the CIA spies
on targeted Windows users like we had
mentioned here on threat wire last week
we are likely to start seeing
comparisons of the code that was
released by WikiLeaks and what is
actually infecting targets in the wild
and it seems that actually came true a
lot faster than I thought it would
researchers at Symantec have confirmed a
group that they called Longhorn has been
infecting industrial agency targets
since as early as 2007 with very very
similar tools as what has been described
in the vault 7 leaks Symantec hasn't
necessarily come out and said the long
heard group that we've been tracking is
the CIA for sure but the resemblance in
this research between the two is
definitely there Longhorn has targeted
machines in 16 different countries
including ones in the Middle East Europe
Asia and Africa Symantec's whole blog
post can be found in the show notes
detailing the comparisons that they've
made a google project zero researcher
named Galvan yamini discovered a flaw in
commonly used Wi-Fi chips that could
allow over the year hacking of Apple and
Android devices since many different
brands of smartphones rely on broadcom
Wi-Fi SOC to make their devices connect
to wireless access points it's very
common
problem affects popular brands such as
Apple's iPhone ghouls pixel samsung's
galaxies and even more Apple fixed the
problem with iOS update 10 point 3.1 and
Google's update is only available to a
few devices such as the pixel with
Android phones on cell carriers awaiting
the update the hack allows for an
attacker to run malicious code on a
smartphone without even touching it by
just being in the wireless vicinity
benjamini was able to execute a very
very simple proof of concept of the code
that basically just allows him to change
one variable on the devices memory but
the implications could be way worse than
that this is another example of the term
stack buffer overflow which is a common
means for attack luckily the researchers
say broadcom was very efficient with
providing patches for the problems and
working with vendors thanks again to all
the fine people who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow are you can spare a
bit of change any little bit helps us
keep the show completely independent and
ad-free we now have an audio-only RSS
feed extra content and early access for
a patron so definitely check out all
those perks we might even feature your
furbaby in an upcoming episode like the
brand new Chloe hello Chloe you are
adorable I want to pet you can't donate
you can also hit up the subscribe button
or you can share this episode on your
favorite social media page use the
hashtag threat wire so that we can see
it in we might even retweet you so yay
awesome perk with that I am Shannon
Morse and i will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
