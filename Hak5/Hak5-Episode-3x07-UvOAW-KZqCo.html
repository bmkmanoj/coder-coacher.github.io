that and a whole lot more this time on
high five
hey Jensen cracks have been part of like
hack culture since I don't know what
like 300 baud modem and here to show us
all about the cracks Chris garling calm
thanks for asking a new name Chris
curling and the doc mommy we have the
second last name yep so what are we
crackin what's going on man um ki jai oh
well what we're cracking is actual
practice stuff the legal stuff that
people use to you know what I want to do
reverse engineering so that it goes to
break a law because winners don't do
where's exact you know so kind of
stumbled upon it not some upon but kind
of some lacrosse it the other day we
went to learn securi online because my
friend Chris gates runs that and he
posted a thing called crack me and I had
to look up what crack me was i guess
it's an actual what's a crack it's a
legal way to practice Virginia reverse
engineering other different programmers
create these exe s that you have to
supply like a password or some kind of a
write your own key Janner you know you
unlock it and you can win prizes and you
know okay so it sounds very similar to
like kind of like a hack war game yes
where it's like aa brute this box and
you know there's the other team trying
to like secure it and stuff like that
mhm exactly so we uh we stumbled across
it here and this is their website and
just kind of downloaded here and I had
to actually look up how to go about
disassembling it and I found a program
called dotnet reflector ok so you
download the crack me what is the crack
it's just a zip file that has the exe in
it okay and what does that do when you
actually open this it asks for a
password Wow okay so so this is a really
simple one you just rather than taking
something like Hydra and attempting to
brute-force this week we know it would
take forever yep we're gonna we're going
to use this little program here it's
called a.net reflector and i downloaded
it and i have in this folder here and we
run it so what does God net reflector
allow us to do it's a pretty much d
compiles don't think it D compiles you
into the exact source code but it
interprets and shows you what the code
you know what kind of code so what the
source code of that actual program might
be yes so what kind of languages does it
support then uh I have a little drop
down here IL c sharp visual visual basic
Delphie MC plus+ and chrome i'm not sure
i have heard of three of those yeah
about the same here all right so we go
in and we open it this is my nick see
here and what it does is it uh it has it
has a bunch of different libraries it
operates under all the net-net
frameworks and there's a couple other
ones and when you open it it drops it
down into your little workspace here and
then it starts to show you everything
that's connected to it you know all the
little things that make up like all the
calls visual basic for example in this
one and so when you say the references
we're actually taking a look at like the
DLLs and other resources so then we here
we go you're enough drone the system
stuff right here all the libraries it
won't act I think some of the stuff
won't actually show cuz it's not code I
see per se but then we go into the
different crack me things and this is
the actual project I guess see how very
cool yeah so it's visual basic their
name to my project like a halt exactly
so and there's nothing in here I already
went through those I'm not going to work
at that so we started hunting around
because we weren't real programming
experts and we're just kind of looking
for stuff that you know directs us to
where the password might be all right so
we start going through the crack me
itself and we're looking around and and
we see like PSW box submit button things
like the asteroid box there you go then
i think if i go here disassemble it and
it'll pop up window and there's a new so
that's the source this is the actual
code that that makes this happen now is
that the actual source code that was
written I don't know I written this is
what it cut it reverse interprets it as
yes I see ya so when like you know
interpreted languages the compiler you
know takes it down and it makes it a lot
the machine so how do we find the
password well we we start looking
through here where and we're like okay
PSW box we see submit click stuff down
here and here submit button so we kind
of said well submit
that must be what happens when you click
Submit so go we clicked on it and there
it is there's a very simple statement
it's just a if statement and avoid
submit okay so that's the the function
and it's it's it across if password text
equals too easy yep in leet speak in
leet speak of course so what happens
when we go ahead and plug that into our
we take our little box here and we can't
do enter I guess there we go and then it
just says email chris g i learned
security online to win so so yeah you're
a winner you're what connects my five so
i believe they're giving away some books
i think by the time that this actually
you know i think they wrapping it up
next week alright so looks very cool but
at the same time I got to say like
there's absolutely no way it is that
easy for those awesome groups known as a
really good ice and video like go is
practice yeah this isn't like if you
were to open up i don't know like insert
name big corporate program maybe
photoshop for example dot exe doubt
you're gonna see the source code no i
don't be not so maybe that's so maybe
that's the next yeah chapter we have a
this and it goes into some high-level
stuff there's some more tools that i
found here at this website and all these
all these sites will be in the show
notes great and just different types of
disassemblers d compilers hex editing
you know things like that and that's for
the more advanced stuff that you'll find
at crack miss de and cracks news de is
where you would find more of these
cracks way a lot more almost nineteen
hundred of them wow so you could really
go from like you know the intermediate
to the advanced and start and I go to
lace here and you see how if over here
these ones are solved and it says who
solved it so there's a lot of ones that
weathers unsold yeah there's a lot of
them so great it even goes back I mean
here's this is 17 January of this is
kept pretty you know yeah up to date you
know what decompiling exe s and you know
hex editing searching for strings and
stuff really sounds like a great way to
spend a rainy afternoon no joking
serious it sounds like a lot of fun yeah
and I know that just from personal
experience keygens have always been you
know a near and dear thing to my heart
because it's like magic the way that
they were
and best of all you get that leaky gym
music so always you can get key gen
music net one of my favorite sources you
know not for ya it's part of the demo
scene I consider yeah yeah awesome well
Chris thanks so much for coming by and
showing us how to get our crack on yep
and and of course people can find out
more about you and all the fun crazy
stuff you do Chris growing calm because
that's his name yeah all right name well
let's see listen some people just jam
out
going on guys today I'm going to show
you how to hook up your rock band drums
to your PC so that you can get a little
free play on whenever you want create
your own drum tracks and basically show
off to your friends and how awesome you
are on your rock band drums first part
of the the little hack here is we have
to install the drum drivers which are
not provided by Microsoft however they
are provided by another guy you can go
to his blog it's at DX prog com he's got
the drivers he's ex created a bad script
for you guys so you can just run it
install the drivers plug in the rock
band drums and you're good to go the
second part of this comes out of Andrew
redson who has created a very nice
application that he's keeping updated
pretty regularly he actually just
released an update yesterday but what
this is is it's going to me it's going
to require that you have the hack drum
driver installed it's going to require
that you have the latest version of
directx 9 C installed or else it's not
going to work your rock band drums must
be plugged in before you actually start
the application and from there we can
actually open it up and you've got your
drums on your computer now basically
I've already got the drums installed and
what we're going to do is if you open up
the menu here you've got free play you
can assign the pads different sounds
you've got record and playback so you
can actually record your drum track
trade it with your friend and see if he
can make it any better and he could play
it back on his pc if he's got the drums
as well now the nice thing about this is
we can just go ahead and here in a free
play and
you could play drums to your heart's
content to your fingers bleed or to your
leg falls off really doesn't matter you
no longer have to have your drums hooked
up to your xbox to just whale on some
drums do whatever you want the other
part of rock band drum hackery is uh I
actually broke my rock band drums the
first time that I had them and yes I was
wailing on him I apparently I'm the
drummer for the hak5 rock band group
Paulie is catching up quickly though so
I'm going to have to smack him down I
actually broke the pad on the yellow and
red drum pads and thought of this idea
here is get a mouse pad not an overly
thick miles pan because you're going to
be missing hits but a mouse pad
nonetheless this one here is probably be
about an eighth of an inch thick and you
just go ahead and cut it out in the
diameter of the drum pad you're probably
gonna want to cut it so you can still
see the colors in case you have people
coming over I don't know exactly where
all the colors are at and some people
have suggested that you glue it onto the
drum pads why glue packing tape has
worked since we got rock band a week
after it came out with these drums and
they have not faltered yet so it also
makes it sound and feel a little bit
easier your sticks pop off the drums a
little easier and from there you've got
protected rock band drums that you're
not going to have a problem with
breaking for more tips like this go over
to hack five hit the forums and I'll see
you guys
you
so every once in a while a device comes
along where you say to yourself you know
if I could just get into that i'm sure i
could have a lot of fun well here to
tell us what he's found as just such a
device is there and darren what's going
on man hey things for having me on the
show problem so so yeah this little fawn
router here has definitely tickled my
techno list and i could say right off
the bat that this is all inspired by an
article i read over at room 362 calm
highly recommended that is the website
of our friend muaks that would be
correct okay mobic the big guy that i
just kind of stand in the shadow of so
uh I mean he blocks the Sun yeah yeah
yeah so thanks muaks and this is a
basically the fon router is from Fond
calm and it's a very inexpensive little
router that you can pick up for forty
dollars at their site that that allows
you to to share your internet with the
public at large and in turn you have
free in turn you get free access to any
other fun okay so the way it works is
they send you this little box here and
it's just it has one ethernet jack and
it's gotten atheros chipset for a
wireless here and by the fall out of the
box you plug it into the to your tubes
whether you've got an existing router or
you just plug it into your DSL cable
whatever and and it will go ahead and
create two wireless networks to ssi DS
ones fawn underscore or whatever and
that's the public one and then there's
the my place network that it creates
which is the one for you which is wpa
encrypted with the password being by
default the serial number on the bottom
of the device okay so that's but we're
not going to do that now you see by
default it's it runs open wrt which you
would think would be nice great it's a
little lockdown okay Wes SH access no
ability to do some fun stuff especially
with that chip set in there you could
probably do some fun stuff okay so we're
going to do some fun stuff with it in
part two but for right now we need to
prep the turkey we need to get into it
that's that's what we need to do right
so we're going to replace the firmware
on this bad boy and the first thing we
need to keep in mind is do not I
do not plug it into the internet yeah
you are you did just that well I turned
what would be a forty-dollar hack into a
beautiful $80 hack because mr. genius
here plugged it into a internet and it
got its a little update on and now it's
got the new version of the software
which is a pita to hack so basically
what we're saying is don't plug it in
but in the show notes we're going to
have information on how to depending on
which firmware version you've got how to
actually get back into it just in case
you went ahead and plugged it in tubes
right auto update is now by default what
normally comes out of the box is as you
can see here firmware version 0 point
7.1 release one okay okay there's a hack
very simple hack for release one there's
also a very simple hack for release two
and this one updated himself to release
three which has a very convoluted hack
with very mixed results and for me it
just did not work okay okay but I've got
links to all of this possible ways to
get in and I'm going to demonstrate the
very easiest way there are several
different sites that have walkthroughs
on how to get this guy opened up first
being over at the open wrt wiki they
have a great and huge article that
explains how to get in to this guy over
ssh and once you're in there how to
upload the new firmware by entering the
you know the hex values and it gets
really convoluted very you know crossref
user-friendly not so much so then
there's you know an easier article /
room 362 and then there is over at
useless hacks they have a great little
article that that does basically the
same thing using HFS web server of end
and a couple other tools and and i'll
have all of these links in the show
notes to these different methods but the
method i'm going to be talking about is
the super easy method it's two steps
it's called break in and upload new
firmware using a GUI GUI yeah awesome
yeah so how do we do that well the way
that the phone works is that within the
first 10 seconds of booting up it has a
piece of software in here called red
boot which is a boot manager okay that
listens
on this little serial port here for 10
seconds and if you can telnet in through
the serial port within that 10 seconds
an issue a control C to just kind of
break it you can go ahead and issue your
own commands and replace the firmware
great but we don't have a serial cable
no because this this isn't a normal
serial cable that well this is normal
but it's not like you could just plug it
directly into your PC your PC uses like
plus and minus 12 volts whereas this guy
is expecting 3.3 volts okay you can get
I believe it's called a TTL I'm not
positive on that but there's a converter
there's a special cable it's very
similar to the cables that you would
have to go from like USB to your cell
phone nowadays okay I didn't have that
cable laying around so what we want to
do is just tell red boot hey wouldn't
you mind just listening on on the
Ethernet port as well because then I can
telnet in that be a lot easier yeah
alright so I've got this so what we do
is we set them up on a switch or use a
crossover cable use a crossover cable
and we need to we need to go ahead and
enable ssh so we can replace the red the
colonel and replace the red boot
configuration okay so to do that what we
need to do is if you're using the r1
from where it's so super simple there's
a file here called SSH enable the HTML
and if I take a look at the code here
all it really does is is it's a form
with method of posts the action is to
this connection to SH file over on the
web server and the value that it's
sending is is / ET c / init d / drop
bear okay that's it it just enables this
is H it's so freaking super simple all
right that's on our one if you have our
to the hack use if they've kind of like
lock that one down the other alternative
hack is to tell it to use a different
dns server that then does the same kind
of thing when it goes to register with
radius yes it's a little bit more
complicated but it's not too difficult
because when people have made it you
know pretty easy with a hacked server
all ready for you ok ok and then if
you've got released three there's a very
convoluted method you
seeing a second router and some crazy
dns stuff and i won't even get into it
but it's not all right it's it's not too
so we run the file yes it enables SSH
yeah so if I go ahead and pull up that
file here it just looks like this i
click Submit and as long as I'm
connected to it it will go ahead and
enable ssh okay which I can go ahead and
pull up putty and log in to 12 to 16 8
10 dot 1 which is its default IP this is
all the way you're connected to either
over the Internet or over the my place
the prime SSID to probably network so
got yes so I've already hacked this one
so what we're seeing here is the open
wrt splash he would see a similar one
and be like oh fun you know so that's
how you get into it and then all you
need to do from there is issue a few
commands that will allow you to replace
the the red boot configuration so all
you have to do is copy over these two
files open I'm sorry out hex which is
the red boot configuration and you need
a replacement for the vmlinux that the
colonel so in this case it's open wrt
for AR 531 2.4 colonel vmlinux blood
area you SCP those files over we're if
you want to run a web server locally and
use double you get when your ssh din
that'll work is welcome care you just
need to get those files over you issue
these two commands it replaces the
colonel it replaces the red boot config
you restart the guy and in the first 10
seconds of booting up he starts looking
for for telnet on port 9000 okay okay so
now we can go ahead and use our GUI
rather than doing all the crazy
convoluted like here's the hex entries
of the memory addresses where we want to
root nap so some German guys wrote a GUI
for it it makes it entirely simple
exactly clicks and it's done yeah
there's this great site that i will link
to in the show notes it's all in german
expect and bishan do I job as nixle boot
so but it's the at least the program is
in English enough to understand it
you're pretty much fire this bad boy up
and all it's so simple you just check
the file that you want free of your root
filesystem ok in this case we're going
to flash this guy with
open wrt this also works with dd-wrt but
open word is a lot more fun for what
we're going to be doing in part 2 so
we're going to send it the squash FS
file for the atheros 2.6 I think this
kamikazes later version of open wrt
we're going to choose the checkbox for
the colonel and choose our Colonel here
to the Pharaohs 2.6 okay and then we
choose which adapter we're connected to
it on I did this over a switch you could
do it with a crossover cable either way
so you choose your adapter you unplug
your router you plug it back in you
click go it connects to it replaces the
firmware and about 20 minutes later you
now have an unlocked phone so make sure
that they know 20 minutes maybe a little
less maybe a little longer but it is
doing something yeah it's a slow process
i'm in fact when I first SCPD over the
Audi X and the and the replacement
kernel for a 512k file it took like a
minute and a half okay so it oh it's so
speed demon but it is working and it's
doing its thing so yes okay now once
you've got your open wrt on here that's
unlocked you should be able to telnet
into it and set a root password because
by default that's what it looks like by
default it does not have a root password
set so you just need to go ahead and
tell knit into the bad boy run passwd
enter your new password and bam you're
good to go from there you can enable
Wi-Fi and I've got all of these in the
show notes but basically pull up putty
or your favorite SSH client go ahead and
here and and issue these commands to
enable the Wi-Fi okay make sure that you
can verify that it's running so go ahead
and like you know pull up whatever OS
you have today you can see the actual
wireless so I can see it by default the
SSID is open wrt okay and then go ahead
and verify that the clients work so ssh
n issue w land config a THC or list
it'll list what clients are connected to
it and then bam you're good to go we
should note that also there is no web
server front end for the new open wrt no
not by default but we were we are going
to be doing lots of fun stuff like that
or in the park
too and there's something else that was
important to note here and that is oh
the configuration for is super simple
it's all in / ET c / config there's a
file for network there's a file for
wireless I'll have links to the open wrt
wiki pages that explain how to change
this it's really super simple i mean
this is this is the SI d SSID and you
just replace it this is the IP ranges
just replace it BAM all right yeah
sounds great so we have a brand new non
updated yes version of the fun that we
are going to play with next month yeah
all right you go great all right there
let's go get a snack yes
have you ever been on a public computer
not had access to internet explorer or
firefox we have a solution for you if
you open up calculator and go into the
help section under help topics once it
loads you right click on the title bar
and you'll see an option jump to URL and
you can put any URL you want in there
and we have one we're going to throw in
there and voila hak5 forums for more
tips like these check out the tips forum
at forms hak5 org alright well last
month's trivia question was the
following the NEC be 20 processor a
29,000 transistor CPU was reverse
engineered to be pin compatible with
what Intel chip I was correctly answered
by trinitron X kind of interesting about
that chip was it was not only pin
compatible with the 8088 but it was also
instruction set compatible with the 80
186 and supposedly ran about thirty
percent faster than Intel's own stuff
it's kind of like the AMD of the time
you know so you got imagine reverse
engineering and I'm going to make better
hmm an intelligence if you just keep up
with the crack amis you might be doing
that too there you go all right all
right this month's trivia question
happens to be oddly enough about rock
band the indecent new wave band
freezepop has been featured in many
music games including harmonics is rock
band which game was the first to feature
this boston-based band you can send your
answers to trivia at hak5 org until i
talk about free thought now makes me
want to go play some brain power
alright for all those network
administrators who are concerned about
miscellaneous computers ports open on
their networks will coppola is here with
us to help alleviate your fears and know
exactly what's running on your network
well how's it going buddy very good sir
alright so what do we got today what
we're doing is we're going to demo a
piece of software called in protect
which is more or less a front end for
Nessus and in that okay who is the
primary target for this the software
network administrators or just about
anybody who's interested in their own
security on their own network okay so
why do we need this you know is for
somebody who you know working with the
network every day why do we need this
instead of NOT you know going through
and just knowing what we've already got
on our network well it's centralized you
can sit in one PC whatever your terminal
is it worked and then scan all your
machines on your subnet okay and it's
sure beats going every machine and
physically touching it definitely
definitely definitely so this package
includes Nessus yes sir what else it
also includes in map okay you can also
compile this from source and include
Hydra that was another tool that you can
incorporate in here we're not going to
incorporate hydro into the scan mode
okay but we do have it up and running in
a vm then what are the different way of
me you can do it nvm can you do it you
know I've see you can you can download
the network security tool kit live CD
okay they also have a vm everything is
pre-compiled inside the live CD and the
vm and all you have to do is just get
your settings correct and you're ready
to roll all right so let's go through
and take a look at this and what it can
actually do for network administrators
and making their lives a little easier
basically you're you're introduced into
it you have to go to the Settings panel
okay and you have it protects settings
you would fill in the URL for an S
astore you can download that if you
don't already have an update the file
name which you're going to grab the URL
for the plugins the plug-in file names
the md5 which is also a good thing
because you want to make sure that it's
actually the correct file right the sig
file names
and you can also have it set up to send
email alerts to another network
administrator maybe he's on in a room at
location or something okay so after your
studies are correct you want to go ahead
and perform a scan okay really simple
you schedule a new scan mm-hmm give it a
name save it add some hosts which we've
already done this once earlier
so we can do ranges yes okay this is
probably not going to take the range
i've installed but after you've got your
range set up your scanning aside your
network it does take a while for the
skin it'll sit in the background and
formulas scans are finished okay but as
your scans are finished you can check
the status of them by going to this page
and selecting which new scan you're
running either it be necessary or in map
currently they say there's a sixty-seven
percent will continue to let them go
through okay now can we look at reports
while they're scanning what is currently
found or do we have to wait for it to
complete before we can actually view
those I would wait till it completes I'm
sure there is a way that you can review
by check out the tail of the commands
and everything like that you can do I
would wait for word to actually finish
but you can do an HTML dump or a PDF
dope okay so we've got an SS can that we
performed earlier ten we will check out
the HTML of it and it gives you pie
charts and tells you whether your
serious vulnerabilities or whatever it's
found and in this case it's found
eighty-six percent info and fourteen
percent as a low okay it gives you the
IP addresses of the boxes that you've
scanned okay and it gives you detailed
reports about what it's found unless
this IP address here has found netbios
open and of course it's identified as
microsoft due to the 445 board and if i
was actually a registered Nessus user it
would give me full details and info
about this okay so what we're saying is
this is something that to get all the
features and functionality up we
actually have to pay for that's correct
okay but but it is free to try and see
what it's like and then right if you
want to you can go ahead and write i'll
give you an idea of what's vulnerable on
your system it may it be a false report
or not but gives you a concept of what
vulnerabilities you may have okay great
so we've got our scan results it gives
us you know what with the pcs that we've
scanned on the network have
vulnerabilities for now does this only
work for pcs or is it going to go
through any network device that may have
a vulnerability and look at it it'll
scare it'll scan routers or just about
any machine that you have as long as it
has an IP address it can be scanned okay
great and the set up for it how
difficult is that if somebody wanted to
you know I mean you said that there's a
live CD and stuff like that but if they
wanted to are there instructions
someplace that we can go to say I want
all this custom stuff in here and then
build it most definitely okay there's a
walkthroughs for the live CD there's
walkthroughs for the BM there's even
walkthroughs if you want to compile it
from scratch for your own personal use
okay well great um let's see who's who's
machine was then i think that was
chris's i think we're gonna have to let
him know that yeah he's got some
problems gone I bios is not a good thing
to share yeah well alright so we'll
we'll go ahead and put all the
information in his show notes for us so
that you guys can download nessus that
you can download and protect and
everything else and he's also going to
have the configuration links in the show
notes will make so much money not a
problem all right now
sighs few episodes ago I showed off a
little program called packet builder to
allow you to create installation
packages i believe it was for segment on
VNC well to my surprise I found out that
there was actually a program built into
windows that'll do basically the same
thing really simple you don't need to
pay for anything it's called i express
two point oh it's built into Windows you
just start run type i express you get
this great little wizard and it allows
you to create a quick little package so
we're just going to go ahead and create
one here for the phone hack that we just
showed so we'll create a self-extracting
file here and we're just going to tell
it to extract the files and run the
installation program and then we're
going to give it a title so I'm going to
call it fawn hack or something like that
and then you have the options to give it
a prompt and you can prompt users with
different text we're guessing that no
prompt and you also have the option to
throw in a license like if you you know
really scan something under the GPL or
something no license and then we get
here add the package files I just got
those on my desktop here these are the
the fon GUI hack utility as well as the
file system and new kernel so go ahead
to select those and then all I have to
do is choose what installation program
it's the only executable select this
program and then I can select something
to do post installation I don't have
anything for that and then here's where
I get the options whether I even want to
show window or make it completely hidden
so that's kind of cool and then of
course we have our finished message
you're like thanks for using the program
I don't know I'm just going to leave it
blank and then we go ahead and have the
option to let it know where to save this
and I'm going to choose to hide the
extraction progress and say next to I
have to give a name I'm going to call
fawn hack next and no restart after the
installation finishes and we don't want
to save this for later use BAM it does
its thing BAM there we go finished and
now I have my phone hack exe a double
click on that it does all in the
background and you know makes my mix my
installation really simple and now got
my program ups so there you have it if
you want more tips like this head

i'm here for this month's hack and
basically what i'm going to do is I'm
going to fix all your guitar problems
that you may have we all do if you have
rock band you've got guitar problems
it's that simple what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you the only permanent
way that I know to fix your rock band
guitar I've already cracked it open here
basically you just take out all the
screws that you can possibly see lift
off the back plate and here we have the
inside of the rock band guitar now for
those of you that don't know it has
never actually seen inside of this
basically there's two parts that are the
problem there they are the pickups for
the up and down strum on the guitar when
you're actually playing it now the
reason that you have double hits you
have missed hits or you have actually no
pickups whatsoever is because the person
that designed this came up with the most
insane design for can you get a shot of
this they're the most insane design for
a pickup system ever okay now in the
guitar hero 3 and all the other guitar
hero series of guitars they actually use
a switch it's not like the ones that
we're going to use today however it's
close enough and this is theirs you've
heard of the rubber band tricks you've
heard of the put scotch tape on it it
eventually always fails ok so we're
going to do today is we're going to show
you how to fix your guitar with rock
band once and for all over here we've
got our list of tools we've got your
screwdrivers of different sizes on
either ends you're big and you're small
and there are certain screws that are
going to require the smaller one but for
the most part you can probably get away
with the larger screwdriver we've got
our solder our soldering iron in this
case a portable cold heat unit pair of
pliers snips and an exacto knife okay if
you are scared to strip the leads right
here on the pickups you can use a nice
little thing but I don't need that so
what we're going to do is first i'm
going to show you where things should go
should look when you open up your guitar
now basically i've already got this side
done here and you can see kind of what
we're going to do the main issue that we
have with the way that this is right now
is when you hit this whatever reason i
cannot get it on there when you hit this
it's twisting this entire assembly and
that's not what we want so what we're
going to do is we're going to actually
remove the screw that's associated with
this part right here you're going to
take it off just like this and you're
going to be left with this what we're
going to do is we're just going to snip
this end right off okay there it goes
now before I actually get into cutting
the shielding off the wire i'm going to
show you what we actually bought for
four dollars ok this is a sub mini lever
switch that you can buy at your local
RadioShack store it costs about three
dollars and fifty cents okay this switch
is going to be the answer to all of our
problems by two of them one for the up
and one for the down okay once you get
that essentially we're pretty much good
what we're going to do now is we're
going to actually take off
the strum bar there's four screws in the
corner of the strum bar and we're just
going to take that off right now because
we actually need to trim some of the
plastic now I didn't give you a warning
at the beginning of this segment because
I figured you probably would have
already understood this will void your
warranty you will not be able to return
this to EA but if you want a permanent
fix because there are complaints on the
rock band forums that even return
guitars that EA has shipped other people
are failing yet again so this is going
to be the answer to all your problems
basically you can see here the
difference in the sides these two sides
used to look identical okay now this is
a sign that how it comes from EA this is
the side that we've modified basically
made it almost entirely flat as possible
as we could and that's going to allow
for clearance of the new switch to go in
place okay so what I'm going to do right
now is I'm actually just going to take
these snips and I'm going to cut all of
this away
alright well we're back finally we were
done cleaning up the pickup the strum
bar for the rock band controller and in
here you can see exactly where we did
the cleanup we basically flattened it
out as much as we possibly could so it
looks similar to the other side that
we've already proof of concept it okay
and basically the entire reason that
we're doing this is to make room for the
new switch that is going to actually
detect when you are actually strumming
the guitar so now what we need to do is
we need to do one other modification to
the guitar and that's going to be on the
holder for the screw where the old item
old pickup bar used to be and basically
what we're going to do is we're going to
eyeball about one eighth of an inch
maybe a little less we're just going to
take our snips we're going to come in
here as flat as we possibly can and
we're just going to snip a little bit
off try and clean it up as best as you
can alright the new switch that we're
actually adding is a lot I shouldn't say
a lot it adds some height to the overall
profile of the unit so we need to to
trim that down a little bit here you
could see the one that we've already
done and basically this is the switch
here okay the screw that's in there does
not come with the screw with a switch
it's a simple wood screw that you can
buy at any home depot lowes or wherever
your local hardware store is and it
simply protrude zout a little bit just
enough so that we can actually anchor it
into the the holding point for the screw
on the previous unit what we're going to
do now is we're actually going to put in
the strum bar once again and it only
goes in one way we're going to take our
four
screws that came out of it we're going
to put these back in here and there we
go all right okay our lever switch is a
little wide so we're going to take the
component here and once again we're
going to trim it without breaking the
entire unit off as best as we can I'm
sorry for the bad camera work I do
apologize you're going to want to take
once again about an eighth of an inch
off of this entire unit here okay you
may sound like a lot I probably should
be taking this off right about now but
we can sweat through it and just make it
about as flat as you possibly can I
think that's good so we're going to do
now is we're actually going to screw the
assembly down
the last thing that you need to do is
once you've got it in and you've got
both pickups hitting just where you want
them we actually need to solder the old
connections onto the new switch what
we've got here is we've got a continuity
tester basically you can find it on any
of your standard multimeters we're going
to go ahead and set it to when the
circuit is closed it's actually going to
emit an audible tone that lets me know
that hey the switch is working now I
already know that when depressed these
two should sound off when we let go
nothing remember that this is a
three-way switch even though it's not
being pressed the outer connection
points close the circuit we want the
inner too so use a tester to make sure
that you're actually soldering the right
ones from there we're actually just
going to take a knife because that's the
way I like to do things and we're going
to strip kids please do not try this at
home as far as using a knife
okay now that we've got the bare metal
exposed it's as simple as soldering on
the connection points to our new
switch
okay make sure you guys leave yourself
enough thicken your your solder is
actually going to connect with the
switch here all right turn your
soldering iron on inside our way we're
going to do just make sure they're tight
and they are tuck them back in where
they supposed to go just like that
actually will type this one underneath
now remember this is the only time you
will have to do this mod right here
we've got a one hundred percent will
never break again rock band guitar mod
put the shell back on close it up and
you guys are good to go item numbers my
own thoughts and comments and pictures
of these different steps will all be in
the show notes for you guys so if you
have any questions feel free to post on
the forums visit the show notes or I'm
usually in the IRC chat and you guys can
ask me any questions if you actually
want to fix your own rock band guitar
you
