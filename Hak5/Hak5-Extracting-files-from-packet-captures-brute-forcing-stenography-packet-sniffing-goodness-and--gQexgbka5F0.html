more on this episode of hak5 this week's
episode of pack 5 is brought to you by
netflix go to WWF flexkom / hak5 to get
your free trial membership go to assist
express support smarter with go to
assist expressed and domain com your
next big idea starts at domain com hello
and welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse and this
is your weekly dose of Technology have a
fantastic show in fact we've got like
two shows at least we do you'll get them
on a regular weekly sebassis place week
right what's you know because we're now
all out here you were actually gone for
a while yeah I went to Texas how was
that it was so awesome my brother just
graduated from Air Force Goa 326 bmt i
think it was 17 for flight or something
like that I don't know all sorts of
crazy numbers but go you guys really
support you guys that's cool I'm very
very proud of my brother rusev orses
you've got a brother in the Air Force
yes probably got a sister an Air Force
shirt yeah it's so awesome that she's
moving to Tokyo for the Air Force I'm
jealous my brother put a bunch of East
Coast places and I was like man moved to
Japan so we'll see where yes I don't
know yet hmm it was it was very well
it's good to have you back here we're
trying to kind of figure out a regular
shooting schedule so if you're into
watching the show live I think we're
probably gonna start shooting at in
Wednesday's which means that we've got
to show is back to back to produce and
that's one of the reasons why
unfortunately I know I so tease this guy
for for for this episode but actually
it's going to be on the next one just
because I have to shoot it tonight there
with a bunch of stuff but you're gonna
guys are gonna really love it I think we
got some great stuff involved with it
but we have some really cool things from
RSA to get into in fact this is an
actual segment but one of the neatest
things we
RSA was the NSA had a booth there wow
really yes I go to the NS and I'm like
so as I say what product are you showing
off ya like em and they're uh well that
they were actually showing off an enigma
one of the from like world war two like
the code box and that was just so cool I
got to play with one I almost broke it
yeah but they didn't yeah they didn't
punish me ok so I stay I'm a good side
with the NSA I tell you yeah yeah so
that's what's going on this week as well
as we've got stuff about to crack the
code challenge yeah i'm gonna show you
step-by-step how to do the crack the
code challenge that we did this past
weekend and announce the winners
stenography brute-forcing and a little
bit of packet sniffing goodness with
extracting files for packet capture that
that's a lot of fun stuff yep but I
figured why don't we just go right into
it and get into the headlines because if
you are bummed that you like me did not
get your hands on one of those google
c48 chrome notebooks well check it out
there's an alternative instant on OS
called Splashtop linux it's been
available and it's now available for
download it's been available previously
for like you know pre-installed on
machine from like asus and acer and dell
and some others but there's one point
out release check this out this makes
this trim down linux 2.6 you know it's
x11 based OS available for the public
she can get in on that now it's like
boom instantly on I like I had it on my
last asus i don't have it on my new acer
so maybe I will maybe and
song has made of ROM based on android
2.3 point to which is gingerbread for
the i 9000 series that just leaked to
the net hey all of the changes haven't
been determined quite yet by the users
that have downloaded this but if you
don't have an i 9000 model you still
have to wait for an update to your
Galaxy S devices so I'm kind of looking
forward to seeing what the users help
you can do with the wrong I'm really
excited about it i'm on a galaxy s here
and i'm still on 2.1 it's like come on
yeah and this isn't an i 9003 well no
but it's the same family it's a it's on
sprint so it's an epic 4g but yeah so
Samsung has been you know doing that to
all of us galaxy s users for a while I
hope guess what Sony's doing my own
they're not taking the ps3 hack slightly
as a German hacker graph chuckle oh just
recently found out when authorities
raided his house early in their week
took his equipment of the countess yeah
check it out so he posted on his
hypervisor reverse-engineering blog
quote Sony was today at my home with
police and got all my stuff in accounts
and then hours later on he posted the
hypervisor Bible as soon as he puts it
links have since been removed to comply
with legal notices and stuff but you
know nothing's really deleted from the
net hem ng a hot man sunny yeah you know
what's out there somewhere and check
this out nintendo 3ds it's been out for
a day in japan and it's already been
apparent okay yes well much like the
original des oh yeah i mean takes no
time the tech on group has already
gotten their hands on the three
3ds and they torn it tore it apart to
look at all of the delicious insides
including the 3d display which they kind
of figured out what that one is along
with the hardware is so gay to on
YouTube has already had the 3ds to run
r4 cards and play on authorizing intend
odious games yeah the art horse where
it's at man that is so inexpensive too I
get the our fourth leg under ten bucks
man if you're gonna do some home brew on
the DS you wouldn't know anything about
that though yeah I don't know anything
about them but I like the artwork do you
know anything about getting encapsulated
inside of carbonite no well Han Solo new
and attendees at a tangible embedded an
embodied interactive conference here got
to expand themselves in 3d using a
hacked Microsoft Kinect and then print
out the resulting stl file on a stair
analysis or sterile assists or stair
assist what about Stratus thank you
that's the word anyway a 3d printer it's
not the MakerBot you know we actually
have a MakerBot so we should try that
out with theirs it would there's one
upstairs yeah my roommates got a laser
cutter a MakerBot cnc everything you
name it yeah that's okay I'm kind of
excited so you want to hear about the
crack the code challenge there's so much
fun host did you have what it took to
compete in the crack the code challenge
six of our hak5 viewers did this past
Sunday mad props go out to natural for
being the first to crack the code as
well as jellyfish John Alex Leo and
Tristan a big thanks go out to all that
participated join the live stream and
chat and of course go to assist Express
for sponsoring our hak5 lab network
we'll have details on the next challenge
on next week's show so be sure to tune
in coming up we'll be diving into the
challenge howlett was put together and
how
completed using packet analysis
steganography and brute force but first
let's thank Citrix for go to assist
Express if you're an eye to your
software consultant you're always
looking for ways to be more competitive
you need to grow your business we can't
be in two places at once that's why i

ok major spoiler alert if you haven't
participated in the crack the code
challenge but you really want to because
you know we actually posted on Facebook
and Twitter you do follow us on those
write about how you can play at home a
hack 50 work ccc download the puzzle and
do it at home well FYI we're about to
break it down for you because it's time
t good what that's right yeah we're
gonna go with that crack the code
challenge yes oh okay yeah so over the
weekend we hosted they correct the code
challenge I'm sure you guys made of
heard of it maybe I don't know but um
yeah the challenge involved two main
tools and I'm gonna go over those for
you yeah we basically put together i
love that yeah everybody logged in they
had all his good stuff on their desktop
and it was great is uh everybody's on a
Windows XP service pack 2 machine
completely unpatched and like trannies
for all of this stuff and we had like I
don't know like at least 30 something
people on at any given time and it was
great because Paul was like totally
helped me like get people in like boom
boom boom over streaming live was so
much fun and dude um this one guy we
like echo different machines because we
can like pop in on VNC and see their
session like see what they're doing and
really go hey look at this guy he's
already like he's almost there right hey
look at this guy he's not even trying to
crack the code challenge was he doing oh
he's in metasploit he's owning other
machines and he was literally going into
people's desktop and deleting the
challenge yeah he was deleting the files
off of their desktop so they couldn't
compete and it's like that's one way to
win just on all your neighbors that's
kind of funny that's something that the
challenge I don't know no was that was
actually some kin I wasn't gonna give
him shower now I got one yeah and then
whom Allah showed up later it was great
it's great it's joe eagle sorry I could
do this all day lots of people from iris
article I enjoy it it's fun to play the
community we gotta we gotta show him how
to do it now okay all right I'm sorry
but you can help yes okay good so I'm
gonna go over to the two tools network
minor and stick hide and Darren is going
to go over how they figured out the
password alright so first of all steg
hide that's a steganography program
that's able to hide data and various
kinds of images and audio files and then
you can
and use it to extract those files all
the information that's in them as well
yeah you've done a second idea should
check that out that one in any knifed
fifth season yeah 512 and then mobic did
a segment on 514 about network minor
network minor is a network forensics
analysis tool for windows it can be used
to as a passive network sniffer or
packet capturing tool in order to detect
operating system sessions hopes memes
open ports all sorts of other stuff
without putting any traffic on the
network just attack it's never like
Wireshark but it's easy because it
breaks it down and it can also parse
pcap files for offline analysis and to
regenerate or reassemble transmitted
files and certificate certificates from
those pcap file that's the best is
reassembling the files because you like
you can watch the wireshark and see the
TCP sure I mean it's like oh they went
with these websites but what they
download here's the zip file of what
they count emoted it's yeah it's it's
pretty fun so today I'm going to show
you exactly how to do it step by step so
first of all what we're going to do is
download this zip file and i already
downloaded it where's it at oh it's a
high fived org slash CCC does done zip
don't sue okay so i already unzipped it
and i put it into my little local disk c
drive up here right there alright so
double click on that and you see all
this different kind of stuff in here
there's a packet capture file right here
called i can haz packets readme jpg and
then we have this dike hide network
minor and this one called safe around ok
so this readme file that's the first
thing I see cuz I'm like oj Peggy a
picture so I opened that up slowly on my
little machine here I has a secret code
I hands it on the network oh it's an
adorable cute little picture curry in a
filthy bath tub even like disgusting
yeah it's nine ten years ago I think
that's is that the heck how smelt the
apartment the hack apartment from season
i won she must have been a kitten she
was a little kitten anyway this is not
about cat as though so basically it's
telling us we need to look for something
that has to do with Kirby because she is
hiding so
kind of code on the network so keep
Kirby in mind next thing we're going to
do is open up a network minder miners
use me network minor and here's the exe
SL enter from network minor you can open
the icon has packets top pcap file and
then once that is finished which all
open that right now and i can haz
packets open that up and it's gonna take
a couple of seconds to read it but once
it's done I'll look around and im gonna
see a whole bunch of files different
kinds of images all sorts of other kind
of stuff now keep in mind we're looking
for kirby and this is short for kerberos
kerberos what does that mean well it's
an authentication protocol yes not not
having so much to do with the challenge
but that's just cute trivia about hak5
and the kitchen has been involved in
that the show yeah well other than five
it was almost gonna name the cat five
because then it would be cat five and
then it was like no cuz then they'd
upgrading a duplicate cat 6 or cat 5e it
was really bad ok so it's done and we
know we're looking for kerberos or kirby
or something that has to do with a cat
so looking through here under file tab
I'm gonna look through the file names
because I have a feeling that hahaha
there we go kerberos jpg that's exactly
what I was looking for yeah where are
you going to images you'll just see a
picture over right there yes so you can
open the folder from here and there's a
cute little picture of Kirby kurose dot
jpg oh how adorable so I'm going to copy
this picture into into the stag hide
folder because I know that steg hide can
do that kind of stuff it can find out if
there's any you know hit and data in
there so I'll copy it over here okay so
I have stuck I'd opened up right here so
I want the info on the coast on jpg so
i'm going to type in stike hide info
kerberos dot jpg and enter
her and get information yes of course
enter passphrase okay so this is where
the passphrase what that is well there's
a couple of different ways to go ahead
and get it see the packet capture is
actually following some actually web
browsing session that I did earlier when
i went to the hak5 forums and then i
went to a special website and if you
actually you know if you track down the
tcp stream you can actually see that I
went to hack five org slash CCC 27a okay
now there's actually in the same folder
as it and index HTML and if you look at
the index HTML view the source there's a
comment as says nothing to see here but
if you go to that website hak5 dot org
slash ccc 27a view the source there's
actually a riddle that has to do with my
birthday and if you go to facebook or
use melty go or anything on me you can
find out it just basically asked you
what month i was born in which is
februari so that's that's pretty much
that's the password right there the
other way to do is doing a brute force
attack and I kind of hinted to that in
the packet capture because packet
capture one over to the hak5 org slash
forms honored of episodes and I don't
know what there's been this discussion
thread going on called hak5 dark net ?
and on the 13th page here there's a post
from a guy named cypher round and round
has put together a perl script as that
brute forces stag hide passwords you can
find it over at cypher round blogspot
com and it is his stag crack perl script
and in fact that exact perl script it
was included with the ccc zip right
there alongside network minor and Steg
hide so it was kind of a little hint
yeah yeah so any word list worth you
know its salt is going to have all of
the months of the year I mean it has to
yeah and this is why we don't use words
as passwords but you know for the
challenge come on yeah and to make it
easy one let's see okay so februari okay
so now i want to extract the whatever
info is inside of this pictures ray so
says that there's secret txt inside
their sacred txt all the evil villains
name them like secret evil plans stuck
hi Dexter docx SF what is it again
Kerberos dot jpg yep and I'll hit enter
and passphrase again februari Road
extracted data all right now to show the
contents of the file ass I'll have to
type in type secret dot txt there we go
okay so congratulations you won email
Darren at high five org with the code
and the special code got them in yeah
and don't email me anymore cuz we are
done the winners although we have six
winners and we gotta give a mad chat out
to net Rob being the first and then like
right after him jellyfish was like oh my
got it John Alex Leo and Tristan all won
the challenge yeah so mad props to you
guys hey guys are the leet the lyrics or
complete you guys have some ideas for
new stuff too like i guess i should
mention it right now but moobus was
telling me about some CTF stuff that he
somebody I don't want to give away any
hints right now but is including JPEGs
will you give me hints after we owe ya
cool some backstage backstage hands
right so anyway we want you to send your
feedback over to feedback at hak5 org
and you know this is a perfect
opportunity using these tools these
command line goodness to transition
right over to the hack tip because last
week we were talking about command-line
packet sniffers and tools of that nature
and we just got a great submission so
check this out now I'm like TCP dump and
n grep for filtering but Steve's eroded
was quick to point out that T shark is a
command-line counterpart for Wireshark
which we all know in love and it's got
rule filtering built in it's quickly
become one of my favorites for all of my
packet sniffing needs so for example if
i type in t shark tak are and then
and bang tcp port equals 53 and UDP and
IP address equals I don't end at 7331
not 55 not like that's anything and then
Takei my interface eth0 here I'm going
to go ahead and be able to sniff just
UDP packets that aren't on port 53 DNS
and that are from the address that I've
specified so do you have any gems are
rocking your world hit us up tips a hack
five ugh share them on the show of
course we will be back in just a bit

Barack 5 i'm here in kitchen here at
block master RSA 2011 talking to Moses
how are you Moses accident so uh tell me
these USB drives you've partnered here
with Kingston one of the largest USB
drive manufacturers what new are you
bringing to security on USB well the
cooperation with blockbuster in Kingston
brings secure drive management's to get
the Kingston products those hardware
encrypted drives right but I mean I
could just go and pick a USB Drive off
the shelf and put like truecrypt on it
how is this different well those drives
our Hardware encrypted using AES 256
which prevents you from from bridge for
stacking them I mean they will just you
know lock down when you enter the wrong
password too many times okay so there's
not like a volume that you can copy off
the drive and then try to brute-force
later is it is it could you do like a
bit for bit or is it seriously tied to
the chip and the hardware it is I mean
you it's not possible to take the data
off the device the encrypted data and
then try to to attack it the day days is
locked into the device
I mean so as a user when I plug this
into my computer and I enter my password
to unlock the volume what happens and
what what does that mean to me that say
like as a systems administrator versus a
user well you get access to the data as
a as a user the encryption is performed
by the by the hardware the key is
derived from the user password so it's
not even stored on the device as a as an
administrator job you're secure that the
data on the device is protected I mean
if if user drops the device anywhere in
the world nobody will be able to recover
the data except the original user of
course right now what I think what's
really interesting and unique about this
is the way that it phones home and the
kind of management that an administrator
has access to your telling me about some
of the features like publishing and and
and autoruns so tell me about some of
those as an administrator what can i
what can I do for my users well using
safe console which is the management
console you can remotely reset the
drives you can recover lost passwords
you can even recover lost data and you
get full file audit trail of everything
that's copy to the device so i can see
if somebody's you know copy files to and
from what machines they plug the drive
into i mean these are the machine what
file what time you get the password
attempts yeah so i can see somebody lost
their drive i could see if somebody
nefarious picked it up and tried to
unlock it yeah what could you do could
you wipe the data from there or what
about you I mean other you can reset it
from the from the safe console interface
or you can just wait for whoever found
it to de plug it in and
unless they could get a connection to
the console the device will raise itself
I think it's really interesting you were
talking about being able to push files
to the actual drive how does that work
well that is a feature will call the
publisher it allows you to to send files
from a central repository on to all the
devices in your corporation files such
as priceless for example or even
portable applications right so if I've
got like a sales team and I've got a
powerpoint template for our sales demos
and I want them to be using the new
version you know the updated cover sheet
for the TPS report I could send that
updated TPS report to all of my
employees over the USB drive using
something kind of similar to group
policies really yeah it's connected to
the active directory I mean when you
change the file on the central server
the new files will be pushed on to all
the devices so I mean everything is done
automatically I mean nobody has to find
the new price list you know just to get
updated the values right and not just
the the ability to publish file so
you're saying you can even tell the
system to run a command you can do that
yeah I mean we've all heard about them
feared be the author on from USB devices
right like the USB sweat slide yeah yeah
but using the console you can actually
specify a command centrally the trusted
administrators specifies the command to
run when you unlock the device so you
could so it could be something as simple
as net used this printer on the network
so that they get access to so many
shares yeah and you can even ask the
user beforehand for username and a
password which is sold on the encrypted
partition what kind of crazy stuff have
you seen people administrators doing
with that technology well quite a lot to
people have actually used it to set up
VPN tunnels it's an interesting where
they deploy VPNs yeah i mean you unlock
your device and automatically you get a
VPN tunnel it's really convenient for
the years because they don't have to
find the right application the right
command to use everything just happens
automatically follow now there's a whole
lot of other awesome management features
but let's start to talk about the user
side so if I'm a user and say like I'm
in a meeting and I want to share a file
on my device with some other colleagues
I'm going to have to pull out a
non-secure USB Drive copy the file over
to it and then share that or how am I
gonna do that I don't wanna get my
master password out to everybody at the
meeting no I mean you should never give
away your your secret password to the
advanced that is why we developed easy
shop which is a way to distort files on
the device not on the public drive and
not on the encrypted drive but on a
hidden volume and using software
encryption you can actually saw a small
subset of files using a different
password okay so then you just give that
password out to your club meeting I mean
you make up but an easy to remember
temporary password now if i plug this
into my computer and say I need to get
access to it but I don't have internet
access it can't phone home am i still
going to be able to get up my data yes
you will I mean if I'm away on extended
leave without internet access for say
like a month after a while will it
eventually expire and say no you need to
phone home to the server before we can
get to can do that I mean when you plug
it in and you don't have access to say
console if too many days have passed of
course you configure it and you turn
this feature on right will either
disabled itself or even reset itself
that's a way to automatically in force
but device this time to get lost I mean
if somebody loses the drive they're
probably going to you know not want to
say that to you but you know keeps
silent right okay and this way you get
it research anyway nice now what about
as the user am able to use this on
windows on mac on linux yes it it works
on windows and mac and linux as well the
management system only works on Windows
and Mac bug okay so if i'm a linux user
i can still unlock it get out my data
yes you can how do i do that well it's a
simple come online too you know you
simply plop it in into your password and
you have like a new volume okay but does
the but you said it doesn't work with
the management console so if I deploy it
to linux users they don't get the
ability to push commands and documents
or any of that stuff no it's just an
encrypted drive is that a plan for the
future yes we're planning on releasing
it hopefully this year awesome and where

trusted names in SSL it's easy the
thought ssl 123 is all you need to
encrypt your site it's got the strongest
encryption available and the validation
is so quick to get your certificate
issued almost immediately and it's
affordable use coupon code hak5 it's
less than 40 bucks a year that's the
best price for an ssl 123 on the web
period bottom line if you want to use
ssl and pretty much everyone should try
domain coms ssl 123 and i gotta say
domain that comes from sponsoring hak5
for over a year now
we couldn't be happier we've got our own
hak5 dot orgs on them and it's running
great so I definitely recommend you give
them a try you can get a you know domain
to less than 10 bucks a year and
reliable hosting for less than flat so
support hak5 by supporting domain com
your next big idea starts at domain com
all right I'm on there we go Thank roll
on that just about wraps up this episode
of fact on but before we get going you
know that there's a couple of things
that we need to cover right Jim yes Oh
like a meals Toby rights now that I'm
adhering to the tech trust you're taking
the last way of life I figure you're my
best chance for a quality fix I have an
issue that I would love to see how you
would resolve I work at a non-profit
food producer oh that's cool thanks that
provides millions of servings to food
feeding programs worldwide every year
we're running we're running as much open
source goodness as we possibly can there
yeah yeah sweet so that we can direct as
much revenue to the feeding programs as
possible I have a vm called windows
terminal server running a software
package that requires a USB software key
I need a cheap or free way to hack or
bypass to overcome the lack of ability
to have non storage USB pass-through
right now it's two hours USB
pass-through can be an issue with
virtual machines I know that it is with
proxmox I've successfully done like all
sorts of things like even Wi-Fi USB
dongles and things like that nature with
virtualbox but with proxmox they
actually recommend a product of all
things because they have not figured out
that feature yet the product they
recommend in their wiki is actually a
USB redirector and i gotta say it's kind
of great because it is free in linux
okay now i know that you said that
you've got a windows box it is available
from incentives procom for windows it's
going to run you about 60 some euro no
it's just just what it says I don't see
anything about hear about any licensing
or anything but it's pretty neat because
you can take a physical machine has to
be and plug in an a USB device and then
run their client on any machine it could
be a virtual machine and essentially
that USB port is really directed and
it's pretty good name yeah so I like I
think that's pretty cool check that out
and Nate rights I'm assistant been
working on transferring your sales
people over to new laptop
cool today I convinced one of them to
purchase either a large cap flash drive
or an external hard drive so he brings
in an HP 500 gimp gigabytes simple safe
portable hard drive that does not
require a power cord that's cool too he
was going to start copying data on his
own but finds out the hard drive box had
previously been open so he wants me to
look at it look it over first and make
sure that it's clean and I'm thinking to
myself I have autorun turned off and
this isn't a you three device so I have
no worries about a CD EMU partition like
you three if someone opened that if
someone that opened it put anything
malicious on there much to my surprise
once I plugged it in on my Windows 7
machine it brands something WTF just
happened yeah what just happened turns
out there is an HP virtual CD partition
containing an autumn autorun.inf and a
file called HP launcher.exe which is
about 552 kilobytes really huh you know
we might have we might know a little bit
something here about autoruns and USB
especially if you've been with us since
the second season in fact i was actually
/ RSA we were talking to memorex no not
me I'm sorry Kingston just yeah and I
was actually talking to the guy as we
were walking around the show floor and
he was explaining to us essentially you
three is gone because the licensing fees
and everything was so expensive because
what the developers had to do say like
you were skyping he wanted to get your
app on there you would have to you know
not only licensed the technology but you
had to rewrite your code and then your
code would sit on the shelf for forever
so it would be old by the time people
plugged it in and you had to pay for the
stuff before they even made any drives
it was just you know he said it was a
nightmare and that everybody just
including them dropped it and then as
you guys know you know Microsoft had a
was well it was an advisory back in 09 i
think is let's see 9 6 7 9 40 the
security advisory for autoruns that's
been recently regarding windows XP
because it changed the functionality in
vista and 7 but but they recently added
an update 8 so that autorun.inf is not
going to work on like removable storage
the way it was previously stores and
cdfs partition
hello HP for you know rocking out with
your new 500 gig drive that allows those
mischievious types to use that and go
his sales person for actually checking
up on it oh this box was opened and I
don't think most sales people would well
you know I've got a lot of that men work
for a lot of you know different clients
and stuff and I do not always get the
now want your users Thank You hazardous
until I come to you first like I'm gonna
plug this in but let me check with IT
first check with I tapers wait yeah well
that's a big vector of attack to like a
lot of penetration testers will like
litora you know a parking lot of like a
bank or something with USB drives and
people like look you must be true you
know now but finding a USB Drive in the
ground now like hey penny or something
but a 500 gig hard drive who's gonna
pass that up you know mm-hmm and now for
