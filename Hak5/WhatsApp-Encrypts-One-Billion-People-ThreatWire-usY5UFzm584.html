hey whats app just encrypted a billion
people all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings I'm Pat ignored and this
is threat wire for April 6 2016 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and a big
thanks to everybody that helps keep
threat wire and free by supporting us on
patreon calm / threat wire if you're
wondering if the FBI really managed to
crack the iPhones encryption the
agencies offer this week to assist local
law enforcement with unlocking iphones
is a strong sign that they probably did
in the meantime whatsapp the
facebook-owned messaging service it
serves over a billion people mostly
outside the US has in the words of Wired
quote added end-to-end encryption to
every form of communication on its
service that's a billion people all
their coms encrypted that is amazing
apparently a big part of that was Moxie
Marlinspike of signal private messenger
fame who joined the project back in 2014
now whatsapp began the encryption
process in 2013 and getting its public
key encryption system to scale
successfully was I understand a huge
challenge and for Marlinspike and
national way to bring us work on open
whisper systems to a massive global
audience the question of course is how
long will pass before a
government-issued wiretap order is
issued and if Facebook will pick up the
court battle the same way Apple did in
the previous weeks if whatsapp founders
have anything to say about it it should
be a pretty epic bath while the current
administration has done it's best to
make sure Freedom of Information Act
requests take pretty much the longest
time possible to be fulfilled if ever
there's still a massive amount of
government data that's freely available
to the public now the crew at the MIT
Media Lab has done something pretty
amazing they've delivered what it calls
quote the most comprehensive
visualization of US public data it's a
data usai oh it's free to use it's based
on open source code built in a
partnership with Deloitte and data wheel
and the site lets you dig quickly
ridiculously quickly into huge amounts
of information and generate some pretty
gorgeous graphics what was this for
quote it was built to understand and
visualize the critical issues facing the
United States and areas like job skills
and education across industry and
geography and to use this knowledge to
inform decision-making among executives
policymakers and citizens so are you
curious about your community your indus
or the town you grew up in type it into
the search box and you will get a ton of
information in an incredibly digestible
format what you do with it well that's
up to you you might want to send it
along to someone you trust in power have
you been contemplating just how ugly
election campaigns can get you might
want to read Bloomberg's how to hack an
election not about our current election
up here it's well a story about Andrea
Sepulveda who claimed he was budgeted
six hundred thousand dollars been reek a
pena nieto's successful 2012 campaign to
become the president of mexico that's
the quotes in Bloomberg now he led a
team well let me get the quote he led
quote quote he led a team of hackers its
toll campaign strategies manipulated
social media to create false ways of
enthusiasm and derision and installed
spyware on the opposition offices and
that his teams worked on presidential
elections and Nicaragua Panama Honduras
El Salvador Colombia Mexico Costa Rica
Guatemala and Venezuela Wow Sepulveda
recently pled guilty to multiple charges
in Colombia including illegal
interception and espionage and is
currently serving ten years press
officers or press offices or officers
doesn't really matter which one they all
denied Sepulveda worked for them or on
their campaigns so the question is is
this a hacker hoax a bit of vengeance or
a one man Snowden campaign do yourself a
favor go to Bloomberg read the article
and decide for yourself got a link down
in the show notes thanks to computer
worlds where what might be my favorite
ics-cert advisory in quite some time
quote there are over 1,400 remotely
exploitable flaws and the Pyxis supply
station systems many of those
vulnerabilities ics-cert warned quotes
an attacker with low skill would be able
to exploit no patches will be issued
okay what we're talking about is medical
dispensary machines used in hospitals
and I guess nobody with access to those
machines might ever want to take all the
meds or somebody with nothing better to
do might want to hack down the ability
for nurses or doctors to get to the meds
that said apparently most of the issues
are with third-party tools and computer
world says quote carefusion is
attempting to contact affected customers
and is advising them to upgrade
otherwise ics-cert has the list of
carefusion suggested mitigations for
customers using legacy operating systems
and hey if a hacker locks your system up
remotely
because they had nothing better to do
that day you can apparently still get
out the keys if you know where they are
and manually unlock the medical
dispensing systems and I guess track
things manually hmm upgrades people
they're critical even inside of
hospitals a big thank you from Shannon
Darren and I to everyone who supports
