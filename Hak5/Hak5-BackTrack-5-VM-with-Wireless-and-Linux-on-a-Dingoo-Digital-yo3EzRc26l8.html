hello pack 5 my name is Darren kitchen
i'm shannon moore and this of course
your weekly dose of technology hey where
are we here this is the book the brick
is back the brick is it's real it's not
it's not what it was yeah yeah be
careful there's like there's nails and
stuff in there oh yes good dangerous
it's been almost six years and we did
the evolution from apartment to the hack
house back house flooding to the hack
has to point to the trip across country
to the garage to niraj house our own
studio office / office yay no it's a
long time coming but it feels so legit
and awesome and i'm so excited to be
really cool we are totally going to need
this space because we've got some
excellent things happening with the show
oh you're talking about the hat tip i am
talking about the hack tip so you guys
know that we've been doing this segment
all here on the show all throughout 2009
here we are smack dab in the middle of
season 9 and i'm very happy to announce
that on May twenty-third you guys should
be expecting to get a lot more techno
less delivered to weekly we're actually
going to be doing hack tip as its own
show on revision3 it'll also be on
YouTube and the hak5 website everywhere
else on Mondays and Fridays and it's
going to be really cool a lot more of
these tutorials and step by steps and
single topic focused you know kind of
stuff we've got some really special
stuff planned for the way the format in
the way that you guys are going to
interact with in stuff I think you guys
are going to love it so for the first
week of its its airing we're going to go
ahead and put that in the hak5 feeds you
can get a salary do we hope you guys
Mason arrive we
you guys will head on over to youtube
and rub three and hack 5 Oregon and get
your hat tip on because we love doing
activist so much fun I do and you know
what we have a ton of information in
this episode so let's get it going into
the hack of headlines it's a long one
let's get it going the hacker headlines
Oh skype they have another security
problem go figure skype on mac OS x has
a bit of a flaw you can send a skype
message to another user and potentially
get remote access to that other computer
Gordon maddern is security researcher
filmed the flaw and told skype about it
more than a month ago but there was no
fix until after the new started
spreading that there was an issue skype
has released a small term patch but no
full fix has been released nor have
users been notified of any kind of
update yes skip cuz all like we knew
about that and we had a patch we just
weren't we hadn't released yet it's
gonna be fixed so that's that's their
crazy I don't know skype just days
before Google i/o begins French security
firm view pin or I'm hoping that
pronouncing that right is demonstrating
a zero-day vulnerability in Google
Chrome which allows remote execution now
the exploit which hasn't been released
to the public bypasses Chrome's praise
sandbox as well as the address space
layout randomization or a SLR as well as
DEP or data execution prevention Google
who's busy with their whole Chromebook
than all the other fun stuff coming out
of Io hasn't verified view pans claims
and says that if necessary and up they
will just be pushed automatically to
users hmm fingers crossed yeah fingers
crossed okay so everybody knows about
the death of Osama bin Laden right after
that it spurred several several scams
throughout the entire interwebs malware
has shown up on certain websites a
facebook scam popped up which I saw
several times on my own profile and I
was like delete delete delete no
unfriending the people that are yeah I'm
like seriously people come on dopes
don't fall for that and even the blog of
the guy who accidentally live twittered
the entire thing his page got
compromised so it's happening everywhere
scammers are really smart and they know
what you're looking for so people want
to see the whole Osama does
video and it doesn't exist there's no
video anywhere so for anyone out there
who is considering clicking that video
on Facebook and sharing it with your
friends don't do it and while you're at
it delete it from your profile if
somebody else has posted it just do it
well I'm so sick of that thing I know
speaking of Rama come on or really
speaking of Facebook semantic security
researchers are reporting that there's a
flaw in the way that the application
authentication works on facebook and
nearly a hundred thousand apps may have
complete access to your account that's
your wall your chats every starion now
facebook now uses OAuth 2 point 0 for
authentication however older
authentication schemes schemes are still
in use for backwards compatibility now
the firm advises users to change their
passwords immediately because doing so
essentially forts access through that
token bug uh does that have anything to
do with the fact that when you go to
certain apps they ask you to switch back
to normal HTML no I already know I don't
do any apps don't know I don't do any
out oh yeah weird like sometimes I'll
click on something answer a question or
there's some vampire really take a look
at that after all but yeah I try to stay
with an HTTPS and I don't do it yeah I
never switch back I'm like did I go this
could be fun if and this is a melty go
plug-in wouldn't happen if it doesn't
already exist we were talking about that
and last but not least hot up the heels
of them bunt to is 11 point 0 419 our
wall release which has been getting
mixed reviews due to the new unity
window manager that Trek Linux releases
the much-awaited version 5 i'm sure
everybody it's super excited about that
in addition to native 64-bit and arm
processes support the security
distribution now comes in both KDE and
gnome flavors deliciousness are you
excited have you checked it out it's
available via torrents awesome good use
of torrents obviously and has a stealth
mode it comes with metasploit and sounds
just plain epically cool I'm excited I
know I am yeah and as you know we have a
whole bunch of information about the
crack the code challenge because I want
to kick it over to Kirby back at the
say hack house macros whatever it maybe
we're going to keep back over to her and
find out about Kirby's old school app of
the week do you have what it takes to
compete in our crack the goat challenge
brought to you by go to assist expressed
test your skills in our private lab
network and bid for the title of supreme

alright if you guys remember a couple of
seasons ago Shannon got our hands on a
little embedded device here the the zip
it yeah he had a lot of fun with this
dude say to yeah except you like come on
I'm where and put linux on it so could
play doom it was awesome I hear you're
doing that again I might be what's the
toy now oh come on this is the dingu
digital the what now the dingu digital
thing goes ain't more babies oh gosh
we're hacking and dingo and babies where
I can baby sitting of babies
assassination so this is the 8320 he's a
little gaming handheld device for open
game development like homebrew oh this
thing's got emulators on it yes it does
it has so this is out of the box right
now we don't yeah this is out of the box
so saying like Atari colecovision Game
Boy Advance nes SNES yeah it says with
all of those and it has really really
modest hardware specs it's a 400
megahertz CPU 32 megs of ram for gigs of
internal storage it's got a mini SD
reader on the bottom over there and then
also has the 2.8 inch LCD screen on the
front and it's only 320 x 240 resolution
no HD awesomeness or anything like that
and all of your normal Jack's but the
cool part about it is all a better place
that yeah that it plays pac-man it'll
attack metal exactly took this out of
meeting ghosts I didn't know what
playback seriously like oh look at that
pac-man ok that's awesome holy just died
I had power pellet okay well it also
other than playing video games you can
do things like play videos and audio
tons of file types has a built-in FM
tuner for radio you can record voice and
the SDK is available for free which is
great but my favorite part about it is
it's customization Allah can do like
different themes like a zelda theme if
you wanted to and it has that ability to
play all sorts of roms so I mean who
doesn't like video games that's cool
that it comes with like the homebrew
roms mean obviously you could guess
maybe you know legally acquire wrongs to
put on better but it's nice that it
comes with some good stuff so it comes
pre-installed with tons of stuff like
that pac-man game actually was called
man it was like a total clone probably
wasn't that did whatever it's got crazy
seller handmade minesweeper you know all
those games that like come pre-installed
on everything and it also has all those
emulators just for your convenience as
well but if you want more that you can
do with your new toy why don't you put
linux on it this idea let's do it let's
get into it I'm going to need so DX is
the linux distro that we're going to put
on XD goo yes jinguk's fixing and dingo
dingus Dean gooks so you can get dingo
dingo steamed up blogspot com or dingo
Singh Kham and it on this website they
also have these really really easy steps
to take to just guide you through
everything it's called the complete
idiot's guide to DX for windows and
pretty simple steps so you can check
those out if you want to first time I
was checking out the dingu wiki oh yes
dingu wiki also comes in handy if you
have questions along the way first off
the first thing you will need is to
download a couple of really simple files
the first one is called boo-boos and
dual boot installer zip file O&amp;amp;I so
we're gonna do little bit this guy's
wouldn't keep the original OS yes
perfect I mean that's the whole reason
like you can dual boot so you can still
play all your emulators on this is I
didn't go to any one rinse linux anyway
and we complete doom and run linux it's
good time sorry so we need the dual boot
installer zip file and then we also need
the local dash 10 zip or local zip file
both of those are pretty much all in the
same they're just from a couple of
different users who decided mirror each
other pretty much nice black mirrors
yeah Rama that's nice and simple and you
also need to make sure that you charge
your dingo before you decide to start
reflashing it because you don't want to
get a brief bricked bingu firmware flash
completely last battery life four
minutes I like saying dingu you dingu
thank you okay so once your files are
downloaded unzip the dual boot file into
you a folder of your choice anywhere on
your PC it really doesn't matter and
then you turn on the dingo and you go to
your system setup menu and I'll do that
right now record picture library browser
system
press a go-to about press a again
there's a little easter egg in here so
usually you just get your memory 3.85
gigs you know free 3.3 gigs so you know
a little bit of memory so we have to
like up up down down LOL RBA up right
down up right down okay okay so we get
another another menu that gives us our
LCD module so on the screen it should
say something like LCM fair i li 9 30 31
or 9325 whatever version that you have
at the end of one of the lines mine is
933 right one remember that number it'll
come in handy got it right here this is
the LCD module and each one has
different 1i think the most updated it
was like 9 30 35 but it pertains to the
whole flashing progress or a
manufacturer it keeps changing apart and
depending on that you're going to need a
different version of the rom over yeah
exactly so it's really important that
you use the files that pertain to your
LCD or it could totally screwed up ok so
now I need to reset my dingu this gets
tricky it's according to the steps it
says holtby while pressing the reset
button now what I'm bleeding is whole be
well hitting the power button here it
says hold B and press the reset button
well I'm reading mine well in backtrack
5 so obviously it's more correct ok well
you are correct turns out if you hold me
and press the reset button which is on
the side a little reset hole that you
can you know stick a little paper clip
into it doesn't work so well so you
actually have to hold let's see I think
you'd hit be first old um be hold down a
bead hold down reset hold down reset
oops hold you on reset or hold down the
power button sorry power back hey deke
pulling them be ok let go the power
button keep holding gonna be okay okay
you can let go the power button now all
right ok and then you know that you're
in so you're now in what's called rock
box mode this is where you can actually
update yeah this is where you can get
it's kind of like when you put a
pineapple into a red boot mode or many
different devices I like this who's
managers all right now we can tell some
instructions on the ceiling yes alright
so now I have to plug it into my
computer with the nifty little USB cord
that comes with it because it comes with
like every single cord you'd ever need
for the thing which is great alright so
i plug that in and I choose cancel if
any kind of found new hardware screens
pop up and when my pc asked for a driver
location i choose my newly created dual
boot folder and the driver should
successfully install and then i'm ready
to flash my Dean you we've already done
that we're here on windows XP 32 bits a
little kind worth mentioning if you're
on XP 60 or on this sorry wow that is
seven you're on windows 7 64 bit your
computer is prolly not going to like it
because it's not a digitally signed
certified router from Microsoft which I
didn't know was a problem until there's
there's a hack to get around that it's
not worth doing or talking about right
now basically if you've got an XP
machine this is the way to do it yeah
just use XP because it works a lot
better hello who is the vanilla
computers it seems so I did this nifty
little thing called Windows f12 to go
into my device on this one it's windows
key pause and then pause is on f12 TF
yeah anyway and then I went into
hardware device manager and updated the
drivers by right clicking on the USB I
think it was called like jay-z 4740 or
something like that that's what the ding
you was sure as far as I think I next
easy I guess it looks cheesy but anyway
after it was done it said that it was
ready to go and successful so I was like
yay now I unplug my dingu and I press
the reset button again okay i think the
power button yeah maybe so we've already
done that part so so we've got the
drivers installed we don't even need to
do that we can just leave it here that
is because i was just to get my drivers
installed the first time we're good to
go on the drivers okay so let's get into
the fun command prompt happiness okay so
now I hold the B button down and press
reset again to and then i plug my ding
go back into my pc which i already have
that understands the drivers and we're
ready to go so now I need to find my
doll boat folder desktop directory let's
see and it's my dingu dual boot right
there so
they knew little boot okay so there's a
whole bunch of different files in here
the one that I'm pertaining to is the
USB tool schwinn exe there's also when a
USB told dash linux and USB told ash OS
x and they all do exactly what you would
imagine they do yes okay so i'm going to
scroll up a little bit so i can see this
the easiest way to do this is just by
copying it from the website it's USB
tool dash win space one space h win it
tab that's autocomplete i like doing the
tab to autocomplete just make sure here
specifying the right file nothing wrong
with putting the wrong bin on your
letter huh zero it's 700 000 enter okay
so it says it found the device it's
starting for it sending data okay so
this is the stage one of the flashing
sequence and then the second part is USB
told 1c oops z Z image image daughter
installers for boot underscore installer
underscore i L I nine and mine was 93 31
not the older version sure and then I
put in 0 X this is a hex code mm-hmm
memory address so it is six and then
five zeros and a press Enter ok so it's
sending data done verifying and booting
device right installation that looks
just like anaconda anaconda yeah I'll
explain later so we go ahead and install
it okay so it says it tells me the
keyboard on here start is enter selected
escape left shoulders tab ok so I hit
start to continue alright acceptance of
turns mm-hmm start to continue do you
agree to the terms and conditions that
you have read yes I do spiffy which SPL
do you want to
dual boot or original firmware dual boot
full boot okay about to write dual boot
SPL team nand flash do you want to
continue yes yes success device will now
reboot all right okay now i should see
denix okay there was the dean its thing
and then it restarts into the original
firmware awesome okay it's working so
far now since i reset it and ok now we
got it in USB mode i need to reset my
dingu again and plug it into the pc and
the pc should be able to find it in a
couple of seconds so all right so a pc
sees it what do we need to do now ok
next I need to plug my mini SD card and
format it into fat 32 which I already
did that part i unzipped everything from
the second file that i downloaded the
local dash ten thought zip into the root
of my mini SD card and that is right
here so there's not a whole lot of fun
find some folders on the SD card great
so after its unzipped i go to the mini
SD card and i rename my LCD screen file
to z image so mine was 9 30 31 so i
choose that one all right and I just
rename it to Z image and I just erase
all that extra stuff yeah shortcut for
that one's f2 again no birthdays just
records just short cut cut you're so
weird ok and so I went ahead and changed
the name and if I wanted to I could
delete the other else p image if i
wanted to it doesn't really matter sure
and then you're done so you can unplug
and reset the dingu while holding down
the Select key and it should boot into D
new and launch the Dean menu oh so
that's how we do baby boo it up while
holding down select it goes into linux
and we don't hold down selector goes
into the original i guess all right okay
well let's put this for the SD card in
him exciting ok so we're actually using
a microSD card into a mini SD card
adapter and let's see I think it's this
one that doesn't it yeah and the SD card
adapter how much do these costs for like
a little too gay mini SD
Justin thing yeah the shipping is going
to cost more than it's like two gigs
okay so i got that plugged in i should
be able to unplug this holding down
select hit the reset button all right
look wrap it in it ding x ah nice okay
DX is loading up I'm gonna keep keep the
Select better we should know okay there
we go hey so I have games emulators
media sound system okay I think it's
working so we're not any original dingu
OS now we are now in ping ducks yes and
there's a whole bunch of awesome
software that we can put on here i'm
looking through the web so it already
has like off it says doom duke3d
heretics hexen it looks like it already
has all these images on there for it but
none of the games are actually installed
quite yeah it looks like we have to
download them there's a whole bunch of
links over at dingu wiki com or the
actual different games but it looks like
it's you know set up to run them yes so
you can go online and find all your
handy bombs oh yeah oh I'm excited we
should do this next week yes we
definitely should because I think we've
gone long on this one for sure oh but
that was really excited but we learned a
lot I learned a ton about how to how to
hack this little device that was that
was tough but I figured it out okay so
there is a ton of stuff you can do with
this little gaming device the growing
online community has tons of home bro
video games to try out there's theme
packs there's wrong everything that you
could want I've leaked a bunch of the
websites and our show notes I'm thinking
next week I'm going to try to stick doom
on here hopefully because why not yes
it's doing it's the perfect time of year
for doom how do you guys feel about that
so it's always the perfect time of year
Jim hey you want to get a bullet
obviously Shannon you want to solicit
some feedback right because feedback at
hak5 org that's where you should be
letting us know what you guys think
about this stuff is it seen yet what you
want to see in the future you've got
some tips on my D is of what stuff that
we should cover some other toys that
Shannon should
flush it from where of and what not you
want to hear about some some good hacks
I'm here in backtrack 5 you want to find
out about the latest yeah I'm now for
the hack tip oh right it should be no
surprise to any of you guys that I'm a
huge fan of backtrack I love all the
Linux distros and make easy to get at
the tools that you love for all of your
pen testing needs and we are so happy to
be playing with the new version of
backtrack you grab yourself a copy over
backtrack linux org and version 5 brings
with it so many great features besides
the fact that it's 32-bit and 64-bit
native you now get the choice of KDE
desktop which is traditionally ads as
well as gnome which is kind of my
personal favorite but not to say that
there's nothing wrong with KDE but now
you get a choice also it works on arm
yeah ARM processors right so if say you
had a smartphone or a tablet or
something like that that supported such
processor architecture you can
potentially install that on there and
that's probably something we're going to
get into later but what I wanted to do
right now is give you guys kind of a
quick idea of if you're new to backtrack
and you want to start dabbling with it
how you can quickly and easily get
started now head over to backtrack linux
org go to the download page and you can
find yourself you know where you can
select if you want to know if you want
32 bit and you get the option here for
both vmware image or I so you know
personally I'm a huge fan of virtualbox
nothing wrong with VMware but I like the
idea that sounds virtual box is open
source and you can just you know I'd I
get a warm fuzzy with it and it's my
personal favorite virtualization
infrastructure or whatever so I go with
the I so now I already have that
downloaded here and while you could you
know burn yourself a USB key or say you
know an SD card any kind of flash
removable media to boot off of and use
it with your bare metal sometimes you'd
like to you know run it in a virtual
machine to dabble with get familiar with
or if you just have multiple programs
you need to be running a lot of times
like to do backtrack in a virtual
machine because my Windows host will say
have
access through Wi-Fi or 3G or something
like that and then all of my other OS is
on top of it just you know get the
internet access through them and then I
can use something like say a USB
ethernet controller to connect to a
pineapple or something like that and do
my nefarious bidding now if that's your
flavor all you have to do is fire up
this awesome tool called unetbootin and
you just provide it the disk image and
just tell it where you downloaded your
ISO and choose your backtrack 5 I chose
gnome 32 bit and then you select your
drive hit ok and a few minutes later
you'll have it now what I'd like to do
here instead of doing in a USB mode is
actually to create a virtual machine
I've already got one running here but
let's create a new one let's walk you
through the process so I'm in I'm sorry
i said it's on Oracle's virtual box here
and I'm going to go ahead and create a
new vm and I'm going to call it be a
backtrack 5 i'm going to choose
different icon here because that that
totally matters and we're going to say
it's other linux next I'm going to give
it I'm going to give it a gig of ram if
you've familiar if you've been familiar
with backtrack 4 back your cloud
requires a little bit more resources so
we'll choose that and then right out of
the box virtualbox will go ahead and
create the hard disk you need I'm going
to go with the eight Meg's or eight gigs
that it recommends and that can
dynamically expand as we need and so
there we go we have that running now
let's pop into settings okay because out
of the box it's not going to be
configured the weather i personally like
for networking which is instead of doing
that coming here under the networking
tab and choose bridged i like to do that
with say my wireless adapter that's what
I'm providing internet access over the
other big change that I like to make is
USB you can see on the USB tab here that
you can click this icon to add USB
devices I've got a bunch of different
USB devices one of them plugged in here
is an alpha this is the alpha aw us 0 36
h it is a realtek chipset 8187 I believe
that's great for packet
action and stuff like that so if you
were say to be running this in a virtual
environment here like I am you could
using virtual boxes USB passthrough so
that the Windows operating system
wouldn't really see this anymore and
would go straight into your vm now I
already have those checked on my other
running machine so I'm not going to
enable those just yet switch it in a
minute but oh I hit cancel let's just
make that networking setting real quick
all right bridged adapter to my wireless
great and we'll start it up and the
first time you start it up if you don't
have a cd-rom specified it'll actually
give you a little wizard here where you
get to choose now I've already selected
my bt5 image otherwise you would click
this icon here and point it at your bt5
image and in just a moment you get this
splash screen here where you can go
ahead and boot into the live environment
and I got to say it's pretty quickly now
the first time you open it up you're
going to be greeted with a menu like
this and you're just going to go ahead
and you're already logged in the
password for root is tour one of the
first things you're going to want to do
is type passwd space root and change
that and then type start X to bring up
the x window manager
and then from here you'll choose install
backtrack now you can just go ahead and
start using it in its default state as
it is right now however if you're going
to want to make changes if you want it
to be persistent that is you'll want to
install it to that virtual hard disk
that we created that eight gig volume
there and then from there the changes
that you make will stay every time you
reboot so really this part right here is
just next next finish I think the most
difficult thing right here is choosing
your time zone so when you finish the
install and reboot you're going to end
up with something like this i'm going to
close this one down and force that power
off not going to hurt anything cuz it
live and pull up the one that i have
already running so first thing you're
going to notice is that it's really
quick it's also very well organized just
like previous versions of backtrack
things are you know categorized whether
it's information gathering they got
great network analysis here and you can
choose lots of different services and
things that you're looking for
vulnerability assessment you know
privilege escalation it really just goes
through all of the different categories
of what you would need to do when you're
auditing a networker you know computer
something like that so what I what I was
showing you hear about the USB this is
really the magic that I like with
running this in a in something like
virtual box with an alpha and like a
trendnet USB Ethernet adapter is that if
I right click over here I can see that
these two devices are checked so they're
passing right through to my vm and as
I've done here when I do if config you
can see f0 e ph 0 that's the ethernet
interface that is bridged with actually
my wireless interface here my eth one is
my trendnet USB Ethernet adapter plug
directly into my pineapple low is local
and then w land 0 is my alpha and i love
this because it works right out of the
box if i were to say do airmon-ng start
wlan0 and then over here pull up
I don't know say arrow dump tak ng space
monsey row there we go right out of the
box everything is working it's you know
I couldn't be happier I've only been
playing with it for a day because we're
recording this the day after backtrack 5
came out but already I'm very
enthusiastic about it i'm looking
forward to hearing what you guys think
about it and i hope that this has given
you a little bit of insight on how you
can quickly and easily get up and
running in a virtual is a virtualized
environment like virtual box from oracle
