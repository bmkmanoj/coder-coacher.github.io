backing up to the cloud Jason Applebaum
joins us to simplify amazon s3 and
cracking the code now look scanning
packet sniffing and reversing md5 hashes
plus promiscuous mode Wi-Fi cards magic
lantern firmware for the canon t2i and a
lot more all that this time on act 5
this episode of pack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com your next big idea starts
at domain.com the Thunderbolt by HTC
from verizon the only phone that can
harness the power of 4G LTE and go to
assist express support smarter with
gotoassist Express hello welcome to hack
5 my name is Darren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse this is of course your
weekly dose of technol us great show for
you guys this week as always what I
tried this stuff oh you tried the
Vegemite yes yeah I am a very bitter
okay multi um I didn't like it oh I try
to though i tell it like it is really is
it really that i like the koala cual is
nice yeah just take a little very bitter
isn't it yeah what do you think feel
like I ate some ocean yeah yes ocean I
don't know no no we did try the Vegemite
thank you for the Vegemite I'm gonna
keep the Koala who ray um did we haven't
talked about this we need to talk about
it again because im sue sue sue so so
excited about the party we are having
here in the east bay it's going to be on
April second april' second at the hotsy
totsy club here in Albany so come out to
san francisco bay area you're gonna have
to lure and we're gonna have deal cheese
they're going to be doing some crazy new
york or rapid do they do they do a song
together that i absolutely love called a
wordpress it's about my favorite CMS and
to my favorite nerdcore rappers you can
I hope that ace does coda girl yes
that's a good one too although that's
actually dual core song so Dale chased
encoder role that would be like mash
horrific wait yeah girls oh wait no see
now I just got those stuff you're right
now a tail chase does do coder girl it's
my girlfriend's a hacker that there's
lots of girlfriends and coding and
hacking going on good stuff so I think
we should probably aah you want some
water yeah we should probably just get
right with Shannon started off for the
Packers headlines in a report by the
University of California San Diego in
the University of Washington scientists
have discovered ways to remotely take
over your car yes yours this hasn't
happened out in the wild just yet but
they bought a car and they put it
through a whole bunch of packs cars
nowadays come with cellular connections
and Bluetooth technology so a hacker
could potentially remotely take over the
locks breaks track the vehicles location
even steal data etc etc right sounds
like fun Siri check out full disk
encryption is coming to the internal
memory and the secure digital cards of
Android devices thanks to whisper core
an app from whisper systems Moxie
Marlinspike or Marlinspike co-founder
and CTO of whisper systems demonstrated
the beta of this 256-bit aes encryption
system on a nexus s phone recently now
with super core is expected to roll out
on other Android devices as well as
being free for personal use probably
going to be some pricing for corporate
use to follow and you may remember
Marlin spike from such tools as SSL
strip Google sharing and other cloud
cracking services like WP a cracker it's
good stuff man like I'm so genius
brilliant brilliant guy some jail
breaking news snow trees 2.3 just came
out for all of your Apple jailbreaking
needs or at least some of them this
whole will let you jailbreak your iPhone
iPad or iPod using iOS 4.3 on Windows
but it requires tethering e redmond pie
the creators of jail of the jailbreak
say that you can use the ownage tool if
you don't feel like using Windows
no but having come out with the
untethered version I look like you need
windows to hack your iOS that's great
that's okay check this out twitter has
finally jumped on the ssl bandwagon
following the footsteps of Facebook and
after of course omgs my packets can be
awesomeness that was firesheep you guys
remember that from October and now you
can use HTTPS to log into the social
networking service in fact they've even
gone as far as to allow you to enable
always use SSL so you don't even have to
type the essence in HTTP every time so
good on your Twitter for making ssl an
opt-in feature very and related news ssl
strip still works hmm i have some good
ideas for hat tips now make your friends
believe you really are an x-men or at
least close to one yes the guys at the
London maker fair 2011 hacker space and
bride arcs use the Kinect to make Tesla
coils react to your every move and where
did they get the idea the local pub of
course and they called it the evil
genius simulator that's a win for me and
we have a video of it the evil genius
single around the neck
nice all right now coming up in a bit
we've got amazon ec2 programming we've
got the crack the code challenge how
it's completed as well as an awesome
hacked if i'm looking forward to but i
figured why don't you i haven't actually
check in with jason first an awesome for
our first ever season nine road test
when it comes to extending the life of
your digital camera nothing does more
than installing a custom rom the magic
lantern firmware for the 5d mark two and
the t2i right here has done just that
for me even though it's still in beta
after four months it's really proven
itself to be strong to toolset however
it's not for everyone there are some
downsides sometimes the camera locks up
when you're switching modes and requires
the battery to be pulled and the men you
expect and can cause artifacts to remain
on the screen and you have to restart
the camera in order you'll away however
it does purring a lot of tools to the
table that are incredibly useful it
makes up for it with an audiometer
custom safe zones which you can do edit
in photoshop your image editor and throw
them onto the overlay you can edit the
mic level inputs and you can also record
the mic input to one channel while
recording the onboard mic to the other
so you can have both audio tracks which
is really cool I do on all however
recommend this but I like I said it's
not for me everyone if you're afraid
your camera is going to freeze up and
you know never be able to get it back
you know this may not be for you but
with good news it did just come out of
beta on the 13th of March so haven't had
a chance to play with it but I can't
wait the Thunder ball is the only device
powerful enough to harness the power of
Verizon 4G LTE the Thunderbolt is mobile
hotspot enabled which means it provides
a wireless hub for up to eight Wi-Fi
enabled devices at one time so multiple
users can take advantage of an instant
hot spot along with having these the
Thunderbolt can give you lightning fast
NFL and NHL stats and games fast
streaming movies and TV shows it has a
scorching fast 1 gigahertz processor
an immense 4.3 inch screen and a
kickstand for hands-free entertainment
this sunday i had the pleasure of
hosting the crack the code challenge and
really snubz no no more candy for
you after the segment if you're good
alright a lot of people participated in
fact an overwhelming amount of people
participated in the crack the code
challenge this time and we were really
only expecting Lexi but anyway we had
like three times more people than we
were expecting show up so Paul and I
were having just a hell of a time
getting everybody on but we're upgrading
all the vm forgetting more machines and
we're even getting the thunderkittens
assault force involved so it's going to
go a lot smoother next I'm very excited
about that yeah but there was out of all
of the people only about twenty percent
of them actually completed the challenge
so there's a lot of people are like how
do you win it yeah yeah so figure why
don't we just go ahead and dive right in
figure out how to crack the code if you
will show me how to do it alright so it
were just going to be using a lot of
packet sniffing and breaking hashes and
some older protocols like FTP and telnet
and things that are plain text so we'll
be using tools like FTP telnet and
netcat yeah well speaking of kitties
that's actually one of the files in the
zip you can download the zip over at
hak5 org slash CCC 13 da zip and play
along at home but basically you get all
of these fun tools you get IP scan and
kirby's treasure an md5 netcat blank
read me yep and then Windham and peak at
ok so the readme is just a picture to
kerbey to kirby's i have lost tikki too
much as a chest one last I saw it was
bad oh ok 10 7 a-3 3140 forgets where
though of course Kirby will help him
that sofa so pretty straight is actually
at a truecrypt pile we open that over
like oh hey let's let's go ahead and do
some of this action but it's all like oh
it's the password it's februari no it's
not figure right now so what we need to
do is use those clues to figure out now
the first thing we're gonna do in a
situation where yeah we've got an IP so
let's port scan it ok rather than
scanning the entire network since we
already know we've got that one host we
want to know all of the services that
are on it maybe we can explode it maybe
there's some clues so let's find out now
since we're using Windows machines at
the
moment pour the crack the code challenge
get someone except later but for the
moment we could use and map however I
figured hey let's make it fun use a GUI
tool there doesn't love a GUI tool so
angry ip scanner is actually one of the
better you know network scanners that
have found two windows with GUI and
we're just going to take a look at 1073
oops not 10 to 5 530 1 dot 14 and we're
going to come down here to kind of
hidden to hit down here and check scan
ports and we're going to give it a port
range of I'm gonna say to through 2000
or I guess you know if you were I'm just
not right yeah yeah actually I mean if
you're new to this house maybe you do
port 13 65536 or 65535 whatever it is
all of the ports but that's going to
take a while in fact I've gone ahead and
actually prepped that turkey so I can
minimize this and pull up the other one
where I've gone ahead and done this time
the scans are done and you can see that
yes the the host is up its green that
gets a ping yeah the name of it is
leading me cleat and it does have some
open ports here we see that sweet 2124
122 123 135 139 1 443 those 3 135 139
443 that's windows box RPC and port
number 1337 1337 of course so I'm just
going to go through these ports in order
I've got to my I'm going to pull that
down here and I've got my command prompt
to open and I'm in the zip and you see
that we have quite a few tools one of
which being well obviously enough in
Windows we have ftp so we know that port
21 is ftp so i'm going to have to be
over to it 1073 3114 what we get is it
says the princess is in another castle
Oh yep so we're getting close now we
actually have some numbers here those
are actually hex codes I believe they
either hex or just more anyway so you
can plug it in using a lot of people
well we're like trying to brute force
the login associated with these services
there's actually no logins associated so
you can't root force them yeah well but
so that's that's kind of a red herring
but at least we know you know if you
were actually to reverse those back to
ascii you would get another clue it's
we're going to find the same clue here
in a moment the next one is port 24 so
in that case what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna issue netcat 1073 31 14 and 24 and
says listen to isn't elite okay okay all
right well I'm just going to keep going
through these sequentially 3371 22 port
22 is typically SSH so 122 we would
assume would be SSH so I can I could
open up potty or all right going to
putty over 210 7331 14 on port 122 and
yes and this is where a lot of people
get stuck as well there's no tips here
it's just the long answer like all right
well I'm just going to keep moving on
because I know that you know these
practical challenges are built to be
completed in just a few minutes okay and
everything that you need is provided in
the zip I just use putty because it's
easier than using plink sometimes I
don't know anyway so the next one 123
now port 23 is telnet so for that will
use plink with tack telnet
on port 1 2 3 and it says and then whose
kitty is unamused keep scanning tiger
and then tinyurl tinyurl now that
tinyurl we're gonna get to in just a
minute but it bounces to hack 5 and
somewhere else and you know it brings
you to a website that will become
relevant here in just a moment so our
next for one we're not really concerned
with 135 139 or 445 those are typical
windows are PC ports not really that
interesting but 1337 it's also listen to
leet so let's check it out so in that
case NC again for 1073 3114 on port 1337
whoa listening please be very patient
the quieter you become the more you can
hear yes this is how are you listening
so with that said we can use netcat to
do two things we can use it to connect
to something else we can also use it to
listen on a TCP port for just any
traffic so we're going to go ahead and
change the scheme of your windows box
we're going to go ahead and listen on
port 1337 so NC and then it's basically
tak capital l tak lowercase P 1337 now
if we do that and we're patient I'll be
patient Kirby meows oh oh okay so that
right there is your next clue it's
actually an md5 hash okay now all of
those that other hex code and that
tinyurl those were both trying to take
you to this page right here the md5
diaries ground web com there's a lot of
different places online where you can
reverse because these aren't salted so
you basically can just reverse the md5
sum and if you uh if you reverse that it
reverses to march ah ok so much I told
you what's the pathway no I know it's a
horse
password but you know it's it's easy to
reverse and it's quick them like i said
you know these challenges are so that
you can just come off when your skills
play with some packets you know other
people we're playing with the other
things in here we have like wind dump
which is kind of like TCP dump but for
windows and that and you could get it
similar ways because basically the whole
time that you're looking for this clue
it's being told to you by this server
that's broadcasting you on your port
1337 so the quieter you become more you
can hear and we can go ahead and now put
March and hey look there it is we got a
volume oh yay and you got the code we
got the code nice don't don't email me
we all the winners have already won but
uh yeah and it's all really neat anyway
cool Thank You Deron that is the cracked
a code challenge for this week of course
I really look forward to hearing you
guys feedback on these challenges we're
going to be having a lot more of them
and I've got some really devious
thoughts for some future ones involving
some linux stuff a little backtrack
action it'll be fun sweet all right so
we'll be back in just a bit we're going
to be talking to Jason about Amazon ec2
instances and some cool cloud stuff but
first Qin tell me a trivia
last week's trivia question was this
composer of Blade Runner was an
inspiration to the recently released OST
by Daft Punk of tron legacy the answer
was vangelis or vangelis not sure how to
say that this week's question is and I'm
an x-files geek in season 5 of X Files
esther name is the creator of what
gnarly Entertainment Software answer the
question over at had 50 works most
trivia for your chance to win some sweet
pack 5 swag and now a word from our
sponsor if you're assisted min or a
webmaster you know you need to secure
your website ssl it's critical I Twitter
just implemented it and it's used to see
hear anything from online transactions
email corporate Internet's social
networking and if you're looking for an
SSL or a certificate or even just
looking to move your providers you
should totally check out domain com
they've got the thought ssl 123 product
which is pretty fantastic because it
builds trust thoughts been around for a
long time as one of the most trusted
names in SSL and it's also all you need
to encrypt your site it's got the you
know highest level of security that you
could ever imagine and it's validating
you you know they can get validation
like so quickly here so we got ours and
Jessica flowers it's awesome really
affordable if you use the coupon code
hak5 you can get an ssl cert for under
40 bucks a year seriously best price on
the web for the thought ssl 123 product
and you got no excuse now not to have us
to sell on your site and bottom line if
you need to use us which we all need to
go ahead and check out domain coms
thought ssl 123 and thank you very much
to domain com for hosting hak5 for over
a year now on their awesome virtual
private servers we definitely recommend
you go over to domain com get yourself
domains like 10 bucks a year or hosting
for like five bucks a month it's good
stuff support hacks 5 by supporting
domain com get fifty percent off at
checkout with coupon code hak5 your next
big idea starts at domain.com
it's the cloud it's cloudy there are
computers in the cloud now what does it
all mean here to explain it to us of
course Jason what's up dude how you
doing pretty good well when you say
cloud cloudy I assume you're talking
about cloud computing your cloud storage
so or daydreaming or fluffy ones anyway
so ya know you're a big fan of this
amazon stuff and i even playing with ec2
instances why yes three stuff what's the
storage what's the difference I don't
well s3 is storage ec2 is a server so
you need a server go ec2 if you need
storage go as three because you can't
run PHP off s3 that was a lot of
acronyms but there you go now that
sounds good and I guess the idea is it's
amazon their trusted it's your boss
they've cut its it's the you everyone's
using s3 so Dropbox uses s3 a budget
that's my George so expensive yeah have
you tried like mosey and actually know
anymore those he uses s3 and moseys dead
to me but they backblaze and carbonized
so yeah carbon I don't even know if car
but anyway the point is it's cheap
storage matter of fact it's so cheap
it's free why is it for us listen is
there more they're bored tell me more
now okay so so Amazon is in competition
with Azure which is as or is Microsoft's
answer to s3 nice way so the reason
amazon started a free tier is to you
know get more people in the court okay
camp because so what do we get for
freezies you get on s3 you get five gigs
a month for freezies plus twenty
thousand requests so what is the request
a download or an upload oh okay so if i
do a gigabyte upload is that 1,000
requests are now you have nineteen
nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety
nine mile s alright if you do twenty
thousand requests a month you are
obviously not just using it for backup
right okay well that's great though that
they offer us basically five gigs by
cake well we can just hear that so it's
going to turn off into the first year
you need a credit card so they're gonna
ask you for a credit card so it's it's
one of those nights one of those things
because if you go over they will charge
you and there's no warning it's just
like now you're on over alright cool
well hey you know five gigs for a lot of
sites like I'm thinking this is perfect
for you know I got my website around the
thing I need the flat files i need the
databases i need all
stuff just in case disaster hits the fan
we need to you know just its fact
because you can download it just as fast
as you can upload is brilliant okay well
in that case let's get started what are
we doing today so it's pretty simple all
we're going to do is we're going to set
up a script to automatically sync our
server with the cloud so in case you
ever have to get it get your data back
in a hurry you can have it back really
quick all right I love this idea what uh
so we've got a linux server here what
kind of dependencies that we're looking
at so first thing we need to do pretty
simple is install ruby so it's sudo
apt-get install ruby hooray for debian
and apt-get or you know young or
whatever your favorite district manager
thingy nothing things okay once that's
done it's pretty straightforward after
that check there will be install so it's
Ruby tak v44 version Oh version not
morose is version we are running Ruby a
version 1.8 point whatever nice so then
once that's done we need to get the s3
Ruby sync files so this is some scripts
it's the Ruby script that somebody wrote
to sink a particular directory or
multiple directories it's a whole huge
tool set for managing buckets and all
sorts of goods so it's not just like FTP
that's like our sink or something okay
so they got their own version of its all
the ed amazon has their own api's to
push bits to them so it's the s3 version
of our sake there you go all right cool
well in that case let's go ahead and
grab that script I'm assuming we can
just download they do get down but you
can W get it from an address uh-huh that
happens to be on s 30 s right it's
stored on x3 so you can get this rs3
sink from s3 it's pretty awesome next
time um alright cool so let's go ahead
and grab that so all you do w get and
then the URL and that will go ahead and
get it and then ontar it so it's tar X Y
Z Delta 49 or whatever it is XV of F X v
ZF there it is unzip on the extractor
want to have whatever order you want
yep mr. synced our and then you just go
and run run that then that will give you
your s3 sync folder make sure you put
this somewhere where it'll be useful
because you need to run the Ruby script
and reference your target directory so
kind of keeping your home directories
where I like so you don't want to be
backing it you don't want to do any
backing up the script and saying hey you
don't your target directory / www you
don't want to put your script and sliced
up yeah also don't like backup your /
because you'll be setting your entire
hard drive yeah yeah been there yet been
an Etsy and lib and bar recently I've
been seeking for three hours Oh like
well let's get into it right so that
once that's done all you're going to do
is you're going to CD into what just on
tarde list all the directories now what
you need to do is rename so MV MV thank
you RM not or have one ah config why am
l dot example mm-hmm just drop the dot
example right so then what you're gonna
do is that they provide you with an
example schedule because that's not so
much an example strip that's the config
for us for your sake ok cool so you've
got that renamed yep and then what you
need to do is s3 config why really am a
no everything else is far not as
superior ok all right anyway as you can
see I've already populated the access
key and secure key which I got from my
account manager under the s3 so you sign
up for amazon s3 account yep and then
that's going to be your account settings
page where you've got all your create
your account is your cruise security
credentials so you've your access key
and then you've your security key click
show it's right there don't give these
out to your friends and family this is
like your safe word or put them on a
podcast or put them on a podcast so this
this right here yeah totally don't give
that out to the world okay great we'll
keep that money anyway if you do you can
always even activate the key but anyway
so once that's done we need to come in
to the s3 control manager or the Cheney
8 amazon web services management console
AWS janiers wrote it yes and then once
you're in the Amazon
engine console you're under s3 tab not
elastic Beanstalk not easy to not VPC
day yeah there's a whole bunch of them
there but we're looking for s3 we're
gonna create a bucket the bucket is hot
has a bucket yes you has a buck is of
the bucket have you seen my blue bucket
anyway yeah Paul knows what I'm talking
about I I don't think I do so anyway
they're named the bucket whatever you
want to name it if you name it something
ridiculous you're gonna have to type
that something ridiculous in a lot so I
wouldn't do that ok and then region
whatever region in the country you're in
there's different pricing for all the
regions US standard is pretty much the
easy one I think North Carolina may be
cheaper don't quote me on that or you
can put all your data in Singapore Tokyo
or Ireland oh nice yes and now all you
do is help create that bucket is created
is also case sensitive also don't make
it something ridiculously easy because
if you accidentally make your public
files public it's s3.amazonaws.com yes
or temporal you got it's got to be
available because all of amazon but my
point is if you name it so you're saying
some other idiot already took town yeah
somebody bunch of artists antenna and
hey what's the bucs great hacking
segment waiting to happen anyway go
ahead yeah well brute forcer script i
write that in python like 10 lines and
this week you pack final brought my come
on come on alright once you've got your
your config done just go ahead and quit
that and now let's create the place
where you're going to stick the files so
that they can be synced because you what
you want to do is you want to tar mall
up put them in one place and then once
they're in one place you can move that
one place to the cloud ok as opposed to
having to fish everything and do
multiple pushing how do we do that yes
all you're going to do is make dir s3
back up
and once it made it's right there it's
going to be not in your same folder as
s3 sink now what we need to do is create
the s3 backup script okay so dot s hs3
back up to sh and all we're going to
need to do is there's there's several
different schools of thought of how to
do this pretty much what you need to do
is anything you want to copy to the
cloud move to the s3 backup folder
anything you don't want to move to the
cloud don't have any extra backup folder
nice ok so it's got like a watch folder
where anything that pops in there it's
automat was just gonna move it up to the
cloud no oh it's an s3 backup folder you
can run another cron job oh okay there
you go all right run on a cron job it's
not that sophisticated not just a ruby
script okay um but when you run the Ruby
script it does but yes just sends them
well it's right here so the Ruby scripta
to run it is Ruby s3 sink RB tak are for
recursive and then s3 backup that's the
name of folder cure and then bucket
which I need to define oh so in the
script you just say bucket equals and I
it's back up in this case it's our case
it's back up underscore hak5 and then
what I did here because I've made this a
daily script just colon and then
whatever you want the folder in your
bucket to be so you don't actually need
the colon anything okay so just like if
you were to like SCP something to
another server and then you'd like colon
slash whatever no not so much this is
this is more has to do with bucket
management okay so instead you can have
multiple buckets inside your bucket or
multiple folders I would call it a
folder as opposed to a bucket is that it
gets confusing there's any of buckets
and folders what folders in a bucket and
folders and buckets buckets of folders
look yeah yes so then anyway once that's
done basically you can put anything once
whether you're you're dumping in SQ if
you're dumping a sequel into a tar or
you're you're zipping up an entire HT
Access file whatever you want to do you
pop it in here make sure you just move
it to the s3 back up and hurt run and
then all you do is once you run the
script it just starts uploading it like
Italy anything we put in here we can
just okay we'll move move
find something real quick well check
tilde like LSD I was just going to move
the s3 sink oh there we go yeah I'll do
that will synchronize our
synchronization yes trips with
synchronization sure I'll go with that
and now what we do is just run the
script so anyway that's it you run it it
works it's up in the cloud and you can
drop it the chron / you see where he X
ttc / cronbach daily dropped that script
in there on top big whatever yeah that's
a whole nother active waiting to happen
but yeah dude that's that's epic thank
you so much because we're using this to
back up our yes sir oh yes I don't we
use this on a date you've been using
this for like what now a year now or
sometimes do it yeah hold up stuff man I
got a strong very solid and it saved us
on more than one occasion it's nice to
have that kind of peace of mind so
definitely if you're looking for some
sort of backup in script thank you Jason
so much for combined schooling us on it
absolutely good stuff now we're going to
be back in just a bit with more goodness
actually no there's goodness right now
because it's time to check with Shannon
about that kid I just remembered that's
what's next act him we get asked a
million times over if we demonstrate an
arp cache poisoning attack for windows
and while we covered this way back in
season one i figured it's worth a
refresher now there are a million ways
to do this in the command line with
linux tools but here in windows will be
using a very simple tool called Cain and
Abel once you've downloaded and
installed it from excit go ahead and
fire up the sniffer by flicking the chip
icon in the top left right there the
first time you do this you'll be asked
to select your interface and you can get
back to the screen any time by clicking
configure I've gone ahead and selected
my interface with my IP address since
it's my wireless network card now I can
scan the network for potential targets
so you go over to the sniffer tab right
there right click and select scan MAC
addresses I'll stick with the default
all hosts in my subnet and then i click
ok so i have this huge list right here
well we have a
this stuff Darren you got a lot of stuff
on your your wireless card going on
right here I hope you know about all
that stuff right there okay cool now
that I have a list of all the machines
on the network I can go over to the ARP
tab and start the actual ARP cache
poisoning attack so I'm going to go
through here and i'm pretty sure 10 dot
13 dot 1 through 37 dot 124 is Darren
right Darren yep all right so I'm going
to choose his and I do a little bit of a
poisoning attack on him so I'll click my
plus sign so you click the blue + icon
on the toolbar to bring up the routing
dialogue and here I'm going to select n
dot 1337 dot one on the left that one is
always the router and then 10 1337 dot
124 on the right because that one's
Darren's machine see if I can find it
right here one two areas and then click
OK and the route will be loaded so now I
can begin the poisoning attack by
clicking on the radiation icon on the
left right there so it's poisoning
immediately our poisoning attack begins
yes now you can sit back relax and wait
for your target to do some browsing
which it looks like Darren's already
doing some browsing alright once enough
traffic has gone through you'll notice
full routing below which means that
you're getting a lot of good information
going right there so what does all of
this stuff mean arp cache poisoning
attacks basically mean a technique used
to attack a wired or a wireless network
in a connection the attacker can sniff
data and send a spoofed art message over
to the land so when they send that spoof
message they receive data that was
intended for the router or the computer
in question it's a man-in-the-middle
attack neither machine knows that I
exist in the middle they just think the
they're sending data like usual usual so
what tools are taking tickling your
technolo send them over to tips at hak5
org and we'll share them with the world
we'll be right back after a quick word
from our sponsor if you provide
technical support to clients colleagues
friends and family have you found an
easy cost-effective way without being
there in person well the best way for me
to provide technical support is to do it
online with go to assist Express go to
assist Express lets you view and control
another person's computer so you can
quickly resolve technical issues now
I've been able to use it to help friends
learn new software or fix family
computer problems without being there in
person yeah that's that's worth its
weight in gold so try go to assist
express free for 30 days for this
special offer you have to go to go to
assist calm / hak5
that just about wraps up this episode of
hak5 but you guys know before we get
going we met your tech nos better of the
week and some meat leash and stuffy in
the world's curds I know you're hungry I
am so hungry those emails may be those
who will whet your appetite or something
you'll be satiated beat eroded is there
a cheap substitute for an ARP cap maybe
firmware flash on a certain Wi-Fi card
or something to run software side to
work with the Wi-Fi card or virtual
appliance anything yeah I know to talk
about so uh they actually sell a Wi-Fi
card for this and its really expensive
here's the thing I like 200 bucks yes
something like 8 and basically if you're
willing to do some linux tools which I
find to be better anyway you can get
away with a lot more cards there's
plenty of compatibility whether you're
looking for older like pcmcia or looking
for like you know your pcie or a little
mini pc is and stuff like that or even
USB adapters totally the best resource
if you're looking to buy a new one
rather than just find out if your
current one supports it is to go over to
aircrack-ng org and i've linked to miss
Jenner's to their compatibility list
where they show and you know based on my
experience I'm going to go ahead and
recommend atheros wholeheartedly had no
problems whatsoever we like their lines
they've got a good USB chip if you can
find a USB card like this that runs the
atheros ar 9170 chipset you shouldn't
have any problems there's a bunch of
other ship says he should check out
quick compatibility list so yeah thank
you jerry alpha is wildly off is good
that's a real thing and we got a second
email from daniel he just sucks what
