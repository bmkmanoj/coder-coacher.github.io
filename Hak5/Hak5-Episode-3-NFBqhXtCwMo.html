email from Norfolk Virginia and you're
watching hack point-five
hey heckling welcome back to another
fantastic episode of hack point five
I'm your host Wes and I'm Darren and
before we even get started with today's
show I'd like to thank everybody that's
downloaded the show that's been seeding
the torrents all of you that post in the
forums and vote in the polls thank you
we really appreciate your feedback means
a lot to us so in this episode I 0.5 we
have some really nifty homebrew hacks
with RSS we've got a security segment I
think you're really going to enjoy with
Harrison but I think we're gonna kick it
off right with a classic mod segment
that's always my favorite AI clings
welcome back to another mod segment this
time around I'm gonna give the case a
break I'm gonna catch my keyboard up now
what I've got here is an IBM m-series
keyboard made in 1987 these were great
keyboards at the time and they still are
actually they've got great tactile
response I mean these keys are real
springy and the chord for it is eight
miles long and detachable plus stretchy
anyway I'm gonna give it the same
treatment that I gave the case it's
gonna be all black with some red accents
the pinstripe and the logo starting off
I've gone ahead and pop most of the keys
off out of and most of those are
actually just caps anyway so it's no big
deal and I've sanded them down rubbed
them off with alcohol got them prepped
and ready for painting and I've also
taken the keyboard apart says that's
going to get painted just set this aside
make sure you take good care of and
we're going to clean up the back as well
now here's the thing where we're gonna
do it is gonna save you about sixty
dollars because we're gonna make our own
das keyboard in the same stroke no
characters on it whatsoever so this way
you know it's fairly inexpensive and
this keyboard will be for the true leet
hacker let's get started
all right and we're back in the backyard
again getting ready to do some more
painting I've already got everything
gathered up that I need so let's get
right down to it first things first is I
need to paint the main body itself I'm
gonna paint this black and I've taped
off everything that I wish to save so
let's get to it all right so while the
top half of the body drives I'm gonna go
ahead and do the bottom half and if you
look here we are even taping off the
birth certificate for this thing you
know the date of manufacture so it'll
keep its authenticity let's get back to
painting all right so now that I've got
the whole body painted black I'm gonna
go ahead and start painting the keys all
my gray keys are gonna be black and all
my alphanumerics are gonna be red and I
might change that up a little bit later
on so let's go ahead mask up and start
painting these up
all right everything's all painted up
the keys are drying right now and I'm
gonna go ahead and logo this thing up
and pinstripe it now I got these cool
little paint pens to do this with it's
really good for small detail work that
I'm about to do and inexpensive so start
off with the red on the pinstripe and
just be real easy with it
probably take you a couple of times to
get the effect that you want all right
well my pinstripe dries I'm gonna go
ahead and do my stencil work now and
same thing I've got more paint pens and
it's just gonna be the same principle as
it was before just paint it in
all right everything's just about
finished up I've just got to do my last
little bit of red on the logo itself and
then we can just go ahead and slam this
thing all back together and show you the
finished product
hey we're back here at the lab we've got
everything put back together it's
working the way it's supposed to and if
you look here we've set aside W a s and
D right here painted on black that's for
you gamers out there so you can find
your movement controls very easily and
also it's a shout out to our friends at
WASD TV who unfortunately had to suffer
through Katrina so our thoughts and
prayers go out to them any right here we
even have the hack point 5 logo custom
painted on there as well to match the
case so all in all you have a custom
painted keyboard superly matches your
own personal colour scheme on your case
and if you have any questions about the
series m keyboard from IBM check out the
show notes at hack 5 org west's another
truly amazing mod I just like the fact
that you take an already awesome
keyboard the IBM M series and just make
it so much better well thanks I mean
it's just it was a great keyboard still
is and I just wanted it to match and
look as good as its do you know it
matches that case perfectly now next up
we have an RSS alarm clock that John and
I hike together I think you guys are
really gonna enjoy this but first a word
from our sponsors
hey Billy are you trying to getting
owned by noobs and CS uh-huh
are you tired of getting your zero-day
where's three weeks late oh then I think
Billy
that you need a big bowl of hacks or
flakes that's right hacks or flakes
packed with all the nutrients in
caffeine that all the actors need get
offs in your favorite Channel
pop headshots with the p90 even me a
real girls tank your place nutritious
delicious specially formulated to
enhance your micro and on specially
marked packages a free copy of nmap
it'll make you look cool at your flick
may contain traces here and you can tell
the position of clothing the girls John
what's that man let's go I've got a huge
problem this morning I woke up my alarm
I had to go to work is horrible not the
work the alarm dude this thing it just
beeps that's the point of it Alana did
no no no no what I'm saying is like 2005
and my alarm is just beeping so I
figured I'd take a break from hacking
into Gibson and put together an alarm
clock on my computer okay I didn't oh
wait you're gonna do this they're gonna
do the whole music thing on the wake up
to my music yeah that's really cool man
oh come on do you really think I'd do
something that lame it does play music
but it's way better than that what do
you do after you wake up coffee
breakfast email email news digs slash
dot you know check it out yeah yeah okay
so why not just lay in bed and listen to
your RSS feeds and what we're gonna do
here with some Perl and some vbscript
we're gonna hack together a little batch
file
that'll do this all for so you know play
a little mp3 to wake us up and then BAM
get to lay in bed and listen
so there's a Moroso it's a listening
part I'm using the Microsoft
text-to-speech engine or you could use
festival on Linux or Mac or whatever
this TTS was built in dotnet right right
well you know it's built into Windows
and this will work on ninety eight
ninety five whatever to run ninety five
please just just you know I'm sure
there's a Linux distro out there so we
head over to speech and on text of
speech I've downloaded an additional
voice and Michelle and she sounds well
she sounds better than Microsoft Sam way
better than Sam sounds horrible yeah
horrible I don't know why they
but then in there yeah okay so now what
we're gonna do is we've got the alarm
batch file opened up here alright and
you know it's good morning and then it
runs this Perl script and what this Perl
script does and have modified it a
little bit this is a RSS to html5 and
it's going to download the RSS feed from
Digg and then append it to alarm dot txt
so just copies the RSS write it does the
same thing to the slash the RSS feed and
then appends it here you know after
saying these are the photo on your
second when you get enormous that's when
you get XML so you know we'll get all
the notes and stuff what this Perl
script is actually doing is converting
it to a format where it can actually be
read by our text-to-speech engine it's
not actually HTML can strip the HTML so
I'm certain all the tags out suffice
text yeah pretty much awesome that's
really cool so you know it goes through
there in this blowing blowing and then
we delete any alarm file that was there
from the previous day and then we run
this awesome VB script that I found text
to wave and you know you give it the
text file that you want to convert and
then 35 is the option that makes it a
44.1 killa her stereo 16-bit sound file
and they wave and then we delete the
alarm text since we don't need that then
we go ahead and start the alarm m3u now
the m3u is really simple here we go
we've got I'll just type it yeah I mean
that's just your basic m3u that's a
playlist and it'll run in iTunes and
Windows Media Player and
winamp which is my favorite so let's go
ahead and give it a shot all right what
I'm gonna do is schedule it using at so
we'll schedule at at let's say 6:30 but
all this all this command line stuff can
we do on the get way you can do the same
thing you're doing in the command line
just by heading over to control panel
and scheduled tasks and the same exact
things we have the same way you do your
music but more science-y files cool so
we're gonna do at 6:30 every Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday
we're gonna run alarm backs this alarm
dot bat there we go
so it's scheduled let's go ahead and run
it long got that so making our
announcements access food creating the
file cool
now it's scheduled so right so it's
gonna happen every morning exactly it's
important can wake you up okay you know
a Love Shack will gets out of bed but
what you want to keep in mind is to make
sure you change that song yeah yeah yeah
if you listen to things oh no not at all
or else you'll end up hating the song so
I've gone ahead and given like 30
seconds of The Love Shack to wake me up
and then I'll head over to the RSS feeds
that's sweet like that yeah we got I
gotta read that yeah wonder what Kevin
will talk about anything I hope said it
sounds very cool man anyway you get the
idea
it's not the greatest voice in the world
but it's a lot better than the default
one that comes with Windows it's much
better you know you'll get used to it to
him so this will go ahead and wake you
up in the morning with some RSS feeds
and you know maybe after that you'll
check out the newspapers there's
something you heard that you like maybe
it'll be in there hey welcome to the
front table Ali hi how you doing great
what'd you think of the RSS alarm clock
well it's better than mine which just
beeps and beeps and eventually gets
through out the window I know that
feeling at least you can't throw your PC
out the window yeah I'm pretty attached
to it about as attached as I am to mine
but anyway we have a security segment
coming up with Harrison ooh probably
make you a little more paranoid about
your home network security yeah so uh
won't we take a look joining us here
today is Harrison to demonstrate a
man-in-the-middle attack Harrison thank
you for coming what is a
man-in-the-middle attack
all right well for the second being
technical I'm gonna refer to this as an
ARP cache poisoning attack now an ARP is
an address resolution protocol now each
device on a network uses this to build a
table with all the other devices on the
network now in the table it contains
each devices MAC address and its
corresponding IP address now they do
this by singing out a C
of ARP requests and ARP responses the
problem with this is it's susceptible to
attack we can exploit this vulnerability
between two computers a and B or two
devices by telling each one that were
the other so this will allow us to kind
of intercept the traffic like eavesdrop
yeah all we're doing is position ourself
in between two devices for example your
computer and the firewall and that we
can pick up all the network traffic in
between them
it sounds great so what do we need to
get this done well we're gonna use a
couple of tools the first thing I like
to do is get a little bit of do a little
bit of enumeration on the network with
the security scanner in this case I'm
gonna use nmap because the tool that
we'll use to do the ARP attack actually
has a built-in scanner but it's not
quite as detailed and it doesn't allow
us to do port scans well and maps also
open source and hey you know it's cool
because it was in the mail I send the
matrix oh yeah there was a real attack
in the matrix matrix too so I'm going to
use in map and since I'm Hardy on the
network I know the subnet so I can
simply scan and find out what all the
other devices are ok now I can tell by
the names of the computers that since
you are using the solomon extreme
international your IP address is
192.168.1.1 o2a it's an extreme
interface man and obviously the router
is 192.168.1.1 so I'm going to do a port
scan on you that way I can get an idea
of what kind of apps you're running and
what ports you have open and while
that's running I'm gonna go ahead and
start up Cain and Abel which is a
totally script Kitty tool I know but I'm
assuming that all of our viewers or most
of them are running Windows and it works
as long as it gets the job done right
exactly if you are using UNIX though
which I do mainly I would definitely
suggest you check out a tool called
header camp which does the job you know
just as well if not better than cain so
we're gonna go ahead and start our
sniffer and kane
and scan the MAC addresses as you can
see it builds a pretty good list of all
of the devices on the network so we'll
switch tabs here select the firewall and
Aaron's computer go ahead and press this
button what button which will start the
attack so now we're poisoning and so the
firewall thinks I'm Darren's computer
and Darren's computer thinks on the
firewall so I'm gonna pull up either
real and as you can see our nmap scan is
finished so let's make sure that you
when you're running out the real you
choose the right the right network
device I'm actually plugged into the
network so I'm gonna use my wired
Ethernet ethernet device and now I am
scanning the network so why don't you go
ahead and send Wes an instant message
you know what Wes signed off but I will
talk to John or anyone else online right
now now as you probably can see I can
type in AI M which is the name of the
protocol and the other real hit enter
and it will filter out so that we it'll
filter all the traffic so we only see
the a.m. traffic now I can I can look
through the traffic and I noticed that
you're talking to somebody called the
wine cork yep that's one of our viewers
and the message you just sent him says
you there with a question mark right
I just noticed an incoming transmission
this is hey mm-hmm and another outgoing
that said we're doing a segment right
now so there you go as you can see we're
picking up all the traffic and the other
thing I want to point out is using cam
and Mabel we can also snap up passwords
HTTP passwords and unless of course
using SSL and that's one of the
countermeasures and we'll get into that
another time with how to protect
yourself from this attack which I would
highly recommend using Gmail if you
don't have it or hey because that does
this out there their SSL all right
Harrison that looks pretty neat let's
see if you can get my FTP password for
hack 5 TV which is where we keep the
episode files for them logging into FTP
now with a test account I got it right
here
let's see username is test at hack 5 TV
in the password is lame password that's
exactly right
what sir lazily and password alright
well now that we have demonstrated it on
our network you want to go try it out on
somebody else's ok you want to hit up
the campus with a coffee shop sounds
good to me
alright let's go let's go
you
coffee shop okay and he is can you hear
me yes sorry about the volume we don't
have any wireless mics yet there's my
t-shirt maybe we can afford a guy using
G for college students let's go see okay
alright so here we are we're connected
to the Linksys wireless network here at
the coffee shop okay damn alright we've
got traffic what do we have here oh we
got a bright as he disconnected from his
IMAP server oh yahoo messenger ymsg and
that's great yet bull riding on two new
friends two two computers who are upping
the tooth appears at the same time mr.
trevor day and if we head over to ed the
real you check out here is yahoo instant
messenger traffic as well as i map
traffic for email and scroll down we've
got some more so you just go down this
list and there's tons of traffic to go
through but we could save this and kane
will save any of the passwords that are
going through this list so there we go
isn't successful so there you have a
clings how to own some noobs on their
wireless networks using some completely
script kiddie tools
yes but next episode we will have a
countermeasure segment showing you how
to protect yourself from the same attack
up next we have a brand new segment with
ali that i think a lot of you are going
to really enjoy so let's go ahead and
check that out today I've gone retro and
taking a look at Namco Museum's 50th
anniversary for the Gamecube we're gonna
see if it's worth your quarters if
you're better off sticking with
emulators and roms okay so there are 14
games in the entire package itself but I
decided to go with three that I loved
and two that I've gone without for the
first game I picked Galaga this game is
relatively easy and where you only need
your left and right directional buttons
and a really strong thumb for those
rapid fire shots the enemy formation now
of course since this game is 20 years
old the graphics are a bit archaic but
they are adorably twinkly aren't they
personally I found I had the most fun
with this game just by sitting around my
friends pass around the controller and
trying to see who could beat each other
scores I gave this highly addictive
arcade classic five out of five space
books
cuz you know everybody needs a space
bugger to second
I chose pole position to the sequel to
its revolutionary racing counterpart its
what the original should have been with
slightly better graphics and tracks that
can almost be beaten this one will keep
you entertained at least long enough to
qualify though the 1983 simulated engine
sounds will need even no choice but to
play it on mute you can actually get
past the qualification round without
pulling your hair out or breaking your
joystick so once you use two
downshifting in the turns avoiding those
slick spots and the other cars this game
is really rewarding when you finally win
I give this arcade speedster three and a
half out of five wheels and lastly out
of my favorites group I have sky kid I
mean what could be more fun than flying
around in the cute little biplane
blowing things about all listening to
the sound of 8-bit chip tunes well
getting to the landing zone and being
cheered on by the hula girls of course
the graphics are lacking with its 8-bit
color palette but at least it's not
asteroids gameplay is highly simplified
to this blue Bexley shut up I give this
arcade aviator four out of five bombs
now for the two of could have very well
have done without I didn't like these
very much
Mathi Fritz obnoxious sounds obnoxious
music obnoxious doors that can't be
shoving you back into the obnoxious
enemies couldn't get past round one and
then there was rally X of course you get
to run in a little car away from red
cars and collect Flags and dodge of
rocks and yay it has a radar but whoa
you can't see anything of course it
didn't have enough time to review all
these games for you there are a bunch of
honorable mentions Dig Dug Galaxian
dragon spirit boss goat in Rolling
Thunder pole position pac-man and mrs.
pacman all right now the box only lists
14 games but there are indeed 16 games
ok you ready for this the two secret
games are the much-coveted the very rare
Galaga 88 which you can get access to by
getting 40,000 points in Galaga now if
you get 15,000 points in pac-man and
20,000 points and mrs. pac-man you get
to play pack mania where you can jump
over the ghosts uh-huh this game
presents us with a menu that features
songs like come on Eileen and working
for the weekend also
that has original arcade cabinets for
each individual game neo Goods us with
another killer even attend this I'm Ali
now go put some videogames after
watching the show Thank You Ali for an
awesome arcade game review I understand
the thing about mappy but seriously
rally-x not that bad whatever you say
Darren okay well next up we've got
another RS s homebrew hacked I think you
guys are really gonna enjoy but first a
word from our sponsors
new from micro shaft the micro chef mini
this unique new personal computer is
powered by a powerful celery d
microprocessor with two gigawatts of RAM
and a 400 K gabite hard drive powered by
a revolutionary new bullhorn operating
system it's easier than ever to write
documents check email get infected with
worms become a spam zombie and lose your
identity online even cluster multiple
minis with the Beowulf Bowl best of all
when it becomes too infected to boot you
can even eat it the incredible edible
mini PC new from micro shaft
good morning Bevin top 5 stories
trending this morning our weekly release
schedule party danger leaf exemplar down
little by little poultry LG LightScribe
DVD burner with pics touch keys the next
generation cell phone user interface
learn C++ with start notes
you John
dude what is this I own my printer it's
good CRS is newspaper I program to the
other day is it like the alarm clock
yeah it's kinda like the alarm clock you
say what it is yeah so how does this
work I mean I see that I got like RSS
feeds in here but how did you get it to
print out like this yeah actually it
just automates a lot of this things it
parses the files grabs the RSS feed
prints it out to HTML and then you said
in order to print so what am I gonna
need if I want to do this well you're
gonna need an Apache server or is server
web server to run the scripts and I use
PHP 5 - that's awesome
can you show me the code yeah basically
we're going to start off by creating
some variables for the actual tags as
you can see when I pull up the XML it's
got like an RSS the version of the RSS
it's got the channel and then it
traverses through down to the core which
is like the description so go back up
here I'll show you the variable names
and basically we create an array throw
in those tags in there and it'll know
what to grab what node to grab now we
get into a little bit of the dirty work
I'm not gonna go through and explain the
entire process yeah this is a lot it's
kind of it's a lot of kit 250 some lines
yeah it's it's not a whole lot but yeah
it's a lot to explain so it'll be in the
show notes though yeah definitely so is
this like is this a class or is this yes
it is a class it's actually I labeled my
classes RSS news and it's got some
built-in functions so that it just
creates an object so this is really the
engine behind your PHP script that Lars
has the XML so what actually puts it
together and makes it look as beautiful
as this well if we scroll down to the
bottom this is all the preg match where
it matches the data from the array to
the eiffel node then it grabs that data
on the inside then we'll just scroll
down here this is doing a little bit of
stripping and this is where the actual
RSS feed gets passed into the actual URL
that you enter mm-hmm once it goes in
here it's gonna actually open that file
I'm gonna go grab it bring back the data
and then we want to scroll down here
down to
the actual printing which I built into
the function as well which will actually
print all the data it goes through each
little node and knows okay inside of set
let's say description it's gonna grab
all the text inside of there mmm
so I've got like this slash not feed and
I've got this story about Google that's
right there where it's actually printing
the Google article exactly and in
reality there's actually that
description tag right there okay yeah so
it knows which one to grab all right
then so we're gonna go back to the index
page which is the actual main page that
you view all the data in and as you can
see at the top we include some CSS so
we're not messing around some ugly
tables and I include once the new step
HP which is was that cooler class that
was our class and I'm gonna start off by
creating an array of the URLs okay I see
so we've actually got all the URLs of
the newsfeeds I see you got weather from
Yahoo and that's up my weather right
here
traffic BBC News slash dot and then you
know a personal blog right so we've got
the as you can see we've got the links
in the array and now what we're actually
going to do is we're gonna create this
URL objects mm-hmm since it's a class we
have to create an object for it and it's
gonna count for each and every URL so
now what we're gonna do is we're going
to take that out I'm familiar with this
icy body and some devta yeah yeah well
right before that we're actually gonna
parse those URLs we're going to feed it
the URL and parse it is going to go
through alright then so we're gonna move
on to the actual HTML and as you can see
it's it's really lower down because of
the CSS and I just call my div tags
I've got your RSS header if you wanted
to you can include the data in there
with a simple date function call through
PHP and then we actually call the
function that's in that class called
print rows so we don't actually have to
have the engine code in our PHP index
and that makes actually much shorter
yeah and the CS because if it was in the
index file you'd have to get like a for
each loop and then print it out so
instead it just throw it in the class
and then just call it nice so how are we
gonna automate this hook prints every
morning well basically we're in Korea
basketball and run a few
but before we do that we're gonna have
to do is we're gonna have to call an app
file or a cron job on UNIX to set the
time so that every Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday ok so this is just
scheduling to run the batch file just
like we did just like when the alarm
clock exactly it's gonna call that batch
file we're gonna go ahead and run that
and the jobs created all right so we're
just going to quickly go over the batch
file first we're gonna delete those old
files so we don't were yesterday's news
an idea and then we're gonna do a curl
connect so that we can grab the live
data and they're not making this main
CSS and the newspaper HTML exactly now
it's going to also convert that to PDF
it will share our program called doc to
PDF and then it's going to create an
automatic automated print command using
Newark and CMD so we're gonna go ahead
and run it whoops
go ahead call a newspaper stop that run
it it's gonna go print great can I see
the PDFs coming up yep there it goes
great it's coming out the printer
so nice thank you so much and you know
this can be customized with whatever RSS
feed you want so you know anybody can
use this code to make their own custom
newspaper in the morning where can they
get more info and all the code and
everything they need to get this done
we're going to post them on the forums
on hanklab org all right so check out
the show notes sounds good last month's
trivia question was what was the
frontside bus speed of the Pentium 75
and that was correctly answered by test
mat from West Virginia who writes the P
54 C 75 or P 75 had a frequency of 75
mega Hertz NFS B of 50 mega Hertz with
1.5 ratio and we thought it'd be kind of
fun to hook him up with a gift
certificate from all of mp3.com worth
about two hundred and eighty-five rubles
that's about five hundred megabytes of
undi rm2 music that's a that's a nice
gift that's a lot of music to give away
anyway this month's trivia question is
what is the TI a telecommunications
industry association designation for
cat5 cable now bonus if you can tell us
the name of Daren's cat as always to
send your answers to trivia hak5 org now
on with the show
all right today real quick and simple
you're gonna mod your IDE cables make
them rounded you're gonna need IDE cable
an exacto knife what dude what I'm
filming I'm filming my rounded IDs what
the hell do you want these runs Eddie's
I got something much better this is an
80 case and and fix it man fix it yeah
dude it doesn't do anything it's busted
it's old its got like a 486 in it so
what do you what do you want I want it
to be functional that's all I'm asking
you just want it to be functional
yes all right let's go hit the shop oh
all right let's go let's go
as ever fully functional
you
hey guys real quick recently there's
been a few exploits out on the internet
for the wrt54g router we just wanted to
go over them briefly right it's a common
wireless router and if you have it what
you want to do is make sure they've
updated your firmware you can find more
information on those exploits and the
firmware and are shown otaku org and I
thought that as long as you know we're
bringing this up let's go over a few
quick tips so you guys can use if you
haven't already secured your wireless
network one of the things that you may
want to do is set a DMZ and that's a
demilitarized zone that's any incoming
packets on any ports that it was that
your computers did not originate you
want to set that to an IP address on
your land that does not exist another
thing they may want to do is set the
wireless encryption mode to at least wpa
wpa2 I mean if you've seen any of the
other IP bases three to five minutes
right correct but you don't need to go
into that ever go see a web cracking
segment on high five so definitely
another thing that you can do is set MAC
address filtering it's not required but
I mean if you know how many computers
will be on your network and you're not
planning on having buddies over anything
it's not foolproof but it will
definitely attack it's good okay of
course turn on the firewall and enable
HTTPS for your web admin console and
what that's going to do is all your
traffic instead of HTTP / / 1 &amp;amp; 2 once
again 101
it'll be HTTPS and that's SSL so your
communications will be secured it's
purely Erica sniffing yeah I don't have
to go into that earlier I mean we showed
how easy it is to pick up HTTP pass
right so another thing you may want to
do is disable the wireless admin access
to the min console what that will do is
it will only allow you to log into the
administrative console over a wired port
that means there can't be some guy in a
band sitting out front of your house on
your wireless network that can get into
your man cons very important another
thing is to disable remote management
now if you're not using a remote
management what that is is allowing you
to get to the administrative console
over the internet if you don't have a
need for that go ahead and disable it
and disable universal plug and play
unless you have an app that you know
needs it chances are you don't it's just
gonna
by where if you contract any spyware
it's just gonna open up all these ports
and your network will be a lot more
interesting definitely definitely
Oh change passwords yes multiple
passwords yes and don't use the same
password on your Linksys router that you
use on other things right right I found
out earlier earlier when we were
downtown at the coffee shop we it was so
easy picked up somebody's HTTP password
I think this is aimed password here some
scan some ports and notice he had SS a
trip and an SSH server and bam it was
just turns out it was the same past
where he was using first yes the same
password for your secure stuff yeah with
your in 30 second shell on his computer
is easy piece of cake so definitely
multiple passwords and secure passwords
too right so we'll get into secure
passwords probably later on the other
half or something but we won't do web
cracking no no I - left cracking okay I
guess that sums it up that's pretty much
thanks guys see ya so that pretty much
wraps up this episode of hack point-five
as always if you have any questions or
comments feel free to shoot either of us
an email or contact us through the
forums while you're there don't forget
to cast a vote in the polls or you can
call something new a hack point-five
hotline that's two oh six three three
eight four two five five so continue
supporting continue seeding this
torrance and we will see you next month
I'm West I'm Darren trust to techno lust
we thought we'd let you know at a time
yeah I'll let you ahead of time we're
letting you after the bag you've already
been half our requests and responses the
problem with this see like other college
students go to coffee shops like to pick
up chicks we go to pick up a password to
the stuff I I got 10 bucks that says the
parole is some visual basic script yeah
that's sad little bit scripts we put a
source so that's gonna wake us up right
there yeah and as long as your
computer's on which of course it is
because on BitTorrent
you know you know for command an
indignation stuff right there isn't
another you're not careful yeah better
than mine that just speaks and beeps
beeps and beeps and beats and beats and
beats and
what was the frontside bus speed of the
Pentium 75 that was correctly answered
by test Matt from I was correctly
answered by test back from why do I
can't really say so much press correctly
answered by test Matt and yeah
let's correctly answered my test match
from West Virginia I got it let's
correctly answered by test mat from
somewhere no I can get it it's that was
correctly answered by no I got it I got
it
that's practice my test magic from last
month's trivia question was what was the
front side bus of a front side bus
now that was correctly answered by test
mat from West Virginia
