android media server attack crushes
phones and tracking point sniper rifles
have a wireless hack all that coming up
now on threat wires hello I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for July
thirty-first 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security our privacy and
Internet freedom a huge thanks to
everyone watching the show and
supporting us we've got a lot coming up
next week with black hat and DEF CON so
today's show is going to be a quick one
let's get right into it with bind which
is a popular software made to turn human
talk domain names into IP addresses that
computers can actually read an example
of this could be google com which equals
in dns IP address land 8888 it turns out
that it has a new vulnerability that can
make a server running tons of domains
crash with the exploit labeled cve 2015
5477 all an attacker would had to do is
send a malformed piece of data to a
server that is wall durable and then it
would crash this would take down any
sites running on that server
specifically bind 9 DNS servers
basically in leet speak this means that
a packet exploits the handling of
queries for Tiki ey records which allows
denial of service attacks to happen now
while by nine is full of features and
gives servers really abundant use of
resources it is widely insecure and many
features shouldn't even be made
available publicly via the Internet
there is a patch available via the
Internet systems consortium there's a
link in the show notes I'll start off
the second story by saying this isn't
the same exploit a stage fright for
Android that Darren reported on earlier
this week android phones have a media
server service which is used to index
media files and the exploit can be used
to make the phones crash or go into this
vegetative state where you can't do
anything with the device an attacker
would send a user to a website with a
malicious file or the user could install
a malicious app with a bug if a
malformed video file using the mats
troska container is opened which is
basically how android phones read MKV
file
for example media server crashes which
in turn makes the entire phone crash now
there's a trend micro researcher his
name is wish woo he said quote the
vulnerability is caused by an integer
overflow when the media server service
parses an MKV file it reads memory out
of the buffer and writes data to null
address when parsing audio data this
happens in 4.3 all the way up to five
point one point one the vulnerability
was responsibly disclosed to Google in
late May and a fix has not been released
and lastly security researchers Runa
Sandvik and Michael augur have
discovered a hack involving tracking
points computerized sniper rifles where
wireless connection built into the rifle
could be exploited to change the scopes
calculations and force a user to miss
their target or shoot something
completely different as well as disabled
the scope or disable firing itself now
this is a thirteen thousand dollar rifle
it's linux power to allow even a
beginner to get a bull's-eye with the
self aiming product the user is fully in
charge of the manual trigger though now
tracking point told wired in an
interview that they will work with the
researchers to update the software and
due to tracking points financial and
stability at the moment the researchers
will not be releasing the full code for
the exploit at this time there are only
a few thousand of these rifles and
consumers hands at this moment but it is
a little bit sovereign to think that a
weapon is vulnerable to this kind of
attack I'm slightly freaked out now
before signing off I want to thank
everyone for watching the show whether
you're a patron at patreon.com / threat
wire or not we really appreciate all of
the sharing all the commenting and all
the liking that you guys do on all the
social networks we've also got t-shirts
available at HEK shop calm if you want
to sport a threat wire t in RL and we
also have stickers and we are not yet
fully funded for three times a week but
we are on our way with your help so if
you want to support us via patreon click
the link below and find out all the
details and we would love to see your
adorable fur babies as well we love
seeing these guys every week so thank
you so much for sending them in now we
are independent we are completely
ad-free and we always will be and of
course if you're going to be in vegas
next week for the hacker cons swing
by our booth over at Def Con or the pool
party at bsides lv las vegas where we
will be celebrating 10 years of hack 5
i'm so excited there will be cake now
with that I'm Shannon Morse and i will
see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
