about Armitage the GUI front-end to
Metasploit plus nerdcore sensation dual
core is making the lives of forensics
investigators much much more difficult
awesome his real name is David his
interests are sidelines internet and
gaming all that and more this time on
hack 5 this segment of hack 5 is brought
to you by goto assist express hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
towards your weekly dose of technologies
inten which in binary's 1008 cos 0 is
representing the one and the other one
is representing a truer than the next
zeros representing a 4 and then the next
one is her for anything at 8 so 8 plus 2
is a 10 ok I got it
yeah yeah very exciting episode today
exciting episode it's good to be back in
the studio I have been crazy yeah you've
been moving into your new digs moving
into the new digs one of the reasons why
well also because we went to Derby
County we got so much content so we've
got even more for you guys great stuff
for this episode kind of needed that to
also deal with the whole movie thing but
now well we'll show some footage of
Kirby later the new place how does she
like it she has been yelling at oil
tankers oh wait does she see them coming
oh I lucked out I got some I would like
I like was like craigslist.org / SF Bay
/ apartment center and like boom it like
had just posted like 30 seconds ago like
what waterside studio apartment for
cheap yes so that's awesome
congratulations on your new digs you
need to have a barbecue so I can go over
there and enjoy the water
good yeah we can invite all the hak5
fans except for the fact that it's like
200 square feet yeah it doesn't really
read my fancy yeah a little bit small I
know that's okay
speaking of fans we got a gift I love
gifts from fans I did too a little
explosion gifts from that shoe all right
so these are my gosh diskettes wears
nothing on them
as far as I know so so you say yes we
want to plug them in and find out oh my
god wow they're so pretty wait this
these came out at 87 so no no they
actually originally were introduced in
1971 with a whopping seventy nine point
seven kilobytes of data could fit on it
I wasn't even born yet anyway those are
from Aaron Aaron and Sookie oh oh it's
like Sookie but it's the Asian version
oh there you go of the true black
character Sookie Sookie's named Sookie
that's why everyone turned tunes into
this I was well they're like so
interested in True Blood he says my wife
and I are moving and cleaning out the
house I figured I can send you some
8-inch floppy disks I had hanging around
they can store a whole 500 kilobytes I
also got a picture of my leek Kitty's
cake got an espresso this must be in the
one circa 1976 that could hold 500 K
later on before the end of the life they
could actually get all the way up to 1.2
megabytes before Wow
before the private quarters came around
that's where I started the faculty
quarter double-density
that was good stuff which one were were
those the fat ones what they were just
like this except there were five and a
quarter inches well okay yeah yes and
then the three and a half's and then USB
yep no quack but pretty sure I know how
oh dude sent a picture of Zoo kitties
yes thank you for the picture of zoo
kitties yeah yeah I love that
my brother just got kitties yeah his
kitties are named one is thanks from the
the the movie about Halloween it was
like some cartoon childish movie and
then the other one I think he named
Chewbacca Oh cuz I told him to look at
Kirby which is kerberos and if I had a
second cat which I can't now limit its
face but I would name it five as in cat
five that's so nice and that that nerd
just there was like why not cat six I
know it's like come on it's old-school
to five by the way okay
have you heard about the xbl Xbox Live
hack
that have been going on lately Microsoft
still claims it's not their fault the
ones that have been going on for months
and months and it's really just some
people like breaking into some accounts
with weak passwords yes using it to buy
fifa 11 fifa 12 like I don't know
they're getting like ever it is
they're like stealing people's Microsoft
Points and stealing their credit card
information that's tied to the xbl
accounts well isn't it beautiful I mean
any system where you've got a credit
card tied to the account I mean if
somebody hacks my Amazon account they
can purchase stuff cuz I've got credit
cards attached to that I'm mine to my
xbl account has my credit card tied to
it and it has been that like that since
I've gotten my gold membership years ago
and so I called Xbox and I was like hey
I kind of want to you know take this off
because I'm a little worried about my
security and they were like they were
like oh well rather than saving the
credit cards so that every time you want
to buy microsoft points you have to type
in your brain I would rather just type
it in every time so it's not saved
anywhere and you know I don't know what
their encryptions like over there I
don't know how they're saving itself the
whole thing with the Sony fiasco is
there's no transparency without
corporations on how they store their
data so the guy tells me he he says okay
well we actually can't do that but you
can you can fix some some family family
security settings on your Xbox console
to keep people from buying things on
your console protect you from a local
attack exactly I was like oh yeah you
said put a pinko on there no it's like
that's not really fixing what I might as
well said you put hot glue in your USB
port yeah
so and then I go no you know that's not
really what I want I want to delete my
credit card you know I don't want to
whit have to worry about any hacks and
then he goes oh are you sure you're not
talking about the PlayStation 3 hacks
and I was just like do you know what
kind of show we've done for the past
like six years oh I was like really it's
all zeros you know and just like
overwrite your card with me
no because it verifies that when you hit
submit on like any website well sounds
like putting you've got two options you
can one wait for your credit card to
expire like I know one of mine's
expiring them which mine expires in
January I can't do that did you
auto bill pay so after that I need to
redo otherwise
you could just go to like any
convenience store at least here in the
States and pick up a Visa prepaid and
use that and then you can like refill it
online in at least that way if it does
get stolen you've got like a balance of
what 20 bucks in there yeah that's true
I could do that that would be a lot
better than tying it to my bank account
which I like the idea of those prepaid
cards when they first came out and like
my first thought was dude you know like
use it until there's like ten dollars
left on it and go to the bar drink with
all your mates and leave that's horrible
don't do that don't do that bartenders
need your money well yeah yeah tip your
waitress
they gotta be about 500 bills and stuff
yeah but but now I like the idea of like
I don't know just like the whole credit
system we're like oh you know uh-huh
anyway enough of our bantering away yes
we've got excellent stuff this deal it
is you know we're going to be talking to
Rothfeld Mudge about armitage excellent
GUI front-end to Metasploit he's done
such a wicked job it was really
fascinated talking to him about going
from like a programmer making like
grammar software for WordPress to this
and he's a really cool guy I think you
guys are gonna enjoy it so we will see
you on the other side here at Derby
cotton 2011 with the man by the name of
c64 music is that correct yes that's me
I make all the beats in dual core I'm
responsible for all the awesome music
and then you got that that that tall kid
from the UK doing all the raps right
yeah he has the he has a easy job I got
the hard job nice note you were here
talking about forensics how does that
work actually anti forensics I I think
doing forensics professionally for a
living would suck because there's so
much overhead with documenting
everything and all that stuff but don't
you actually do that for a living I mean
I know that you're a rapper but you're
also a hacker no I do reverse
engineering for a living so that's
that's like the cool cool forensics so
reverse engineering and now you're doing
reverse forensics yeah so basically it's
like if you tried to come in my house
and take my stuff and do a forensics
investigation on it it'd be like a war
crime in there okay so is this like the
whole idea like the Hollywood movie were
like the FBI busted and then the hacker
is like oh no and he grabs
the EKG or whatever the hell those
things are and like runs over to the
servers and tries to like zap them or
whatever
yeah well use the EKG first to get the
heart rate of the server but then along
with your Nagios monitoring but the EMP
like clear fry your circuitry out yeah I
know a lot of this um is this stuff that
I'm dropping in the talk is real basic
stuff
nothing hardcore but it's like a couple
different approaches or aspects of a
forensics investigation we're dealing
with stuff like trying to acquire memory
to do memory forensics so taking an
offensive counter approach to that in
this case we're like overwriting the USB
Drive that gets stuck in the system with
the bite so you've got an attack so so
the forensics guy shows up trying to
image your desk and he's like oh I'm
just gonna plug my USB Drive into images
it and then your system starts attacking
the forensics investigator yes that's
that's one of the things we've got tools
that just some basic tools I wrote that
basically pollute your filesystem in
your disk with like a lot of encrypted
content so when you go through and carve
out all the files you get all these like
encrypted drivers and encrypted seven
zips and encrypted GPG files and there's
no like it obliterates the
signal-to-noise ratio there's no way to
tell like what was actually solid
encrypted material that was legit and
what was just like crap material that
was angry
whoa my mind is just blown poor the
simplicity of it all because I do rely
on you know true cryptid encrypted
volumes for stuff that I want to keep
private and I never realized like oh
dude of course some some bogus ones
that's even that's almost as good as the
whole plausible deniability factor of
TrueCrypt
yeah I I think there's some other stuff
about TrueCrypt some other folks I know
the do forensics hardcore have some
notes about trick rape that's that are
interesting but yeah this is more like
chaff right it's like background noise
and you can't distinguish what the real
signal is so that's uh that's just
another part of the approach and that's
considered in the talk so those tools is
that something open-source do you
publish this yes there are gonna be
published on github github calm slash in
280 but it'll be spelled by my handle
way like int 0 x8 0 but yeah they'll be
open source and I write C in x86 at work
every day so I thought it would be fun
in the sense of trolling still to write
all these in bash
really yeah yeah just for the fun of it
yeah just for the lol's well alright

challenge and register because we're
only going to be able to take some of
the first few registrants because we
have a very special challenge set up
