equals no more banner ads at the router
level 80 of dual core reports plus a
cloud syncing nass without the hassles
of building and maintaining a bsd box or
messing with our sink to ec2 not that
you couldn't but just this one's dead
simple all that and more this time on
hak5 this segment of hak5 is brought to
you by the ben heck show hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse is of course
your weekly dose of texting a list guess
what else it is your birthday happy
birthday my hair is curly I don't think
I've ever done that on the show I've
always straightened it yeah yeah really
no I think I think back in the like the
47 not oh yeah season 4 6 &amp;amp; 7 oh okay
yeah cuz I remember there was one where
you were like still Missouri sending in
footage for me that's right I was lazy
one day and I was like yeah I'm gonna
record the screws straightening here
mm-hmm well anyway I did there could be
a wiki that tells you about Shannon's
hair salon okay baby don't know why are
wicked maybe it's on the darknet I psych
guy and don't worry about that um that
was sad actually maybe we all have to
move to the darknet just to see it if
current let's propose legislation goes
through yeah I know Patrick got really
riled up about it on tekzilla we've been
talking about it on tnt I'm really riled
up about eggs of course you guys know
already we're talking about the Stop
Online Piracy Act the the proposed
legislation that would you know give the
government and this is this it would
give them the ability to on behalf of
copyright holders because we know that
through the DMCA they've never done
anything bad like sue grandma's that
don't even have computers but the
ability to go after sites and payment
networks and Internet service providers
in advertising networks and basic search
engines anyone that's involved with
linking or giving you
the ability to enter any website that
they deem they don't like yeah as soon
as there's just like an itty-bitty link
to some kind of copyright infringement
that you may not even know about on your
Twitter or on Facebook or even on google
the search engine build they have every
right according to this a very very
bland act to completely delete the site
yeah this is take it down and this
actually been happening recently with
like ice taking down stuff at the DNS
level and it's just like WTF you know
like who gives you you know anyway it's
like it's just like all of the the
congressmen are backing this and they
don't really know the full story and we
really wish we had some more technical
people go in there and tell them it
really is Yahoo Facebook Twitter so many
others are against this but then again
we just found out this week that
Nintendo as well as the business
software lines for the BSA you guys know
them is is a organization that
represents Microsoft autodesk adobe so
many other companies that are interested
in software piracy are all for this and
by the way it actually the latest seems
like that it might not go through in the
way that is but I'm afraid that this is
one of these things whether you know
they proposed it like we'd like to we'd
like to censor the internet and kill
babies and they're all like oh oh oh did
somebody say killed babies no Nick's the
killing babies part and then we can pass
this and it's like we've had got a wise
up with our plastic forks and do
something about this mozilla.org / SOPA
has the links to where you can find all
of the eff good stuff oh good okay you
know need to check that out is to
protect yelling basic Grisman we that's
what they do over at the eff they make
it really easy if I put like nine 4801
and then submit my zip code and just
second here it'll actually show me who
my senators are my my house
representatives I know that if you're in
the UK or anywhere else in the world you
probably like come on what but you know
unfortunately a lot of times things
follow sue I mean look like Canada and
the DMCA yeah that's true so I'm really
riled up you need to be relative as well
it's time to take action and then yeah I
just encourage you guys to go and get
more educated I mean maybe you're all
for this maybe you want you know
copyright holders to be able to
blacklist DNS stuff or maybe you're
interested in ways to
fourth this on a technical level I
should probably point out mafia fire
calm it's where you can get a plugin for
firefox and for chrome what does it do
well when i started d listing stuff on
dns levelland like torrent sites that
would legally link to some torrent files
right a torrent isn't necessarily
illegal there's plenty of great i'd be
an episode hak5 that's good there you go
absolutely right well I says hey you
know we're nixing it they just take it
out of the dns server so that when your
browser goes hey what's the IP address
of this server it goes what server what
domain we don't see the domain is
registered but we're not going to feed
you the IP address for so unless so what
does the plugin do oh just it kind of
puts it back well it puts it back in ah
yeah so it locally knows the IP address
so it's like all right fine I'll
remember 206 dot 348 dot whatever daily
good yeah actually the crazy thing about
this is when it first like started
seeing this whole sopa thing was a dude
whatever i'm just gonna get on opendns
you block all the DNS listings you want
i'm on the oaken Venus know so much
turns out that would fall under an inner
service provider and then they would be
legally obligated to to you know the
government says block that then opendns
would have to do that it's like you know
it's my birthday that's a good as for
listen to me not past this thing because
this let's talk about something happier
it is it is your thing in any case you
know what mm-hmm I have some happy news

really sure as well as all of the latest
builds from his show
there has been a huge move from local
data collection to storing stuff in the
cloud or on a network share the pogoplug
mobile was recently released and it
pretty much has the power of both it's a
perfect little tool for people who want
to be able to access files from anywhere
and upload files on the go that's the
name to get this guy started you just
plug them into your router and stick
some sort of external drive into it
whether it be an SD card and external
hard drive or even a flash drive and you
just leave them there sitting on your
computer desk cool after that and after
you've activated your Pogoplug mobile
and created a new account of course you
can access and store files on the black
box from your phone your tablet or your
PC the pogoplug guys have even created
really streamlined apps for your iPhone
your iPad and your Android device yeah
the apps are mostly just for streaming
files so there aren't a whole lot of
advanced capabilities like you'll see on
the pc version now back to the pogoplug
mobile this device has it's about eighty
dollars and it has USB 2.0 an SD card
slot so you have infinite storage
expansion if you will since it is two
point oh the fastest files that can be
transferred are about 30 megabits per
second and it does have a Gigabit
Ethernet connection from your computer
you go over to my Pogoplug calm and log
in to see all the files that have been
uploaded to the pogoplug cloud or to the
pogoplug mobile device and my SD card
you'll see over here is about 16 gigs
and I've only used now six hundred and
forty megabytes so far pretty good with
your device activation you also get five
free gigs of cloud storage and over here
on the side I can click on pogoplug
cloud and it shows me I used seven point
five megabytes of my five gigs pretty
nice the online interface is really easy
to use and understand with file sorted
by type at the top so i have my just
regular files i can look at music by
itself photos movies sharing and there's
also a nice little help center and then
over on the side it sorts things by
device so i have my Pogoplug mobile
which i haven't named yet and my pogo
plug cloud when you first start it up
it'll take a little while to sync all of
your files from the device to your pc
and we do have a very fast connection
here at the studio so i was able to time
it pretty well took me about 20 minutes
i did find that my phone seemed to sink
the files a lot faster when i checked my
pogoplug paged on the pc it was still
going so a little difference there i
also discovered after messing around
with it that if you play an mp3 from the
phone or the pc browser interface it'll
continue to play in the background while
you do other things including browsing
other files on pogoplug so I'm going to
try that right now I want to let's see
I'm just going to play something in the
background here and I can look at other
photos browse around a little bit pull
up a PDF if I wanted to and it works
pretty streamlined I don't have any
issues with it other than this image
thumbnail doesn't appear to come up all
the way but it's okay I know what the
picture is from the app on your mobile
device you can also automatically upload
photos and videos but for iphone users
you do have to turn on location services
services for this I don't know if you
have to do location services as well for
Android so overall I found that the
pogoplug is not only really easy to set
up and use but also perfect for anyone
who is on the go all the time and wants
to access all their files ASAP with
maybe a little bit of time for buffering
of course I did want to mention that
apparently there are some hacks for
pogoplug mobile specifically this model
which is the Pogo v4a 101 like getting
arch linux on it and possibly your boon
to if you know more about this so you
just want to give me your take on the
public pogoplug mobile you can always
email me feedback at hak5 org or leave
