linux sort of will explain how and what
this might mean for the industry then
playing games and other windows apps in
linux with wine which isn't an emulator
but it kind of is sort of plus our
favorite linux commands one of them
involves chocolate mmm chocolate stay
tuned all that anymore this time on hack
five this segment of hack five is
brought to you by ting hello and welcome
to hack five my name is darren kitchen
you're so creepy my name is Shannon
moralized I'm seeing spots yeah where
sometimes the wodsworth principle
applies and sometimes it doesn't I hope
your Thanksgiving was well yes it was
amazing I went like to Snow White's
house and uh and it was fantabulous no
no I actually got high score on Galaga
next to Space Mountain oh really
yeah right you went deal on that I only
had to go I only had to go to level 36
yeah I was I'm like a stress out thing
and totally I think it's amazing what
like a day at Disney will do oh I
totally agree I mean it's one of the
happiest places on earth so they
supposedly yeah not bad I must say I
kind of agree before we get into the
other stuff I do want to say since right
now is just with the way that our
schedule do it goes for the shoot the
first time that I've actually had
reading and the feedback from the
episode before last so that was a 1213
I'm still getting awesome emails from
you guys in fact I'm responding to a lot
of these in my own personal video blog
which you can find at hack 5 dorg just
scroll down it's right under there where
the regular going so they automatically
get updated onto the website there and
then I put one cosmonaut and there's
some really good discussions going and
do Google+ and I'm tagging a lot of
amazing stories that are coming in but
we'll get into those in another week cuz
I have a lot more to say on the topic
but with all of that said just a quick
update that obviously our money isn't
good enough for that bank and this is
this this is what is it called a free
economy or a free market or whatever and
so we just go somewhere else it's a free
it's a free country we can move on to a
different totally
they don't serve our kind but you know
that's quite all right by me whatever so
yeah not to get into another rant let's
just go ahead and get into because we
got fun we got we have wine stuff going
on today we have wine you have a gift
and wine we just started doing a new
show we should mention that at the end
of the show by the way stick around for
that
yeah what's the gift Oh check it out I
have actually not seen this so this is
from Richard oh thank you Richard he
says I might even set up to download
your show every week I know how you two
love old hardware and I thought you
could use this old adapt tech es si si
si I card scuzzy oh it's a scuzzy card
do we have any terminator you said I
couldn't find the original driver disk
but I figure you can download them from
the internet and he also gives the link
for that if you want it down let him
enjoy looking forward to your next
podcast oh thanks so much for the PCI
card Richard I love these yeah that's
awesome
these make three big they make great
Christmas ornaments you got a loop right
there you just angry you know what
speaking of which we need to bring out
the Christmas ornament we got to get the
tree out I got some AMD chips we can put
on it do you have some hats some Santa
hats cuz I totally want to wear one we
didn't make my trance or X's out of him
you only do a segment like that okay
again with the one words principle about
this show what again are we saying we're
drinking wine yeah we're we're having
some wine on the show because we're
talking about the wine this whole
episode is completely like wine crazy
I've not had that worked out to you some
wine yeah we didn't even we didn't plan
this we didn't plan for outfits to match
but they totally do because I'm whining
she's always whining hey what you don't
have to tell them that so you hear about
you hear about this netflix on the linux
finally hmm it's it's kind of an
unofficial thing actually yeah I heard
California I mean if excited that you
were able to get this working really
awesome me too because I will say that
there are several things that have kept
me
conflicted about being wholeheartedly
Linux as much as I want to
keep that like in my heart there are
certain things specifically steam which
is now actually coming blended it's
coming the Linux gaming that's been
completely saying video editing and I
have tried every video editor on the
open source platforms and there is
nothing unfortunately video editors
don't look so good with neckbeards it
turns out or it so says Paul or editor
looks ok anyway so I will so anyway I've
been debating playing with other stuff
experimenting with the dark side
recently point being another huge
contingency of running like Linux will
hardly is Netflix and that's been an
ongoing issue for years ok so for the
longest time Netflix actually hasn't
worked on Linux and why well because of
dr. M dr. M DRM digital rights
management oh my god I see Netflix
relies on Microsoft's Silverlight it's a
pretty where application framework and
it basically enables rich apps kind of
like flash and this is like a free
runtime released by Microsoft back in
like 2007 it's been updated five times
since then an open source implementation
was actually done with support from
Microsoft by the mono team but the
project was abandoned because there was
like well let's just say it there's
really pathetic acceptance for
Silverlight period plus there's
proprietary restrictions so many
actually speculate that silver light
will go on them you know go end-of-life
or go by the wayside and for many of us
Netflix is really the only reason for
its existence still they are previously
a bunch of dirty hacks that people have
attempted to get Netflix running on
Linux through like wine or the consensus
kind of was for the longest time well
just simply run a Windows virtual
machine and then you can stream video
but yeah but that's a crappy workaround
yeah well the one you need a Windows
license to you're now running Windows so
you're gonna have to like you know wash
yourself a lot and three you're running
Windows and that's on your network now
yeah as a computer been possessed by
evil demons I don't know look in the
bottom left do you see little things to
start I guess that doesn't apply anymore
nope because the Start menu
Kaycee hello anyway it's the Aki
solution however finally there's a great
solution by Eric Hoover who has put
together a nice little package to
actually get Netflix going on Linux
without the need for a VM rather
actually using wine so wine other than
being that awesome thing that
Californians make it's not an emulator
extra stands for wine is not an emulator
it's an application that lets you run
Windows programs in Linux and it's
pretty cool because it does so by
actually duplicating the functionality
in Windows so when Windows programs call
like api's and dll's basically it has
replacements for those Linux equivalents
so that's pretty cool
so basically Windows programs can run
and it's kind of a crapshoot but gen
we'll get into how to make that a little
bit better not have to go into the whole
dependency hell thing so what we all
love dependency how it's really nice
about this is it used to be quite a bit
I mean this is only broken in the last
week and it was before like you had to
compile all this stuff now there's just
a repository so if you're in like you
know Debbie and we're going to this is a
really easy thing to do
first of all sudo apt-get install wine
get yourself the latest version of that
and then all you have to do is add a
repository of PPA from Eric Hoover and
once you update you'll be able to
install the packages called
Netflix - desktop so there's a couple of
problems I've run into with that in that
if you don't set everything up
beforehand you might run into some
issues like so make sure that you get
wine installed beforehand make sure that
you actually open Firefox before you try
to install this so basically what this
package does is it installs a version of
Firefox that's already set up with
Silverlight all ready to go and it's
kind of like self-contained so you're
running the open source yet windows
binary version of Firefox in wine that
has Silverlight so there is already
proprietary stuff in there so you know
this isn't for the this isn't for your
gen 2 crowd that doesn't want anything
you know proprietary right however this
does work now there's also and I'll have
a huge list in the show notes because
you know there's all these little
workarounds you still have to do as far
as installing fonts and things like that
always there is but this is a much
better solution I mean I was able to get
this running like ten minutes yeah so
with all of that said once you have this
all done basically you can run Netflix -
desktop and what's going to happen is
you'll get a full screen this is
actually a Firefox running here and it's
running in full screen if I hit f11 mmm
there we go
ah come back you can see it's actually
wine program leather there we go okay so
it's kind of porky well no it's it
starts fullscreen I didn't wait for it
to load it's actually here's my top ten
I can start watching Star Trek and that
would be awesome how come more
Battlestar Galactica which would be
almost as awesome in a different way and
now I can actually start watching some
Netflix goodness up in my Linux well I
want to see you actually play a video on
there I know like anything for it but
it's going to be a little weird because
what I'm doing in this instance is
you're this window right here it says
Mozilla Firefox on the top left and this
is just a Firefox window a Windows
executable of Firefox running with wine
in Linux and to make matters worse I'm
actually running Linux in Windows this
is actually a virtual machine so for
that reason it's not working the
greatest as far as sound and playback
it's a lot it's pretty choppy but that's
only because I'm running this in a
virtual machine so I've got an emulated
Windows environment and it'll work just
fine yes okay yeah and so once I switch
over to dual the situation with this new
laptop then I'll be able to show it on
the bare metal Linux on this one
actually we'll talk about it in a couple
weeks I got a fun little thing that I'm
doing with Linux on this machine and
anyway we'll get into that later but but
that's it and and so that's pretty cool
because now you're able to do that which
before was only thwarted by DRM yeah and
this isn't actually the first time that
DRM playback on linux has actually
caused a stir back in nineteen
9 you may remember that a Norwegian
programmer by the name of John Denison
have you remembered this but he found
himself on the other end of a massive
legal lawsuit because of this program
called DCSS and this was a program that
decrypted commercially produced DVDs and
in that case the DVD CCA they were the
organization that was like you know
responsible for licensing the encryption
stuff you know hit him hard with this
like lawsuit about oh it violates WIPO
treaty and how DSD CSS can be used for
copyright infringement and it's a it's a
fun rich story I remember it being like
one of the first times that I got really
into your rights online yeah over a
decade ago and it's it at that time it
caused a huge stir and almost set some
precedents in courts so it's a good read
if you're interested in that kind of
stuff to see all of this has happened
again and all of it will happen it will
happen again it's called the eternal
return actually that's actually a kind
of Eastern philosophy kind of thing so
anyway that's another really good thing
to read on your own time anyway what I'm
interested in is what this is going to
spur in the industry because yeah fun to
see how Netflix responds you know as
Shannon demonstrated a few weeks ago
there's actually no technical reason why
Linux why Netflix can't run on Linux I
mean Verdun since few weeks ago Jenna
was hacking the Netgear NeoTV and that
was just a Linux powered set-top box
when it's Linux box I just happen to
jailbreak it but you can run Linux on it
just fine Netflix on it yeah Netflix and
so we had a Netflix binary on the that
little embedded Linux box yeah so you
know I think that if Netflix wants to
not have a huge PR nightmare they should
go ahead and embrace this course or come
out with something I know that there's
like a lot of technical fun when it
comes to actually getting digital rights
management what should they
contractually have to do you know they
have to give it a best effort or
whatever as far as their licensing of
this content is concerned so this could
actually mean a lot of like rockiness
for Netflix as relationships with their
content
providers if they don't take appropriate
steps it really is going to depend on
how they actually interpret how this is
running if this is like you know they
have no problem with like oh well you
run a Windows virtual machine in your
Linux box to run Netflix so that doesn't
violate anything yeah and so it'll be
interesting to see if Netflix goes all
like you know Metallica on this or not I
really hope they don't cuz there's just
like what you said there's no reason why
it shouldn't work on Linux it's you're
still paying for your subscription with
Netflix you're just trying to get it in
every way that you can yes what's the
issue here we're all paying our brother
or uncle or that neighbor right let us
have that password for the Netflix yes I
guess we should probably mention that
they have been a sponsor in the past
they have yeah yeah yeah they were
definitely a sponsor and I had quite a
few of my siblings use the hack 5 key oh
yeah two week free trial oh I thought
you were gonna say your password for
your Netflix account they don't let you
do that no I don't let them do that yeah
anyway so with all of that said I'm
really interested to hear what you guys
think is this a solution is this a
workaround
do you think that Linux that Netflix is
gonna fight back
and or do you even care or have you
moved on and you're like you know what
if you don't embrace it I'm not even
down with it you know just not let
Netflix know about it yeah I think I
think they know how to Google hopefully
okay well with all that said feedback a
high-five better let us know and we're
gonna take a quick break but when we get
back it's more wine it's time for more
wine its we can slur a while and tell
you about Linux
you guys have heard me raving about ting
recently on hak5 and I'm so happy to
report that so many hak5 viewers are
already taking advantage of their
customer first approach to the sell
market you're not familiar with ting
it's out new service that brings clarity
usability and major savings to the
mobile phone users they've got really
one simple plan it's so great
get this honest pricing megabytes
minutes text messages they're all billed
separately so if you use more than you
just pay for the next year there's no
ridiculous fees and if you use less
you're credited the difference there's
no BS I know I'm taking my existing
phone over there I'm so excited
so check out hack 5 ting comm and check
out their online savings calculator you
really get a sense of like whoa this
could be majorly less expensive than my
current plan so get this your first
month of service just for being a hack 5
viewer you can get $75 off your first
month all you have to do is go to hack
5.10 comm and it'll automatically be
applied so go there check it out really
cool service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
