by domain.com hey guys Shannon Morse
here from RSA conference 2013 and I
found iron key by omission this is chris
Louie who is showing me their brand new
software Chris it is great to see you
today how are you doing today doing well
how about yourself dude alright thank
you now you guys I know a little bit
about iron key but for anybody that
doesn't tell me a little bit about the
history of the company sure so iron key
was started by a grant from the
Department of Homeland Security and our
goal was to make the world's most secure
flash drive and we succeeded in doing
that that's awesome now I am pretty
familiar with some of the older flash
drives that you guys have implemented
but what is new this year well we have
this year is actually our iron key
workspace device this is a completely
bootable option it has windows 8 and it
takes advantage of the feature called
windows to go that was recently
introduced in Windows you know it's
about time they started including that
I've been doing little boot letters
forever on my flash drives and half the
time they break it's nice to finally
have that easily included in Windows 8
yeah that's right and it's a feature
that's been highly requested before and
now it's officially certified and
licensed by Microsoft so is your
specific ironkey workspace also
certified by Microsoft yes this is the
ironkey workspace w300 product we are
Microsoft Certified we offer the fastest
read and write speeds of any microsoft
certified device up to four hundred
megabyte read and 325 megabyte right wow
that's super fast and now is this I'm
assuming it's USB 3.0 act yes in order
to be a microsoft certified you have to
be USB 3.1 out now tell me a few of the
specs like do I have to run a super fast
computer to be able to use this guy the
beauty of this is you can plug it into
any computer that's certified for
windows 7 or windows 8 and it'll just
run the drivers are already on the
device you just plug it in boot from USB
and you're ready to go all right I'm
gonna ask you a secret can I use this
with my linux computer and like my mac
at home as long as the hardware will
support Windows 7 or Windows 8 you can
plug it in it it'll boot it may not be
certified by Microsoft but it'll do now
who's your target market for this guy
we're targeting mobile workers disaster
recovery solutions and compliance issues
where users have to use separate
workspaces but share
same hardware and does this new flash
where I've have all the nice security
that's included with all the iron keys
products yes we offer a variety of
products we have an entire family of
work space products anywhere from
software encryption all the way up to
phipps level three certified hardware
encryption ok what kind of specific
encryption is included it uses the AES
256-bit encryption which is the current
government standard for encrypting data
very very nice nice and unbreakable I
love it now how much does it cost and
where can people find more so the device
will retail some for about a hundred
dollars and if you'd like to know more
go to our website which is wwan key calm
awesome thank you so much Chris budding
entrepreneurs startups and innovators
are all turning ideas into realities
online back by the strength of a dotnet
domain name dot net is globally known
it's one of the world's most popular
domain extensions a dotnet domain name

of building their web presence around
a.net domain name already have a dot-com
purchase the corresponding dotnet and
protect your online brand is the dot-com
that you want already taken and you
don't want to register a dot-com domain
name that's like 20 characters long
the.net is a perfect alternative you can
find a new dotnet domain at domain.com I
like domain com because they're

ninety-nine a year they're reliable and

coupon code hak5 and when you think
domain names think domain.com
as Darren would usually say it's time
once again to check port 110 this week
Paul says I started playing with n CFS
to encrypt and hide sensitive data
locally only a few days before seeing
that week show after putting on my
private stuff away he runs fuse mount
tak you with the folder path for example
in our example it's tilde ford / private
to unmount the decrypted folder that way
it just looks empty as i mentioned when
we did our first one on restart now at
first glance it's going to pass right
over it so even if you do make the
mistake of leaving your computer logged
in and unattended or your login is
correct all your sensitive data will be
nicely hidden away and not asking to be
peered through although you need to make
sure your encryption folder is hidden
and everything at least to the untrained
eye is gone now it's probably newbie
tricks but it's handy newbie tricks no
thanks Shannon and I should say that
Paul you bring up an interesting point
and you know I will not poopoo obscurity
because I think that you know it's fun
like when I was a kid I used to actually
create what is it like folders inside of
like I don't know / windows system32 and
it would name the folder and alt
character code alt 0126 I think that's
what it was it looked like our alt 160 I
think it was yeah it would look like a
space but it wasn't a space it was a
null character and if you tried to open
the folder it would give you an error
because windows explorer didn't support
that particular character which was a
really cool thing although you can still
get there if you opened up the command
prompt to navigate there through daus
and then do start space dot it would you
know so it never rely on that for your
security and I think that using n
capacity encryption FS is still a great
first step and there i guess i would say
there's nothing wrong with adding that
kind of stuff on top of it but don't
rely on that because you know you say
walking away from your computer well
consider cold food attacks your
encryption key is active you know now
some people would say that that's
theoretical but you know i don't know
what what do you have on there that's
that interesting that somebody had run
off with your laptop freezer ram and
recover
ki or you know same thing could be said
about you know using encryption and then
sending setting your laptop to go into
sleep mode or suspend instead of like
you're properly shutting it down so all
things to consider either way very cool
using ntfs and I look forward to hearing
what you guys think as well so as always
feedback attack five organ work and from
Amsterdam I'm gonna hand it back to you
