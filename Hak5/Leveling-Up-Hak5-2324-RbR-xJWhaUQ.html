tape measure and an HP palmtop
we're finding out today on payload
actually I aligned we're not gonna do
any of that I still need a haircut
good morning internet that crying in the
background is a puppy that woke me up at
6:00 a.m. and have been up ever since I
didn't get any sleep because sab
messaged me in the middle of the night
because his middle of the night is my
middle of the afternoon or the inverse
thereof note to self
put your phone on silent before you
sleep I was gonna do a K read ultra re
hacks video today with some PowerShell
that does really nifty stuff but we're
gonna have to save that for next week in
the meantime if you haven't had one of
these crimes are from my grandma in
South Africa they're amazing so seeing
as I don't even have time to set up this
guy we're just gonna take this guy we're
gonna have fun today I'm taking you
along with me pH I'm just going to the
hardware store I'll be back I may just
be saying this because I'm a new puppy
dad for the first time ever but this
girl peach here father the smartest dog
that ever existed hardware store
there we go rg6 I got a love that just
brick-and-mortar stores in the United
States or at least in California they
want to check your receipt when you
leave the doors if you stole something
all you have to do here at least is just
walk out and say no thank you Azul
someone going to daycare peach
what's that what's that oh yeah puppies
like five trucks
so we're in downtown Oakland now heading
it to the cockfight warehouse in
Richmond and only way we're gonna drop
off Beach puppy daycare there with other
puppies I guess at some point you can
play without the bells you need to do
more vaccines or no anti-vaxxers you
know one minute you're knocking across
the planet the next you're taking a
puppy to daycare well you come up with
your own conclusions
so I've come here to a sort of sketchy
side of Richmond because this is chapter
marker in life if you will
longtime viewers of hak5 know that we
actually started in Virginia and at one
point when things didn't really work out
I got a friend dave randolph reaches out
to me and said hey dude you can stay
with me here and right here I'm Barron
Hardaway in Richmond California pretty
much sold off everything that I owned
and got on the motorcycle and headed one
way west on that hack across America
adventure you can find uh vlogs from
2010 on YouTube there but along the way
you know having absolutely nothing but a
dream and a buck in my pocket I asked
you guys the audience to help me out
along the way and I had you know just
hundreds of people sign up to put me up
for the night and help me along the way
to get out here and it's just like the
story of my life it warms my heart so
much I can't tell you how grateful I am
to be here today because of that and to
Dave for putting me up in this joint
here because it allowed hak5 to get
where it is today to shoot out of that
garage was just so much fun and after
about a year there we were able to
finally move on to something a little
cooler let's check that out
this was the next major milestone for
hack five this chapter saw everything
from the Wi-Fi pineapple mark three to
the mark five to the USB rubber ducky
this old firehouse from like 1905 I just
remember being so scared going into this
place thinking oh my god hack fives a
business now and we have a lease even
though it was like month to month and a
bucket where foot but still you know
this was the era where you know Shannon
moved out to California and and the hak5
really came into its own I feel like
also the little town of Point Richmond
is like Main Street USA you got like
children running the streets and stuff
you can literally skateboard down Main
Street it's no big deal I love this
place there's this chapter the warehouse
when the firehouse got too small for us
it was really just luck that this popped
up the same week we were able to just
move just down the street to a pretty
rad warehouse
of course there's a lot of changes going
on right now and the warehouse isn't as
cool as it used to be but this is the
place that allowed us to do pen test
with act 5 so much more Hey look there's
Josette the cb750 that got me to
California as you might imagine shutting
down a warehouse is no small feat and
along the way you find all sorts of
interesting weird stuff like this weird
out pad your what you doing I'm sorting
getting rid of things contemplating my
future this one does is this is this him
to keep pile Tommy that's in the keep
pile this is in the keep pile ok
anything related to raspberry PI's and
single board computers as always
the world's worst Apple created adapter
probably not in the campus is that a
30-pin yes it's a lightning to 30-pin
one of the least functional adapters
ever it spun some more legacy stuff 6.22
was the best really I don't know I might
have a timer
III was I just had to try them both you
never know and which one did you settle
with Red Hat anybody need a mouse and
this one does a serial and ps2 and it
says it works with Windows 95 here I I
got you an upgrade oh yeah
add that to your single board computer
collection find a working mother boy
where's the mother I love that it's a
cartridge you know how you make these
work better oh I was gonna say I learned
that from my Nintendo days this was a
mistake
cartridge at CPUs it wasn't a mistake
yeah it was an obscure to make everybody
get new motherboards from the next
generation of processor and then they
went to something else and you had to
get another motherboard and then they
went to something else and you know what
all those motherboards have in common
you always have to go to something else
yes another Intel chipsets yeah sockets
I mean slots slots yeah yeah okay yeah
yeah I got that report you asked for
it's uh
there you go good were the other five
disks to make the spreadsheet complete
that's true that's terrif it's a
microsoft access as well no visicalc you
physically remembered so I always love
rolling with my portable operating
system and was das dude you got to get
the one with high memory in your config
sis I got an auto x-dot that that'll
have your machine running three times as
fast
oh wait wait wait hang on hang up dude
this is not a regular dis oh oh that's
cool
I think somebody made this for us hey
it's a USB Drive let's just plug it in
that was actually my first operating
system oh this is 95 this is the one
with USB support I hear hey I hear
that's gonna catch on my my such weird
stuff this is a cup from revision3 back
when that was a thing tekzilla and filly
to Franco and this right here that is a
prototype of the mark-5
way before the mark-5 that's a prototype
of a mark three and that's four well
that's just for fun this is actually
that hack across America's tour I was
talking about but started here in
Virginia and just kind of zig zagging
around and eventually got to the bay it
was very sad that I ran out of West look
DV tapes
this right here is season 2 episode 1
that's how many DV tapes it took to make
an episode so crazy on the Metasploit
minute this week we will discuss
cracking at a level that you have never
seen before the spare computers this is
insane
this is like 40 laptops the pentest
attack five oh my god that is the
coolest DEFCON badge ever I know what
that is - guys this is like the Pentium
thanks Sarah what you got over there
Patrick

[Laughter]
something new from HP came in today
let's see oh my god
Shh Scotty beam me to the enterprise
oh yeah hang on let me uh let me make a
note here I just gotta get my stylus out
and then uh wait this sounded ridiculous
until now all the phones of stylus style
I was stylin I missed the eye pack this
is the HPI pack I have the original
compact I pack yo uh Patrick you need an
ID pack it's got four Meg's of RAM what
say what is leaving the warehouse mean
to you yeah somebody get her a fork Oh
guys spectacle fest I don't know y'all
know it's a shame this happens almost
every year so a little sad saying
goodbye to a place like this I mean this
was basically home for the longest time
I built so many drones here there were
so many good times to be had but
sometimes you just got to embrace the
change all the cool stuff that's coming
next Hey ladies
and there goes that by by bike Baba
Josette I'm not gonna lie I'm really
sentimental about this bike and it's
tough to see her go that's all I can say
and suddenly like that it's empty what
break
