responses androids doomed you can do
security 46 million dollars stolen via
email all that more coming up on threat
wire greetings everybody I'm Patrick
Norton and I am back here in the hack
warehouse after Def Con 23 and this is
threat wire for august 10 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom a huge
thanks to everyone watching the show and
supporting us at patreon.com / threat
wire so 18 months after they report a
flaw and Chryslers you connect
entertainment system security
researchers Charlie Miller and Chris
valasek shoot a youtube video with a
wired reporter inside a Jeep Cherokee
they take over on the highway remotely
wirelessly it's pretty scary video goes
public Chrysler decides to release a
patch on USB stick claims the remote
access laws have been shut down on the
network side the video goes ridiculously
viral and Chrysler suddenly issues a
recall on 1.4 million vehicles with the
UConnect 8.4 inch touchscreen systems
and then they tell the press the only
learned about the hack specifics a month
before by the way Chrysler just agreed
to a 105 million dollar penalty for its
performance on earlier recalls let's
contrast that with what happened at Def
Con last week Kevin behalf Aditi CEO of
security firm lookout and clouds fair
security researcher mark Rogers showed
that they could remotely shut down to
test the model s but only after they'd
had physical access and pulled apart the
dashboard to get it they could shut down
the motors but hey check it out Tesla
set it up so they can't shut down the
steering so you still have some control
over the vehicle on stage with those
guys well be Straubel Tesla's CTO who
thanked them for finding the
vulnerabilities and announced at Tesla's
bug bounty now maxes out at ten grand
and let the flaws have already been
patched by Tesla's over-the-air update
system quick note 2 car manufacturers
you might not be as nimble as Tesla but
you better start thinking more seriously
about automotive security meanwhile in
the wake of androids stage fright
vulnerability the one that impacts
ninety-five percent of Android devices
where a malicious video mms can execute
code well ARS technica is pointing out
Android's update system is a giant bag
of suck that it doesn't work that it
can't really respond to serious security
issues that Android is doomed or to
sound a tad more sophisticated google
samsung and LG's fix is going to be a
patch on two-point-six percent of all
active Android devices tops that's the
percentage of devices running Android 51
right now as opensignal pointed out and
it's android fragmentation visualized
report last week open signals seen over
24,000 distinct Android devices roughly
seventy eight percent of which runs some
flavor of Android for dot something aka
KitKat unfortunately most LMS and
carriers don't care much about Android
updates for devices that aren't
currently on sale and care even last for
non flagship phones and updates are of
course controlled and gated by the
carrier's who will often take months to
release patches for known flaws that
irritate all their customers Google told
ARs after the article went live that
quote currently ninety percent of
Android devices have a technology called
a SLR enabled which helps protect users
from this issue and that the next
release of messenger also contains a fix
that helps mitigate the issue at the
application level by requiring the user
to click on videos before playing them
and that they recommend that jelly bean
and above users switch their default SMS
app for additional protection oh my
goodness neither of which of course
impact the simple fact that it is just
about impossible to get serious security
updates out to all the Android devices
on the planet brace for impact people
and from the cyber theft doesn't have to
be incredibly technically sophisticated
Department Krebs on security has a
write-up on ubiquiti networks they make
really amazing Wi-Fi network devices
they lost 46 million dollars thanks to
quote employee impersonation and
fraudulent requests from an outside
entity targeting the company's finance
department like that's what they told
the shareholders called CEO fraud or
business email compromise Krebs says
quote it's an increasingly common one
targeting businesses working with
foreign suppliers and or businesses that
regularly perform wire transfer payments
the tool of choice fishing for access to
the right
executives mailbox or creating look like
email addresses and sending requests to
the finance folks that handle the money
and make the wire transfers Krebs says
the FBI's advisory on these scams urges
businesses to adopt two step or two
factor authentication for email where
available and or to establish other
communication channels such as telephone
calls to verify significant transactions
bec committee has gotten back less than
seven million of the money lost and
expects to pretty much permanently lose
around 31 million dollars ow before I go
I want to give a huge thanks to everyone
who supported the show so far on patreon
our plan is to do threat wire three
times a week that's our milestone goal
with a rotation of Darren kitchen
Shannon Morrison myself do us a favor
the only way we can do that without
advertisers is if you contribute to
patreon.com/scishow or a subscribe go a
long way to you can find all our
episodes link to our social networks and
other ways to contribute over at threat
wire net with that i'm patrick norton
and i'll see you on the internets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
