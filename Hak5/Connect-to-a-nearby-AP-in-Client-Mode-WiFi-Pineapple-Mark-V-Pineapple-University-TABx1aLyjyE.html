hello and welcome to pineapple
university i'm darren kitchen and in
this video we're going to talk about a
fun new feature unique to the Wi-Fi
pineapple mark 5 and that is client mode
now up until now we've talked about
connecting your Wi-Fi pineapple either
to a Linux or a Windows machine over a
wired Ethernet connection which is great
however for remote deployments you may
want to have your pineapple somewhere
discreet and connected to a nearby
access point and what's beautiful about
the mark-5 is that since we do have both
of these radios on the board we can
actually use the second radio to connect
to a nearby access point as a client I'm
going to demonstrate that now so I've
already connected to this pineapple over
the Ethernet simply by just plugging the
ethernet cable into my laptop and I've
navigated to the pineapple website at
172 1640 2.1 colon 1471 and i can see
that my pineapple does not have internet
connection internet access here now if I
click on show next to internet IP says
Eric connecting it does not have an
internet connection because I haven't
set it up in this case since it's over
Ethernet I would do it with the WP 5
script in Linux but suffice it to say
this thing is offline let's get it
online over its wireless connection here
I'm going to click into network and I'm
going to go over to client mode this
collects the list of nearby networks and
in just a moment I'll use this drop-down
to choose a nearby network I'm going to
choose Risa that's network here and I
see the bssid of it see the SSID what
channel is running on the security type
the signal strength I see I have great
quality 70 out of 70 here so simply a
matter of giving it the password for
this since it is a wpa2 PSK network and
click connect to this network that's
going to spin
and if I look over here at my pineapple
this is really exciting you'll notice
that I have three LEDs green for power
yellow for or amber for Ethernet blue is
for the access point radio and red now
that just came on is for the client mode
radio so anytime that the realtek which
is what we use is w LAN one that's our
radio that we can use for client mode we
can use it for raw frame injection or
other kinds of fun Wi-Fi attacks this is
going to blink red when we have activity
and so as we can see we have all of them
lit now and if I come back over to my
pineapple interface I can scroll down
here and actually see that I'm connected
to Risa and I have a great signal
strength and I can see that I have
packets going through here and I've got
an IP address and I can close this out
here and go back over to network where
it's said IP address I'm going to
refresh this and click show and there we
go I'm now online so it's as simple as
that and now whenever this Wi-Fi
pineapple is within range of that
network it's going to automatically
connect disconnecting is simply a matter
of going over back to network client
mode and down here under connection
information simply click disconnect so
with that I'd like to encourage you all
to visit us over at you need Wi-Fi
pineapple comm for more videos like
these as well as other lessons and of
course links to the forums and IRC
chatroom I'll be there but until then
class dismissed
