by Netflix
it's time once again to check port 53
because we're getting our email over DNS
today to dig it alright so this question
is from Tom he asks I have seen many
times you do the LS command and Linux
but I've always been wondering why
you're probably thinking what a funny
question right well I am new to Linux
and even worse I am self-taught so my
question is why use LS command when L
does the same thing yeah good point if I
do an LS here you'll see that there are
my files if I do an L you'll see they're
awesome my files but the command is
actually LS and if you're a veteran to
bash and let me say right off the bat
there's nothing wrong with Mike's being
self-taught I would probably tell you
that like 99% of the your fellow peers
watching are also self-taught and that's
the way to do it I think you know I mean
like is you - you didn't go to school
for this no I mean like I went to school
they taught me some of this stuff but
honestly I kind of taught I could have
taught some of those classes and then at
the same time you'll pick up a little
nugget here and there and it's really
all about sharing and experimenting and
sound like a hippie but that's like the
whole her thing though it really is like
ask anyone in iti think I mean you can't
you can teach it right you can you can
make be Totti you can get an MC se but
do you know there's a difference between
like being able to learn and being able
to like understand right anyway so that
aside in your regular in your home
directory so if I just do CD I'm in my
home directory I'm gonna cat this file
here called dot bash RC and in here
you'll see that we have a bunch of these
aliases and the one in question here
alias
l equals LS taxi F so by entering L and
hitting Enter
you're doing the same thing is running
LS taxi F if you liked LS Tech la I like
that one or lah or LRT those are all
good options you could just change this
right in your bash RC file there are the
ones I've seen a bunch of times like
people put like H for history when those
are really just that's aliases it's that
simple and so you can come up with your
own commands like dir if you're coming
from dass and you don't want have to
type LS yeah
so very interesting which I actually
have I just checked that
so I'm us already and you know I think
those are really says that just come by
default and and and I think it's like I
see the I see the reason why you would
want to use an alias but at the same
time I kind of like to like tend towards
using just the actual command because we
would go from system to system to system
and then suddenly what you needed isn't
there and you freak out and it's like
why I use my instead of man oh yeah cuz
like a lot of times like just go with
the basics yeah that's me thank you Tom
this next question is from Kim she asks
I was reading upgrade your life by Becky
Worley on where you should never do
online baking I also read another
article a while back that claims a
person who wants to protect their online
account info can set up a virtual
connection is this really safe or do you
know of another way to protect your
online account info I do a lot of
traveling so I need to log on to my bank
account often okay this is so great I
have to grab this from my office I've
got one right here alright so the
virtual connection she's talking about
is a Virtual Private Network and I don't
know what it is with talking to like
when I was talking to CBS and they were
like wow how do you protect yourself
some something like this and I'm like
well don't use Wi-Fi yeah it's a
horrible answer actually better answer
is like bring your own encryption you
know like your yeah public network SSH
tunnel VPN and so they just call it a
virtual connection it's like do you even
they totally missed about but but this
if I this is a private network it's a
USB virtual private network you plug it
in and now you're safe sure tell that to
your boss now now you have a VPN led1 a
USB and call it a day but you know
honestly this office
well no it's because the media just once
like this you know there the traditional
not the traditional media once this kind
of like answer they can just like throw
here and they're just like Oh get a VPN
and unfortunately that doesn't translate
well to consumers because it's still
kind of you know they get so confused so
easily with the personal confuses and
all that you know but I'm hard to
understand
guys no you know SSH tunnel get yourself
a VPN but if I tried to explain this to
my mom she would not get it I know and
that's well that's why it's good for
hackers but bad for consumers and that's
why you should kind of be a little bit
of both yeah but but yeah I think that's
what she was trying to say is a VPN I
like witopia I've been using that
especially on my android phone they got
the l2tp the PPTP all the standard
protocols and SSH tunneling you've been
doing a lot of that with the new
pineapple so yes you know it's just it's
good stuff too when I did that tekzilla
interview with Patrick about the Wi-Fi
pineapple 3 mention those as well the
VPN really important I use just wait
till via 4 just to watch the BBC iPlayer
but I got a lot of time I mentioned that
and anyway we can link in the show notes
to plenty of times that we talk about
tunneling of all sorts to Tory along
