by goto assist I'm all about all those
different kinds of file-sharing services
let's see I've checked out Sparkle share
BitTorrent sync the one from last week
of course and I've also checked out own
cloud now we did get some feedback from
one of our viewers named Alexander about
own cloud and a new one called C file
which I'm going to check out this week
so I want to go ahead and get into his
feedback real quick he states that the
file synchronization and own cloud is
very buggy at times after almost four
years they are still not able to
maintain a stable version or fix errors
in a timely manner and that kind of
stinks not the current shabby state I
really don't feel like paying for own
cloud I feel that C file does a way
better job at synchronizing files than
own cloud has ever done the web
interface is more confusing and there
are far less features in C file than an
own cloud at the moment but at least the
few available features work after the
initial configuration so now it's time
for my own C file review this is my
first time really checking it out and I
definitely wanted to find something
that's not only easy to use on the GUI
side but also has lots of customization
features because we all love to
customize so I'm going to go ahead and
show you what it looks like it's very
easy you just have to download it from
the C file website which is C file comm
and they talk about how they're open
source and everything hopefully they
really are turns out they are that's
probably one of my favorite absolute
pros about this is the fact that they
truly are open source and they have a
very large team of collaborators as well
as a big community who's actually
checked out everything that's going on
on the background to make sure that it's
totally done right so all you have to do
is download it and luckily it is
available for both Windows Mac and Linux
Android and iOS as well so you can view
and be able to sync everything on your
mobile devices as well now once you
download it you get this nice little
icon down here it doesn't even have to
do anything you don't even have to open
any other programs it's just a nice
little icon right here when you click on
this pulls up in a web interface and
this is actually on my local client so I
have a local server running right here
one two seven zero zero
one and then it shows me my C file
client now you can see that I already
have a folder sync called my stuff and
I'm also going to show you what it looks
like from their website as well now you
have the choice to sign up right here
now you do want to sign up on their site
because you do get one gig of free file
synchronization on their on their server
which is pretty nice and it is encrypted
I'll get back to that in just a few
moments now I'll go over to here we go
so once you log on through their website
you can see this which looks pretty
similar to github if you're some
familiar with that as well you'll see
down at the bottom under name I don't
have any file sync right now so I can go
over here and upload something and I can
drag and drop so I'm going to minimize
this and I'm going to go over to let's
see here's my BitTorrent sync I'm going
to just drag and drop that over here
silly picture me and my bro and then
click start and it's going to
automatically upload it and hopefully
sync to there it is now if I go over to
my C file client I'll just refresh this
if I click on my folder in my folder
sync now up there it is so it just
opened up and you'll see that there it
is I already had it open perfect so this
is the folder that it's going to sink to
on my local computer and I can also see
that it sinks into my web browser which
is very very nice now I did mention
encryption see file uses AES 128 bit
encryption and this encryption goes on
in the background no matter when you're
uploading or downloading so everything
that you do on their local service is
encrypted so you're good to go
so once you create your account on their
site you got everything up and running
you got your 1 gig of free space now you
can go ahead and create a new library
now I'll go ahead and do that for you go
to my file and I'll maximize this for
you guys I can create this thing called
a new directory I'll call it
um snubs stuff Smit so now I have this
nice new folder right here what I can do
with this alright so here's the snub
stuff directory not a lot of options
that I have with this I can just delete
rename move and copy it so there's not
too much going on I can also click into
it and create more uploads here or
download whatever I've already uploaded
into it now it can sink a folder on your
computer or on several computers at the
same time and you can also share it with
friends in it you can do either offering
read-only or read/write abilities
there's not anything else that you can
offer whatever you're doing sharing with
family and friends now if I want to
share something for example I want to
share this picture that I just uploaded
which shows up as well in the interface
so I'll close I'll go back I can click
on share right here and I can do either
a private share or a share link and
that's it I can also have the option to
update or download and I can do all the
other delete rename move copy etc etc
now say I want to share an entire folder
that I've created on my a key on my
computer that I've been syncing up to
see cloud what I'll do is go back into
the interface I'll click on my home up
at the top right up here and this is the
folder that I've been playing around in
so I can click on here and either
download and sync the entire thing I can
share it so I can enter email addresses
or a group if I've created a group of
contacts that I've wanted to share it
with and then I can choose whether I
want to read write it or just read-only
so they can only look at the files and
then you click Submit and you close you
also have a couple of other options like
you can set up a payment account if you
want to add additional storage to your
account you can change your profile name
and things such as that nature but one
thing you cannot change is a password
for an encrypted library so one nice
thing about having sea cloud is that you
can change the encryption from library
to library but each time you
do it that password cannot change once
you've actually created it what you can
do which they stayed on their FAQ is
that you can create a new library with a
new password and then you can just copy
files all over to the new one
now if you want to sync via the desktop
client all of that is done locally and
that password can be changed on your
local computer because the password is
also saved locally so let's discuss a
couple of my pros and cons about C files
specifically now my pros on this it's
really easy it's really really fast to
use yes I got to say the interface is a
little bit confusing but that's just
because it's something new it's
something that I got to get used to
it's definitely open source it's checked
by the community definite pro now on the
con side yeah there's not a lot of
customization options or features for
example one thing you can do an own
cloud is sync a calendar that's not
available in C file you can create a
your own server version of C file to on
your own Linux server which is also a
nice Pro as well so I have to say of the
4 or 5 that I checked out C files
definitely one of my top favorites along
with probably BitTorrent sync that one's
also really really nice on the down side
probably I'd say own cloud yet it's a
little bit buggy so it's definitely not
one of my favorites Anna I would like to
see some more capabilities built into it
you know that actually work now that
about wraps it up for my segment but
make sure an email me feedback at hak5
org let me know what you think of C file
is it one of your favorites do you
actually use it let me know and we'll be
right back after a quick break
more and more people are working from
the cloud using different devices
bringing their own devices to work
working from anywhere I mean if you're
an IT supporting all of these clients
all of these employees it can be
absolutely challenging and this is why I
highly recommend go to assist by Citrix
I mean it is an easy-to-use based
platform so you can assist anyone

integrated toolset including a Service
Desk to track and log these incidents
remote support so you can quickly

entire IT infrastructure taking fix
those problems before your boss is
calling you about the exchange server
nobody ever wants to hear that call so
with go to assist you're gonna be

tools you can adapt to your customers
