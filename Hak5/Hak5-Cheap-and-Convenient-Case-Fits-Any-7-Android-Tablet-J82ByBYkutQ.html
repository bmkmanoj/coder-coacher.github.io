2013 Ford Fusion the official car of CES
for hak5 I'm Darrin kitchen here at CES
2012 and I just found another case but
it's not for iPhone it's actually for
Android and if you're an Android fan
like me you might really like this okay
now you know what here's the thing I've
seen a lot of ridiculous stuff here I've
seen like 80 inch TVs that I will never
own I've seen internet standards that
are great but it's just it's even in the
ether it's whatever you know and this
this is actually a cheap thrill that I
kinda won it's only $30 and right here
we're looking at an Android case for
7-inch Android tablets I know there's
plenty of them on the market right here
this one is actually from max West and I
just kind of like the design it feels
really sturdy and what I really like
about it in addition to ok you know
we've got a nice little stand here and a
clip in it and it just has these little
teeth that will just kind of clamp on to
your Android device so you know whether
it's a Kindle Fire or whatever you may
have as long as it has USB you get a
nice little keyboard with it and the
keyboard feels just like the keyboard on
my old EPC 701 which is so near and dear
to my heart I love my netbook at the
time now I carry around an Android
tablet and I still miss having a
keyboard and while I've looked at a lot
of little Bluetooth ones this seems like
a nice package just because you get the
case the keyboard all in one and what I
like about it actually is the fact that
it's over USB and not over Bluetooth so
there's nothing to bet no batteries to
change or anything like that of course
it does mean that your Android tablet
must have like USB host mode and and
sometimes you may have to have like a
dongle that will take microUSB B 2
female USB a but no matter if it does
work what's nice about it is just a
generic head it does have some
interesting keys here and it will say
this being like a very cheap like $30
product and it's not perfect but it's
inexpensive and it'll probably get the
job done like for example the zze key
here is actually the home button oh well
whatever anyway that is o2
Menten has a stylist yes 1990 called and
it wants a stylist back anyway can for
continued coverage of all thanks to es
head over to revision three.com slash
CES you'll find some more cheap thrills
and ridiculous stuff and of course we'd
like to thank Ford for powering our CES
coverage the 2013 Ford Fusion will come
with an available EcoBoost engine that
has two main characteristics turbo
charging and direct injection this
provides more power and better fuel
economy than similar displacement non
turbo fuel injected engines the 1.6
liter is expected to be the fuel economy
leader in the class the 2.0 liter
EcoBoost is the performance option
thanks to Ford in the 2013 Ford Fusion
