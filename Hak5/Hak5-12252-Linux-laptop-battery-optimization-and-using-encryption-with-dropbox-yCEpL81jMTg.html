by goto assist
now whose responsibility is it to secure
all that that you put up on the cloud
you put on the cloud again oh yeah
alright
like a monkey fling and poo like your
cat photo but you have to encrypt them
flinging poo that's that's the best kind
of pills encrypted to encrypt all the
things so this segment it's all about
encryption up in the cloud or do you
want to encrypt on your computer or
sending it out doesn't SpiderOak already
encrypt for you isn't that the whole
point of Spyder yes yes it does
I have only trust on them don't we trust
Spiderwick I mean are you saying it
should you should you think should you
actually trust whoever it is that you're
you're putting all your sensitive data
up with because it's their servers they
have access to all their encryption so
if they aren't hashing and salting
everything correctly they could gain
potentially gain access to all your
stuff so what you really want to do is
just trust no one and we've all heard of
tno trust no one you want to make sure
that you are encrypting everything
before you put it up in the cloud so you
want to have that encryption key on your
computer instead of their computer I
love it all right so how do we do this
is this just a mean you're talking
encryption so obviously this is just a
Linux thing it's gonna be it's gonna be
impossible to do on your windows box
this is really gonna suck for syncing
across platforms right so we found these
directions over on how to geek and it
turns out that there's a little tool
called NC FS or NTFS depending on who
you are and how you want to say it and
it's just a it's just a command-line
daemon that runs in the background of
your machine every time that you log on
just for Linux just for Linux Oh in
Windows actually a man is getting at and
Android that's what's up yes I put it on
my computer at home as well on my
Windows machine see the thing and that
has a GUI if you can make it convenient
then people will use security exactly so
let's show me how convenient this is so
first of all of course you just do sudo
apt-get install and it's called en CFS
like that so it's already installed on
my machine
it's our universe virgin gosh what are
you doing lady crazy person so once you
have it installed the next thing that
you want to do is actually create the
new directories for it so it's going to
create an encrypted file for each file
that you upload this is different from
TrueCrypt containers so if you're
familiar with a container on TrueCrypt
what you do is you create a whole volume
and you upload that to Dropbox or
SpiderOak or wherever you have it and
every time you make a change in that
volume whether it's just one file or ten
files it has to re-upload the entire
thing because it's changed the entire
volume you could imagine if it was a
hundred Meg volume of your cat photos
you changing one cat photo and going up
and it's going to take up a lot of your
data if you have some kind of cat and if
we've learned anything from Ted Stevens
it's not a big truck you not something
you just dump something on it's a series
of tubes before those kittens and
they're gonna take longer
gonna take longer to get up there
exactly so in confess or NC FS does this
differently it does a separate encrypted
file for each file that you want to
upload to Dropbox or SpiderOak or what
have you
so only re-uploads of that one file are
going to change instead of having the
entire container change so to install
this on your boon to machine and it is a
little bit different for other versions
of Linux but I have a gun to go to so
I'll do this one you just put in in CFS
and then do a tilde for home put in
Dropbox slash encrypted and crater and
you want to create another volume called
private it's going to ask you if you
want to create a new directory for
encrypted inside your Dropbox folder you
tell it yes and do you want to create a
new one for private yes you do now it
also says it's creating new encrypted
volume please choose from one of the
following modes you can either do the
expert mode paranoia mode or if you
believe an empty line it just does the
standard mode now I chose paranoia mode
because it's already aes-256 and
encrypted a standard is a little bit
less than that I think it's
128-bits but if you choose expert mode
you have the ability to change all of
the different configurations so I can do
like Blowfish with AES and cool all the
different ones so just for this I'm just
gonna do paranoia cuz it's good enough
and it tells you 256 bits appear it's
SSL AES and it is salted and it's going
to ask you for some kind of password the
important thing about this is your
password cannot be changed after you to
create it so make sure it's something
that you're going to remember so I made
mine something I won't tell you guys
it's really sure it is a qwe rty totally
knew it there we go ok so once it is
done it just goes back to my regular
prompt so I'll clear this out alright so
now that we've created that what does
that mean to me so I just start throwing
all my stuff in my Dropbox and go
everything into the encrypted fuller and
you're good to go no no you do not so
after you've done all the setup and
everything it's created this encrypted
folder and the private folder private is
where you're going to put everything but
it sounded really wrong gonna put your
thing in the private floor so Dropbox is
going to sink the in encrypted version
in the Dropbox encrypted folder of
anything that you place in the private
folder so you can access the private
folder on your machine and then through
Dropbox you can get into all your
encrypted documents so basically it's
like mounting like a virtual file system
over there it's kind of like a symlink
yes don't touch whatever's in the
Dropbox folder it's just one your
garbage yeah if you put anything into
the encrypted folder if you just like
copy and paste a picture or whatever
it's not going to encrypt it ok so you
want to put everything into the private
folder and that's all that's all so we
can get into it anything that's
decrypted desktop and so I I take it
that I can now likewise you know cuz I
use multiple Linux machines with Dropbox
I could just rerun this command enter
the same password and then it'd be able
to read the files and my encrypted drops
actually yep and another thing I did
want to mention as well you have to run
the in CFS or NC FS command upon restart
and the next time that you log in this
is because it is not actually a part of
your
you're keeping it for gnome but you do
have the option to include that if you
wanted to now I didn't do that but how
do you feel about that well okay so
there is a version for gnome called
gnome - HFS which will add it to your
gnome keyring so then when you log in
with your regular password that also
unlocks your thing I don't know I like
different layers of security I could
imagine
say I don't know why you would ever
leave your machine unattended and logged
in but if you did maybe you perhaps
don't have your cryptid files even
though they don't have the password yeah
so I'm gonna say layer things and this
is this is really cool I mean this is
not oh yeah I'm already getting my
Dropbox on I'm gonna start using this
are you kidding this is freaking
fantastic in fact I used to use a much
more kludge eversion of this what I
would do is upload GPG files literally
just used open GPG to create a encrypted
version of a file with a symmetric key
or something and then upload that to
Dropbox and then hmm I'd have to
download it move it to a different
directory so they're not thinking the
unencrypted version and then you got to
unencrypted that it's like yes this is
really cool I like that it's transparent
once you've got to be set up it's your
private folder and that's it yeah now if
you run into any difficulties when you
restart your machine just make sure to
run that NC FS command again because one
way you can tell if it hasn't been
mounted again after you login is going
into your private folder and not seeing
anything there no no my files are gone
yeah and they're not really you just
have to be log into n ZFS okay so very
easy to use and I put a file into my
private folder and there it is so this
is the that's the garbage file yeah this
is the garbage file in my encrypted
folder they're trashing our rights
inversion if I go back to you my if I go
back home and this is all in Nautilus
just to show you the GUI if there's my
example text file and long live back
five alright so since I'm logged in I
can still get into it and I can still
see what's going on but if I was on a
different computer I could also use NC
FS on that one to get access to hey I'm
so I just set up the command line dam in
for a Dropbox on my machine why don't
you give me your rock
credentials and I'll be able to do it
over here yeah so yeah what's yeah
you're so funny
give her a chocolate bar all right now
when we get back we're going to get into
some of your feedback and by the way if
you have feedback on this where is it
