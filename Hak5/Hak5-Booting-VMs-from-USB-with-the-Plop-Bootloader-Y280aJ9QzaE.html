by t-mobile a few weeks ago I went
through this whole shebang workaround to
get VMware and VirtualBox to boot a USB
bootable device zero knight wrote in
with a fix he said not sure if you know
about this or not but there is a much
easier way to boot a USB Drive in a VM
than the command you showed in hack tip
which I must say it was a really really
long command line it's called plop boot
manager and I was lucky enough to find
it when I was trying to get USB Kitana
working I've had success in both VMware
and VirtualBox with this to use it you
just tell the VM to boot from an ISO and
it will have the option for a USB so I
decided to try it with a little tutorial
now you need a couple of different
things first of all download the zip
file from the plot boot manager website
which is plop 8e next you'll need some
kind of bootable USB flash drive like
this one I have right here that
apparently can move around it's kind of
cool anyway I have Puppy Linux installed
on mine and I made it bootable using
unetbootin which is this free program
that you can just google it it's really
easy to find third download VMware
Player or VirtualBox now for my tutorial
I've gone ahead and used VirtualBox so
first things first I need to open up
VirtualBox there we go
and I need to create some kind of new
virtual machine now you don't have to
change any of the default settings so
you can just click Next Next Next and
then start up the VM so I'm going to go
ahead and start a new test machine
okay create a new machine next and I
will call this plop boot manager next
you hard disk dynamically expending okay
sounds good does it really matter what I
put it is what it would it make the
operating system because it just changes
the icon next thing you need to do is
take a moment and unzip that flop zip
file that you downloaded from their
website earlier now go through the first
start wizard and change all the
installation media over to the plop I so
to do that I just start up the VM first
run wizard I choose my ISO which is
already in there but I'll show you what
it looks like so it's right there hit
open next and type is CD DVD ROM device
and click finish and it should start
with no problems
yay this starts now if I go down to USB
I'm going to have some issues when I try
to open it it's going to give me an
error
okay so I'll hit enter to fix this issue
you first need to close down the VM and
right-click on it and choose settings so
I'm going to properly close it down
close shut down and go into my settings
log now in this menu you'll need to find
the USB choice and click the plus button
over on the corner now it only sees two
of them so I plug this in which even if
I had this plugged in in the first place
it would still give me this error
Plus okay so it's SMI corporation now
you may see several different USB drives
on here and if so a really easy way to
figure out which one is your drive is to
unplug it and see which one disappears
ha very simple after doing this you
click okay so I add that click ok and I
should be able to start up again with no
issues
so after our doing that I clicked okay I
reopen my VM and I should see a little
USB icon at the bottom indicating that
my USB flash drive is seen if not you
can go under devices USB devices and
click your drive so that it has a
checkmark next to it so the USB is right
here it says indicates the activity of
the attached USB device which is the
correct one under devices I can also go
to USB devices and click on s mi
corporation check that for some reason
it seems like every time I do this I
have to restart my computer or wait for
it to and freeze itself if you do run
into VirtualBox freezing you can just
close it down restart or wait till it
stops working so hard and registers your
actual change now that all of that is
fixed you should be able to boot off
your USB Drive so from the plot main
menu go to USB and hit enter USB enter
oh and I have Puppy Linux starting up
sweet that was so much easier so I know
there are a lot of fixers for this VM
glitch these days and this is just one
that boots off the USB s you can always
