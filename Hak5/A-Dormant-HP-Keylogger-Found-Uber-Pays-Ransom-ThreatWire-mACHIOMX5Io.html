HP mobile apps have all sorts of
vulnerabilities and uber is hiding
behind bug bounties all that coming up
now on threat wire greetings I am
Shannon Morrison this is threat wire for
December 12th 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom our patreon is over at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that
is still the best way to support the
show and will help us reach our next
goal and now onto the news the first
being keyloggers so a keylogger was
found on HP laptops and publicly
disclosed last week by security
researcher Michael Ming who goes by ZW
clothes on the Internet's Ning states in
his blog explaining the keylogger that
he found it by taking a look at the
keyboard driver software called sin T P
sys or sis where he discovered a format
string that looked eerily like a
keyboard logger
after analyzing his findings me noticed
that the logger would save data to a
trace file if turned on it's actually a
debugger that's used through Windows
software trace preprocessor or WP P for
short he reached out to HP and HP
responded quite quickly with an updated
driver without the trace message which
also lowered the size of the driver the
update is available through HP's site
and via Windows Update and the
virustotal and HP links are available in
the show notes right down below the
keylogger is off by default but if a
computer was struck with malware for
example the malware could be written in
a way that takes advantage of the known
bug and enables it to send keyboard logs
to a third party attacker now this could
include anything that you type into a
computer so that could be your passwords
your credit card numbers a lot more the
synaptics driver that had the bug comes
pre-installed on over 460 HP laptops now
when HP responded they stated that the
logger was a debug trace that was left
in the driver code accidentally and a
third party would need admin privileges
to take advantage of it of course this
would not be hard if the computer was
already infected with malware or an
attacker had physical access now on
another note about keyboard loggers
Michael on patreon in bTW if you are one
of our patrons you can always send in
your favorite stories on the community
tab so Michael on patreon sent in a leak
about WordPress secure I discovered the
wordpress key logger while working the
research on crypto miners that I spoke
about a few weeks ago in a related story
they discovered that over 5,000
WordPress sites have malware infections
that use fake CloudFlare domains in a
script that exploits the function dot
PHP file that WordPress themes use to
operate the key logger steals login
credentials for WordPress sites and
could also be used on retail and
business platforms to steal credit card
information from visitors now if you run
a wordpress site security recommends
removing the add j/s scripts function
from your site's code and changing the
login credentials for your
administrative access google just
patched a ton of vulnerabilities for
their Android devices so if you own one
and you have an update available make
sure to hit update and restart your
phone one of the biggest vulnerabilities
that they patch was first disclosed way
back in July by Eric low fortune of
guard square the vulnerability is called
Janus with CVE 2017 one three one five
six and it was publicly disclosed to
everybody on Thursday and now included
in the December Android Security
Bulletin and update now if used in the
wild the attacker could gain root
privileges on an android device by
circumventing anti-malware applications
or detection and they would sign their
application to look like a trust and
publisher Janus can work because apk
files and de x-files can have extra
bytes added to their code apk files
because they are archives basically
where the publisher signature is only
verified by taking into account the
archives bits not any extra bits of data
that are included and de x-files can
automatically contain extra data by
default now defined de X's or dalvik
executable files are pretty much the sum
of an apps code and that code is zipped
up into that apk archive file which is
what you would download whenever you
download an application from the Google
Play Store or any other application
store however not all applications work
this way but by default many do now
since the verified sing
could be compromised a user could
download the malicious application and
think that it's just their normal
banking social media calendar or
whatever application that they're using
and then they would log in and their
data would end up being stolen the
escalated privileges would allow an
attacker to steal other data from the
phone as well or install malicious code
now this affects older Android models
nougats 7.0 and older to be specific if
you have received an update after July
of 2016
you're most likely fine now the fortune
does recommend updating Android phones
on the consumer side if you can in for
developers make sure to use signature
scheme v2 so that your application won't
be tampered with in this way and that is
now available on newer Android operating
systems
I recommend never downloading
applications outside of the Google Play
Store as well
now another flaw was also discovered but
this one affects both iOS and Android
applications with man-in-the-middle
attacks researchers at the school of
computer science at the University of
Birmingham discovered and published a
paper explaining how the flaw works the
man-in-the-middle attack affects major
applications that carry sensitive
information including HSBC NatWest and
Allied Irish Bank plus VPN applications
like tunnel bear just to name a few
these applications use certificate
pinning with SSL which is a technology
designed to verify that a website or an
application is trusted by a specific
publisher if the certificate pinning is
done incorrectly like it was with these
apps that leaves the door wide open for
man-in-the-middle attacks the
applications implemented cert pinning
incorrectly when creating the TLS
connection for secure transport of the
data inside of those apps these apps
were not checking for hostname
verification which would show if they
were connected to the trusted party an
asset they were vulnerable to hacks as
well the attacker would need to be on
the same Wi-Fi or spoofing and network
that a target is connected to they could
then use DNS or ARP spoofing to redirect
the traffic to go through the
man-in-the-middle attack thereby
allowing the attacker to view the
vulnerable data all these applications
have been
updated to apply a fix by now you have
probably heard about uber being hacked
last year and 57 million drivers and
riders altogether had names email
addresses and more data stolen drivers
had their driver licenses stolen for
example but no social security numbers
or credit card information was stolen
luckily but news came to light last week
that uber had paid off a young man in
Florida via their bug bounty program at
$100,000 to keep it quiet and delete the
data the identity of the hacker is
unknown but reports detailed that uber
did not feel threatened by the person
and as such did not take him to court he
was paid through hacker 1 which is a
company that hosts bug bounty programs
for companies and processes those
payments for responsibly disclosed
vulnerabilities he reportedly had to
sign a nondisclosure agreement about the
hack and uber reports that they analyzed
his computer for deletion of the data
now while much of this is a gray area
like we don't know if the deleted data
is actually completely gone we don't
know who did it and we don't know why
uber was so secretive about the hack
what we do know is that they are being
hit and hit hard with several potential
lawsuits by US states and regulators but
they also run the risk of violating FTC
guidelines for not publicly disclosing
security incidents within a reasonable
timeframe they chose to be silent about
it and quietly pay the money via a bug
bounty program but I should clarify this
is not a bug bounty this was an illegal
hack in a ransom and ubers unethical
payout could set a dangerous precedent
in many other companies since InfoSec
leaders have come out as expressing
concern over their payout some have said
that it's a good thing they were glad
that they got the data deleted but since
we have no way of determining if the
data is actually gone or if it still
runs the potential of being released
publicly I'm on the side of Hoover was
unethical trained and I will continue to
be so I would love to hear your thoughts
on this story below as well thank you
again to all of the wonderful people out
there who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow
an update on our patreon page about how
threat wire is going to react to these
changes going forward needless to say I
am a patron as well as a creator I
donate to a lot of my friends on patreon
so I am seeing both sides of how this
change will affect us not to mention I
worked in the credit card industry so I
know how transactions and fees should
work so be on the lookout for an update
on patreon.com slash threat wire with
more information within the next day or
so for what it's worth though the whole
reason this show is made is because of
our patrons so you will continue to see
all the behind the scenes extras that
you would expect no matter what on
patreon and we will keep on showing off
those fur babies because that's my
favorite part of the show I love those
fur babies they are super cute so thank
you again to helping us keep the show
coming completely independent and ad
free and of course if you cannot donate
if you don't want anything to do with
patreon I totally understand you can hit
that subscribe button or you can share
this episode on your favorite social
media page and you can totally support
hak5 as well on other means with that I
am Shannon Morris and I will see you on
the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
