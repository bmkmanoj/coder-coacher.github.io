floating around on the internet CBS has
started marketing these new disposable
digital cameras both still and video and
they run about seventeen fifteen bucks
American dollars for the stills and
about thirty for the video problem is
everything about them is proprietary you
have to take it back to CBS have them
pull the pictures or the data off of
them put them on CD for you and give
them back
that's another like an $11 charge so
you're looking at it like thirty or
forty dollars just to get about
twenty-five pictures that my friends is
a ripoff all right so there are some
geeks out there that agreed with me and
they discovered how to make these
cameras reusable using some custom-made
software some tools they've programmed
and USB here's your list of supplies
you're going to need a USB female B
connector soldering iron solder a
multimeter a dremel and some hot glue
okay before you take anything apart what
you're gonna have to do is find out what
firmware version your cameras running
you do this by holding down the shutter
button in the display button at the same
time and then hitting the on button
it'll come up on the LCD what firmware
version you're using ours was using 65
50 and that's what all this is based off
of if you're running 65 20 you're lucky
because that's a lot easier okay now
they know what the firmware is you can
go ahead and disassemble the camera
there's three screws in the back and a
bunch of locking tabs all around it now
take all the screws out and when you're
popping the lock tabs be careful you
need to save them try not to break them
as much as possible once you open it up
you'll see the board in front of you
with the LCD and on the left-hand side
you'll see the proprietary connection
that CBS uses and we're going to be
soldering leads onto that that lead to
our USB connector okay we'll have a
picture in the show notes telling you
where pin 1 is on this proprietary
connector and we're going to be using
pins 6 7 8 and 9 pin 6 is your positive
5 volt USB pin 7 is the USB ground pin 8
is your USB positive data and pin 9 is
USB negative data okay
first of all now that you have it open
find a place that's going to be
convenient
for you to mount the USB female
connector then from there you just
follow the pinout diagram on the
connector and solder accordingly to
those proprietary pins okay now that you
have all your connections made and your
plug is mounted just figure out where
it's gonna be on the case draw a little
marker on it use your Dremel and cut out
a hole so that way it's nice and tucked
away it doesn't look bad and you've got
easy access from there go ahead and take
the board mount it back to one half of
the cover so you still have access to
the back panel snug it up because now
we're going to move on to software and
we still need access to that board okay
so now we can go ahead and start
gathering all our tools software tools
that we're going to need to do this
first off is going to be the P v2 tool
2.13 the lib USB 1:32 filter bin ODOT
1.8 oh and the live USB win32 bin oho
from here we can go ahead and install
the live USB device bins and the filter
bins now once they're installed gain
access to the Libby SB INF file and you
have to add strings for 2728 to be to F
and 30 will have the full string line in
the show notes for you now we can go
ahead and run the PB 2 tool and you just
plug the USB cable into the connection
you made and your computer now with that
board exposed please be careful and
avoid the flash capacitor that's 200 to
300 volts it's going to zap you hard now
with PB 2 tool running and the USB cable
connected between the camera and the
computer go ahead and click open in P V
2 tool hopefully you'll see PID 27 if
you're using the CVS red camera find the
RAM module behind the LCD starting on
the bottom pin count up to the sixth one
take the probe from your multimeter
bridge pins six and seven well while
they're still bridged unplug the USB
cable wait a few seconds plug it back in
hopefully you'll hear to death beeps
they're very distinct you'll you'll know
what they are if you did great we can
move on if you didn't just lather rinse
repeat until you do at this point I'm
assuming that you've heard the to death
beeps go ahead and on bridge six and
seven on the RAM
click open in the pb2 tools and then
find your SDRAM key scan what that's
going to do is scan the keys in the
firmware and pull them down then click
unlock this is going to unlock the
camera so that in future uses we don't
have to go through this process every
time ok at this point we can't take you
any farther we have this crazy little
thing in America called the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act which forbids
this but the software will walk you
through it you're like ninety-nine
percent of the way there now so don't
don't fret we'll have links in the show
notes that'll take you to all the
pertinent information that's hopefully
not on American servers but there you go
that's how you hack the read CBS camera
all your pertinent information links in
the show notes thanks a lot
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
