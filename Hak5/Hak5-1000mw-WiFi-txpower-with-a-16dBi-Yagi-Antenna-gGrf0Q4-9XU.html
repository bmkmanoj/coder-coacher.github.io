by jack threads you know what time it is
Shannon it's time to check port 110 time
to make photo dare cuz he's been
drinking
we haven't haha this is this is a lemon
tea mm-hmm until somebody smells it okay
let's get to the emails thank you or
Paul W writes love the show but I'm
worried for you in episode 10 11 Darren
had a sweet yagi Buddha sixteen dbi
antenna hooked up to his trusty 1000
milliwatt Realtek 81 87 Wi-Fi adapter
this is a clear violation of FCC part 15
regulations which are 30 DBM plus 16 DB
I equals 14 DB m e IRP much greater than
the 36 DBM e IRP limit more frightening
Li this is significantly over the OE t
65 bulletins limits for human safety
I'm not worried for Darren safety but
please don't point this stuff at Paul
the camera guy we like him I like him
too
yeah what is he talking about yeah let
me actually see if I can focus this
right at there we go see this is what
the sniper scope is for as it breaks the
camera with apparently all sorts of
radiation oh no see okay well I'm not in
there with the OEt 65 bulletin I'm not
an AM radio operator I don't pretend to
understand all of the fancy awesome
stuff of the spectrum I kind of like sit
in the Wi-Fi world and I'm working my
way towards there don't get me wrong I
think it's fascinating but well I don't
even understand quite what he is
speaking on as far as the DB i8e IRP
limit stuff goes sure so e IRP is the
equivalent isotropically radiated power
and is basically a way to measure how
much practical power is coming out of
the device it's usually rated in
decibels and it's just a way so that I
can know like you know this antenna at
30 minutes that's DVI well this is
essentially a nine and this one is 16
yep okay and then the difference here is
this is just a dipole antenna so you can
kind of think of it as the it all goes
everywhere once right omnidirectional
and this one just goes one way this only
goes well
it's it they all have different kind of
cones but your face it's just pointed
right into Paul's brain and that's what
we want because Paul's brain might be a
link synapses can catch cancer um I
don't think so
but anyway that's what this guy is this
guy the Edie actually it's called a yogi
Judah array oh yeah cuz of the two guys
right yeah the first it was invented in
1926 by a senior Shintaro who da right
for the what Imperial University Tohoku
and to a lesser role his colleague
helped him develop it was his name
that's he did sugu yogi accept the yagi
name has been 50s easier to pronounce
yeah I did too yeah what Luda is easy to
but a lot of people would probably call
it you die just because they wouldn't
know the pronunciation is that I don't
yeah he just yeah it sounds fun
I only speak English German and binary
oh well I I speak a little there's you
minus one zero how I say macchiato
chotto hanashi Mossad nihongo watashi wa
nihongo Oh yato enoshima's I speak a
little Japanese oh okay ami back on so
what he's talking about here though is
that the way that this antenna works in
amplifying the signal and also or
directing the signal at Paul he he he's
implying that I'm running my radio
outside of us-spec and thus breaking the
law but I'm actually not
this guy is FCC part 15 meaning it right
so it's it's regulated in the US right
and here let me show you just a bit like
close a couple of these and clear this
okay if I were to unplug my radio plug
it back in and you're going to see that
my now have W land 12 and I can bring up
that interface and I can WIW config w
land 12 and you can see now that my TX
power is 27 DBM what that translates to
is as you guys know 500 mm
which is the legal limit in the United
States
okay and one of the reasons why the this
particular 81 87 is pretty popular is
because well I mean like a lot of radios
it can depending on your operating
system go let's see how high auto spec
and I'm not advocating this whatsoever
but for all of our Bolivian and and
listeners and viewers in Baileys all you
would have to do for instance would be
iw reg set and then your country code so
for Bolivia that's Bo or for Bailey's
that would be BZ so if I do that and now
that I've specified that my country is
Bailey's you can see right here it's
actually changed my country code and now
it's saying that my radio is allowed not
only different frequencies instead of in
the US using channels one through 11
I can use one through 14 or 13 many oh
yeah whichever those are and I can go
all the way to 11 or that is I can use
one watt out of this radio but you can't
do that in the United States because the
FCC prohibits it right that's why I
don't do that oh okay so that's why
we're not radiating Paul's brain okay so
we're still in the legal limits even
though you can go you can cite of it
well if you really want it if you were
in Bolivia or Bailey's you could totally
do this okay yeah so just fly there and
do it you know yeah just go over there
and do it yeah with you thanks for
sending that in because it really got me
on a tangent
learning about likey IRP yeah and a
whole bunch of stuff that I need to get
more into because I love that stuff it's
totally a it's just it's like it's all
hacking yeah really it is all right cool

weird happened the last what was it last
weekend at my birthday party I was
hanging out with this chick Jen who's
pretty much grown up here in California
and I'm from Missouri but we both had
pictures of our relatives her cousin and
my sister both around 20 21 years old
with their friends and it was the same
exact picture just two different groups
of girls and they were all going like
this he all of them it was the weirdest
thing like their heads were all caught
the same way and they all had their
they're like hips poked out the same way
and like their legs in the same fashion
as if they were models or something all
20 years old or 21 years old completely
different areas in the United States
same age group and you know their
clothing was almost exactly the same it
was the weirdest thing ever and I was
like okay are you trying to say that
Valley girls are like carbon copies you
know I think so I honestly do three
girls each from the same area
hey all of them it was the crazy at
craziest thing they could have been
twins yeah so weird I don't go came into
the show not to act 5 org to find their
facebook and myspace URL of course
myspace yeah yeah oh my god wise it was
the weirdest thing nothing to do with
that vibe but I thought it was awesome
he's like you know there's like um why I
lied so it's so like everything now has
like red eye removal yeah why do we now
have duck face removal tell me there's
people oh that's another thing my sister
all the time yeah how about the
technical side of the week please sorry
I want you busy like in my own little
world through MySpace make the thing
happen okay fine this technology odo is
from Kevin he built this awesomely cute
little robot and it's holding a little
hat five stickers oh it's so cute he
even sent in a little video I don't know
if we have time to play it but
individual there's a let's take of the
video you can send in your own photos
over to feedback at hack 5.4 or if you
want to top that video I'm just gonna
say yeah
now I'm tough
to the trivia because I think I know the
answer to both of these thank you do I
think I do okay last week's trivia
question was this framing element takes
up 9.6 microseconds for 10 megabit 960
nanoseconds for 100 megabits 96
nanoseconds for what for a gigabit and a
mere 9.6 nanoseconds for 10 Gigabit
Ethernet transmissions what is it into
frame gap inter frame get is one of the
answers or you can call it an inter
frame spacing or an inter packet gap I
like to think of it as Ethernet going
okay here's another packet oh that's sad
yeah all right so this week's question

philip k dick novel that took place in
the year 2019 answer overt hack five
