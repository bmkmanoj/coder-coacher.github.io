hack 5 i'm darren kitchen at CES 2011
checking out I twin Luke how's it going
man hi Darren nice to meet you hi it's
going well so tell me about I twin what
is this because I see hardware I see
VPNs this is really confusing okay it
looks like a USB flash drive you can
think of it as an infinite capacity USB
flash drive on broadband so basically
you take this which is USB stick into
the USB port of any online Windows
computer and it pairs what does that
mean it means the two paired that you
have the bike twin formal encryption key
that only the two halves of I twin know
so that's a 256-bit AES encryption key
you then break off one-half bites when
leaving the other one in and you take
this with you now on this half in your
computer you can share files drag and
drop just like a USB flash drive ends
met any number or size of files as many
as you want gigabytes terabytes you name
it you leave it in you then go anywhere
in the world will say you go to Spain
you wonder around to your old auntie's
computer you stick it in the computer
you not have access to those files you
can copy them you can remotely edit them
or you can from the computer sitting at
backup the files to your original
computer with the other half of I twins
now is it only for sharing files or does
it create an actual VPN tunnel where you
can do say for example if I wanted to
play a video game with my with my camera
girl here in Toronto could she put hers
in and in her computer in Toronto could
I put mine in my computer in San
Francisco and could we play like some
land games over it today we don't
support VPN tunnel today we do have
fully encrypted AES 256 bit in that goes
over HTTPS so you'll be able to access
all her files as she shares them she be
able access all yours you'd be able to
remotely edit and you can both edit the
same file at the same time we're also
about to support media streaming so you
can listen to music on her computer from
yours watch movies on her computer for
yours and vice versa now what kind of
operating systems am I going to need to
use this today we support windows 7
windows vista windows XP various windows
server and this summer we're supporting
mac OS x now if you're running mac OS x
today but you've got fusion or parallels
or boot camp or anything else with a
window session inside that the night
wind will also support that any plans
for linux in the future a good question
sometime maybe in 2011 we're getting a
lot of requests for for Mac so that's
what we're going to focus on initially
and then look at Linux maybe they're
after so what kind of technology is
based on using something like Open VPN
is this proprietary in-house stuff this
is currently proprietary and house stuff
and it's got great ways of punching
through firewalls so you know you don't
have to configure are worried about
ports or anything like that all you do
is this plug and play you plug it in and
it finds away so long as you can use
gmail over https are by stock on amazon
com then you can use I so is there a
foot do guys host your third-party
server that the files go through and we
have an authentication server that we
that is hosted first by Amazon Web
Services just to make sure that both
halves are the same I twin and they're
genuinely I twin devices and also that
we drop it on where possible we allow a
peer to peer connection the data as soon
as it leaves a computer is aes 256 bit
encrypted so nobody can read it we can
read it nobody else okay and is it only
for two computers or can you have a
three a three-way a great question right
now it's at 121 access at two halves of
a night win both paired with the same I
twin very soon ruling out a software
upgrade so that if you have a USB hub
would say five halves or 10 halves of a
night win in it and then the other 10
halves can be out and about say your
sales team and they can all access the
server in the office through I twin and
what's the price point on this we're
launching today january six in the US at
2011 for a price one of 99 US dollars
available on I twin calm yeah alright
thank you so much
for continued coverage of all things CES
