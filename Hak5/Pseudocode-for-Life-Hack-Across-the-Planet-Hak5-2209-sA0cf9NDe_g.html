oh yeah that's happening
can't forget this I'm walking through a
jet bridge which means you're watching
microcosm planet this is what we do
beautiful here but a320 and my first
ever play fun city links so I'm aboard
my a320 on City Link which means it's
obligatory their pin trivia time that's
what we do here this a320 is part of a
family including the a 318 319 321
basically it's a huge competitor by
Airbus to the Boeing 737 and it's kind
of killing it
and I don't know other esoteric details
happens to be about 10 inches wider than
the 737 and it makes noises when they
turn on the fuel pump stuff from the
other end
and this is City link as opposed to GRU
- which I told you guys last week is the
only airline you should fly in Indonesia
but this is actually owned by them or it
used to be and it's one of the other
airlines that's allowed to fly in a year
which bodes well
okay that's been announced Rivia they
like green here thank you
three McAfee and the diplomatic mission
to Alderon continues now
Wow the thing is rickety and bullies I'm
going to be on that one soon all right
it's 1640 the boat that I'm supposed to
be on leaves at 1730 and it's only a
half hour away so I think I'm going to
make it totally gonna make it that's
going to happen no matter what it's
going to be good I'm kind of just
thinking about the future right now and
worrying about it but it hasn't happened
yet so there's no sense I say that so
easy to say
Bahasa of the day is moth farm you see
it just please take the toll road I've
always wanted to just get into a cab and
say step on it
this last is my pleasure I might
actually make it to the boat in time
just kind of stuck in Bali traffic but
doing the best as in I'm sitting here
and accepting that Alba is what is and I
don't have any control over the
situation especially when I paste it
instead of copying in this document
accidentally over wrote all of this
stuff and Google key on my phone and
then I lost like some important phone
numbers because there's no undo and I
would hit ctrl Z but again it's Android
I have no control so one of the cool
things about Bali is anyone can Lane
split it doesn't matter what kind of
vehicle you are you could be like that a
scooter or a pedestrian or a car or a
lorry or it you could be a tractor
tractor
there's about anybody oh I got another
one okay
Streeter for cars and motorcycles and
pedestrians and chickens and everything
in between
I can't believe it I'm that guy and that
guy with the sticker on my chest and a
roller board
I seem to have arrived you're not going
to be able to see any of this but just
suffice it to say that the adventure is
continuing in the back of a pickup truck
something like that if you have a great
idea bring it to the web the way Shannon
I do and head over to domain comm with
an awesome domain discovery service and
a quick immediate checkout process
you'll have the perfect site up and
running in no time
Omega is over at domain.com or soon tax
five bands which is why hak5 will save
you an extra 20% at domain.com or just
send my tweet and say thanks to sporting
hack 5 all these years so when you think
domain names think domain.com so you
know that moment when you get off a boat
in the middle of the night you have no
idea where you are but then you wake up
and you're all like oh it's so I forgot
the name of this island
Hey sorry to interrupt the episode and I
hope it's not too windy the pole on the
roof does have a leak in fact seriously
though I must be making hacker coughs
planet looks like a giant vacation oh
it's one of the things I wish I could
tell you about the cool epic thing I'm
building but NDA's you guys know anyway
I was literally just editing this
episode and stressing out about
something and I just I wanted to share
with you guys that I'm a bit of a
control freak actually I wouldn't say
that I'm a control freak I would just
say that I'm really a most comfortable
when I'm in control relief that I feel
like I have an active part of the
outcome of a situation and it it's sort
of one of the reasons why I was drawn to
computers and programming as a kid I
don't know about you guys but I feel
like hey if I write a program you know I
read some code and I run it it's going
to do exactly as I say and if it doesn't
it's not because it's matter it doesn't
like me it's not feeling good it's
because I messed up you know and then
you just you just spend some time fixing
the code you just do some debugging find
the missing semicolon and move on with
your day but life isn't always like that
I mean there's no there's no recompile
there's no undo there's no control break
and so as I'm like hanging out here on
this extended layover on my way to
Australia here in Bangkok I'm I'm
dealing with a little bit of anxiety a
little bit of stress over the unknown
and I figured this was a good
opportunity for me to just offer a tip
or two about control which is to say
control forget about it you never had it
to begin with
right all you can do is you're back and
accept that whatever comes to you is
what is you know I don't I don't feel
like the universe gives you a lemon
because you deserve it or because you're
a bad person
I really don't think the universe cares
well you are in control of those is what
you do with that lemon and you know it
is so easy to just let the monkey mind
forecast and predict all of the
potential possibilities about the future
that hasn't happened you know trust me I
am I am awesome at this I'm really good
about speculating all the ways
everything is gone terribly wrong but
just the truth is the future as an app
and yet I mean the only moment you
actually have is this one right here and
and if you could choose how you're going
to feel in every possible situation I
mean why wouldn't you choose to be happy
so relax you know
let's let life unfold I say is if it's
easy to but you know it's going to go at
the same pace you know one second per
second whether you're dwelling about a
future that hasn't happened or living in
the moment and when that lemon if that
lemon ever does come you have three
choices you can change the situation you
can leave the situation you can accept
the situation seriously this is like
pseudocode for life there are only three
options ever and and they're all
perfectly fine options you know if you
can't change it well you can either
leave it or accept it and if if the
circumstances are such that you just you
can't change it and you can't leave it
then you don't have a choice you're just
going to live with it that's the one
that I have the hardest time life really
I have have such a terrible time
accepting what is just surrendering to
what is and as it turns out though
surrender surrender is a good thing you
know render there's nothing wrong with
it it doesn't mean you're weak
it actually means quite the contrary you
are strong right if it's in those
moments that you find yourself where you
you have to do nothing more than just
accept what is and surrender to what is
just just remind yourself of what you do
have control over and remember to
breathe
and if you're anxious or depressed just
you know eat well sleep well take time
for yourself and don't drink alcohol
just hack your happiness all right
that's enough life hacks sorry to co-op
the episode like this but you know
really the only thing that you're
missing is me on a beach telling you
guys about some stories about that
National Geographic documentary and I
left all of my footage from Beirut back
in San Francisco so I'll just wait until
Shannon shows up in Australia and then
I'll make something a lot from then
until then I'll see you in Australia I
hope that you guys can come out to the
meetup there's details over at hack
across the planet calm thank you so much
for supporting us at hack shop comm
there's more episodes at hack 5 org and
as always trust your technology or have
your happiness I'm going to check out
the full situation I really do think as
a leak
