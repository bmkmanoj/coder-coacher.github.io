I want to tell you about a common
illness at this time of year it's called
hack itis it's symptoms include restless
nights' a common symptoms of blah and
just the feeling of wanting to crawl
under your sheets its remedies include a
long tropical vacation adopting a pet
for a local animal shelter or your
monthly dose of high point 5 I recommend
hat point 5 on a full stomach and if you
are spare to hack anything with a chip
episode 5.0 has my seal of approval
so anyway since I got so rudely
interrupted last time I'm gonna go ahead
and show you how to do some rounded ie
DD cables really fast once again you'll
need a knife guy to eat cable and duct
tape son of a I can't believe you
what what's it look like I'm doing dude
brownies again I'm serious flame not as
cool as this check this out dude what is
that it's a chip of some sort it's on a
PCI card I don't know you're it what as
the creepy computer guy that the store
next to my office you gave it to me and
you're gonna trust it from the creepy
computer guy well he gave me a power
supply once that worked right that's
just a power supply not some kind of
abomination of hardware
go ahead some evil looking crap I just
want to see if it's got like some firm
wire let's just boot it up see if it
like device manager detects it we can
like play with it dude dude my system my
software your hardware but come on let's
just try it you are responsible for
anything that happens get this crap out
of the way well it's seated cover back
on
all right dude you ready yeah I'm ready
I'll kick it
uh-uh dude alright hold on let me try
and find a light huh here we go actually
I can turn the lights on with my cell
phone
alright um dude how are you gentlemen
excuse me all of your packets belong to
me the hell they do what the heck is
that man I am your new server overlord I
told you we shouldn't have plug that
thing in dude it's really starting to
creep me out man
store the episode you put that ik little
humans I think we should just do what it
says Annie you realize this is all your
fault right Paul yes your fault just go
roll the intro fine
my name is Darren kitchen and I'm West
Tobler and this is hack point five point
six actually the point of eight three
two we have a very special guest today
on the episode introduce Franklin Harris
from the textile podcast hey miss miss
it's so good to finally be down here
it's well it's warmer you know you
really have done a nice job with the set
right well thank you we put a lot of
hard work into it now this is actually a
special episode of pack five because we
have a live studio audience in house
actually about sixty people behind the
cameraman right now yeah they're like
laying on top of each other it's like
trying to wrangle apartment now why
don't we just kind of make things right
yeah okay pleasure
yes thanks for having thanks for coming
to come down I appreciate it so we've
got a jam-packed episode again yes
always always we've got some streaming
videos from streaming audio some mods
some yeah up the arcade Harrison's gonna
do a little hacking he's gonna send some
code just some other code make some
happens actly happened yeah so before we
get ahead of ourselves why don't we just
go ahead and jump right into the mod
enjoy ok so last month I actually showed
you how to construct your own home
arcade cabinet so as promised this month
I'm gonna bring you how to set up your
hardware and software so while we go
ahead and turn this bad boy around and
crack it open okay so now that we've got
the case all opened up in the hardware
laid out let's go ahead and start off
with the core of this whole thing and
that's a seller on four hundred with
passive cooling the passive cooling
saves a space with the lack of a fan and
for that same reason that keeps the
noise down next we have a Rage 128 Pro
integrated and between the two we have
more than enough system resources to do
what we want to do now over here we've
got an IBM 7 gig mounted and that's
plenty of storage space IDE cable now it
would be around
but some jackass keeps interrupting me
when I try to make them oh excuse me
over here our controllers plug into a
USB hub and over here to the USB ports
the other ports being used by our USB
powered speakers because no cab would be
complete if you didn't have sound we
have a 90 watt power supply plug
powering the whole thing and over here
both our monitor and power supply are
plugged in plugged into a power strip
excuse me which comes out through a hole
on the back so we only have one cord
hanging out let's go ahead and turn it
around and check out the software end
okay so now we're all booted in and
we're running main 32 is our front end
for our MAME emulator now granted front
ends for me more like distributions for
Linux there's a ton of different kinds
so just pick the type that best suits
you what we like about main 32 is that
there's an option that we can scroll
through the games with the joysticks
instead of having to use a keyboard now
one joystick will do single selection
one up one down the other joystick will
do an entire page so like I said we're
running main 32 is our front end and
Windows XP is the operating system and
it just it runs very smoothly no
problems all you have to do is select a
game you want to play what's what's a
good one Darin just page up one all
right so will load up that one okay so
as always links for all the partnered
information will be in the show notes so
other than that it's time for me to get
my arcade micro on y'all take it easy
come on Darren get owned please
all right John's with us we're gonna
talk about streaming audio absolutely
now why would we want to streaming audio
and what is this gonna do for us
definitely gonna allow me well I'm at
work but listen to all the music that I
want right
I leave you know we've talked about this
before I leave my head my ipod at home
all the time when I leave yeah and you
know I want to be able to listen to
music at work I'll be at a party I want
to access to my musical in every
wherever you are as long as there's a PC
you want to access it yeah now and
there's a million ways to do this and we
touched on it a little bit last episode
when we talked about the VPN which I
believe is one of the best feature wise
ways to get access to music because you
get like all the cool features of
actually being on the network right so
you set up a VPN and you know you set it
up with iTunes to connect to your music
collection great a couple of problems
well one if you're doing with Windows XP
the VPN connection yeah one concurrent
connection that could be a problem if
you want to have your friends get in on
it
alright the other problem is it's a
little tricky to set up you know it's
not something that you would give to
your friends yeah I don't even your mom
or something like my mommy when I did
she need access to my VPS yeah it gets a
little ridiculous it's a little too much
well there's a couple other ways to do
it the easiest way I think is FTP
absolutely I mean Sapa lousy server with
FileZilla or some similar bullet proof
yet and just be able to set up a ftp
drive to your music very easy to access
and you know it's a little quirky but
with this little utility from Novell
yeah I can actually map a network drive
to an FTP location will have all the
links and everything in the show notes
for that and that way you know you just
go to my computer and bam you know it's
it's right in there and as far as you
know Winamp can tell it's just arrived
one of the cool benefits of that is I
could give you write access you know
different user accounts I could give an
account
John is a she's not right access good
nobody send me some stuff yeah yeah you
say so legit if it's clicked Creative
Commons yeah another way to do it oh
well you know what back up FTP the con
seriously that's really sis but that's
not something I'm gonna call my sister
and be like yeah sure you just
accessibility and this
program do this do that let's drive now
I would oh you want to upload okay well
I've setup permission for yes place you
had a party you just want to set
something up real quick not still not
the thing to use I think the easiest and
this is something that I've been using
for a while is I've already gotten
Apache server running on my machine
right so why don't I just a leus to my
music folder so then you know it's just
an IP address it's you know security
through obscurity or you could just put
an HT Access file in there if you want
some security and the cool thing is you
get a directory listing of all your
music you just go in click the mp3 of
plays couple cons though finishes
playing you have to go back and choose
another one it's right instead of
playlists it is really you can't fast
forward I mean that yeah that's a good
thing you know in Firefox with QuickTime
it just streams it right there and
they're either got a lot of pluses I
like that except for you know the
drawbacks are you can't upload music to
it you know you got to click one file at
a time so you showed me the most awesome
application and pretty cool it's by slim
some devices all devices
it's called slim server this thing is
gorgeous and I just got him on is just
what's pretty exciting about it I got
him on and I've been telling that for
awhile he just keeps ignoring me but now
he finally school hacker yeah it works
for me right but somehow I I somehow
found this this software basically load
it install it on your computer
really easy next next finish it that
connects finished I've never loves your
music idle ocean music just like iTunes
so you know you can do John raw you can
do artwork means everything art or a
color or exterior I'm finding music I
didn't even know I had in my collection
because I go to the artwork thing and
I'm like you know as long as you got the
album art when you download your music
at the album art put it in the folder it
shows up and I'm like wow what's this CD
and stuff I hadn't listened to in years
yeah now now it's there and it's it's
pretty funny because your action is
pretty funny like you who is this i
don't even know i had this CA and the
way that it works is you actually
connect to a stream and the cool thing
is you don't have to use like any
special software if you're using Windows
Media Player iTunes win damn whatever
it'll connect to the mp3 stream right
and it's just one stream and then once
it's changed on the server side that's
all it matters it's just one stream once
to change that a sport forward not a big
deal so then you use the web interface
to control the stream so there's just a
really cool black Google browse create a
playlist right and then it rescan
whenever you like
add music to your list or you add
possibly if you want you can do the
FileZilla set up an FTP and add a whole
nother folder now you can do both if you
can do all you do all of them sort of
kind of together and I like this because
I can give you access to it's got
permissions and accounts inside I can
give you access he can listen to his own
stream I can have my own stream or I
could have one stream and like be DJ for
all my friends right it's a really
amazing piece of software I love it I'm
going to start using it like crazy
that's the coolest this is a really
coolest part it's not different it's got
a different interface you can change the
template on it and it will be handheld
template this will allow you to use
possibly what what type of friends could
you use for them I've got a trio 650
it's a palm town where you could use one
of these smart phones that you run
Windows Mobile or a Symbian phone and
anything with a web browser you'll be
able to like control your music from it
and if you've got a phone that has like
a milky ocean or yeah mean iPlayer but I
think you could listen to it on the go
that's amazing yeah which is really
really cool and it's just a really it's
a light really light software it hasn't
take a whole lot to run I'm gonna set it
up on my stereo and use it to control
the stereo yeah it's like a little
remote like some more go yeah all the
time
alright so that pretty much wraps it up
those are a couple of ways to do it we
know there's a million others so sound
off in the forums and the show notes let
us know what you think what you use and
we look forward to hearing responses so
all the fun tweaks and how to do it
client-side server side all that
shownotes hak5 org so go get your stream
on it's a pretty cool box you've got Wes
I appreciate it man I'd have to have you
flight to Toronto and building well I'm
flying up there anyway for the meetup so
that's right of course you might spend a
bit I'll have all the supplies purchased
through Cory that's right but does it
really have to be windows no it does not
have to be windows we will have links to
Linux distributions to do the same thing
in the show notes but a 90% of our
viewers are windows and for our purposes
the main 32 front-end serve our purpose
is quick I was up at 3 in the morning
while you guys are sleeping practicing
my mic gotta get my street fighter
skills oh yeah man you schooled me the
person well I am old I remember it's all
good happen so what else we gotta uh up
next is our Ajax tutorial asynchronous
JavaScript and XML
not the stuff you used to clean
bathrooms No
not that 10 hello world 20 go to 10
touch more complicated than that but not
too bad
cool so while we go ahead and take a
look at that hey how you doing John
pretty good at myself doing alright
thanks a lot
good now I understand that you came here
with a Ajax tutorial that you've
prepared yes I have prepared it for what
developers we're programmers who want to
get started with Ajax and this is the
first steps into learning just the ok
beginning layer well I mean I don't know
much about Ajax it's a huge buzz word on
the internet right now you see it right
and left you see page just using it you
know it when you see it at least I do
right but I don't know what's going on
behind what I see right and a lot of
people on the same boat you are because
they have a lot of misinterpretations of
what Ajax is and they believe it's a
programming language they believe it's a
technology but it's not all it is is
just innovation on top of what already
existed and now that people have
realized that they can do certain things
with JavaScript it's growing and growing
and growing and just the ajax world is
just getting bigger ok now what is ajax
ajax stands for asynchronous JavaScript
and XML a synchronous asynchronous
asynchronous is basically a seamless to
a very rough down version it's a very
seamless it's a seamless line to the
server so that you don't have any
interruptions on your web page and is
that what allows us to have that almost
real-time feel on the page it seems like
there's a program running right and then
there really is it's basically an engine
running inside of your page that is
going back and forth between the web
server ok and with the XML XML is a big
big punch in this mm-hmm
that's why they added it into Ajax is
what it allows you to do is pull data
from XML and just pop it in on the
screen is since XML is so light not a
lot of overhead compared to connecting
to a database or retrieving the data
it's a lot faster and that the biggest
thing that lets us you know instead of
having to go back to the server and
refresh a page every time we want to
send you information the old way that we
still we'd have to go we'd have to post
it to the web server PHP or Die dead or
whatever would have a you
go through the steps of getting the data
or manipulating whatever and it would
have to refresh my page the entire page
whereas with or reload the entire page
rewrite and with Ajax we're just
refreshing the page was that one section
yes yeah it started a really refreshing
it's like it's just getting the data
that's all it's doing and it gives you
that truth like PC on desktop
application feel okay now pulling it to
the web development all right so I
understand that you brought a demo with
you yes I have it's a very skin down
version of just using some Ajax and I
use just a little bit of XML and I guess
we're going to get started all right
sounds good all right we're gonna start
off by declaring an HTTP request
variable we're gonna set it to false
okay and then we're gonna have a
function call called requests with
requests the object and gets its
initiation next we actually have to make
sure that it's set to false because if
it's not then we're gonna get it true
when the object really hasn't been
created yet okay so it's very important
now this is the part where we check our
browser ie in Mozilla and opera I use
the main outcast
yeah they handle things differently
though things a little differently
because it uses ActiveX right so the
object is now created we have a few
trying caches and the ActiveX to make
sure the different versions of ie you
can and now we're going to see if it has
been initiated if it has nothing
initiated we're gonna send an alert or
and say you know there was a miss
problem so now we're gonna go into the
onreadystatechange ready state being our
beginning point for our actual Ajax the
up connections connection it's done it's
what do we do now right you're gonna
call this function it's going to be
called ready state or whatever you want
to call your function it's gonna go
through the process of what it has to do
first okay next we're going to use our
dot open or that opens gonna have our
types like get you can set up the post
if you want mhm
then we give them to our send I set it
as null that's it in terms of what do we
do now alright next we have our ready
state function call this is where it
does on ready state this is what's gonna
happen okay this the it has four
different exercise five different stages
0 through 4 mm-hmm 0 through 3 really
are insignificant you
concerned with number four but for this
example I went ahead and trade similar
terse to let us know the status just so
you understand what's actually happening
okay now we are at four meaning that
everything is ready to go that's all set
then we have to check the HTTP status on
the Apache side mm-hmm status is the
status code for that's 200 there are
many others in case you want to do
something different and dependent upon
what you're going to use is right but
for the most part most of time you're
going to use two 200 and this since
today we're going to go into XML which
is you know the big name there we're
going to go ahead and create a variable
for an XML document which is our sample
if Simone will get into that and we're
going to create an object for that next
we're gonna go into our root node and
our root node is going to find the root
node inside of our XML okay all right so
we've got that set we've got searching
for root going to get the first item and
then we're gonna print it right there
simple very clean very easy and if
there's a problem there it's gonna send
back an error so there's a lot of error
checking okay so we have that created
we're gonna go into some of the HTML and
we're going to unclick do that request
that JavaScript request call you can
pass it the URL or the file name of the
XML file and then it's going to do its
work we're gonna go ahead and pull up
our stable XML very simple very very
simple it's only four lines of code yeah
and we just declare it as XML we created
one node called root and it'll get the
insides of that node so we have our page
up here it's got our link we're gonna go
ahead and take a click at it here's our
alert or learner this is the actual
initialization of ready state okay now
we've got it loaded got interactive and
it's ready to go
now hold that no doubt Boyd I just said
now yeah it's pull it check the node
pull the data out of it and that's the
information that was left in there
no and it's it's a very light version of
course that you can just you deal with a
little more research and know you have
an idea of what is the limit with this
this is right to get you started because
you can do some incredible things with
Ajax so yeah I've seen a beautiful site
and we're we're dusting
next year's we're going to see it grow
even more so that's the basic rundown of
what Ajax is good tutorial just to start
off with I really enjoyed it is very
informative thank you so much your
problem just I need you to check out the
show notes yeah you'll have your script
and everything everything all the codes
gonna be on there and then we go from
there
all right well thanks a lot Wes know
what where have you been I've been out
with a hackling what's up dude I've been
calling you I called you like six times
we get into the ideas
oh dude I'm sorry dude you need a
microchip jackhammer
yeah dude my phone's a hotness Microsoft
makes of that yes oh I will man I will
have you ever been annoyed by the fact
that your cell phone has absolutely no
power when it vibrates you ever had your
girlfriend or wife be mad at you for
days cuz they call you and you can't
feel the phone vibrate introducing the

for an additional five percent off so
Darren what are you gonna show us today
okay like a little bit earlier Johnny
now we're talking about ways to stream
audio right well what about video I kind
of stopped watching you know using real
player and like the 17 no no no it's not
like streaming video like you're
thinking we're not gonna like there's no
buffering yeah I thought we had like an
interview no this isn't streaming video
in the sense that you're thinking like
streaming like a video for our hard
drive at night if you want to like take
you know hack five to your friend's
house and play from there
don't try to string that over your box
at home just download two copies and
bring one is place all right so I'm a
little skeptical about this what we're
doing minute we're streaming television
oh now see that's and that's an idea
right there were stream that we do live
cable television oh it's it all right
cool I used to do this because I work
you know for me there's channel that I
used to watch and on my lunch break I
would watch you know this certain TV
show and you folder but did something
happen then they're no longer around but
you know just imagine you know you're at
work I'm at work well you know the only
channel I really watch was like the f1
races which the f1 season is over so
what does it mean that it's ahead oh
yeah well I'm for pretend that I'm watch
the F way brought one race and like a
son
afternoon I'm installing icy pxi 3.0 and
like I got like six hours of downtime
and I'm like you know gotta do something
well yeah I mean why wait only one race
as I said number one sponsor of f1 so
that kind of okay I like it okay so you
know really to do this what you need is
a Windows machine with a TV tuner card
okay how much does it TV tuner card cost
120 bucks off yes they were pretty
inexpensive you can find some deals out
there
Newegg sure if you want to plug knew a
guy wants to give us some money that'd
be great too okay so I'm vien seed here
into the the home theater PC and let's
go over there right over there over
there okay thank you over there it's
it's somewhere so yeah so okay so we're
in the we're in the home theater PC all
right we're gonna start up Windows Media
encoder when is me mean encoder that
sounds something awful no it's not
is this already it's pretty yeah you can
pretty download microsoft link somewhere
likes maybe over there put them right
where put the link down here I like it
up there I don't know it's all over the
place yes so we're gonna broadcast a
live event alright we're gonna select
our video source and our audio source
for a video source I've gotten ATI rage
theater that's the all in wonder card
that I have and what does that cost but
at the time it was 200 I'm sure you
could pick it up for like 20 bucks now
it's bad it's a $7,500 wonder it's nice
job done so TV tuner TV tuner video
tuner right gonna give it a channel 20
now this is like the TV channel just how
do they have to be tuned in to the same
now to pick it up alright so now we'll
choose the line in source on our audio
because that's where the TV tuner is
getting its audio feed the head next
the most important part pull from the
encoder not pushed to a media server
because media server cost like a
buttload yeah so next we just give it
the bot load being more than I'm willing
to spend yes so we give it a port number
port 8080 that are oh come on don't even
a neonate them there okay so now I've
got to set the encoding now it's got a
whole bunch of cool presets and you know
they work just fine
I've got about 512 K up
on my my cable connection here so I'm
gonna give it a little bit less than
that so is that like typically a good
idea to just go one night below you know
that way if your roommate is like torn
ting then you don't smack them around
yeah so 340 K for me that was just fine
so no TV frames for a second 30 frames a
second 320 240 finish I'm a little
skeptical I gotta start encoding trust
me this is a lot better than you're
thinking all right - the server there
okay and we're over here on our client
now okay another client what's happening
is media player looks a lot like the
open URL and give it the dine DNS or you
know the IP address of your cable
connection of course you gotta see our
DNS went a little bit haywire everybody
knows yeah well the lights started
flickering okay there we go
it will open the stream then stop my
frame give it a minute
come on me I don't want to see him
buffering hey that wasn't Duke I wasn't
too long and now look at that right
Darren what is this
that's the firm that's right I am
honestly impressed actually this is the
best scene from the firm yeah well we've
watched some more of it but then we get
sued so okay well that's pretty much
yeah okay so that actually is pretty
good quality is it's great quality I
mean it's like I can I can watch yeah I
could watch from work yeah it definitely
it's not bad that way you won't miss
your favorite show
you can also there's settings in there

somebody there's don't do
where's right Mike FTP rights it's not
so local IP address lops off last octet
and replaces it with a value of 220 this
means that if your local Oracle servers
on host 1.2.3.4 it starts with a one
point two point three point two to zero
it attempts to TCP you know what really
long very long not worth you got it
right so we're gonna hook him up with

Harrison oohing a hack hack was
Metasploit some miss medicine I think

somebody else's good make some
happen right so let's watch Harrison
make some happen
okay Darrin I got confessed last weekend
I was every year place and after you
went to bed I was kind of bored decided
to play around with the security
auditing tool Auditor
a lot of good stuff about it's actually
really cool I prefer to lob pics down
because the new op because is a wax
based on Slackware and I gotta be honest
like I am a die-hard you know knotek's
family it's awesome so I did boot it up
and played around with it for a little
bit and one of the things I wanted to
talk about was the Metasploit framework
yeah about that it's it's actually
pretty creepy it's creepy how easy it is
to use in the first place I heard about
it was iron geeks website it's got some
really cool security video tutorials and
stuff like that and check it out really
cool
anyhow the Metasploit framework
I keep fumbling over that basically what
it does is it sucks down exploits and it
gives you like a list of exploit so you
can you can perform with the payload and
you space it like point-and-click it's
got a web interface so it makes it like
ridiculously script kitty to you like
it's really bad really I did notice that
one of your machines is not past yes
there's a good reason okay listen when
Windows XP service pack 2 came out it's
just the complete bastardization of wait
have you guys patched up are you guys
patch I'm sure they're planning like
because I always patch I mean yeah well
no listen I patch all my machines it was
system administrator keep everything up
to date but this one machine I used to
see this in the show I know the Torrance
and to get the best speeds on this
Torrance you got to be using service
pack 1 because service pack 2 just kind
of met Center I know there's an update
I'm actually but if there's any thing is
this one ever really bad security
exploits for service pack 1 as a matter
of fact Oh what would you do
oh well I want to explain a little bit
about the framework first it's actually
got a lot of exploit so you can do like
for example once a target is I think
it's a share point if you're running
front fades extensions even like Oracle
9 and Microsoft sequel server hardcore
saying like even I think apples Samba
server as well it's pretty wild but one
of the exploits is Microsoft Windows XP
for service pack 1 right and so you can
pull up the web interface and select you
know
I think it was the RPC 139 blaster yeah
yeah same one yep exactly we were able
to shut down my machine no no actually
it kind of like takes the same attack
and then you can choose which payload
you want it's actually already a large
selection of payload it's like okay for
example I selected the exploit the next
page lets you select the payload it's
got ones like believe it or not like you
can execute a command yes on the machine
okay
also like get a command prompt whoa yes
it's a really scary okay and you can
also like this is this is a really funny
one okay so don't get mad but you can
also bind the VNC show okay I didn't get
on I mean it's like point you click I
mean I can't take credit like I don't
think anybody can color so so badly so
so it's more script kiddie than can
enable it's much more it's it's so bad
we got a like desk oh dude your desktop
it's hot by the way I can't take that
was tombi time via forms you like punch
event also I did website was great
that's really that's tough it out but
game back on subject
yeah it's so easy to use it's ridiculous
so it's most of the exploits on there
are alike a little bit outdated so if
you keep all your systems patch it's
only this is no that's what updates or
any nice actually it's funny that you
mentioned that because there is like an
update script on there are you stands I
haven't played a round of it but I think
you can actually sync it up with like
security focus exploit tree and packets
harm and it's like you can go out and
search and find an exploit if you don't
have one there's no particular system
you're targeting it's pretty nasty like
a pendant I mean like it was designed
had a great application it makes you
mean really a lot of Auditors but at the
same time it's got a bad side effect you
know so I mean you know the good
outweighs the bad I think in this case
whole delights I mean nobody's gonna
call themselves a hacker no no nobody
calls themself a hacker using this
but it's it's pretty deadly it's it's
pretty it's pretty crazy what you can do
with such a limited knowledge of like
security and and exploits okay what's
the what's the moral of the story here
the moral of the story is
just don't use windows just kidding no
if you're gonna use windows if you have
to use Windows you definitely patch it
up I mean it's like one of those times
we said that it's one of those things
like if you if your boss is like I don't
feel like updating okay yeah check it
now you know what do you think about it
now two clicks yeah so it's good it's a
lot of fun to play around with but just
don't use it in the wrong ways of course
not
of course we would not promote that
sounds like a really nifty tools and
thanks for owning my box I have to go
update now I suggest that everybody else
do the same for any of this stuff that
he's talked about here I like to share
