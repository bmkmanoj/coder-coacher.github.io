Google but is it any good we're gonna
find out today on hack 5 why do you come
in and you say hello welcome to act 5 my
name is Darren kitchen my name is Jana
Morris it's your weekly dose of techno
Lester I got it it's been a while yeah I
mean we haven't had bricks since the
firehouse yeah it's been a long time
they're real I like that I like the real
brick background it's super fancy I love
the time lapse you did oh thank you yes
yeah I was proud of that I wish I had
the GoPro there the entire time that we
were installing it all right well check
out my vlog with Perrin we got this
place lit yeah I included some of your
footage actually in the timeline to the
time-lapse if you guys haven't been
following along for a while hi-5 moved
to Oakland and we're also having a
meet-up on the 29th so if you're
watching this before March 29th 2018
join us if not see you next time that
reminds me I was walking down the street
the other day it was going to Bart and I
passed these two dudes and one of them
went had five and I turned around and
then he went back five and I said yeah
you got good stuff and then he walked on
so if that was you sir it was really
nice to have somebody recognize me from
the shows so totally weird in random but
I kind of doubt of when it is not about
context yeah you're like you're like
DEFCON this makes sense the elevator in
your building
it doesn't he was so nice though he's
just like I like your stuff and I was
like cool you know that's awesome I like
hearing that
hey you know what we're doing today
outlying we are putting some packets
through some things we are outlining
outline so outline makes it easy to set
up a VPN to protect Internet traffic
from peering eyes it was originally
developed by jigsaw which was born out
of Google's ideas similar to other VPN
implementations it secures the traffic
between two different end points like
between your phone or a laptop and a
server that you host yourself in the
cloud so that way nobody is
eavesdropping in between those two
points and they won't see anything of
value yeah it's usually just like
garbage you're like hey I'm just gonna
protect my data
in transit between me and whatever I've
got in the cloud so when I'm on the
public Wi-Fi or that airplane Wi-Fi or
whatever have you I'm like find sniff
this is garbage
so outline is targeting this to
journalists specifically but really
everybody should be privacy conscious
enough to use one personally we are not
a fan of saying a third party for such a
service or paying for a third party for
such a service and hoping that they are
telling the truth when it comes to their
network policies because we all know
that doesn't necessarily happen every
time like you know maybe they keep logs
even though say they say they don't keep
logs in their policies and stuff like
that
and Soviet Russia bear says logs keep
you very classic with the yeah there was
no intention of that actually I was
serious and plenty of these hosted
solutions have been caught breaking
those promises to users so if you are
like us you probably want something that
you can roll your own and from the looks
of it outline may actually be a good
solution yeah I mean basically outline
is actually a kind of an audited version
of shadow Sox with basically they did an
independent review from the InfoSec
group radical open source those guys are
pretty cool they're out of the
Netherlands where awesome hackers live
and if you're familiar with shadow Sox
well it's pretty much a secure Sox by
proxy cool now we have not covered
shadow Sox
specifically on hack 5 but we have
covered Sox 5 proxies using SSH on
episodes
lucio 6:14 1108 all the way through 11
13 17 23 and 17 24 so we have done
plenty of episodes about Sox 5 suffice
it to say Sox 5 is a really great proxy
technology so we are really keen to see
what Google's jigsaw has done with the
same concept now the benefits with
shadow Sox is that it's super fast it's
cross-platform open-source and it's
really easy to set up as well which
Darin is going to show us so the hope is
that outline should be basically the
same like nice and easy to set up so
let's find out shall we
right indeed so here's the thing you
know now it's similar to most
client-server setups that you probably
Mille ER with you know you've got a
server or what they call the outline
manager and then you've got your devices
like your phone and your laptop and your
tablet and those are going to run the
outline client as it were and basically
they can communicate in between
everything in between those two things
are encrypted right so it looks like the
server itself or the Outland manager as
they call it they like to go is
available for Windows and Linux yay and
Mac OS is coming soon so for all you Mac
people out there you are not alone they
are having you as well the client or
just outline is available for Android
Windows and Chrome OS with iOS and Mac
OS coming soon - I feel like this is the
first time ever that Mac OS and iOS were
no first ones to get an app in Android
was if you think it's always like
Windows a Mac thanks google and then
maybe down the line Linux like don't get
me started on Google Drive where anyway
I'm still sore me too I'm ridiculously
so anyway yeah ok so it basically the
one big selling point of outline is that
it's stupid simple to set up on your
virtual private server mine I love
digitalocean I've been using their
droplets of like the affordable pricing
model there this isn't an ad I'm
literally just a fan the outline folks
seem to also be fans because they
integrate well with that they say they
do as well as Amazon ec2 Google compute
engine Linode you know all of the usual
suspects so here's the thing though I
did run into a little trouble
downloading the image for Linux and then
having read about how it's like supposed
to work so well with digitalocean I'm
like oh cool I'm just gonna go ahead and
W get this guy over on my digital open
VPS and and take a look here I've
actually got a server in the cloud right
here okay and I've gone ahead and
downloaded my outline manager and it's a
dot app image and I'm like okay you know
chmod that plus you know a plus X and
then run outline manager and I'm like
are you kidding me I'm missing this x11
library and here's the thing
this is an open VPN server
why would I be using x11 I'm like oh no
in fact you may have even noticed that
when i SS aged in ISS aged in with that
tack capital X right here and the reason
for that is because I'm like okay well
if this has to run in a GUI I guess I'll
do some excellent port forwarding and I
tried it and not so much so here's the
trick basically don't overthink it
download it to your Linux box and
literally double-click it as you would
any other app that you're a Windows it's
got a GUI and so the manager you
actually run not on the server itself
but on the Linux box that you're going
to set up your server with that's so yes
I know it's kind of breaking my human
model but I'm like hey okay actually
when I got over the the stupid factor it
was easier yeah or at least I think now
I actually haven't run through the
walkthrough but I think we should
because what's gonna be fun is we'll get
a real first look at the kinds of
mistakes that somebody like me that's
thinking too old-school is going to make
let's do it live all right let's do
alive okay so here we go I've got things
going to fail so I get the out load
manager open and it's like hey choose
your server and we can do ec2 or Google
compute and stuff but I actually already
have a digital open account digitalocean
account so I'm gonna say I got one of
those sign me in everyone his password
is Kirby right just kidding
hang on got to remember my password and
I'm pretty sure of that hey hey okay two
things about this one I think is pretty
awesome that I that it supports the
two-factor authentication I'm pulling
out my two f ed app here to get into
that and - it does feel really weird
logging into my digitalocean account on
some app I'm putting a lot of trust in
Google right now for that I can imagine
that if this were the norm you know
there's all sorts of opportunities for
fishing here but then again we're
talking about people that'll just run
any docker image that they find on the
Internet this is already room for
shenanigans okay so two FA code okay all
right so I've got to authorize myself
the application I'm a little
disappointed I thought that maybe I'd be
able to like choose one of my existing
servers but it looks like I have to
choose a new one here I'm going to
choose SFO I guess I could you know go
through London if I wanted to see the
BBC iPlayer but you don't want to well
it's got a pretty throbber I can say
that but does it work oh wait it's a
Robert and the progress bar going across
the top how's that hooray we have a
server let's see next thing is to create
some keys okay okay it seems kind of
like Open VPN server a correct approach
when you create a profile okay not
connected yet click here to install the
client
okay got it alright alright my access
key we can add a new key I can say like
a key for Shannon right yeah okay I've
got Shannon's key click share and copy
it to the clipboard ok interesting hey
check this out it actually puts it on
this AWS instance yeah all right I can
also email it or do a chat and just
gonna copy it to the clipboard that's
cool uh-huh and then although you can
share that key with your friends if you
need to there's really not a whole lot
available here in the outline manager I
mean you know basically I can check out
their Terms and privacy and what data
they collect but otherwise under the
actual settings of my server or I can
just name it choose whether or not I
want to share anonymous statistics or
destroy the server so ok not a whole lot
I'm imagining once you're connected I'll
see under data usage how much you're
using wow that was just stupid simple
that was it yeah that's it and so now I
just need to send you the message over a
secure medium I mean it runs into the
same problem you have with everything
else which is key exchange okay but
thankfully I can find your PGP key on
key base or I can use signal to send it
to you or what have you
whatever have you yeah ok so you have
already sent it to me and I see this
nice little web GUI on my computer when
I click that link and it pops up it says
to access the open Internet through this
outline server follow these instructions
so if I want to connect with this device
which I do
I'll choose connect this device then I
copy my access code so copy that and
then install outline for Windows so this
is going to be my client right right
okay so we install it and I'll just
stick it in my Desktop folder cool and
it looks like this is just a regular Exe
as well yes next finish okay cool
I'm kind of astounded yeah me too Google
just made it really easy for everybody
to get really secure well you can see
like with their marketing they're
they're basically aiming this at
journalists yeah which makes sense okay
access key please confirm that you want
to add this server and that should be
the same as what I got from your link so
an odd server all right so it says I'm
currently disconnected so I'm going to
hit connect and let's see if it works
Hey it says I'm connected hey okay
verify your browser connection most
browsers connect automatically with
outlines some do not got it okay and
there you go you've got the IP so that's
the same as the server that's the same
as the so it works and it looks like
under the options for this server I can
rename it if I want to I can also forget
it which could be rather useful and it
seems like you can add multiple servers
on the client side as well so if I go up
to this little plus sign I can add
additional access keys if I have other
ones for maybe other outlets if I was a
journalist and on the menu side we have
submitting feedback about and help so
nothing really exciting there basically
it's just an access for your server and
that's about it so it looks so easy well
Wow
yeah and when I log into my digitalocean
dashboard here I just see another
droplet called outline server San
Francisco to be cool which is gonna now
cost me another five bucks month hosted
somewhere else we do it for the segment
yeah yeah we do alive okay that was
uncannily easy yeah it was yeah
okay so what actually happens when
installs this is it grabs the latest
version from a repository it's a docker
instance and then it actually installs
Watchtower which is a tool that makes
sure that that docker instance is always
up to date and it restarts it does it
hourly that's cool because now when
there's a new update it's automatically
updated and then finally a management
web server is also there it's spun up on
a random port at a random path with a
self-signed SSL certificate so quite
useful I don't say quite useful I'm
really curious to even SSH into this
server now and start poking around
seeing like what the infrastructure
looks like yeah it is but I mean given
the fact that it's stupid simple to use
and anyone can use it I'd say it's a win
for a certain subset of the audience I
think it might be yeah the pros pros
seem to be that it's really free it's
really fast it's really free it's really
free it is really free open-source yeah
that's true and it's also audited by an
independent third party with a really
big name backing it which is Google and
on a technical standpoint it seems
pretty well put together - there's
things like DNS that are forced through
the tunnel so it's less likely that your
true IP address will leak which is great
leonesse leakage is an issue they
actually use Open DNS as opposed to
Google's own DNS 8.88 and I try to
prefer that kind of cool yeah it's very
cool the one major caveat I would say
brings us to the cons yeah yeah so with
the Windows client yeah UDP packets do
not go through CCP goes through the
tunnel and end even dns goes through the
tunnels with you okay that's a huge con
as well the fact that there's no iOS or
Mac clients right now okay so I'm sure
there are many journalists who are like
so excited to talk to their sources in a
secure fashion in the day and age of all
of those like stuff but I you have an
iPhone oh well
man well there's still signal get an
Android hey what are your thoughts you
can always email feedback at 5:00 org or
comment
yeah check out hack shop calm our very
own hack five gear for instance we have
a packet squirrel that has a shadow Sox
client built-in and that's compatible
with outline so when I saw about oh like
this is gonna be good yeah and then it
also do Open VPN and SSH if you're
looking for like a stupid simple
physical proxy gateway device and as
always you can also check out all of our
past episodes at youtube.com slash hack
5 and hak5 org we are so happy to
announce that we hit 400,000 subscribers
on YouTube which is amazing we actually
hit that during your birthday party
which was so random and kind of ironic
and very very cool so thank you
everybody
subscribing and I believe this episode
comes out right before we are having a
party down here in Oakland yes
so hack fat better work slash Oakland if
it is before the 29th of March and you
would like to come down and play a
little game called capture the cocktail
leave it at that we'll talk about more
of that later with all of that said it's
so nice to be in a studio I know no nice
to have bricks again totally laters
happy shiny face is off my usually like
banter ways with you because we haven't

let's go let's go do that
really really want forever this is water
yeah you mean you mean a Frappuccino no
