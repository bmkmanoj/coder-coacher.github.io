audible welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers network gurus and
IT ninjas i'm your host Shannon Morse
and today I am going to show you how to
protect your Windows PC from little or
big new blitz ever let a kid play on
your computer innocently only the find
that your PC crashes every few minutes
because they accidentally deleted an
important file or perhaps you just need
to prevent users on your network from
messing with their machines too much
happens to me too luckily there are
answers to those problems first off
there is start killer a free and open
source program that you can find at
toward XCOM this program does just what
it says it kills the star button giving
you more free space on your taskbar and
removing that button from prying eyes
you could still get into the menu by
hitting control escape like so and
removing it with control escape as well
you can also hide the start killer
taskbar icon and still access the
settings by hitting ctrl alt shift f12
like this and under the menu you can do
everything right there start killer uses
just a bit of a memory and it can still
be used on all newer versions of Windows
including 64-bit number two is taskbar
Eliminator which will hide your taskbar
this program gives you more space for
viewing on your monitor or it just keeps
others from messing with programs
sitting on the taskbar again all newer
versions of windows are compatible and
it is free and open source to use you
simply press and hold ctrl alt and T to
bring up the menu and it brings up the
Preferences window from which all
options can be adjusted press and hold
alt + key to immediately show or hide
the taskbar directly such as so
disappears and right back up it's nice
and simple after the break i'll show you
my very last program to minimalize the
threat of Child + keyboard but for
here is a word from our sponsor

choice is key tweak this also free and
open source program for windows will let
you disable enable remap or reset key
configurations for your keyboard do you
want to disable caps lock who doesn't
want to make the Windows key
functionality disappear before letting
Little Billy darren play out in your pc
that can be done ki tweak is easy to use
you just pull up the dialog setting box
click on a key you want to mess with and
then choose how you want to change it in
the control keyboard control box below
and then click apply and you're done so
I'm going to make sure that this works I
hit my caps lock which is key 30 go down
to the remapping keyboard controls box
choose disable key and click apply
restart now new so normal typing and
then I hit caps lock and it stays unkept
yes it's so much nicer that way who
doesn't want to do that to their caps
lock oh alright that's it I mean how
easy is that okay so I want to hear your
