you by go to Asus welcome to tech tip
the show where we break down concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and
today I'm checking out net cat now last
week we discussed installing net cat and
all the available ways you can do it on
Windows and Linux this week we're
actually going to go over the basics now
like every other security tool on the
market this one can be used for good or
bad in I like to focus on the good now
one good way to use it is as a really
simple chat interface you can use two
instances of net cat running on one
computer with the operating system of
your choice for this example now today
one net cat instance will be a listener
and the other one will be a client I
will be connecting over TCP port 3 1 3
37
now TCP stands for transmission control
protocol and this protocol will let us
transmit a stream of data from one
program all the way over to another now
the port is kind of like your computer's
address at hack 5 for example port 1 is
Darren kitchen at 5 hack 5 Street in
port 2 would be Shannon Morse at 5 hack
5 Street now that we know what chatting
is in net cat let's go ahead and take a
break and we'll chat right after working
in I team means constantly jumping from
one problem to the next and each issue
needs to be solved fast and every minute
counts so don't waste your time juggling
different tools and duplicating data
entry use go to assist from citrix the
leader and remote support now you'll
have the tools you need integrated into
one easy to use platform so you can work
faster in more efficiently so how does
this thing work go to assist includes
three essential support tools that you
can customize for your needs go to
assist service desk for example allows
you to log incidents and track the
resolution go to assist monitoring one
of my favorite parts proactively
identifies issues to fix before they
become bigger problems and then there's
remote support where you can provide
live or unattended support to any PC Mac
or mobile device from anywhere to
resolve the issues quickly now I
personally love
go to assist monitoring it's super great
about being proactive and letting you
know when your server needs a patch so I
don't have to actively keep an eye on my
servers myself like 24/7 because that's
no fun now sign up for your special 30

hack we're back so let's get to netcat
and chatting in netcat so first off
we're going to go ahead and start with
our listener machine now for me this is
going to be my Linux box so first thing
you're going to type in is NC Tech L
Tech P and then your port whichever that
might be mine for example is 3 1 3 3 7
so on my machine and I have netcat
running already of art already checked
it with NC Tech H like we learned last
week I'm going to type an NC Tech L tak
P 3 1 3 3 7 so what does this
specifically mean it basically means you
open netcat as a listener that's tech L
on port tack P and then the port number
3 1 3 3 7 and of course the port number
can be pretty much whatever you want it
to be now tack L specifically means
listen mode for inbound connects you can
also use tack uppercase L to listen
harder and re-listen on socket close now
we need to find out what my internal IP
address is by using ifconfig on Linux or
IP config on Windows so if we take a
look at my Linux box I've typed in
ifconfig and I find my internal address
is 10 dot 73 31 1 4 5 now if we take a
look at my windows box on the other side
I typed in ipconfig and I get 10 dot 73
39.1 79 as my internal address now those
are going to be important in just a few
moments now in another terminal window
and this can also be on your Linux
machine you're going to type in what
your client wants to see so for example
on my Linux machine I'm going to type
into the second window NC 10 dot 73 31
one four five because that's the IP
address of the listener and then you're
going to type in the port which is 3 1 3
3 7 now this is going to activate the
other end of the connection as the
client so the client is running netcat
listener activated on host 10 7 3 3 1 1
4 5 and then it's followed by the port
number so of course you have to listen
on the same port it's completely
unencrypted but it does let you chat so
let's just use my Linux box to chat
between the two terminals very simple so
we have this on the listener sign NC
Tech LTAC P 3 1 3 3 7 and on the client
side we have NC the internal IP and the
port now if I click enter on both and
I'll type hi it will show up on the
listener side now alternatively I can
also do vice-versa so I can talk from
the listener side over to the client
side for example on the Linux box I can
say soap and it appears over on the
client side now obviously it's done
correctly it should be able to chat
between the two windows but of course
this isn't really necessary to chat on
between two windows on one PC so let's
go ahead and use my windows box for
another example which basically
simulates what two employees for example
could do on the same internal network so
my Linux box is still going to be the
listener and my windows box is now the
client so you could use the same
commands as last time but on two
separate machines so let's go ahead and
try this on my Windows machine so I'll
close I pee config I don't need that
anymore now I'm going to type in NC 1073
dot 31.1 4 5 that's the listener on port
3 1 3 3 7 and on my Linux box I'm going
to go ahead and close this second
terminal that I had running
and cancel out that chat session so it's
going to tell me that it's been
cancelled connection reset by Pierre and
I'll go ahead and start a new connection
for my Windows machine so I press enter
and I go over to my windows box again
and I press enter on this one so now I'm
going to try chatting between these two
so I'll say test from Windows and if you
take a look at my Linux box so as you
can see on the Linux box after I type
that into my Windows machine
it appears over here tests from Windows
now I can do the same thing from over
here tests from Linux and what should
happen is as soon as I hit enter it
should appear on my Windows machine and
if we take a look at the Windows machine
there it is
test from Linux now you can send chats
from listener to client and vice versa
no matter what computer you're on now do
you guys use net cat and what is your
favorite use for net cat let me know in
the comments below or you can email us
