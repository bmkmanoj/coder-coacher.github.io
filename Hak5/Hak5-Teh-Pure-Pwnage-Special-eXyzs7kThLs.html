we're on a hack five road trip to
Toronto for the premiere of the pure
ownage TV series join us as we sit down
with director and cast members Jeff
lepere Derek Hale and Joel gardener this
episode of fact 5 is brought to you by
gamefly goto assist Express remote
support made easy and domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain hello milkman hak5 my name's
Darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse and we
are on a fun road trip ends at five just
frequently going s to Toronto again up
in Canada it's the field trip I love
going to Canada for a live act bus and
why did we go up there oh well because
pure ownage the awesomest ownage show on
the internet is premiering their TV
series on showcase in canada so it's
podcast gone television is awesome yeah
I mean we were literally walking around
Toronto and there were posters of germy
like owning Toronto it was hilarious I
was like wow yeah we are so we're
talking to Jeff and Joel and Jarrett
from the show and and this is awesome we
actually talked to them season 2 episode
5 as you remember that far back in hak5
history when they came out with their
like 10th episode or something like that
big huge premiere Bloor Street Theater
same kind of deal but now on TV so we
figured we'd do a little follow-up and
see how they're doing and you know
actually that's that's where we met you
season 2 episode 5 actually yeah I was
doing a micro battle outside in the
front line those good times yeah I gotta
dig through DV tapes and find that
footage one day I think i won yeah it's
like early early snubs footage good
stuff but yeah we understand that this
probably may not be your cup of tea but
I think you should stick around just
because it's highly interesting if
you're into new media and if you haven't
heard of pure ownage you need to go
check it out right now it's hilarious
you'll love it so let's just go ahead
and kick it over and
see the interview Jeff so guys we have a
unique opportunity to go and talk with
Jeff lepere the producer and writer and
everything extraordinary of pure
illnesses check it out what dude Jeff
Darren from hak5 hey so good to see it's
been like what is it would we do this
like three years ago it's been the well
here's yeah yeah you guys were making
like the milestone of like your tenth
episode and that's right yes long way
all right well let's let's up in do an
interview yeah sounds good Jeff it's so
good to see you up here and I just gotta
say first of all like pure ownage on TV
how'd that come about oh well yeah you
know we did the web series for a number
of years and throughout the life the web
series we were kind of always talking to
showcase you know they were aware of the
show you know some of the execs came out
to one of our screenings and and they
were impressed but really we didn't they
didn't know what to do with us we didn't
know how to you know make a web show
into a TV show wasn't until we started
working with our executive producers Ron
man and catherine tate and they sort of
said Allah I know how to make this a TV
show and they got the right people
involved and yeah we just went from
there now it's premiering every Friday
at ten on showcase and you know I'm
really excited now I can say that with
the network that I produce for I've
heard the story a lot of going from TV
to online now what is the feeling been
overall going the other way well you
know if pure ownage is a success on TV
it might open up doors for more web
content producers to move to television
you know the mediums are still very
different i think that there's a huge
lack of legitimacy on the web you know
you might have a web show with a lot of
viewers but people don't really think of
that as being something as significant
you know finally when we when we move to
television I a lot of people are saying
oh congratulations you know it's going
to be a big thing now but really you
know we had a pretty big thing going on
the web but you know what the the
biggest difference i think is the
advertising dollars you know on
television you know the dollars per
eyeball that you can get for advertising
is still a lot more than what you would
pay for on the web so that really drives
the industry i'm not sure which way it's
going to go maybe we'll have more web
content producers moving to television
or maybe we'll have TV shows moving
to the web if there's better ways to
monetize it I'm not sure it's going to
be excited I'm exciting 10 years I think
the technology is going to change a lot
and it might change the industry so how
have you adjusted from the ad hoc nature
of like podcasting to working in
television proper now you know it hasn't
really been much of an adjustment
because really it's it's been a little
bit of specialization we can spend a lot
more time writing but you know we used
to do the web series it was very taxing
used to do everything ourselves we used
to you know find the locations you know
arrange all the actors and you know
right our skeleton scripts and a lot of
the stuff was improvisation and it was
very you know off the cuff which to give
it a unique feel but now it was really
nice working in television to have
people do things for you you know we had
a production designer build the sets you
know we had people make things happen
you write something in script and it
would show up the next day on set and
you'd be like wow I just wrote that you
know a couple days ago and here it is
you know what's happening so it was
really cool it didn't take me long to
get into the groove of production to
learn the ropes and so to go to the
production meetings and know who would
make what happened and how to get things
done so it was really nice it's nice
working in real TV so how is the writing
adapted to like the strict nature of
television with timing and add breaks
and that uh yea the rioting is it's we
had suddenly have a script supervisor
that would time out the scripts and she
would come back and say oh you know I
went through this and this is like you
know 23 minutes so we got to cut some
stuff for you guys have to write more
we're under time but at the end of the
day in the editing room we do have a lot
of freedom to to cut things out keep
things tighter it was very different
sticking to 22 minutes you know we had
to stick to 22 minutes on the second
right and so you're at the end of at the
end of the cod feel like wow that's a
great show just watch it all the way
through but we've got to find 30 seconds
to lose so you're just trimming here and
there and cutting it to the standard TV
length which isn't so bad but it's
painful you know there was one episode
number for that had so much material and
it was just a shame to cut it up and to
you know leave out a few jokes here and
there but in the end it's it's a very
tight high paced product and you know it
has more of the traditional TV structure
the 3x structure and all that so yeah it
might have it more of a TV field in the
web series but i think it's it's more
joke dense it's faster paced and i think
it's the best
stuff we've we've written so far so were
there any challenges in production that
you face that you just weren't expecting
when we're in production your personal
life is pretty much on hold you know you
have no time to do anything personally
you know you just get up in the morning
you're straight at work and then you
come home and you have half an hour to
write a few emails and catch up on that
and you just go straight to bed and
really it's you know things pile up and
it's you know everything becomes a
jumble there's so much going on at the
same time I wasn't sort of expecting a
you know the amount of work that would
be involved producing a show but after a
quick period of adaption you know if I
was very natural for me to get in the
swing of things and again you know
delegating is the key right you have so
many people you know when these
experienced people in television they
were just so amazing at their jobs and
you could just you know give them a
little bit of input and they come back
with you know better stuff than you ever
imagined you know the props guys for
example or the art department they were
really stellar so what are some of the
differences between the story in the
original series and now the TV theories
well it's a we call it a partial reboot
so if you haven't seen the web series
you'll be able to get to know the
characters you go to get to know the
pure on universe but if you have seen
the web series you won't be bored
watching the first few episodes so
there's a lot of introduction stuff we
have three of the characters Kyle Jeremy
FPS Doug coming over from the web series
and a few new characters who you'll meet
if you if you watched the first three
episodes and yeah it's the same style of
humor we've taken a lot of what's worked
on the web series a lot of the same
themes we visited but in a new way with
new jokes of course so you know we've
tried to stay true to the original feel
of pure ownage with having all new
material and sort of making it
accessible to everybody if whether
you've seen it or not so how does the
fan reaction been to the new series so
far it's been fantastic you know even
the people that don't live in Canada
have found ways to watch it and you know
getting a lot of positive feedback
online on our Facebook fan group and a
lot of the emails we get a very positive
so I think people are really excited to
see that you know puro
images has come to the next level in
this TV show and yeah yeah it's just
been nothing but positive there there
are there always be a few people a few
naysayers that that aren't on board but
that's that's to be expected all right
so what's the future hold for pure
ownage oh I hope we get a second season
you know if people are watching us on TV
and it's a you know people like a style
of humor and makes you laugh I hope we
can do it again you know it's amazing
experience amazing professional
experience making this and you know I
really hope we can do it again so what
are we going to see purely to the

it's good to be back in Toronto again
singing all the guys how are you doing
I'm doing good ah you know a little bit
sick oh that's okay so yeah just don't
breathe on me but I had a couple of
questions for you that is yes yeah I'm
all into acting and grow I throw a man
out there it's really you know that's
okay well I just wanted to know like
what's it like filming what used to be
an internet TV show on TV now have you
cuff come across any kind of problems as
an actor in front of the camera nail um
well it's a it's a trip yeah real editor
three words it's a completely different
experience actually it was really
exciting I wasn't really worried coming
into it um you know stepping on set and
you see 40 50 people staying around each
them Wow I sang all they've been doing
their job for 20 30 years they all know
what they're doing that the best of the
best and you step in the center there
and it just words on a page that you
wrote up and now you're talking there's
always people around they're capturing
it's a it's a pretty different
experience um then employing a camera on
the street with your buddy right and
yeah I'm filming a few scenes and
natural light guerrilla style but uh as
in that cut I guess it wasn't so
different from you know the artistic
side of things in terms of my
performance I wasn't concerned with the
who was holding the camera or her set
the lights up or anything it was mostly
the scheduling that I think had the
biggest impact on performances was the
fact that every minute of every day is
is scheduled in budget okay yeah there's
so many people saying out there at all
you know Union waves you know this isn't
cheap right and literally there's people
whose jobs are just to make sure that
every minutes met every seems made it
salt making the days we're getting
everything your day and it's
no it seems like you know we had a long
time to do with all these people now
making eight episodes in a couple months
is my task how then did you have to do
we have 32 days on set so four days of
shooting for episode which is you know
less than we would using the web series
by far so the biggest image here on the
web series you know Jeff could come over
we would do the scene as it was written
or improvised around it if I some more
stop poor self some beer here for a
couple out of this pump with new ideas
go holy shit actually really funny let's
Rishi let's do this let's do that and we
had that kind of time yeah to do that
when you don't have that time with a TV
show you know they need to need to know
your shit beforehand when you get there
and ready to get it done because
otherwise you had a lot of trouble was
there anything that you could or
couldn't do on set now that you could
are going to do when you were on the
internet I think theoretically yes we
were always really good at
self-censoring ourselves on the internet
yeah okay I never actually showed my
balls even though he could have no one
can stop us we could have made in this
true yeah we know it's honestly it could
have been a porno right yeah but we
could have had full frontal we get a
shock you soon we really wanted to so I
theoretical yes but um but the truth is
showcases limits are actually beyond our
own where we sent it ourselves in the
web so really so no so yeah wow that's
called a single moment although occasion
though we have quotas for certain words
yeah um you know we have like two fucks
per episode they like to limit the bags
and the gays because they have you know
yeah that's understandable homosexual
viewers on their channel that they don't
want to offend of course but we of
course don't use those words in any
homeless convenient sexual connotation
what so ever
and gamers and people that are small
know that so it's not a big concern of
course yes there's a lot of idiots get
mad about stuff so but always know it's
my point is that they would allow us to
pretty much do anything we would be
comfortable doing it's awesome that they
gave you that freedom to do whatever you
want it's really cool yeah it's really
really cool no I know a lot of the cast
Joel you and Jeff all came from me the
internet TV show parentage but what
about the rest of the cast how did you
find him or did showcase help you to
find them uh nope we've sort of honor on
to find them but we had guidance from
people that have made TV shows before so
I'm gonna hire the casting director in a
casting agency they you know they they
put up casting calls actors came in we
would serve screen by headshot a lot of
self tapes me Jeff Derek Harvey to show
runner mm-hmm and occasionally Michael
Kennedy the director the first couple of
episodes would sit in the room and we
would the audition these people and we
saw a lot of people whose parts in it
and the network is really involved they
have final approval over everything so
oh ok let's go cast someone in the show
our buddy ya know unfortunately we can't
just cast our buddy in the show but they
have to be someone good expecting that
especially the key roles like a role
like October they took very seriously
you know everything had to be right
Hutton and we're very lucky with
Melanie's um yeah October is the girl
right this october's of the lead female
okay yes she's extremely talented she's
the one that I was aiming at with that
question yeah I was very curious no she
got don't we found on castro she
actually came in for a different role oh
and and she just blew my mind and I
immediately had her of the October
script asked her to cold read it from
the hallway that's cool so she went on
the hallway sorry Esther's to take a
break if she didn't mind coloring she
didn't mind so she spent 40 minutes
reading over this line and came back in
and got the part I lose the
Wow she was just her yeah what's funny
is that she does this audition and then
he reports back to normal character and
talk to us appreciate hide the desk I'm
like well that's that's October the girl
dismount talk he goes that's really her
it turns out she's also really cool and
easy to work with so I think I think
we're lucky my little super cool people
are gonna love her honestly both I
remember some outside the show she
adorable and as a character on the show
she's adorable yeah she really is
actually in fact all around i think we
got really lucky yeah steam yeah I'm
really happy I'm one of my favorite
characters in the series who will be
debuting today theatre he's gonna come
until episode 3 he's played by a jade
and brown and yeah it was it you'll see
him he told me too much I haven't seen
episode 3 yet but no he's new series
regular and I'm a big fan of his
performances in buckle the character of
general pretty happiness good so what
about the all the scripts and everything
you say that you know she came in for a
cold read do you have an actual script
or are you allowed to improv and after
them this the scripts are tight and they
are written to be you know 22 minutes
and theory right they go through
multiple reanimated drafts kind of
getting to talk cold medications making
us or without you need a cup or the beer
of that combination you go back and
forth with the network a lot in the
script phase and it needs to sort of
hone it and get it down to a certain
time and sort of the Act structures and
the proper timing and yeah like I said
the very first question when there's so
many people are set right and there's a
lot of money involved you have to know
what you're doing before you get there
yeah they can't afford to have all these
two guys me internet list let's just sit
back and see what they do it's like know
that they kind of want to know before
what we're doing yeah but at the same
time whenever we had any free moments we
would try to squeeze in some replies
we always let the actress if they wanted
to make it their own just mark the best
performance that way yeah you really do
and in fact when I look back at this the
whole series my favorite were the
moments are all improvised moments that
came through and really reinforced
connecting in hindsight because as we
were feeling I'm like oh it's a real
shame we didn't get enough improvisation
here as much as I originally envisioned
we would be able to and then I look at
the finished product like wow like that
made it that made that minute like wow
holy shit i guess a lot of it really was
optimized but yeah reinforced the power
of a performance its improvised which is
something that scripted in and i think
it season two and we're going to try to
arrange it such a way that we can get
more improvisation if there's a season
204 so often I know okay I remember way
back in like high school when I did
plays we would always do all these
really retarded things before I play to
get into our characters and everything
so just personally what do you do to get
in character I was really curious about
this when the web show you step to beer
that changed you uh no it's kind of
embarrassing but I actually practice my
micro I approximate micro and I say like
I own noobs and call like a lot what
come on ha its animal call oh news com I
just sort of do that to get the accent
in yeah and then I start trying to bring
in new words and then I just to refresh
the accident fresh the character
swimming with his eyes and then I go
that's great it's embarrassing and
there's probably I'm sure it's on camera
or at least on audio me doing this if
they've left the tape running to see me
talking to myself Oh news that's like
talking into the mirror oh yeah a nice a
column two thousand times a day ha ha ha
it's like this is it's not even Thailand
like the Vista step yeah and the Jamiat
TV show you now I'm so I'm trying to
challenge myself a little bit must be a
little bit different in the web yeah
show in that inning in the meta story
right the TV show
operation from inside the web universe
right of course um so Jeremy dagger
acting it's the acting lessons and
everything so one of the character be a
little faster more upbeat more
television because the whole as your
nose the whole pace the show was a lot
of fun yes yeah so so instead of getting
to play new character and having that
life experience I'm like okay maybe I'll
just twist this one a bit bring them
another way great how's the feedback
been it screening so far you know what
it's been way more positive than I
expected really and now nationally I'm
maybe I'm a pessimist but our audience
is so hardcore yeah they watched the
show for five years they know what they
want right yeah they know the style of
pyramids they know they have
expectations that are established right
they have wants I knew mainstream
audience they they don't care they don't
like it expect so I thought they're
gonna come in they're going to see this
new format it's way faster pace Jeremy
talks after everyone moves faster you
know everything's exaggerated a little
it doesn't have that same that's a guy
just chillin shooting some random shit
in apartment no no it feels more like a
TV show and it is yeah the television
version of the web so pure ownage so I
thought honestly that first steps in I
expect the pharmacy erupted oh I gotta
suck so bad but I never I've never once
lost faith in fact that those same
people that think it sucks right away
yeah would buy episode four or five six
seven go holy fuck ok I love the show
it's just different it's just it's what
I love what it's very slightly different
but right away they were pretty
receptive to it so ok I'm I firmly
believe that the show's get
significantly better by the time you get
two three four five six seven I mean I
think they leave one and two in the dust
so I mean if people are loving excited
now I'm excited I want it to be I want
the series to have run so there's no
more is this going to happen all is it i
think in replace him are they gonna do
this or is she just don't add your
apartment i wonder seen the whole series
they go so there's no more
theorycrafting just like here's what it
was and let's see what let's talk about
it what you like to didn't like and see
if we can make a better season two so
good feedback do you think there will be
a second season you know what i think
ultimately will come down how do people
watch it on television
I think it's well we need to get it into
other knees you know how much ever had
yeah we do promo we talked to people
will you curse people to tweet about us
oh yeah you know and get the word of but
ultimately you know if people don't wash
it then then they're probably not going
to give us money to make another one at
which point I will be something else I'd
give you some money to make a second
season you know a lot of people know
that I would be really great is getting
some international sales and discussions
what we really need is to get sales in
the USA mm-hmm um really and there's so
many networks that I think the show is
appropriate for so we'll see what
happens so is there anything else that
you want to go ahead and say before I
head out premier ah well have fun thank
you I'm sure I well human minds
television show uh no I don't know I
don't know anything i'm thinking i was
cheesy I don't oh I'll be cheesy you
know yesterday I was on my BMX bike with
Joel with a backpack on with the camera
similar to that we were shooting some
gorilla shit so uh I guess I lined it
with even though I'm in a TV show now I
still enjoy picking up a camera and
shooting my buddy I thought on the
street doing some funny shit oh I which
will actually be seen by people in
something called the episode 19 of the
web series so that's pretty cool episode
19 and Alexa is yeah
well thank you so much dear and I really
appreciate it coming off I'll see you at

you want some sweetie oh yeah love
sleepy yes so I'm seriously I have to
ask you very very seriously can you say
boom headshot for me how did I know like
other those who first question so how do
your parents feel about you saying boom
headshot on television now instead of
just the internet where the caylaen my
mom is a little freaked out to be honest
really no she she she thinks dog
hilarious and it's funny because Doug's
mom for all the SEMA Show is quite the
slut yeah and my mom is the complete
opposite of dogs mom like so she finds
she finds that the most humorous
actually it's hot dogs mamas portray
because for some reason they're related
somehow i don't know what i have i have
seen the first episode mm-hmm and i know
that there's a little bit of wow in that
episode are we gonna see you play any
well never never we've ever seen me play
well actually that I you simply really
good no I used to play on admittedly a
while back but that was years ago just
to test the game out
okay so what are you playing right now
um I've been playing a lot of mag on the
ps3 which is like shocking longer even
to me because I'm not a big ps3 user
they usually just use it to play
blu-rays yeah that's about it but I was
so sick of modern warfare 2 ok I was
gonna ask if he's playing on 30 bullshit
the copters and everybody but a gun
actually killing me you know yeah that I
switched over to mag because all it is
is is a dude and his gun and yeah it's a
lot of fun do you still play a lot of a
counter-strike no I don't actually have
a bike demonstrate in years i'm actually
one of those guys that gets boring
easily i doubt i'll be playing mag in a
couple weeks you know i'll probably be
on to something else so i guess you
don't beat games very often I'll finish
a game oh yeah I'll definitely sit down
and finish the game like I just finished
playing heavy rain which I was actually
pretty very disappointed in the end
actually really was really good and I
was super excited the first like our two
plane I was like oh my god this game is
amazing at ya and then it kind of just
like okay well I'm kind of done like
having a shower and eating toast and
doing that kind of stuff so after a
while I'm not going to boring but yeah
my problems in all those games is that I
get really into it and I'll play it for
a long long time and then near the end I
just give up on a game and I don't end
up beating it so I don't we play like
beat two games I'm a completist so I I
even have to get all the achievements
even though you know that means nothing
it's just like I got another achievement
yes but that's gonna you know seneschal
this is personally I need to ask you
this because i'm sure there's like five
female fans out there that watch pee on
each other than like to get
nine million like dude fans so are you
single no no no oh who is this I don't
know who this is well she can come on to
the camera she can come on actually we
mentioned her in the last turn of you
she can come say hi this is October take
a buddy Melanie thing this visa the guys
from hak5 I just asked Joel he was
single he told me it wasn't so I'm a
little bit oh ah I knew it man I just
can't win I can never win with these
things sorry those people in drafting
this interview picket fence you are good
oh my god I'm in October
okay matter to you um you're completely
different from your character so how do
you get into your character um hahaha I
don't know it's just kind of a switch
kind of thing you just switch it on yeah
pretty much yeah I don't know where it
is it's hidden somewhere around here but
yeah doug is just I guess hard to
explain you know it's really it just you
don't just get I don't know it's go
psycho yeah pretty much Oh most extreme
part of me x 10 just and go nuts you
know again can you get into character
real quick funny ah probably not no not
right now give me some we're not in the
bar don't want to get kicked out don't
might get smashed I don't know how big a
tab is here oh yeah well alright I'll
end this with um you know I'm I love
acting and right now I do hak5 and it's
just on the internet you know we're on
revision3 and I've always wanted to
branch out and do more and keep on doing
that I think so from from your
perspective what kind of advice you give
somebody who's an online personality if
they want to get it to television um my
advice would be right a great story I
guess and try and try and capture that

that you're going after and and just go
