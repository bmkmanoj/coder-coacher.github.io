it's a really great way to contribute to
lots of your favorite podcasts I do it
myself
I am totally gung ho for it onto the
news I realized some folks out there may
hate this story but since it involved
information security I am reporting on
it if you don't like to hear about
anything involving government
affiliations with regards to InfoSec
please skip to this timecode in the
episode no matter who you voted for we
all want to know the truth in regards to
hacks and that is why we do what we do
please respect your fellow commenters On
June 5th the intercept posted a top
secret NSA documents that detailed more
information about Russian hacking just
before the 2016 US election since that
day much has transpired around this
document and the person that leaked it
for starters the document was dated May
5th 2017 so it is very new and it
details how Russian actors of the
Russian general staff main intelligence
Directorate which is the GRU for short
use spear phishing emails against over
100 election officials right before the
election and how they attacked a voting
software supplier in August the document
explains what was done but doesn't go
into detail on the technical aspects of
any hack attempts to work the phishing
campaign got victim users to click on a
malicious link that looked like a Google
Alert email according to the NSA doc it
is likely at least one target was
compromised out of seven potential
victims along with this the spear
phishing campaign used a Microsoft Word
document with a Trojan written in Visual
Basic to create a PowerShell instance on
the target machine the same actors
created email addresses to offer
election
related products or so they say which
would most likely be used later on for
more spearfishing the NSA suspects the
management of voter registration systems
were the targets and while not specified
clearly the document does reference
products made by VR systems in Florida
which was the most likely target the our
systems is in charge of running the
software and devices that tell election
officials who can vote on which election
day if the attackers were successful in
hacking a company like VR systems
implications could be rather huge they
could potentially cause voters to not be
able to vote on Election Day by editing
information on a voter registration
database but since a company like VR
systems only contracts out two counties
in a few different states the systems
are very decentralized the NSA doesn't
draw any conclusions in regards to what
information could have been compromised
or if it had any effect on the outcome
of the election prior to this leaked
document Russian President Vladimir
Putin denied any Russian involvement in
hacking foreign elections
previously the Obama administration had
released reports in January which we
also reported on on regards to election
hacking concluding that Russian actors
were involved in propaganda efforts the
information from this new document was
made based on details the NSA acquired
in April of 2017 after that first report
about an hour after the leaked NSA Docs
were posted on the intercept the DOJ
announced the arrest of reality winner a
25 year old intelligence contractor at
her home in Augusta Georgia accusing her
of violating her clearance by leaking
the document she printed the document on
May 9th and mailed it to the intercept
but also had emailed the intercept from
her work computer though the subject of
those emails is unknown the intercept
shared the document with the NSA asking
for confirmation on its authenticity
the NSA then noticed creases making them
suspicious that it was printed which
they later confirmed by checking printer
logs by checking the document against
the quote fingerprints made from the
printer in question I didn't even know
fingerprints existed on printers that's
crazy they could also determine the date
time and serial number of the printer
used in an affidavit on the case if
found guilty she would be fined or
imprisoned for up to 10 years
or both winner admitted to an FBI agents
that she indeed then print in mail to
classified information to the intercept
and as of recording the date of her
trial has not been set
published today June 13th was a report
from Bloomberg on the severity of
Russian hacks into u.s. election systems
the article does not provide name
sources but it does say details were
provided by three people with direct
knowledge of the u.s. investigation the
article claims that 39 states were hit
by hacks on election systems and the
Obama administration stepped in to warn
the Kremlin that it could create a
broader conflict if hacks did not cease
Eric Schultz a spokesman for former
President Obama explained that they had
detected intrusions into websites run by
election officials and they wanted to
work with both parties to bolster cyber
defenses into the system according to
Bloomberg the DHS sent teens to affected
states to work on those defenses former
DHS secretary jeh Johnson said on August
3rd 2016 that they wanted to declare
state election systems as national
critical infrastructure but this was not
finalized until after the election On
January 6 2017 on October 1st the DHS
offered help to state election officials
to strengthen their defenses all of this
is according to statements on the DHS
website which for some reason Bloomberg
didn't link to but were easily found
online and linked below going along with
the whole Russia hacking election system
story is commis investigation firing in
subsequent Senate testimony we have
already covered the FBI investigation
the Clinton email hacks and commis
firing back in May which in turn
resulted in the Senate testimony in
early June during the testimony Comey
explained that he made memos of his
private meetings with Trump and Hill
Trump asked him for a pledge of loyalty
along with asking him to look past
Michael Flynn's transgressions on
Russian ties according to commis
testimony Trump also requested that
coming back down from investigations
into Flynn and the administration his
hearing left a lot of questions
unanswered or they were broad enough
that Baez Minds could fill in the rest
though during the event Comey also chose
to stay silent on some questions in
regards to trump colluding with Russia
and said he could not answer them in
open setting after the public testimony
Comey went into a private hearing which
we will likely not see any outcomes of
for several months first we had Stuxnet
and now we have crash override also
known as in destroyer in destroyer is
malware that was used seven months ago
to take down a Ukrainian power grid for
about an hour which thrust 230,000
people into darkness now cyber security
firms effect in dragos Inc are sharing
research which they believe shows that
outages may have just been a test of the
malware capabilities the toolkit is
modular meaning that it can be adapted
the best fit its victims and can exploit
four different protocols that are used
as standards in industrial systems
across Europe the Middle East and Asia
according to the researchers it could
also be used against some systems in the
United States the malware includes three
different parts there's a port scanner a
file wiper and two backdoors it's not
designed to destroy but to disrupt
critical infrastructure it also has a
time bomb so that could be used as a
specific time tuned to the attackers
preference researchers believe the
attacker has lots of knowledge on how
the industry works which ties into its
ability to be used against several
different protocols they also believe
that the attacks derived from a Russian
cyber group that has not been confirmed
