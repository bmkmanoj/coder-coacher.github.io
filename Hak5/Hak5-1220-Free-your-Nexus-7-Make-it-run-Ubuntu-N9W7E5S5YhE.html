on the Nexus 7 + f8 back box and matrix
all that and more this time on hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is Gerren kitchen and I'm Shannon
Morse and to weekly dose of Technology
Adam wears the same shirt week after
week Hayes dude it's the holidays
everybody like free records everything
and I know the magic of the Internet's
over at the rubies in three offices I
was like hey how's it going he's like 15
million shows to do oh yeah well yeah
they were kind of stressing out over at
the TWiT studio - oh really yeah yeah
they were all like leo has to pre-record
ads leo has to pre-record a hat and
everybody's freaking out and I was just
like dude chill like it'll get done calm
down
I know you know we should have just made
up news for the threat wire that really
important for the next week that would
have been awesome just like make up some
random stuff because you know nothing
happens around and canonical decided
that they're going to send every
keystroke to Santa Claus and they're
gonna make you pay for the next
operating system like for real this time
seriously I've even noticed when you go
to download Ubuntu it's like this almost
mandatory donation thing now you wanna
donate yeah yeah whatever you know I
honestly can't knock it it's like it's a
consistent experience they have you know
paid support if you do want to do it
with the enterprise as much as it's easy
to dog on Ubuntu right now with some of
their missteps I I still think overall
they're really helping lead the way in
free and open source software to the
general public like most people who have
never used Linux before their first
Linux will be Ubuntu yeah and I mean I'm
not saying like don't fight the good
fight and and doggone and when like they
do stupid stuff like not inform people
when like hey we got this
feature you might like where we check
Amazon for the calculators but this is
just like what happened with Instagram
or is it's a problem it is it's a if
you're not up front and say this is what
we're doing you know yep then you get a
lot of crap for it well speaking of
Ubuntu we have a lot of fun planned for
today we're doing some hacks hacks yes
I'm gonna show called hack 5 we're
getting into um so we're doing like
putting Ubuntu on the Nexus 7 and stuff
oh I like that
I like that or the Nintendo DS we could
do that let's do the Nexus 7 cuz I'm
sure he just got one for Christmas or
something
yes Darrin had one so I took it and I'm
gonna put it 1 2 on it and hopefully it
works alright let's do it
I guess this means that I won't be able
to run Android on it anymore what you
switch it back yeah you could do that -
honestly I'm curious to see what how
unity is going to be on a touch
interface because remember last it was
last CS which by the way like a we're
gonna be at CES this year but last CES
has it really been a year in the year oh
you Majoli we're talking and canonical
people about Ubuntu coming to the
television and the Roku TV and basically
you know that's when they were first
making that transition to unity and it's
like a lot of people like this doesn't
make sense
and their whole vision or at least from
what they explained to us was that
there's one consistent kind of unified
experience hence the name unity across
your television your tablet your you
know laptop I don't think it's gonna
work it sounds very like one consistent
PC oh well I mean that's that's good -
anyway that's the philosophy you know
the Wikipedia article on Ubu talking
about the operating system um I don't
know that this probably indicates that
we'll see I've been to fo well I guess
we did see an Ubuntu phone remember yes
we saw that you can dock with the thing
that he comes at the anyway we're
rambling I'm ready all right a little
bit we've been doing this all day I'm
ready for Christmas wait a minute
that just happened oh yeah ok so to do
this on your Nexus 7 you need
one and nexus7 - obviously a microUSB
cable for your Nexus 7 that turns into a
USB so you can plug it into your
computer in what am i on three a boon to
desktop computer 12 104 or later yes 12
point oh four or later
LTS or later so that you can download
the desktop installer because it's all
just pretty much there for you on your
PC let's get into it so let's get the
Installer what do we do okay so first
off you need to sudo ad apt repository
and this is the Nexus 7 installer so
I'll go ahead and do that
tory's you want to add this should I
press on yeah you should okay we're
going to assume this to be a safe go
ahead okay well right I guess it were
you're gonna have to update your apt now
my apt get my getting yeah because if
you so I'm gonna sudo apt-get my updates
not updates just update so that's going
through all of your different hey what
apps do you have for me oh you have this
one cool so when you say a pin saw
whatever the thing is it don't know what
you're pulling or you to check for that
package
it'll be like okay you got it now I'm
going to is that done
okay cool it's done so now I do sudo
apt-get install the abouttwo Nexus 7
installer and it's called the Ubuntu -
next - seven - installer see that's what
I'm saying - instead of tak yeah that
was gonna be read you know weirding me
out here sorry do you just press Enter
instead of oh my god it worked
huh that was cool now let's see if I
actually remember to just press ENTER
instead of pressing Y for yes next time
I have to download so let's speed this
up and make it look like your computer's
really fast oh wait it finished okay
cool
all right well then let's hopefully it
works cuz that was not okay cool so
what's next just connecting this to the
computer uh yeah so now to unlock your
Nexus 7 is this one on this is I
man locked up but if it's not unlocked
how would I go about okay so if it
wasn't you want to reboot into the
Android bootloader first you power down
alright let me show that here powering
down power off and then you hold the
volume down button and press the power
button and you continue holding these
until until you get to this bootloader
ue o UI okay here we go
okay so I'm holding right down and then
hold the volume button and press the
power button or hello continue holding
these two the bootloader hey look hey
he's all opened interesting okay and
what next is dirty and then you plug in
the device to your laptop or your
computer with a micro USB court cord
there we go
other way other way oh it's the little
icon on the top thanks you know you know
this I use it and the device almost like
it's a universal serial bus it should
continue to explain your bootloader GUI
on there yes and hopefully it does so it
looks like lock state unlocked unlocked
okay perfect so we're already on load
its happy so now we want to verify that
this little guy the Nexus 7 is actually
seen by our laptop so to do that I'll
put in let me clear this see I got into
that habit because of youth that whole
clear thing yeah or ctrl L whichever one
ctrl L and then we want to put in let's
see sudo fastboot devices okay so no
fastboot devices okay so that should be
the Nexus 7 yeah I guess I'm assuming it
is because it's the only thing that I
have logged in easy way to find out I
just unplugged this guy here and now run
it again okay yeah no sees nothing
awesome okay yeah that's what it was we
try it again
huzzah yay troubleshooting so now we
want to unlock the bootloader and to do
that you
sudo fastboot OEM unlock all right and
I'm already unlocked so we know that
ours is unlocked so we're good but if it
isn't then you just do that and then you
want to reboot with sudo fastboot reboot
bootloader or you can also just you know
how a machine thanks yes so we're done
with that part so far pretty next you
want you and you should see lock state
unlocked on the device as well just make
sure that you do if not you probably did
it wrong so now you want to make sure
that you install Ubuntu 1304 which is
the developer preview on to the Nexus 7
right we're getting next year's build
already ok so to do this you want to
search for Nexus from the dash and
hopefully you should find it soon Nexus
there it is went record Nexus 7
installer so you just follow the
on-screen instructions for this and it
should work so you press agree install
Lubuntu Nexus 7 so this is gonna
overwrite my existing Android yes aha
but you release download images connect
your device in fastboot mood which we
already have seen own engine issues wiki
page if you have any issues now they say
that the whole download is going to take
about 2 minutes or so and then the whole
reboot process for the actual device
will take about 10 to 15 minutes all
right well let's let it do its a
progress bar thing let's do the thing
Paul speed up the progress bar and
huzzah through the miracles of video
editing that only took a split second
yeah except it took a lot longer now
yeah she's been meowing the entire time
that has been loading yeah so it says
preparing the root filesystem please
wait this will take a few minutes yeah
computer says basically the same thing
so now we just wait a few minutes and
get her some milk again
she's like meows yeah
so once it transfers over the bootloader
yeah what it takes like 10-15 minutes so
you got to be pretty patient with it
file system the kernel and all of those
operating system yeah it explains
everything on the device which is Adam
crazy because it's using well I guess it
is a quad-core processor but yeah so
it's fast enough yeah and then you'll
see it go through every all the
processes I'll tell you that you like
expanding dye and you know extracting
files Dyne and then eventually you
should see it do the normal boot up
screen where it says Ubuntu and gives
you those four little dots where you can
tell that it's loading and then you'll
see this screen look at that we're in
unity it's working this is welcoming
English is chosen so you continue is its
no okay it's no shoes network and on
screen pass a keyboard for the password
let's see so it's very small especially
for the Nexus 7 screen I feel like as a
touchscreen that might be a little yeah
if you have you know big man hands I'm
assuming you could plug a mouse and
keyboard into it I mean as a computer in
fact this is a 720p display the
resolution of the Nexus 7 is the same as
your 11 inch laptop right now Wow so
that kind of photographers can make it
look really small that's a the same
resolution of this machine right here
and this is only five eight inches dan
yeah just imagine trying to press all
the buttons on that machine oh Lord
so what are you doing right now so
basically it it's the same kind of stuff
that you used to setting up when you
install Ubuntu initially it's asking you
your name it suggests a name for the
laptop and I'm sorry the laptop well
suggest the name it says your computer's
name whatever your name is - laptop yeah
that's interesting
instead of like tablet I'll give it a
really bad password by not gonna like
that
probably yeah weak password
arrey password alright removing windows
around is not exactly the easiest thing
wait there we go I'll get automatically
sure and there we go now we're actually
in the installation so before we're just
in the part where it's expanding the
operating system so I guess let's just
sit around and wait for this to finish
installing cool ok so once you have a
boon to actually installed which takes
about 30 minutes or so it looks just
like it does on a regular desktop
computer except it's such a small
monitor I can't actually
I can't imagine using this on a
day-to-day basis so one tiny no come on
it's just maybe I would like an external
external keyboard then it would be you
know but turns out you can so the
paradigm is is very much the same as the
desktop you can see I've opened up
Firefox here and I see a little bit of
lying around I have two cares you can't
do that with your iPhone I mean this is
really cool I have a windowing
environment that I'm kind of used to I
mean this is unity here we can say we
really have amazon over here but yeah we
really know for if I could find a way to
get the terminal open we would be able
to go ahead and apt-get install gnome 3
if we wanted or KDE or exit is your
keyboard oh there's my key well let's
see terminal this will give you a kind
of an example of the speed of it so it's
not checkmating I'm pretty horrible yeah
and when you open the browser that took
maybe eight seconds or so so not it's
Firefox it takes a little bit yeah what
what is pretty cool here is let's see
not hey watch this so I figured all
right so it's a computer it likes
keyboards and just like we were doing on
Android previously with the oh yeah
doesn't have to fast so just just to
make sure let's see if it works I don't
see any reason I hate microUSB come on
oh there we go
hello world pound hello world all day
long my hello world pale that is so
oh yeah I don't know I like it I think
this probably I mean if you're not a fan
of Android this is you could always
switch over to mu-2 if you really really
wanted to you can switch back it to if
you want it don't have instructions on
how to switch back if this is your your
bag of D yes exactly so you could always
switch back if you want to back to
Android if you'd ended up not liking
this but you know it it seems for decent
speeds it seems to have decent speeds it
connects just like a normal desktop
would well you know I don't know so we
showed off like how to set up you know
like drag horn go through and this isn't
no I'm not belittling any of this effort
at all or anything I'm just saying like
dragger and suppose all this time
porting over you know parts of kismet
bring out to the Android platform and
then Android now just runs Ubu to so I
can pretty much guarantee you if I were
to plug this into that and then LS us
actually that's a great example let's do
that let's plug an alpha in because I am
curious about that and pay maybe it
doesn't work at all but boy I wonder if
it work I'm just gonna take everything
and plug it into the Nexus 7 what I want
to know is is it just like having a
regular computer and I do LS USB and
I've got nothing but the root hub can
you can you do the regular alpha and POW
and the kernel modules for this our
neural normally on in their bed default
so there's the up-arrow oh and it's not
there
that's sad let's see a D message did it
see it
no no it doesn't it doesn't see it it
says USB to disconnected mm-hm
yeah it doesn't see anything about it I
am going to not lose faith I'm going to
suspect that it's because I'm using an
on the go weird on the go adapter this
converts which to basically this adapter
has been five grounded so do you think
if you switch to just a micro to micro
it would work it would be a microtome
mini in the case of that but yeah if it
was a great cable it might do the trick
I don't know for sure but it's worth
investigating some more I think yes it's
pretty cool if you say you have some
specialized application that you want to
bring into a form factor like this
that's the beautiful thing about Linux
being so universal you know I'm less so
excited about running unity on this yeah
as I am now I have the power of Linux in
my hand and Android wasn't it yeah
there's a lot of differences this is yet
this is really neat I'm it is still in
development so I can't wait to see what
boon to comes up with as far as ya know
not just 1304 but for this specific one
as well well this this one is totally
just like a hack right now I mean yeah
you're gonna sit there playing Angry
Birds on this and if you could with like
a you know a Linux app or something or
flash or whatever it would not be the
same experience it's pretty cool though
I gotta say it's it's very neat that we
can do it and it's very easy to
surprisingly what do you guys think what
what platform needs Linux to be ported
to it next we get Linux on a Nintendo 64
what I have an iPad at home I want to
put I have a Nintendo 64 at home that's
pretty cool
anyway yes we're gonna be back right
after this quick break
if you're setting up a website to start
your new business showcase your
portfolio publish your blog domain.com
is the best place to go for your next
great idea if you need to get a domain
name consider getting yourself a.com
co.com domain is the original we all
know it's globally understood
immediately lends credibility no matter
what you choose plus if you're into
investing in buying and selling domains
coms of the highest after market value
you can find yourself calm over at
domain.com Shannon and I are huge fans
of them because they're affordable
reliable easy to use and plus domain
coms active social media presence on
Twitter at domain.com you know they have
a great customer service they're really
just a fun place to do business so the
guys over at domain.com they're huge
fans of you guys in hak5 and they want
to lock us all up to get 15% off they're
already affordable domain names and web
hosting all you have to do is use the
coupon code hak5 at domain comms check
out that's 15% off in big savings don't
forget to use the coupon code hak5 when
you think domain names think domain.com
time once again to check for one 10 so
the first question comes from Nick and
it's actually a little bit of feedback
he says in backtrack go over to system
tools and enter a p-- and have fun Athar
ape is a really cool tool if you've
never seen it to monitoring tool that's
all graphical and pretty ah it works for
all sorts of types of networks including
Wireless in fact kind of following up
with what we just did a moment ago with
the the Nexus it's like well here it is
actually running at the rate you don't
see a whole lot of interesting stuff
going on right now let me pull up
Firefox again and it's some web traffic
going on there you go yeah you can start
seeing as things happen on the network
and if this were like you know in
promiscuous man you can see it
connecting to different servers and
again the different sizes like you know
different bits of data it's really cool
yeah and I think this is a perfect
example of a use case where you'd want
to do this bringing Linux to your tablet
because no one that's awesome who who's
gonna port that's their rate after 8 not
to enjoyed but after 8 over to Android
it's like well you know of all the fun's
over in Linux
thanks to the party now the next
question comes from in it zero in he
says thank you for the excellent review
of BAC box I've used the cozy little
distro and have to say that it's
impressive
I'm currently remix in it with the
cinnamon desktop and it's turning out to
be very promising the main issue that I
have with pen 2 is its long refresh
cycle the last major release was in 2009
it was a great distro then and I can
hardly wait to see what the latest
iteration will hold one destroyer that
you may like to may want to take for a
test drive is called matrix this French
distro is great as a great middle ground
between backtrack and back box and it's
more suitable than backtrack as a
day-to-day OS and is more robust than
back box still no matter how far I roam
I always find myself coming home to good
old backtrack thanks for all that do you
do and errand for the community you know
I must say that this is one of those
things where in a perfect world it
really wouldn't matter that pen to
hasn't been updated since 2009 because
as there's a lot of other options well
not just the fact that there are other
options though the idea is it's Linux
their source code they're you know
Reaver WPS comes out and well you know
grab the tarball config make compile it
and Bob's your uncle and the idea being
you're not limited to a release cycle of
an operating system when you need a new
tool and you're not that said the
reality is a lot of these tools take a
lot of weird dependencies it's really
tough to get everything to work together
nicely and one you need to get the job
done backtrack has really proven
themselves over the last four so years
of of being able to do that and so I
find myself also going back to backtrack
when suddenly like you know this should
be easy I just want to get XYZ done it's
not compiling right I can't find that
one version of Lib USB or USB Python or
whatever it is
hey let me just boot up this VM and it
works so there's a lot to be said there
I think matriarch so I was just looking
at it just like you said it's very much
you know this in the same vein of that
it's like it's a security distro for you
know anybody looking to do penetration
testing and not a day in forensics and
all of that sorts so I'm just gonna say
Helia to you French guys keep doing this
we need you know not not a creation
invent the wheel and it's not really
competition but more choice more choice
is always gonna be better
I agree now it's time for the
Technosphere oh of the week Sean sends
us a picture of his wonderful prize of
Wi-Fi pineapple that he got out of a
cereal box
