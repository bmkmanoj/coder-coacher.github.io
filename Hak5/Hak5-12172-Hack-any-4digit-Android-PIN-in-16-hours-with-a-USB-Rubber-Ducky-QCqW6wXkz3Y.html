Shutterstock wait i just created a huge
file that does zero through nine nine
nine and that's what's important to me
in fact if I do if I do a more on that
file whoops
Mor more on brute v txt you'll see that
again it does to begin with that delay
oops and then it starts doing its thing
so I'm pretty happy with that so let's
go ahead and put this on a duct
I've got a USB rubber ducky right here
outside of its case and I've got it
plugged into some people asked about
this this is simply an OTG adapter we've
now coupled the ducky with this and this
will get you going on on any Android and
really any OTG adapter will do I just
like the little tiny dongle II ones it's
not a female a two male micro adapter
it's specifically an OTG so what they do
is they ground pin five on this side and
then that tells the Android phone that
this is OD G and I think we've gotten
into that in a separate segment but that
said let's pull out the SIM card II up
micro SD card put that little guy into
our reader and pop that in my machine
and it shows up here so if I do is /ls
slash media and this guy here you can
see I already have an inject up in on
there so I'm going to remove that and
rather than use the online duct encoder
I'll just do it the old-school way and
do Java TAC jar duct encoder
this is duct encoder 1.2 you could also
do the same thing with the new encoder
2.1 which does multiple languages and
you can find links to that a USB rubber
ducky com
regardless I'm just going to take that
file that we just created root five dot
txt and turn it into an inject in which
I can then put on the duck and it'll
start quacking it so tack I for my input
file root five txt tack oh you know I'll
just leave you here if I don't specify
anything else it will make an inject top
bin right here back to let me make sure
that is the latest and do it again you
should have ever written it but we'll
see and so now I'll move that
inject
into my SD card I'm going to run sync
this will make sure that my file systems
all synced up and happy and then eject
or I could just click that at the bottom
there and hurray now I should be able to
unplug this guy let's test it out so
alright so with our phone turned on I'm
just going to go ahead and plug in the
duck and it's going to wait about five
seconds before it starts doing its magic
we put that delay in there and that's
just to make sure that it doesn't like
immediately start flooding the computer
with stuff and there we go we can see
the last digit when it gets to the end
because we are typing pretty quickly and
we went through zero zero zero zero
through zero zero zero three will get to
zero zero zero four and we've now done
five attempts I'm going to hit enter
twice remember and we're going to speed
this up right now so we don't have to
wait the full 30 seconds and zero zero
zero five zero zero zero six zero zero
zero seven zero zero zero eight and hey
would you look at that and there we go
now obviously I use the pen zero zero
zero eight for demonstration purposes so
it wouldn't take so long and so to give
you a little bit of an idea here with
that 30-second timeout theoretically
that gives us doing 10,000 keys that's
zero zero zero zero through 9999 about
six seconds per key now that would take
60,000 seconds so 60,000 seconds divided
by 60 that's a thousand minutes which
again divided by 60 would give us 16 and
a half hours that's actually not that
bad I mean if you like found a phone at
the bar the thing about that is you can
easily take the SIM card out of the
phone now remote wipe isn't going to
save you which is kind of crazy so just
to demonstrate that I actually have a
phone set up over here and this is my
Nexus and so what I thought was okay
after a little while though and this is
a nexus setup completely stock the only
thing I've changed is put the passcode
one two three four on it and there it
goes it says you have incorrectly typed
your PIN 760 times all right
my passcode in now 760 times and nothing
has happened and this is stock I really
assumed as well that Android security
was going to after 50 attempts or 100
attempts or something like that warm at
the device because if this falls into
enemy hands suddenly they've got all the
photos of my kitten on there bummer
right well okay that's assuming I'm
using a four-digit passcode and yes this
is a huge security blunder now there's
also ways to mitigate this for example
you can use encryption on the the device
and when you use an encryption on the
device when you boot up it asks you for
well I guess that is the same pen but
I'm assuming that has some different
lockout so I'm going to have to test
this out because I only started messing
with this but I thought it would be fun
to do a segment here kind of
demonstrating some of the caveats of
online brute-force attacks and some of
the fun capabilities of the USB rubber
ducky the other thing to keep in mind is
that that this is all assuming a
four-digit pin
so before digit pin can be brute-force
in 16 and a half hours well then what
would a five digit pin take well that
would take it said 2.0 five hours we're
talking about well that's it's
exponential I would it would take 166
hours and then but a ten digit pin would
take nearly 2,000 years of course all of
this is moot when you're using a weak
key and somebody can say put your phone
into a mode where they can pull the ROM
and actually do some cool forensics
analysis on this and for that there's an
awesome tool called santoku Linux and so
we're going to be playing with that a
little bit later but basically really
cool live distro that allows you to do
some fun forensics work on Android
including potentially pulling the key
out if it's weak enough which is awesome
so what else have we learned here
basically online brute force slow using
the USB rubber ducky there's also keep
in mind that it's kind of stupid if I
were to leave it running on this one it
would get to zero zero zero eight and
then it would keep typing zero zero zero
nine but we're in my home screen now and
on a long enough time line if you're
jamming at the keyboard on an Android
you're going to get angry birds' it's
just a fact of life so what could you do
I guess you could set up a camera or if
you get bored the nice thing about the
USB rubber ducky is you know it never
gets bored
it never gets tired it never has to pee
but in this case you would actually need
a human to sit here and say oh we've
tried seven hundred and seventy five
times so I've tried zero seven seven
five one of those anyway close enough
you can set up a camera with some
timecode to kind of figure out where it
cracked in but it's not a two-way device
so it doesn't know kind of now there's a
potential there to actually know what's
fun is Android actually gives away its
state in kind of a fun security feature
way where it doesn't allow MTP MTPs
media Transfer Protocol and it's the way
that photos are transferred from one
device to another say you know phone to
phone or phone to like a printer or
things of that nature and it doesn't
it's on by default but it doesn't allow
you to MTP a phone if the lockscreen end
is on so you would need something now
I'm not saying the duck can do this okay
but what I'm saying is if you had the
ability to query every other keys every
other a key attempt whether MTP is
enabled or not you would be able to tell
pretty much if you've gotten in or not
which is kind of useful so there's that
to keep in mind I'm going to say if it's
a four-digit pin code and you're the
Mafia then maybe you've got 16 hours to
kill just getting in the but I'm just
saying so hopefully all of this just
gets fixed in the latest update because
this is kind of like a no-brainer thing
that should be enabled by default your
you know advice to the consumer is you
know use a long enough pin code that it
like I said 10 digits is going to take
2,000 years or at that point they're
just gonna pull your ROM and do
forensics analysis anyway so use the
encryption in fact I'd go into androids
security setting and just check every
box you see I've even seen cool boxes
like if the SIM card changes go ahead
and format the device so you know that's
kind of fun and I thought this was a
excellent example of using brace
expansion with ducky script with a stock
phone and a little bit of online brute
force I wonder what your take is on this
bish
