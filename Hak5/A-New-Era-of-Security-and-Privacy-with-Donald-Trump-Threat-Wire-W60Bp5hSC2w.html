it secure use OAuth to sign in it might
open up your apps to account hijacking
and much much more coming up now on
threat wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for tuesday
november 15 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom good news for our
patrons over at patreon.com / threat
wire we are now offering an exclusive
patreon only audio feed of threat wire
you can copy our RSS link into your
favorite podcasting app to listen to our
show offline now you found the making of
the show so thank you for letting us
bring you security news every single
week signal is a popular encrypted text
messaging app for mobile devices and the
protocol for signal is also used in
Facebook's messenger whatsapp in
Google's new allo app with any platform
that both security you want to know that
it's actually secure by way of open
source code or known auditing by
security professionals and researchers
with this protocol being used by over 1
billion active people worldwide it is
very important in this case to luckily a
signal was recently audited by
researchers on three different
continents who found that there are no
major flaws in the signal encryption
code the analysis was completed by
researchers from the University of
Oxford in the UK Queensland University
of Technology in Australia and mcmaster
university in Canada they determined
that even in a unique environment where
a hacker could be watching traffic and
analyzing it the signal messages would
still be secret and authentication for
each party would still hold signal uses
ratcheting forward secrecy which is a
concept of encryption where the key
exchange between two different contexts
continuously updates during a
conversation so this also means that
older conversations can't be compromised
with new keys now while this is a really
terrible one-liner explanation I know it
is you can go read the entire
explanation on open whisper systems blog
which is linked below the study did not
include third-party implementations nor
did it include group messaging message
sharing across multiple devices or voice
and video call security so there is
definitely some more auditing to be done
but the
is a very positive start three security
researchers from the University of Hong
Kong gave a talk at black hat EU this
month regarding details of an oauth
exploit that could expose more than 1
billion accounts to possible hijacking
oh off 2 point 0 is used by tons of
different kind of apps to allow user to
securely log in with their Google or
their facebook login information for
example this is convenient because you
wouldn't have to create a new account
for a nap it's just authenticating you
via your already made accounts on other
providers websites but oh ah 2 point 0
has no standards set forth for
implementation of security so the
researchers looked at 600 top apps and
found 41.2 percent of them were
vulnerable to an attack using the
researchers exploit they were able to
log into a victim's account using the
OAuth 2 point 0 vulnerability and have
access to any and all details inside of
the app they used a man-in-the-middle
proxy to sniff traffic between the app
server and a victim's device allowing
them to catcher and spoof a user's ID
the researchers have recommended some
fixes to the app devs that they can
implement to help with the problem in
their paper which is also linked below
okay I realize 2016 is not quite over
yet but can we just call this the
largest tak of the year according to a
post by leaked source com the adult
dating network of sites called
friendfinder network was hacked just
last month with over 400 million
accounts usernames passwords and email
addresses being included in the breach
some dating back to the late 1990s yeah
that's like 20 years worth so many
accounts that were supposedly deleted
were also found in the leak of data so
they weren't actually gone yeah they
were still there mm-hmm so sites include
adultfriendfinder.com cams com
penthouse.com amongst others and for
friend finder network users I would just
recommend changing your passwords and be
on the lookout for any potential signs
that your data was leaked oh okay so we
don't get political on the show we
nearly discuss the security privacy and
Internet freedom lols that are currently
being enacted in the world especially in
the u.s. so with
guards to trump now while we are unable
to see into the future we can share some
insight into recent hacks six hours
after Trump was announced as the US
president elect a russian-led hacking
group called the Dukes who was also
involved in hacks of the DNC were found
sending spear phishing emails targeted
at non-government organizations and
political think takes with bodies of
texts such as find out what really
happened during the elections and
shocking truth about the election
rigging etc if user were to open one of
these attachments they'd be targeted
with a trojan made to give the attacker
access to their data but what does the
US election and donald trump's win mean
for privacy and security advocates
across the globe not just phishing
attacks from russian groups while a
republican run government could be
disastrous for any progressive changes
recently made in the privacy fields in
the united states the problem that we
are faced with is not knowing the truth
there have been tweet storms about net
neutrality being bad for media boycotts
against Apple for denying the FBI access
to a terrorist iPhone definitely
happened but we do not yet know what
kind of regulations Donald Trump will
plan for his presidency because well
written proposals are far and few in
between as privacy advocates ourself we
can offer some advice now would be a
good time to do your due diligence with
your own privacy and security and
consider becoming an active member of
privacy focus groups as well as paying
very close attention to the actions of
the government for the next four years
we could be in for a lot of changes or
not time will tell but I will not be
sitting around twiddling my thumbs while
those changes are made thank you again
