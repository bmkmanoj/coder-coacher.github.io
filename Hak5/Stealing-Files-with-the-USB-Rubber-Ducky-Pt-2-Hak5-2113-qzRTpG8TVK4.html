USB rubber ducky part 2 all that and
more this time on hack five hello open
hack five my name is darren kitchen my
name is shannon boy get your weekly dose
of techno lost welcome to this show
where's that turkey lust turkey was this
thanksgiving yet in the united states at
least well like tomorrow i think based
on the schedule that's in my head very
good we work too much
we work very hard but you know what i
did on Monday this week worked very hard
very alright well I got the I got my
hands on one of those NES classics the
Nintendo classic teeny tiny console it
has like thirty games installed yes I
have built retro pies you don't have to
comment about it we have like can i yeah
I think yeah this was fun
yeah retroarch I don't yeah I think so
yes that was the distro there's so many
but yeah the things really really cool
there was a little girl like in our
office one of our friends daughters and
she was playing Nintendo for like four
hours watching a six-year-old play Mario
Brothers for the first oh my gosh it was
adorable that's so adorable so much
nostalgia amazing you know this is
actually gonna be a little bit this the
segment is a little nostalgic for me
because I just pulled code from USB
switchblade for this why switch please
go back like five season two season
don't watch it it's terrible we're
mostly lit the entire time it's all in
standard definition so it's totally
unwatchable
there's beers in the fridge by the way I
know we should totally have money during
the break do you want to get a beer yeah
okay okay cool so this episode is gonna
be super fun this is part two of our
exfiltrating documents series where we
are learning how to use use a USB rubber
ducky to alpha skate itself and steal
documents from a computer from a target
computer so today we are continuing that
series with the USB rubber ducky in the
last part we tackled the stage air
payload of which enumerated the drive
letter of our USB flash drive and then
it executes
the stage payloads so today we're gonna
be looking at those stages and how they
work and then finally at the very end we
will be wrapping this up by combining
the USB rubber duckies hit attack with
Mass Storage firmware and encoding the
ducky script yes and you know what while
I go and run and grab the beers why
don't you explain why we're on such a
ducky kick and that is because we were
just the we the USB rubber ducky was
just featured on the TV show is NBC
that's right
break out break through break blacklist
blacklist we totally watch TV totally so
we were recently on a blacklist episode
they were basically going through like
the Wikipedia entry of the USB rubber
ducky describing how the attack works
and they were trying to find this person
who was able to hack into a network is
what it seems with the USB rubber ducky
by basically going up in person and
social engineering some people let me
see if I can get that video pulled up
for you guys um you're all ready what's
wrong everything
everything's wrong sir I did as you
ordered and isolated all the malicious
code or remnants of it buried deep in
our operating system the first that was
confused our firewalls should have
bounced it but then I realized the only
way we could have been breached was
through social engineering our physical
access with a rubber ducky
a lot keystroke injection attack
platform disguised as the thumb drive it
would bypass all standard
countermeasures by emulating a plug-in
keyboard reprogramming our host computer
as if the hacker was manually typing in
the code still the culprit would have to
plug in a thumb drive yes someone had to
do an FBI employee with level 4
clearance I spent the last 18 hours
collating logins with the first
appearance of the malicious code in
order to figure out who got pumped so we
could interview the employee and Mail
that hacker and it was you I I'll write
another system checker good you do that
I'll call back in 10 minutes
quack-quack bitch all right so I like
that black ghost video ridiculous random
hands it's yay hack shop that was the
hack shop one hand yeah like so there's
two hands one hand packing all of the
planet
so moving on anything on yes so very
excited because guess what we were able
to optimize the the staged payload to
like just bring it down to even less
characters which means faster yes more
intense yes so let's take a look okay
okay so this is the staged payload that
we were previously using and essentially
what this did was this is like a
one-liner that you can toss into the
windows run lines okay if I copy that I
can hit Windows key are see the last
thing that ran was notepad that way it
runs really quick you don't have to
worry about any GUI errors or things
like that yeah and this is these are the
simplest duckie payloads are the ones
that just bring up the run line and then
paste you know and type something in
here and in this case it types let's say
257 characters which is almost to the
limit the limit is 260 so that's great
what this does is it deletes the the run
actually I'll just go ahead and run this
part right here so you can see so
following up on last week essentially if
I do PowerShell and in quotes put that
okay and then a hit when you are again
and now notepad isn't in there it's all
blank so the first part of this seizure
is to get rid of you know clearing its
tracks and then the next part is to get
the volume for the drive that is labeled
DK assign it to a variable dollar sign
you P CD over to it and run DCM D off of
there nice well with a little bit of
help thank you everybody in the comments
that was able to help bring this down I
got it / - lets see 83 characters but
but you know what props to digster
getting it down to 65 characters so much
character that we save it's fewer
keystrokes that we actually have to
inject which makes the payload run even
that much faster and base
we're moving a lot of the heavy lifting
over to the various other stages that
we'll be running so one of the first
things that we did to actually speed
this up you know every character counts
yeah um
using a lot of aliases yes right my
photos as well as you know reducing the
actually not even using a variable so
previously everything was stored in a
variable U P I tried reducing that just
you know one more character to you and
then recycle it over here with you name
but this right here just goes ahead and
execute the actual CMD by by first
enumerated for the label and then
there's backing on the the back slash
adido CMD so it actually just this dot
right here is what's telling it to
actually run yeah and so it's kind of
like you know it's algebra it's like the
things in parentheses are gonna happen
first that happens first and then it
does the neat name plus d dot CMD and
then this is just escaping out because
we're in quotes and then basically what
we're doing now is looking for the dr
levitt letter' with the label underscore
rather than DK because that saves one
more character so we're down to like as
few possible characters i think but if
anybody can get this down from 65
characters to even fewer please by all
means and mad props to digster on
twitter for us and then that one by
because this this just is brilliant I
love this awesome Thank You internets
you guys are amazing
absolutely all right so what did the
stages do exactly well right now we're
just running D CMD which would be our
first of the stages and d dot CMD just
runs e dot CMD invisibly with IBBs okay
but let's actually take a look at how
that works yeah here is d CMD you can
see I've rammed out the previous version
of this stage which would basically
start CMD in a minimized state using
start slash men okay instead of doing
that I've just commented that out here
with REM I'm using a different method
completely which is to use C script
right which executes basically the
basic scripts and other scripts of that
nature this particular I yep VBS and I
WBS takes an input file which in this
case is ECM D this thing right here
which is a long bit of PowerShell you
can see it's quite a bit of stuff let's
go ahead and actually just run this in
PowerShell so I'm gonna go ahead and
take everything in quotes and we'll take
a look at this so if I open PowerShell
now and just go ahead and paste that we
can see that this one-liner creates a
variable wsh it's a new object it's a
comm objected to W script shell and then
it does the send keys this is really
interesting send keys kind of like the
ducky and yeah thankee caps lock so it's
telling the computer powershell that
it's running caps lock yeah basically
using send keys we could just send a
keystroke in PowerShell much the way the
USB rubber ducky sends a keystroke with
the string
ducky script that's actually pretty cool
it is kind of cool and what's really
interesting about this is if you take a
look at the rest of this basically we're
sending the key caps lock then we're
doing a sleep tack m4 milliseconds 250
right which is just going to wait for
your 250 milliseconds quarter of a
second it looks like it's even the same
thing over and it just does it a bunch
of times so when I run this and Qin and
this might be a little difficult to come
out on camera but take a look at my
keyboard right there oh yeah I see ok so
your caps lock has a little LED light on
it and it's going on and off right most
all muscle keyboards have caps lock LEDs
the reason that I want to do this is
because it allows me to have positive
confirmation that as soon as my stay at
my first stage has run you have a
physical visual confirmation a visual
confirmation that the first stage has
gone ahead and started executing nice
and then along the way I can use this
kind of technique to tell various
different stages if they have also
executed that's really smart you can get
LED lights from caps lock yeah num lock
and scroll lock on most modern computers
nowadays I go with caps lock because
it's what you're going to like
especially on like laptops yeah more
we only see that you don't release and
um lock lights and such but on desktop
PC is very common to see a lot yeah lock
nope I'm a little numb so I mean so if
somebody wanted to put in numbs lock or
what was the other one
scroll the scroll lock would they just
have to type out scroll lock just the
same way exactly that's the name of the
character or the key awesome was really
interesting about this though is the
state of num lock caps lock and scroll
lock is stored on the computer and can
be and so it's it's actually not stored
on the keyboard so those states can
actually be enumerated by the duck
probably outside of the scope for this
particular conversation but hmm
interesting stuff could be exfiltrated
slowly cool amazing those LEDs so moving
on from there moving on from there
basically the rest of this group your
boot is to run that C script so let's
take a look at that so it is C script i
VBS CMD because i could just run CMD
right and i can use start / min CMD to
just run it minimized but then I would
have a command prompt running at the
bottom of my screen I don't want that
this i dot VBS let's take a look at that
so this is the single one liner of VBS
and all this does is that it just does a
W script shell run of the file with this
argument that just tells it to to be I
know right it's it that's solely
obfuscated but essentially what this
does is it runs whatever batch file we
tell it invisibly why I said I was kind
of borrowed from the USB switchblade
that's cool so now we actually don't
need to worry about any further
obfuscation and actually because it's
all built in already it's all built in
originally the technique i was using was
to to do everything invisibly in the
batch of script and they have the batch
script just say installing Windows
updates and then he won the batch script
minimized so that if the user did click
on it it would be like oh das prompt
this is installing an update I'm not
going to touch that yeah yeah okay right
so let's take a look at what it does now
so this is finally ECM D which is now
running invisibly so I can actually get
rid of all of
stuff because it doesn't matter but
there you go installing Windows Update
first thing that we're gonna do is
delete those registry keys so this right
here reg delete we can just pass it any
registry key and we'll see right here I
have you know a couple of things in my
run line right let me go ahead and open
my CMD and go ahead and take a look at
this command so reg delete the actual
directory here in H key current user and
then tak F which will do a force because
otherwise it's gonna actually prompt us
so we want that tak F so it's interact
or it's non interactive okay and now
when I pull up the run line well it's
gone it's gone yeah okay so that's step
one second step is to go ahead and
create a couple of directories oh this
is a slurp okay this is a slurp slurping
comes from a old term called pods well
you showed us slurping last week when
you were slurping up the desktop text
documents so is this pretty much the
same this is the continuation of that
okay the nomenclature comes from an old
attack called pod slurping where some
journalists figured out that iPods are
mass storage so you can out of
organizations that was before I knew
anything about hacking right because oh
my gosh you could weigh back in the day
you could have 20 gigabytes on an iPad
or iPod and walk out of yeah or you
could pull up what was the name of not
Snowden the more recent guy that like
exfiltrated like terabytes from the NSA
Wow okay so anyway storage has gotten a
lot cheaper a lot faster a lot more
ubiquitous with the USB drives the term
is kind of just a nod to that so I'm
still using the slurp directory call it
whatever you'd like
but essentially what we're gonna end up
here is on my drive you see I've got
those three files the IE and D scripts
and if I go into slurp I don't have
anything yet so what I want to do is
create new directories for every time
that I run this on a different computer
so I've got this make directory command
to do exactly that and making a
directory with the variable DST so I
have to set that variable DST to
something so this set DST so it begins
with this really weird percentage sign
till the
zero so that is essentially the path to
this batch file I'd show you in an
interactive CMD but it's not gonna do
anything because I'm not in a batch file
if I did not go percent tilde d0 it's
gonna echo that back out but if I run
that in a batch file it'll actually tell
me actually hey let's do this for fun
fun dot CMD I don't know
echo percent tilde d0 control Z hit
enter there we go that's the quick and
fun way to make a make a file now if I
run fun it goes ahead C so it gets the
drive letter it gets the letter of where
we are so we're saying in this case set
a new variable to whatever Drive letter
we're on backslash slurp backslash well
computer your computer so okay I see
what's going on so if we echo as you
might imagine computer name it's
whatever your computer is named that's
great but if I use this on the same
computer multiple times I don't want to
overwrite files so I also want to get
the D so each time it's going to give
you a different date right now if I look
at the date the actual date environment
variable just gives us this like ugly
it's it's not the way that I want it to
be especially that space right there and
these slashes are going to cause some
confusion so to really pretty this up
and this was kind of a new one to me
it's kind of the equivalent of cut in
Linux but this is a fun one in Doss
basically you take the environment
variable right and then you put a colon
a tilde and then we can say - how many
characters and then comma how many
characters forward to do from that so
that's not gonna make much sense until
they hit Enter oh hang on let me echo it
because it was like mm reminds me of I I
don't know why yeah let me let me go
ahead and echo date again so we've got
it right above and now echo this and you
can see what I've done is I've gone back
so the string ends this is what I get
out of date what I'm saying here is
minus four is going back one two three
four characters then using the next four
so in that case it's one two three
four right so that's how I get 2016 out
of that yeah now I can continue
stringing those together with obviously
the next one is go back ten and go
forward two and now I have 2016 11 and
continue continue to continue and you
might imagine that yeah I have the
computer name underscore a date and
because we may do this multiple times
per day on the same computer amassing an
underscore and I essentially do the same
thing with time which as you might
imagine in of itself isn't very pretty
because we've got colons and dots but
suffice it to say the rest of this makes
it pretty that is so cool so that's just
to make our directory where we're going
to keep our slurp stuff I actually don't
need this this is just a redirection to
stay don't give me any output send it to
null since this is gonna be run hidden
anyway but whatever that couldn't hurt
okay then we're gonna do an if exists
user profile backslash documents so
that's just a simple if statement that
says hey do you have a user profile
backslash documents I know I do because
if I if I dir that cuz you're on Windows
cuz I'm on Windows actually hey check
this out Oh how'd that work these are
actually my aliases
oh you aliased it oh this is just these
are just stupid aliases i fat hang on
cat siegel nice windows backslash LSD so
you aliased a bunch of linux yeah then
actually the best ones like cat for
instance which I'm we're using right now
which lives in system 32 actual is cat
CMD will take in whatever the variables
are so I can send it up to four files
and it'll go ahead and do the equivalent
which is time well that's so great point
was weird what we were even talking
about we were oh right so if I LS that
say obviously I have documents yeah
great so I've got all sorts of cool
documents I want to to have fun with
those and let's go ahead and copy them
so I have them rubbed out here because
there's a couple of different variations
of this basically this X copy
and is the magic so this X copy is going
to use a couple of flags first /c is
going to continue even if an error
occurs /q is going to do it quietly
which I guess doesn't matter considering
it's invisible anyway /ji is going to
allow copying this encrypted files to an
unencrypted destination /y is going to
suppress any confirmations similar to
that /f in the the delete registry thing
and then /e is going to copy directories
and subdirectories including empty ones
right so what will happen is since I'm
looking for just certain information in
this case you're just looking for PDFs
exactly I'm just looking for PDFs even
if it finds a directory in fact let's go
ahead - to my documents over here if it
finds for example this Adobe directory
there's no PDF files in here Premiere
Pro and there's no PDF files in here
it's still going to copy these
directories just not populate them with
anything because it doesn't match what
I'm looking for which could be cool
because it will in addition to copying
all the files I want give me a directory
map of what else you know I can kind of
come up with an idea yeah what's there
especially if you're doing recon yeah
really cool you could end up with like
directory structure is like expense
reports backslash 2014 backslash what it
paid or whatever then you might be like
oh I should copy over CSVs
right mm-hmm in fact we could run this
command multiple times depending on the
different file extensions that we want
because here's the thing we could just
copy everything that might take a long
time though right how BIG's your flash
drive right and so basically depending
on it this goes back to the the very
beginning of our of our attack which is
to do reconnaissance and to do targeting
because there's no sense and just
shotgun getting everything yeah if I'm
trying to make a payload that's going to
execute quickly and just go after what I
want so I know if I'm going into you
know if I'm trying to get the Human
Resources files
maybe it's PDFs that I want yeah maybe
it is Excel sheets so I want XLS and
xlsx whatever the file extension is
whatever it is then I would go after
that okay I really depends yeah
so let's take a look here the
alternative to this is to use a slash S
which basically does the same thing
except it doesn't create the empty
directories I provide you know what yeah
we'll do that one and then lastly we're
going to blink caps lock again
so what happens is the first time we
execute this yeah it blinked links to
let us know that it's begun and now you
doesn't just go dark for a little while
and then at the end it's going to blinks
more yeah cool and in between we're not
gonna see anything on the screen and the
only thing that ever happens when we
actually run this is in ll show you
right now cuz I'm gonna go ahead and
save this this is awesome so I'm gonna
save this right now and I've actually
purchased this but I'm so lazy that I
haven't plugged in the license key
because I reinstalled I don't know if
anybody else is like me like that but
anyway
shoutout to sublime text it's a good
editor and the last part just blinks it
and I'm gonna go ahead and grab the
strip downstage or just those 65
characters and minimize everything else
and take a look at real quick you can
see here we are in like that wallpaper
by the way oh thank you you coming back
slush slurp there's nothing in it right
now I'm gonna go ahead and run that
which is what the USB rubber ducky is
gonna do windows key R type that hit
enter
PowerShell pops up disappears okay
and if I manually refresh nothing
happens well that didn't work yeah no it
didn't
yeah then why did it not work why did we
just spend the last five minutes
debugging the code because the
difference between my 83 character
stager payload and the 65 character
stager payload has one very key
difference let's take a look at that
because basically what I'm doing is I'm
saying hey PowerShell assigned to a
variable dollar sign you yeah the drive
letter with the label underscore then CD
to that drive letter and run CMD big
difference whereas this just runs DCM D
so what happens is it runs DCM D which
as we know will go ahead and and run our
C script I VBS II CMD and then all of
the other fun stuff will happen but what
it does is it essentially runs it
from within wherever the the working
directory is right it's not changing the
director so it doesn't do the CD - in
this case the T Drive or whatever it
doesn't do that first because of that
what happens is it runs the equivalent
of C script find out VBS CMD right here
which and then windows then you get an
error because it's not doing it because
it's not there because you know if idea
or its it's not there it's on the drive
that I actually have those files so
funnily enough in debugging this of
course Shannon goes Oh would it have
anything to do with that d0 till the
thing and it was a good guess I'm cold
yes going back to that really funky
characters that the alias right so we've
just updated DC MD now to do C script
hey C script go do in this case the
drive letter that this this batch files
residing on which is for me but for you
will be different maybe backslash I WB s
and then pass it again this was the
equivalent of a colon backslash Edo CMD
right so now that those files are saved
let me go ahead and go into my slurp
directory let me delete this yeah I want
I am going to delete the entire slurp
directory ctrl z yeah it's okay I just
recreate it and now we run that 65
character solution which I don't have in
my drop-down because guess what the
first part of that is it actually
deletes the the thingamabob or the
history which means I now have to come
to my notes and grab it again
so had I used this it would have been
fine but I want to use this because it's
gonna type a shorter the shortest
payload is the baddest bestest payload
so run that and here I'll go into slurp
directory so you can see it live
populate so all that the ducky pill is
going to do is once key are type this
and hit enter that pops up disappears
and now when we refresh the page or
refresh the there we go we have yeah
you're right time and if we go in there
hey look at this we've got files now
as you can see if I you know go into my
actually documents you've got a lot of
folders but this one grabbed a few
because it only grabs at the folders
that only recreated the ones that
actually have in this case PDF files
yeah like Ali and Chris's wedding I have
bridesmaid PDF which is hahaha you made
her a bridesmaid graphic right yeah they
they met at a pub so they've got a cute
little and I do a lot of illustration
and stuff so you know we made this one
which was wedding be really fun you know
the wedding is near buy me a beer right
and that cute yeah I know Darrin let's
get his illustrator on sometimes so we
know it works yeah I even have a w-9
less than 70 characters right that's
really cool
yay I just exfiltrated tax documents off
of My Documents folder that's awesome
yeah a little scary yes so I'm gonna
write all of these up for you guys to
just copy and paste and use it your
leisure what we're gonna do is next week
if we don't take a break we're going to
combine them into a ducky script and
flash drive mayhem device for your
exfiltrating goodness so cool yes this
is the part where as you have been
yelling at the screen saying no D tilde
parenthesis backslash would do it faster
leave those in the comments or just
leave D parenthesis until the backslash
and I will we'll be right back after a
quick break Jessie
the time once again to think are awesome
sponsor domain.com because they are both
awesome and a sponsor why I call them
that and I was actually just over at
domain.com recently because I was
registering a domain name for a super
secret awesome project and I go over to
domain calm because they have a super
simple checkout process it's fast it's
easy your website's gonna be up and
online in no time flat and also because
they get 20% off because I'm smart I use
the coupon code hak5 and you can be
smart too by using the coupon code hak5

pictures send them over to hashtag hack
5 you can send them over to Twitter
Instagram or Facebook to win some
awesome gear from the hack shop because
we love seeing what kind of tech and you
guys are hacking with so this week our
winner is hell hack he'll hit one hit
one who sends us is turtle exploit I'd
say hey you know what that's a Windows
Phone exploit right there that's a cute
turtle x-play I really that's really
before I saw the photos like oh right
