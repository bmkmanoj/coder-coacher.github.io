parts and you can steal all the cars oh
and yahoo killing more passwords all
that coming up now on threat liar
greetings I'm Patrick Norton and this is
threat wire for March 20 30 2016 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and thank
you to everyone that supports us on
patreon calm / threat water pretty big
update on the Apple versus FBI situation
quote on Sunday March twentieth 2016 an
outside party demonstrated to the FBI a
possible method for unlocking farooq's
iPhone them quote the DOJ here testing
is required to determine whether it is a
viable method that will not compromise
data on farooq's iphone if the method is
viable it should eliminate the need for
the assistance from Apple Inc AKA apple
set forth in the all writs act order in
this case Wow does that mean the FBI
Apple thing is done no it means there's
a timeout going on here basically what I
just read you is with the DOJ said when
they file a motion to vacate a hearing
in their ongoing battle to get Apple to
give them a tool to crack the San
Bernardino killers iphone I have no
belief that the FBI is going to continue
to preserve their ability to get
anything they want under the all writs
act however they are pretty certain that
they have a possible way to get into the
iphone that won't require Apple to
rewrite the code now if you want to get
your hardware hacking on to the nth
degree read Jonathan sidarskys blog
entry my take on the FBI's alternative
method it's a really interesting read
first it walks through seven options
sadarski deems unlikely for access to
the information on the phone then goes
deep into possible ways of copying the
nand storage off the device so it can be
reloaded to brute force the pin it is an
interesting look and gets into some of
the possibilities of what's going on
from the security standpoint and well
you know what go to the link in the show
notes if you're curious it's a good read
and it's amazing to start looking at the
myriad ways an organization like the FBI
can use security professionals to get
what they want we've been hearing
stories for a while about cars with
secure remote
knocking at ignition systems getting
unlocked without access to the factory
keys we've gotten emails from friends
that heard about it at Def Con the New
York Times Nick Bilton wrote about some
very personal experiences with his prize
getting broken into the lead him to
keeping his keys in his freezer when he
was at home the freezer trick by the way
apparently worked what's going on a
radial amplification attack essentially
pings your key makes a single from the
key so loud the car thinks the keys are
right there in the car now the a DAC a
German automobile club has verified it
in a big way wired rights at the a DAC
researchers say that 24 different
vehicles from 19 different manufacturers
we're all vulnerable allowing them and
not only reliably unlock the target
vehicles but also immediately drive them
away ow at a distance of several hundred
meters bigger al how much would a magic
car stealing kit set you back the a DAC
research is said about $225 in parts
check wired to see if your car is on the
list and don't assume your American car
is safe because it isn't on that list us
cars use different frequencies that the
a DAC researchers didn't test in the
meantime time to start looking for that
RF bag you bought for your passport or
start tucking your keys in the freezer
first thing when you get home people
trust video more than photographs right
it's harder to fake video without tons
of expensive equipment and pretty much
anybody with Photoshop can manipulate
any image with a lot less well talent
experience technique that makes the
stuff described by Stanford's Matias
nice nurs face-to-face real-time face
capture and reenactment of RGB videos
particularly interesting the summary is
a tad dry quote we present a novel
approach for real-time facial
reenactment of a monocular target video
sequence eg youtube video our goal is to
animate the facial expressions of the
target video by a source actor and
re-render the manipulated output video
in a photorealistic fashion ok let's
unpack that essentially they're mapping
facial expressions from their actor on
top of close-ups of George Bush Vladimir
Putin Donald Trump or President Obama
which means they can make some very very
interesting changes to how a person on
camera reacts or responds complete
emotional reaction changes or I would
have mad
speaks now we'll have a link to the show
notes to the YouTube video the team says
very using a commodity aka cheap
over-the-counter video camera which can
take spectacular Lee good video I
personally suspect the rendering the
stuff that happens on the back side is
pretty intense now if they can tie this
into modifying the audio in real time
and then turn it into a product or just
release the code what a little bit of
work did you get any politician
newscaster a YouTube star saying
anything which well color me scared that
could get ugly can't remember a password
passwords got stolen and folks access to
counts well neither of those is
particularly unusual these days which is
part of why Yahoo started offering
account key for yahoo mail users last
year essentially where a password would
go on the login process Yahoo sends a
push notification to your smartphone
asking if you're trying to sign in if
it's not you you say no essentially it's
two-factor authentication like Google's
verification without typing your
password first which kind of makes it
one factor authentication except there's
two people involved because it's you and
their servers in any case security week
reports that Yahoo is added Yahoo
Finance fantasy mail messenger and
sports to both iOS and Android in their
goal to keep killing the password
because yahoo is frustrated with people
breaking into people's accounts now I
know what you're thinking if you lose
your phone turns out you can go to a
computer the Yahoo sign in page and
answer the questions that appear on the
screen now I just hope those answers are
secure but dying passwords I'm okay with
that a big thank you from Shannon Darren
and I to everyone who supports the show
on patreon.com / threat wire you make it
possible for us to do this show every
week ad free become a patron and we may
even feature you're adorable fur babies
like these ones in the next episode
which would be right over here and by
the way if you donate more if more of
