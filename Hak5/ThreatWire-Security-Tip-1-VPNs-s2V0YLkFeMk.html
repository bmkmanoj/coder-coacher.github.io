snake-oil this time on threat wire a
VPNs a virtual private network they're
primarily used by businesses to connect
securely to the company intranet quickly
explain what a VPN is it encrypts the
data it basically sets up this tunnel of
your information that no one can hack
into it's basically scrambles all the
information your usernames or passwords
any of your transactions and it
basically allows you to create your own
small internet out of your own computer
and it allows you to bypass a lot of
these restrictions this should be no
surprise but the mainstream media is
amazing at fear-mongering the evils of
well pretty much any topic and when it
comes to computer security while they
can DOS out the FUD in spades when it
comes to the practical advice it's
always the same old tired get a VPN
what's that
so the grandma is sitting at home
thinking WTF VPN here's to you a VPN or
a virtual private network is not a
silver bullet to security I'm gonna say
that again it ain't jack
you see network security I mean security
in all points of the universe it's it
really comes down to trust and the
question is who do you trust
da trust your mom your ISP the NSA when
you go online to do something sensitive
like online banking for instance do
trust your laptop do you know who made
the silicon inside of that machine does
the manufacturer even know what's inside
of that machine do you know who wrote
the operating system where the network
stack or that bright and cheerful web
browser application with the cute little
lock icon I mean it is so much harder to
trust an unknown entity than it is to
trust your neighbor Bob he's a cool guy
but ultimately though to function in a
modern society you you have to give some
inherent trust to those systems much
like you have to accept the level of
risk associated with that so when you
use a VPN well while what you're really
doing is creating a secure encrypted
tunnel between two points' be it your
laptop and say some server and the cloud
somewhere essentially what you're doing
is you're giving your data to that VPN
server and at that point it gets poured
out unencrypted onto the pop
the Internet so while a VPN does protect
your sensitive internet traffic from
would-be eavesdropper between you and
say an open Wi-Fi network at the airport
or you know at the hotel and your VPN
server of choice it doesn't really do
much for you after that you see once
your internet traffic gets to the VPN
server it hits the open web and then
you're back to where you started which
is relying on non VPN security like HTTP
and most importantly when you're
creating this shielded tunnel between
you and the VPN server you're actually
handing over all of your Internet
traffic to that VPN provider be it your
local ISP or a raspberry pie in your
closet or a bunker in the Swiss Alps I
mean I know there are some crazy VPN
providers out there which begs the
question who's running this VPN you know
what's their privacy policy what's their
security history who are their corporate
or government overlords I mean how many
national security letters have they
received or even publicly acknowledged
you know when you're connected to a VPN
server that server has direct access to
your computer and a VPN provider can
eavesdrop on your internet traffic they
can log it forever they can modify the
bits in transit you know do something as
innocuous as inject some advertisements
into your web page or as malicious as a
full-fledged man-in-the-middle attack
against some of your most sensitive
browsing sessions so the fact is a VPN
simply shifts the point of trust and and
maybe that's a good thing you know maybe
you trust your ISP at home and that
server in the closet over say the free
Wi-Fi at the airport or the hotel I mean
I know I would but unfortunately a VPN
can also give a very false sense of
security don't get me wrong I'm not
saying VPNs are bad just that you should
know what you're getting into before
signing up for that bargain $2.00 a
month VPN because you could end up
getting a lot more than you bargained
for now I can't tell you which VPN to
trust hell I don't even trust my own
comcast Line here but I do want you to
be aware of the fact that a VPN isn't
the end-all be-all of securing your
connection so
regardless of whether or not you're
using a VPN secure your online banking
or just to watching Netflix be aware of
what you're handing over and now that's
why I want to know what are your
thoughts do you swear by a particular
provider are you rolling your own home
or have you gone full darknet you're
never looking back I look forward to
hearing your comments with that
I'm Darrin kitchen for threat wire stay
safe I'll see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
