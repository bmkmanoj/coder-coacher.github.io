patched and dumped all on the same day
and United gives out 1 million miles for
an exploit all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings humans I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for July
15 2015 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom first off a huge thanks to
everyone watching this show three times
a week and supporting us and thank you
for helping us pass our first major
milestone on patreon you guys deserve a
huge pat on the back so go ahead just
Pat yourselves on the back do the news
first up is a lot of news about hacking
team to catch up on today so on Tuesday
hacking team released a statement from
their chief operating officer saying
they'll release rebuilt version of their
internal infrastructure and RCS the
product that we previously reported that
the FBI had purchased version 10 of our
CS will be released in the fall along
with this we also learned that the RCS
product uses a rootkit installed on the
UV or the UEFI BIOS so that it remains
undetected and installed even when
someone reinstalls the operating system
or they stick in a new hard drive in
their machine now according to
researchers at trend micro the RCS agent
only works on computers with UV
biosystems made by inside in a mi but
those are both pretty popular biases now
an attacker most likely needs physical
access to install RCS on a target
machine so enabling a bios password and
enabling yuffie secure flash does help
now lastly is news on hacking team and
Bitcoin who to SOT now although bitcoin
is supposed to be anonymous hacking
teams are CS version 9.2 had a module
called money module which could track
crypto currencies by exploiting a file
called wallet dat dat which is used to
store the Bitcoin owners private keys
now with the RCS keylogger it wouldn't
take long to capture a password for an
encrypted wallet and use it to track
public transactions posted on the block
chain hmm adobe has released another
patch for flash as of Tuesday and this
one fixes to vulnerabilities found
during the
hacking team dumped mentioned in
previous episodes but today's story is
not just about that it's also about
Firefox and Facebook so first off
firefox by mozilla has blacklisted adobe
flash player 18.0 point zero point two
zero three that version now this means
that flash is disabled by default in
Firefox and you'll need to manually
update to the newest patched version of
flash if you decide to keep it this is
most likely a temporary move but at time
of recording flash was still blocked now
second is Facebook's chief security
officer on Twitter Alex Stamos of
facebook said it is time for Adobe to
announce the end of life for flash and
to ask the browsers to set kill bits on
the same day even if 18 months from now
one set date is the only way to
disentangle the dependencies and upgrade
the whole ecosystem at once it'll be a
day of celebration here in the hak5
warehouse that's for sure lastly for
today's stories apparently United
Airlines really is paying out on their
bug bounty program they just announced a
couple of months ago now Jordan wines a
founder of vector 35 in a professional
hacker was awarded a million miles for
reporting two bugs one of which was a
remote code execution vulnerability that
they paid out on United still does not
allow bug bounties on their onboard
Wi-Fi avionics or entertainment system
but wines pay on amounts to 40 domestic
flights and is worth 25 thousand dollars
so anybody fancy look at United sites
our featured comment today comes from
mark Hari I hope I said your last name
right who is in response to yet another
flash vulnerability says so basically we
have three options go totally Luddite
and skew all technology use text only
browsers or take a few risks online if
you can do without 75% of the web that's
great but what about the rest of us
telling us to uninstall flash and or
java is like telling us we can only use
Linux there's another fundamental flaw
in your logic html5 is not any safer in
fact because it's still new it's
extremely likely that as time goes by
more and more serious vulnerabilities
will be discovered it's a clear case of
the cure being worse than the illness
and it continues there's a middle ground
here and it consists of software makers
being
more responsible and users taking more
responsibility for their own actions and
security oh there are some really good
points in there and a few that I
personally disagree with the amount of
sites that you use flash is steadily
decreasing web technology surveys deems
only ten point six percent of the top 10
million actually use flash twenty-three
percent of the entire web according to
the HTTP archive and that number keeps
decreasing however some of those sites
are still very popular luckily many have
moved away from flash in the past couple
of years now wall flash isn't a huge
concern for the server of the site it is
for the user visiting that site most
sites use flash safely and they probably
aren't a huge concern for you as a user
because they we think are trustworthy
for example hulu but when you have tons
of sites that still use flash which
forces you to have to download flash as
user which then you might forget to
update or turn off which then inherently
makes the user vulnerable to cross-site
scripting attacks from other sites that
may very well be looking to exploit you
etc that is when we suggest you want to
install it and when it comes to html5
which is about five years now five years
old now I could make the same argument
for a lot of new technology I mean WP
was vulnerable so we got WPA but that
has problems too html5 is indeed still
new but it's also also safer than flash
html5 is also not a large target for a
lot of attackers and by using flash it's
kind of like using WEP you're basically
giving your computer to a criminal not
only that but each team of alpha or yeah
html5 is a standardization adobe flash
is a company owned third-party plugin so
no technology will ever be perfect but
it's a standardization and because it's
a game played between targets and
attackers we're always going to see that
it's basically like a tennis match we
need to keep up to date with the
technology and involved in advance and
advances will find vulnerabilities in
html5 too but those vulnerabilities will
create new security features and
enhancements and so on and so forth I do
agree that users do need to take
responsibility for their actions and
security and software devs need to
create products that are tried and true
before release but that's a
really big remark to make to most folks
out there on the internet and it'll take
really long time for us to get everyone
on board so thank you again for your
comment mark it was really insightful
and sorry for my really long rant but
this is really important to me I did
leave links in the show notes in case
you're interested in the thoughts that I
had and if you have comments on today's
stories leave them below before I go I
want to give a huge thanks to everyone
who has supported the show so far on
patreon and if you find value from this
you want to spare a few cents an episode
even a quarter a month which is about
two cents in episode so not much
consider becoming a patron at
patreon.com / threat wire we maven
feature you're adorable fur babies like
these ones which by the way Schrodinger
in Powerball are freaking adorable and
remember to check out our Google+
community our patreon our new t-shirts
available at the HEK shop com website I
hope you'll contribute and help us keep
this coming completely independent and
ad free and if you can't donate a like
share subscribe a t-shirt those co a
long way to the rat wired not net is the
place and with that I'm shanna morris
and i will see you on the Internet
hopefully without flash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
