the ben heck show yeah so this is a
prime you later kit that I saw it's a
just basic clock kit but it's more
design for learning how to solder and at
the end you wind up with something
that's actually very useful a clock that
you can set up on your mantel and admire
for years to come a lot of people that
i've sold kits to they will create their
own cases for it so they'll do sorts of
fancy laser cut plastic or maybe they'll
find a little like a cigar box and build
it into a cigar box there's tons of
different things people have done with
it there's even a guy of france who went
and did a bunch of work with brass
etching and some like furniture like a
drawer handle knobs and did this
absolutely amazing clock that it doesn't
look anything like this he completely
reinvented it but it was just amazing so
in bonus the basic idea is you've got a
an 8-bit microcontroller this is
actually the same ship that you would
find in in arduino before they switched
over to arm so this is an AVR eight at
mill microcontroller and a cot crystal
battery input few trends transistors and
resistors to create a constant current
source and the reason I have a constant
current source is that these meters are
deflected by an amount of current and so
by turning on and off the current source
really quickly I can create different
amounts of current and aggregate or on
average that cause the meters to deflect
at different angles depending so as the
microcontroller is keeping time it will
change the amount of average current
that goes into these meters causing them
to rest at different positions and
that's how how they show the time so
like a controller goes here the way the
circuit board is designed even if you
don't have a case in mind you can just
mount the meters directly to the circuit
board so you know the very easiest thing
you could possibly do is just mount you
know the hours meter here and the
minutes meter here there are different
gradations so you can actually get any
combination of
spacings from about like three and a
half inches up to eight inches or so and
then what I like to suggest is that you
just cut out like a cardboard from
picture frame that you bought at a store
mm-hmm mount the meters into those and
then you know you've got these nice
meters on the front all this bit is all
hidden behind and you've got something
you can just set up on a mantle or on a
desk somewhere so do you have to program
to my controller no comes right out of
the little manila packet with all of the
code already on the arm or on the on the
microcontroller and you just solder it
on following the 30-page instruction
manual and at the end you know in as
little as 15 minutes if you're really
good at soldering and follow following
the instructions you'll have a working
clock and how easy is it to solder how
many components we talking um it's it's
only order of about 20 25 I'd say some
of them are funny enough aren't actually
required I put some extra components on
there to make it easier to program as an
Arduino so it does work as an Arduino
device it has they Arduino bootloader
all that stuff so this is the big
components bag and put like Lego okay so
we've got here is a pre-programmed
microcontroller atmel AVR AVR eight in
fact I think it's at atmega16 8v battery
holder for two double A batteries for
what it's worth this design is probably
one of the lowest power plot kits that
you can find it'll run for over a year
on to double-a batteries Wow it could be
even better it's going to be worse
actually considering it's all based on
resistance no because there really isn't
much that's dissipative in the design so
there's really very little place to burn
power the battery holder is wired up to
you've got this DC plug which kind of
goes like that and then these are the
variable resistors that are used to
fine-tune the position of the meters
since their analog they're only accurate
is that how you said it no it's not how
you said it it's more a matter of
calibrating the analog meters because
they're only really precise to about two
percent and temperature variations will
actually cause the meters needles to
deflect a little bit cool so if they're
outside you know they're going to kind
of move around a little bit depending
upon whether but in a house or in office
it's very stable that's fantastic the
one caveat is you need to bring your own
serial adapter so if you plug in a
serial adapter you can connect to it via
the Arduino software and program it that
way but right out of the box right out
of the kit Meg so it's like letting a
sketch yeah yeah and in fact you know
the whole design is open source the
circuit board the sketch that operates
the clock it's all up on my github
repository github com size share brained
and yeah you can download it hack on it
do whatever you want much more stuff
come on everybody out there we go okay
so three micro switches one is used to
advance the hours so you just click on
this thing until the hour meter says the
right thing another button that does the
minutes and you click on this until the
minutes needle is set to the right point
and then this is a reset button it's
actually not necessary but if you're
going to do our dueno programming on the
on the cron you later kit it's nice to
be able to reset when you want to load a
new code a whole bunch of resistors a
lot of these go into the current source
a couple of these capacitors along with
the crystal are used to generate the 32
points 7 6 8 kilohertz clock which is
used to keep the time fair there's four
transistors which also factored into the
current source and then a couple of just
general purpose decoupling capacitors
which are used to keep the noise on the
voltage supply down so that the circuit
functions properly so how did you end up
bringing this to market well what was
the inspiration behind clock just wake
up one day like I'm going to make a
clock um it was it was more interesting
than that fortunately uh I have a friend
of mine who he he and I were working
together at the time and he had this
meter that he pulled out of some old
equipment and posited to me well could
you possibly make a clock out of this
and I was thinking you know one with one
meter I'm not sure you could never
really read the time of it properly but
maybe if you had two one did the hours
and 12 did the minutes that might work
so I went home and I kind of prototyped
it in and brought it in he thought it
was really cool and then began to
realize you know this would be a really
great way to teach people how to solder
the circuits very simple it's pretty
easy to understand how it all works if i
were to document it all up and create a
nice circuit board and maybe you know
kid it all into a couple of bags i can
sell this is a product see what happens
so this is one of two meters that comes
with the kit you can also I've known
several customers who bought their own
meters from various sort of you know
auction vintage estate sales where
they've gotten them out of old equipment
it's a little bit of extra credit
because you've got to go and figure out
like what the voltage or current of the
meter was even ten what it was
originally designed for it and sometimes
you have to remove components like
there's usually like a shot resistor or
something you have to pull out but one
way or another you can make another
meter type work yeah um so you can leave
it like this but then you have to sort
of deal in metric time yeah I had a
chemistry teacher back in high school
who had a metric clock which is kind of
cool so you can do kind of a metric
clock and just leave this meter in here
but yeah everyone will hate you yeah so
yeah the the common way to deal with
this is to pull out the metal face it's
retained by two screws in here so you
pull out the metal face and then I like
to just go and print out on an inkjet
printer I provide templates for doing
this I print out a new design maybe with
your own font however you want to do it
cut it out with a penknife and then use
some like a glue stick just kind of do
glue stick on the metal face glue the
pit the paper that you print it out yeah
do that and then yeah insert it back
into the meter tighten down the two
screws and you're done every once in a
while people run into trouble like maybe
the paper isn't completely flat the
needle kind of rubs up against it but
you know you usually just pull it out
push it down a little bit more wide over
sure yeah these are the these are the
terminals on which the noes just screw
in yeah there's made two there we go
that's sort of thought about walk up
walk up yeah so you can mount or attack
i have two meters you know just kind of
one there one here and just kind of hang
out that's fantastic so I did that and I
was really kind of nervous about like
really going into business doing this I
made the mistake which was actually a
very good mistake of emailing I think
filter own at on the make blog and he
loved it and immediately posted it to
the blog and suddenly I had like 50
orders and so at that point I was in
business nice and so this is like
actually pre Kickstarter and all of that
yeah yeah and I was just fortunate that
you know somebody really took an
interest in the product and basically
booted me into doing a real business
it's good to have somebody who will just
sort of push you or goad you into doing
the right thing even though you think
you're not ready it's just you know
sometimes you need someone to give you
that little shove off the cliff nice
where can people get these and how much
are they and what kind of skill does it
take um so the kit sells for forty nine
dollars I sell it on my website share
braincom it's like harebrained like you
know the rabbit and as part of my
product testing my wife who's a sort of
a user interaction user experience
designer I had her guinea pig the
instructions and without having any
prior soldering experience she sat down
in about half an hour following the
instructions was able to put together of
an operable kit and she plugged it in
and it worked so you know with no prior
experience if you're really looking to
get into soldering and start messing
around with electronics you pretty much
guaranteed success and frankly anyone
who's had problems who's emailed me
we've always worked it out you know
maybe they had a bad solder joint maybe
one of the parts went bad
that happens sometimes I always make
sure my customers wind up with a working
clock no matter where so no worries
that's Nicole see I braincom sure bring
