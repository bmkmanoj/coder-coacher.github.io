that was the coolest rip i went up to
Toronto to do a couple episodes of call
for help it was a ten-hour Drive 700
miles 1126 kilometers for the rest of
the world I would have been going on the
mind well I thought it was going to be
but I brought my favorite site on the
internet with me my ipod saved my life
and so did matt from Winona University
hooked me up with a program that allowed
me to time shift Pandora whoa okay let
everybody know what pandora is because
it's like the coolest thing pandora is a
site where you can go listen to music as
a radio station here's the coolest part
about it you can customize this radio
station institute specifically for you
pandora has a group of people who
strictly listen to songs to tag them for
certain you know vocal harmonics mellow
mellow guitarist um well if you try it
if you like a band or you like a song by
a band you can type in the name of the
song or the band itself like their whole
stuff and it will search out through all
the music library and grab all the
little tags that match and show you
stuff that you might like or you may not
like if you feel like what they play
then you can give it a thumbs down and
they won't play anything like that
anymore but if you give it a thumbs up
they'll play more stuff like it's great
at learning I gave it let's see the
shins and the killer is any suggested a
Mogan heap which led me to
fischerspooner and then you hooked me up
with jam and I think it's a great
service I actually pay for the three
dollars a month for the account so i
don't get the ads on the screen and it's
really an amazing service I love it I
can't live without at first heard about
it on inside the net and I've been using
it ever since when you tell me about it
I i went to it and within an hour I was
in love I listen to when i'm
photoshopping now i'm addicted yeah well
I listen to it at work but now I can
listen to it in the car because in time
shifting it okay so isn't that kind of
not against their terms of service yeah
well here's what I figure yes it is
against their terms of service I guess
right but what I'm doing is I'm paying
pandor the three dollars a month okay
I'm time shifting those songs so that I
can listen to them in the car okay and
then if I like what I hear I'll go and
buy the artist you know i'll hit up the
itunes music store and you know so I'm
supporting the are
some supporting Pandora and if I don't
like the tracks i'm just gonna believe
it so I don't feel like I'm so it's not
like you're selling it it's for just
kind of personal use its kind of
personal use strictly for you but yeah
it is against their terms of service so
don't sue us it was Matt from winona
University he said the program so his
fault not his haha alright let's take a
look at it so basically when you run
pandora i'm going to go ahead and play a
song here and turn this down just a bit
what it's doing is it will save this
file in a temp folder so here we can see
its access to and if you rename that to
da mp3 that'll work that's an mp3 file
but it doesn't have an ID three tag and
it doesn't have a file name show up is
like track one yeah it's nothing a
random name yeah it's not going to be
very odd pod friendly at all so what
we've got here is this this java applet
and i'm going to go ahead and run
pandora that's the bat file to start it
and then period for this directory and
what that's going to do is use this
program to scrape the artist name and
the title of the track from the title
bar in Firefox and create the id3 tags
and the file name for it so it's copying
access one and if i head over here to my
pandora folder you can see there's my
mp3 file if I open that up there it is
and a lamp and it's got the correct id3
tag and it's playing and it's exactly
what I want and I can leave this Java
program running all night and then in
the morning sync it up to my ipod bro in
a playlist listen to it on the way home
from so you're good for a 10 hour drive
I'm good for a 10 hour drive and I'm
writing down stuff that I like so I want
to get home I can download it on I keep
a notebook by my computer for the same
reason so I suggest everybody head over
to our website check it out and thank
you matthew from winona university for
the awesome hook up thanks not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
