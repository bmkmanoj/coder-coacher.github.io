you how to control your household lights
over the Internet this time we're going
to take it a step further with a webcam
so you can see what's going on your
house while you're away all right are we
going to use a normal USB well for this
normally we've used one of these
inexpensive USP webcams but in this
particular scenario server and the
webcam are going to be pretty far away
so we don't want to use us because
there's a finite amount of length we can
use with extensions and whatnot before
we get signal loss okay so what about
x10 wireless we could go with the x10
but as you probably already know one
they're expensive and too if you've seen
from the shadows or system that can be
easily picked up and the last thing we
want our viewers getting in there
turning on and off the lights and
checking out the webcam having forbid so
what we're going to be using here is
either this antiquated vhs-c camcorder
or one of these pics era small little
webcams and I like these you can pick
these up on ebay pretty cheap and the
neatest thing is composite all right and
like your reference before composite has
no no definitive length we can run it
wherever yeah get the cables and
whatever length we need and USB has a
finite yeah length do it exactly so
we're going to go with the composite
here okay and so assuming we have
everything set up and wired how do we
get that on the server to get into the
computer we're going to need to use a TV
tuner or a capture card this card right
here will accept a composite in Jack or
we could use a ati all-in-wonder card or
basically any card that will accept a
composite in Jack Windows is going to
recognize that as a windows media device
and it's going to work the same whether
to webcam or whether it's a composite
camera like this it doesn't care our
script will still use it the program
will still use it so all in all this
integration is going to be really
seamless really seamless so let's go
ahead and set up the hardware and then
take it to the software let's roll
alright so we're back at the lab let's
check it out we're using a piece of
software here from sourceforge it's
called doorjamb and it's going to be our
capture device it's going to basically
take the image from the webcam and put
it in a folder you can get these
anywhere they're pretty simple and I
just liked origin because it's open
source all right and come from sources
freak yes so as you can see here we've
set it up for windows media device we
can you a preview here and as you can
see there we are right near here the
revival hey Paula camera guy so we're
going to the capture settings sorry
we're going to the store settings co set
up a storage setting here and hold it to
store the images hack 5.jpg enter a
patchy folder we've also done some
caption settings these are pretty cool
we've added the ability to put the hack
point 5 cam on the bottom with our font
so it'll look pretty neat so if we go
ahead and take that over to the web page
you can go ahead and see now there's
latest image it's got 15 cam cheap set
right so let's go ahead and check out
the code all right basically this is the
same PHP code that we used before we've
added just a little bit of HTML and
we've got this http-equiv refresh'
content 15 seconds what that's basically
saying is every 15 seconds repress the
page ok now it's HD be equated equals
expires content to equal 0 what that's
basically saying is don't catch the
image so if you were to repress the page
and your browser was hashing it you get
the same image over and over it just
doesn't repose right well it's not
really about the cookies what it's doing
is it's telling you not to catch that
image so when you refresh you get the
new one every time right now right and
then basically here at the bottom we
just go ahead and add in the little
image tag to the icon jpg and we end up
with this and it'll automatically
refresh every 15 seconds all right we
still turn on and off the lights and
that's all there is to it that's all
there is to it fantastic
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
