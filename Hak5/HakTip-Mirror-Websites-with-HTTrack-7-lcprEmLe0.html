midphase hello welcome to act tip the
show where we break down the concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
in nineteen inches
I'm your host Darrin kitchen and today
we're doing a little website mirroring
and a little local web serving now
whether you're building a website or
doing some prototyping or simply
building a fishing site your you'd be
hard-pressed to find a more easy
mirroring tool than HTT track or HT
track it's something like that anyway
it's available for Windows Mac Linux and
this open source multilingual mirroring
tool sports multiple website targets
user selectable recursion levels a
resume feature and so much more it'll
even convert 28.3 file naming in case
you're still aa six point two two yeah
anyway well getting started is super
super simple let's go ahead and begin
here by creating a directory to actually
store our mirrored web site so mkdir
websites and let's head over to that so
there we go and going ahead and starting
this is really simple all we actually
have to do is issue HTT ra c KH track
we'll call it that and once you get
familiar with the tool you can actually
automate the process of doing this with
flags and such but it also has a really
straightforward interactive wizard which
is much appreciated so we'll go ahead by
and start by naming our project I'm
going to call this Twitter Fisher okay
and then give it a base path so in this
case class route slash websites and
we're going to go ahead and give the URL
or URLs separated by commas or spaces so
there we go alright and now we pretty
much can go ahead and start mirroring it
we get to choose here our options for
downloading
I actually prefer option number two
which will mirror the website with a
wizard hooray so here we can select if
we're going to be using a proxy which
not what file types we'd actually like
and what additional flags
so finally provided here with
natural commandment line script here or
command prompt so this is actually what
would run next time if we were to
automate this process you know with the
tack W attack oh and the tack percentage
sign V there and we're going to go ahead
and launch it yes and in just a moment
or many moments depending on the size
and complexity of the website you're
downloading you're going to go ahead and
have yourself a mirrored website right
here so go ahead and LS finally we can
actually see that here we go we have our
website we see the into Twitter Visser
and actually see here are our cache
files as well as a nice little log file
that HD tract creates and inside our
URLs directory we have all the HTML
files and everything we would expect
that goes along with our website now in
just a bit we're going to go ahead and
visit our newly mirrored website from
our localhost with a very simple web
server but first let's take a quick
break
mid pays is offering unlimited disk
space and bandwidth with an exclusive
discount for hak5 viewers get yourself
free website builders a simple CMS
installs $100 in search engine credits
from Google and Yahoo and 24 by 7 phone
chat and email support
now since 2003 mid pays has been
providing smart simple and reliable web
hosting and if you visit midphase comm
site act 5 they're ready to hook you up
with six months of free web hosting so
with our newly mirrored site in the HTML
and gif and all those other fun happy
files in our directory we can actually
go ahead and start browsing to those
with a web server locally with one
command how happy is that all we do is
issue Python tack em simple HTTP server
and we went ahead and spawned a new web
server on port 8000 of our local working
directory or current working directory
and all we have to do is head over to
HTTP colon slash localhost colon 8080
Twitter Fisher comm normally except for
the fact that if I enter in some stuff
it's not going to actually do the PHP
bits on the back end like it would if I
were actually to enter in stuff over
here you probably wouldn't be able to
tell the difference on your end as a
user so as I said it's good for
prototyping and other fun things anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed that I'm looking
forward to your feedback and how was
that I mean what programs and commands
are rocking the world and specifically
what like W getting curl tricks are up
your sleeve what technologies are
tickling your technical us as we say
