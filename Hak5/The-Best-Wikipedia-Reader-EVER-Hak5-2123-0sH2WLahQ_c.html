and a lot more of this time on hak5
hello welcome to hack five on Deron
kitchen I'm Shannon Moore your weekly
dose effect or loss welcome to this
super exciting episode of hak5 thank you
for joining us and almost said texting
we remember what show were on and that's
I mean we'll put pants on this morning
hey hot pants on right yeah totally
unlike some podcasters because I don't
know if you've ever you know seeing some
video podcast where you just you can't
tell ya I benefits of being a podcaster
just got awkward real grateful word that
we're actually doing a podcast as it
were yeah this episode we are we're
talking about cool things well I guess
we talking about cool things in every
single episode we though I think it's
cool so we're podcasters of every
episode right yeah okay this is one of
those yes it is one of those and it
starts with the gift from again yes okay
yes it does so we're going to go ahead
and start this out early this episode
first off we got a sticker yeah is that
cute wheelchair hackers so this is from
the Kyle t or is the pilots he says
Darren and Shannon I'm a huge hak5 fan I
keep saving up for the Nano tactical
elite the rubber ducky and land turtle
due to my disability it's hard for me to
hold books so I'm really looking forward
to when you release an e-book version of
the Wi-Fi final pineapple ebook in the
hex I field kit pocket guide I am too
I'm looking forward to that please enjoy
this wheelchair hackers sticker I made
from an image I found online I also
wanted to tell you about a device on
making whoa so nano pie that gets power
and a network connection using a power
over ethernet adapter it then uses a USB
Wi-Fi adapter to broadcast a fake Wi-Fi
network hey that's really cool ah yeah
those kind of hacked all of this is on
the back of a blank wall plate which can
easily be substituted for an ethernet
drop what do you think and what should I
call it I don't know
cucumber look I have you no idea but
something beautiful about the
clandestine like tailored access
operations type stuff there it is the
hacker community build I would know
because I like building them too right
yes so I don't know we built our company
on building products for other pen
testers really we are not that way I
don't know it's crazy well it's actually
building boxes like only on the kid red
blue green and it's reason why all of
the products are in this little envelope
the hell they're no different colored so
we've got the green the red the world
nobody knows about the red yet anyway
hmm colored box we also got a bunch I
don't want to run through these super
super quick because you know it'll take
a little bit of time to stick all of
these on there so in the next episode
you'll see all of these stuck onto our
back walls of our set but we got quite a
few different stickers from shmoocon
that we just recently went to we got
four to go labs a bunch from the Wi-Fi
village including Wi-Fi security 1997 to
2016 so set SVR is a sideshow I don't
remember what this one says because it's
written in like rude or something doing
good doing good is that what I think I
might be wrong I don't know I can't read
it all right DJ Randall stickers yeah
lots and lots of stickers so we'll stick
those up but today why don't we go ahead
and get started yeah yeah I love that
thicker part of the hacker culture buddy
how much more to to discuss there's a
lot more to agriculture emoji hackers
some OG hackers like Leonardo da Vinci
Charles Darwin did you know Thomas
Edison Jimi Hendrix David Bowie Steven
Spielberg and Shannon Morse what do
those all have in common what you think
I'm the Watson right now so I don't know
if you tell me each person is an
autodidact that is to say they are a
self-taught person which I have been
self teaching myself for a very long
time so Darren actually taught me that
word today foreign why are you teaching
me new words because I was what it is is
I was thinking about that impromptu
conversation that we had at shmoocon
yeah we know I was very surprised that
so many people really enjoyed that
it this is kind of inspiring the episode
worgen has much more nitty-gritty
technical content here real soon but
that conversation which you just kind of
flipped in the episode in realizes
recording hahaha was kind of the
inspiration here and had me thinking
which reminds me that you're a fantastic
editor and I'm so grateful for real like
you're welcome yes we're ridiculously
lucky here but it got me thinking about
the journey of the hacker and how for
the most part it really stems from
essentially an eagerness to learn I mean
hacking isn't taught in schools and for
the most part it is a solo learning
experience I know that when I got
started knowledge was disseminated by
the way of like text files that were
shared on both more systems and i re-ran
ftp servers you know an hour as the
underground hacking community had kind
of morphed into an information security
industry yeah it has gotten way more
accessible but it's still very much like
a personal journey you know that's
really true similar to a lot of you guys
probably out there my journey started
with googling lots and lots of different
things and then I found pack 5 and this
whole world of information was at my
fingertips but was when i was in school
you know when I was going through
college in high school which was kind of
a long time ago there wasn't a class at
my school about infosec or one about you
know making like with Arduino and stuff
because that didn't exist there wasn't
something for hacking so if I wanted to
learn I had to sell teach myself and
it's been kind of a tough journey just
personally just because of who i am who
it was born as as well as educationally
is that the word i have tried very hard
to fill that void in the hacker
community that has existed for a very
long time you know you find out about
all these incredible hacks that people
are doing but nobody ever tells you this
is how you start you know this is how
you begin the heck they just give you
the end slate they're just like here's
my ending thing check it out on this
YouTube video and it's awesome they
don't tell you like how they got there
and you can learn theory all day and we
teach a lot of theory on this show
especially with hack tips and you can
learn commands all day which I've taught
on hack tips as well but there's always
Singh steps so I've always tried to fill
in that information and share it in a
way that like anybody can be introduced
to it because I feel like if you can't
so you can't really self teach yourself
if you don't know where to start right a
lot of problems i find that finding the
starting point is the hardest part yeah
and knowing that starting part really
for me it all comes down to being
inspired yeah and that does that's
really a lot of what we try to do on
hak5 is to inspire I mean we can't hold
everybody's hand and walk them through
every single thing cuz by can't make you
a cur any more than you can make me one
but I can inspire you so when you go and
do it yourself that it's not foreign and
it just makes it more accessible yeah I
know we've been doing this for 11 years
now and um I feel so awful hope you know
it let's come back to the age thing in
the d-block but anyway one what I wanted
to do was just continue to share
something that will help inspire you for
your own personal journey and one of the
places where I always get inspired is
Wikipedia I love wikipedia I like Alec I
profess my undying love to Wikipedia
real oh my gosh it's the time
acknowledge your uh haha you're a
Wikipedian er um not quite olika be you
remember the days when libraries would
be like Wikipedia does not count as
source well it doesn't but it's kind of
as a great starting off space to get
inspired by things that i will like many
of you go down the Wikipedia rat hole
and I love that I love knowledge i love
i mean i'm uh crazy search for knowledge
like all of you is why you ended up at
this channel yeah so i thought i would
spend some time showing off what one of
my favorite wikipedia apps this is not a
roundup this is not a top-10 this is the
top number one because they opted
changed my life really yes okay and
what's it called so it's called readable
for Wikipedia if I arced Adam you can
find it in the google play store okay
it's for android and it free it is it's
a rewritten version of an app known as
wiki lecturer which unfortunately was
removed from the app store like a little
over a year ago and I
my heart ah yeah but during like for
example hack across America that 20 2013
trip that I did with the band that was
7,000 miles that was over 150 hours of
just arriving uh so for the most part i
was listening to wikipedia yeah yeah so
awesome let me show you the app and then
you know kind of how it works out this
is this is the operate now just pulled
up to a one of the pages in my playlist
right now and I'm just doing a little
learning here on the Dutch East India
Company as you do and what's really cool
is you see these plague control this at
the bottom india company this article is
about the trading company for the record
labels the Dutch East India Trading you
know so as you can see it's it's a Texas
speech engine yeah it is you're going on
a drive a while you know I love text
speech that voice would annoy me there's
better voices you can stall cuz ok one
of the brilliant things of this app is
check this out so they come over here
too that's my playlist hang on but go
over to preferences we can actually
choose which text to speech engine it
can choose the samsung google or if you
install any third party you can choose
those you can also you know increase the
i actually you know increase the voice
speed all the way i love that and then
how to auto play the next pages there's
a few missing features from the old wiki
lecturer version yet this app which had
previously automatically added the see
also links at the bottom of most arts oh
cool you can see that it doesn't include
that it doesn't include that but what it
does is when you're on an article for
instance on here and it's talking about
you know sawmills and i don't know let's
find something more exciting than
sawmills the dutch government yeah so
it's half on dutch government and i say
add he'll cool and next thing you know
you end up if I close that excuse me you
can end up creating just these amazing
play queues and you can make this
download button to save them for offline
use and next thing you know you you know
started at Nelson Mandela next thing you
know you're
the Dutch East India Company at the
Royal Air Force and you're learning
about drag coefficient oh my god I feel
like this would be so useful for all the
different things I want to learn about
ham radio because there's plenty of
Wikipedia articles about it but I don't
want to sit there and read them all yeah
I could totally listen to him on my
commute this was this is brilliant for a
recent flight that I had so if you don't
have anything in your queue and you're
starting with one Wikipedia entry how
does it choose the next one well this
version of it does not so those words
mean you have to manually add them to
the queue and then once you do pro tip
immediately download them because
there's nothing more fun than being at
in Rachel Nevada on that 50 top
right-hand corner of the box as it were
area 51 in the middle of Nevada without
cell service I'm suddenly losing your
play queue and not being able to
continue your offline playing of the
hundreds of Wikipedia articles that you
have hashed first a journey because it's
amazing what you can learn along the way
when you seed it with something simple
like the extra-terrestrial highway
really bring you a deer interesting area
51 you too CIA Gary Powers SI 71
blackbird the actual does then the d-10
non-it and next thing you know you're
into a Nikita and and mutually assured
destruction and and Danny theories on
going and going and going oh so if you
see where that guy if you have done this
to if you have bad 500 tabs open yeah
reading I've gone down the Wikipedia
rabbit hole it happens happen this app
will change your life that's so cool so
when you download them i'm assuming they
don't take up a lot of states because
it's just is it jack audio or engine tax
we actually just downloads that is text
okay and then the and it uses the in
like the speech engine that you already
have to read all that text and it
doesn't have to download anything extra
for that no i just use you know right
now i'm just using the text to speech
engine that came on the phone there i
previously have used i think it's called
svox there's in fact i really want to
see two things here first of all your
recommendations for there's plenty of
them text-to-speech engines on android
because
there are so many better voices than the
robot voice that i have on here
currently the grand i think it was like
there was this it was like a brick Amy
some British voice or something i was
working i don't know because i like how
they say leftenant instead of lieutenant
anyway really yes all that's really cute
I know right but otherwise there's I
want to hear your pics on that as I'm
sharing mine n as well as your pics on
the Wikipedia rabbit hole because yeah I
mean next thing you know you're a tawdry
Lord and you're like how did I even get
here and why if I never known so please
leave those because I will just be like
putting those in my play queue and going
on to infinity I'm also curious if you
guys have any other apps specifically
for Android because we both use Android
here but iOS as well we can share those
on the show too for learning and for
education because I'm always looking at
ways that I can you know further my
brain sponging because I love to learn
but it's hard to find apps that are
specifically made for you know that kind
of thing for just learning you know
learning new things every day especially
some Hamlin's there's some really good
more like ham exams and things of that
nature I find that Wikipedia well not
maybe the best source for some of the
more controversial things is still a
good launching off point history though
great ministry great for technical stuff
so if you need to like understand
exactly how a UDP Datagram is put
together there's no controversy there is
how that data graham is made and there's
a fantastic wikipedia article on it but
for things like newsworthy that are
currently happening in the world it's
not necessarily the best place for that
because i found like if i read a
Wikipedia entry about something that's
currently like growing in the news field
it can change like overnight and then
the entire wikipedia entry could be
different so but history is great if
there's anything culture related culture
is really good on wikipedia and yet
technical like we said it's really about
being inspired and what I found was when
I just let this thing run amok kind of
like a Pandora playlist that gets a mind
of its own that's what i did on act
across America
like listening to hundreds of articles
yeah and just letting it continue to
build this playlist and meander through
the stuff and just each time being
completely dumbfounded inspired and
gobsmacked at some of the crazy things
you just didn't know existed never liked
created a playlist and gotten to an end
no there is no is like just like getting
to the end of the internet however we
are at the precipice of the end of this
segment where we will then just say that
I could go on and on and on forever
about this but just know that just it is
it is just a beautiful app and there's
nothing else like it I know cuz I've
looked everywhere and I just really
wanted to feature because it just came
back out like in the last month and
they've done a beautiful design you know
they've used the material design
philosophy from google and I think it
looks fantastic and I want you all to go
and check it out and you know just see
like how many amazing things you can
learn when when you just load it up and
a next time you're on the bus this is
perfect cool we're going to take a quick
break when we get back we'll see I'm
going to take a quick moment to thank
our awesome sponsor domain.com for
supporting us all of these years and
remind you guys that when you have that
brilliant idea just like Shannon and I
do we go through domain.com first and we
register that awesome name and using the
domain discovery system at domain com
and they're very simple checkout process
makes it a breeze to bring that idea to
reality and get your website up and
online in no time flat and get this the
guys over domain com huge fans of hak5
and you guys so we have a special coupon
code just for you it's a check a five
and it saves you twenty percent at
checkout and if you don't need a domain
name in this very moment you can still
tweet them at domain.com and say hey
thanks for supporting hak5 all of these
years thank you for believing in us and
we really appreciate it so when you guys
think domain names think domain.com
previously i had mentioned how i feel
really old because things like hacker
classes did not exist when I was in
college but I think that brings up a
really good conversation to have about
you know how old are we really going to
come to knowledge about how
King and making and stuff like that yeah
I was thinking about that too like the
bulletin board systems text files like
wow if Kirby is 74 in cat years how old
are we in internet years yet that before
this year and she is gorgeous how old
are we in internet years let's find out
um no I was thinking about actually out
like the hacker community is such a
welcoming space I know this because I
was an awkward teenager accepted into
the hacking community literally found
solace in cyberspace and I know I'm not
alone in this in any regard and one of
the reasons was because age didn't
matter you know and this was emphasized
in one of the text files that inspired
me you know going back to the
inspiration theme here I was inspired in
my youth by the hackers manifesto knew
it yeah yeah we've definitely paid
tribute to the Sun hak5 so check out
that episode and you know if you like
while it is a bit dated a talked about
like stone freaking it talks about dial
up and stuff the sentiment hold true
today and given the recent events I just
wanted to reiterate my favorite passage
in something from it and it's it's the
one that begins this is our world now
the world of the electron and the switch
the beauty of the body we make use of a
service without paying for what would be
dirt cheap if it wasn't run by
profiteering gluttons and you call us
criminals we explore and you call us
criminals we seek after knowledge and
you call us criminals here's the thing
we exist without skin color without
nationality without religious bias you
call us criminals you know there's
there's something really beautiful in
that statement yeah and the manifesto
goes on to say yes I am a criminal my
crime is that of curiosity my crime is
that of judging people by what they say
and think and not what they look like
yes Courtney that resonated with me yeah
as a child and it's one of the things
that made me feel accepted into this
community you know when I was a little
hacker kid on IRC the fact that I was a
you know 12 year old living in poverty
had nothing to do with who I was and it
had nothing two
with my peers either so there's actually
this theme throughout the manifesto
about how you know it's from the
perspective of the school teacher how
all hackers are all alike you know
they're all under achievers right it
even ends with that the text says you
know ends I'm a hacker and this is my
manifesto you may stop this individual
but you can't stop us all after all
we're all alight and and then a snarky
in a way it is I mean it was written
shortly after the mentors arrest in 1986
i want to say but this is where i feel
like we as a community need to remember
that we are all one and only egos
beliefs and fears separate us so this
week instead of saying trust your textin
west at the end of this episode I'd
actually like to end by quoting Nikola
Tesla for ages this idea has been
proclaimed by the consummately wise
teachings of religion probably not alone
as the means of ensuring peace and
harmony among men but as a deeply
founded truth the Buddhists expressed in
one way the Christians in another but
both save the same we are all one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
