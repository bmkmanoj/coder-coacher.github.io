follow-ups in your password tips and
we're finishing off the homebrew
high-performance relased I'm Karen
kitchens you're watching act 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain.com go
to assist Express and Netflix go to WWF
flexkom / hack 5 for your free trial
membership
hello welcome hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen otherwise known as who is now
the spokesperson for Microsoft Kin ok
actually that part still I wouldn't that
be awesome to do a commercial and just
be like is that really what the Kin
makes you think of it yeah what is it
then what does the iPhone 4 make you
think whoa oh right somebody didn't mean
yet somebody didn't get an iPhone yeah
all you do is waiting in line for like 9
hours yeah I'm not interested so I'm
here in San Francisco not Missouri it's
awesome yeah and totally enjoying the
amazing weather that we're having here
yeah today was really nice and an
amazing show for you guys I think you're
gonna really like it I do have to say
it's a little lighter than our normal
stuff just because there's so much going
on but it's because we have some great
stuff in the works well that too is
revision3 is five-year anniversary party
the other day and we had a blast wish
she could've been there yeah so last
time we were together we basically got
some feedback about how how to make a
really really protected password and we
got tons of feedback after that too
after we explained what we do for ours
right yeah we got so much email so we
picked some of the best stuff and I
figured why don't one just go ahead and
share that with you guys cuz I thought
Sameach
kind of came up with some creative stuff
and well first off I'm kakou I'm totally
saying that and kaku he says actually
sent in his password and as Jason our
camera guy right now is pointing out
that null and void your password is no
longer secure
but regardless thank you it's right here
and as you can see it's ridiculously
long yes we did just share your password
with the world but it's 48 characters
and it's made up of anything from
sections of IP addresses and phone
numbers that he remembers remember when
we used to remember phone numbers yeah
and and also they're separated by the
initials of X girl
friends hey that's one way to let him
platonic guests aw and yeah I thought
that was kind of cool how we're moving
snow --ts that just putting a capital
letter in there will make your passwords
so much more secure yes
and then Timo Teemu points out a PG it's
this automated password generator for
Linux the syntax is a PG tuck a wine
Tech n64 attack CCL underscore seed
would generate six passwords with 64
random characters and you can find all
that information at Adelle nurse at
caves ESS AP G yes password generators
writing the thing oh I don't know this
one particularly does it but the ones
that I really like are the ones that can
come up with a random password that for
some reason has some sort of rhythm to
it you know
c7 KQ o w fu for some reason that right
there it just kind of feels like it has
a little rhythm to it yeah there's an
old exchange so you can remember it yeah
of course that one's only like eight
characters which we we say for Windows
you really want to have 15 or 40 15
characters or more Nathan C points out
something that we all may have done and
it's totally bad idea but using spatial
patterns on the keyboard so for example
asdf right or a qwe rty horrible
horrible horrible way to do another one
is qwe asd zxc so if you actually look
at the keyboard you're just going 3 3 3
bad idea but you know I guess for a BS
password it's better than nothing maybe
anything on the maybe anything on the
shift row you make capital and the
number row you make hold down shift but
other than your dog's name yeah and then
of course you just throw in some leet
speak and make it a little bit more
secure yeah
Eugene send a lot sent along how secure
is my password dotnet it's based on
jQuery to estimate how long an average
computer would take to brute-force your
password and
also checks against 500 commonly used
passwords so like love yeah sex secret
now mobic spoink out that it's probably
not a good idea to go to one of these
password generator sites or release if
you are like you might want to take a
look at the code because there could be
like you know Ajax calls that like
logged your password so and the other
thing to point out here is this
particular site tells you how long it
would take a human to brute-force it I'm
sorry humans only brute force at a
keyboard in Hollywood you're smart get a
rubber ducky yeah a USB rubber ducky is
a little faster than that just a little
ya human interface devices for the win X
fuller extra extra fur he says he uses a
combination of leet-speak
pass phrases and site identifiers so
what he means by that is say take for
example the phrase code monkey and you
could probably come up with something
longer than that but he converts it to
c0 d3 you know puts it in the lead speak
and then say like it's his Facebook one
he puts like a capital F B and then like
a random like asterisk or greater-than
or something it's kind of what I do it's
not bad it's very very similar to what I
do it works really well because every
single one is different so it's nice
jerath notes that while he hasn't used
it he's always been tempted to use HTTP
colon slash slash google.com slash
question mark as a password so it looks
like a URL when it's flying by a bite
packet sniffer but I want to take a yeah
why is there a URL in the password field
mm-hmm let's try I don't know you know
I'm always seeing interesting so what is
it Oh PC doctor he actually sent us a
lot of stuff about password managers and
we've talked about these in the past
remember key pass good stuff I love the
portable versions yes
portable versions and the you know
mobile application versions are really
cool but but he points out LastPass and
password safe and says that that he's
actually written us an autohotkey
autohotkey is a great little utility
that allows you to automate a lot of
tasks in Windows and it's actually built
on I forget the name of the scripting
it's very cool anyway I use it we should
probably do a segment just on autohotkey
alone but I will go ahead and share that
in the show notes because you can take
the script modify it to your own adapt
it's very very cool so so much more on
that find it in the show notes a hak5
dot org okay this is personally one of
my favorites because I'm a huge bookworm
and like I had thousands of books on my
Kindle yeah books you know books books
so lyle his technique is to pick a book
off your bookshelf and then go to a
certain page or a couple of different
pages use the first line from each page
and then put that in as your password so
it's a phrase it's not just a couple of
letters or something like that yeah
something that's easy to memorize and
then if you have to change your password
or somebody figures it out or whatever
just use a different page we're
different book I just got to be very
careful if you're having like a garage
sale like that books kind of important
or at least don't highlight it or
anything now Patrick sent in super Jen
past calm which is a JavaScript
bookmarklet that you can just go ahead
and you know drag this link to your
bookmark bar in Firefox or Chrome
whatever you use and then it uses the
site domain and a hash in your master
password to generate a very secure
password that you can use on different
sites you have a different password on
each one and I thought that was really
really cool javascript that runs locally
I like that I like that as specific to
the domain and I really like that it's a
bookmarklet so that you could well if
you're like me and you use Chrome and
then you can do your your bookmarks sync
through Google that's awesome and then
there's also some really good bookmarks
sync stuff for Firefox and I'm sure all
the other browsers opera let's not
forget them so that's something that
could kind of follow you from browser to
browser it's true and Adams sunk it's
password safe it's a free open-source
password management app with a really
good reputation so yay yeah yeah from
you know it was originally written by
Bruce Schneier who's like huge security
expert so and it has the ability to
paste passwords into films fields
without using a clipboard which is
everybody knows that's a high security
risk whenever you're using the clipboard
in the middle of
copying and pasting passwords yeah so
it's a virtual human interface device
yeah that he thinks it uses well I
understand you press a key and then it
types the password for you but using a
virtual human interface device think
about that for just a moment and then
reference the USB what goes quack and
then can type passwords very fast yes
wanna buy a duck like three people got
that joke yeah developers that got a
rubber ducky yeah understood no joke so
thank you thank you guys for sending in
your passwords we're very happy to put
them on the air and also your tips and
you know I got to mention that we've
seen some really intricate ones over at
Twitter Fisher comm that's yeah either
way you want a pH ishe are it's the
newest hottest social networking service
you just want to go over there and give
us your Twitter username password
because yeah we actually log it and
sometimes I go through there and a lot
of it is like hahaha lol whatever but
then sometimes you're just like no no
Jacob 64 that's and you really want to
just you really want to maybe get on the
onion router and test it out but I
wouldn't I wouldn't advise logging to
anybody else's accounts that would be
unauthorized access yeah and that would
be bad so shame on you for even thinking
about that I can't what are you think
doing I don't know yeah all right well I
have some really really cool information
about a software application that I
found online and I want to share that
with you guys and I'm sure you got some
cool stuff for us this week yes
excellent stuff so we are going to be
back in just a bit but let it's first
thank one of our awesome sponsors I'm
gonna go check out this Japanese tea
garden yeah yeah can I get some tea
nope alright Jason

have them well you look ridiculous you
know there's an easier way to protect
yourself right just head over to Circle

com revision3 just celebrated its fifth
anniversary with a big huge party with
diggnation in San Francisco but if you
couldn't make it or you've missed the
live stream that we kind of sort of did
all night make sure to check out this
week's donation over at revision3.com
slash diggnation
all right so let's say you're hanging
out in the city one day at your local
cafe and you decide to go up to the
front counter to get a coffee and when
you're gone suddenly your laptop
disappears from the table that it was
sitting on the first thing you do is
we'll probably panic and then you might
call the local authorities to help you
find the thief or you might just end up
buying a brand-new computer but to make
matters a lot better for you and to help
authorities we have a program called
prey which will collect valuable
information from your laptop while it's
gone missing and even take a picture of
the thief via your integrated webcam if
you have one of those which will
hopefully help you and authorities find
your computer so you don't have to buy a
brand new one so first off you can
download this over at pre project comm
and there are tons of features that you
can use first off it uses Wi-Fi hotspots
or GPS embedded inside your device if
you have that to accurately pinpoint
where your laptop is second off if Wi-Fi
isn't in use pray will actually try to
find some local access hotspot to
actually send you the information
third pray is written in bash so it's
very lightweight and it's also portable
and we all know how much I love my
portable devices you can add a pray as
you like there's all sorts of different
tasks that you can set on or off and you
can change the different time frames if
you want it to send info to every five
minutes or every twenty minutes you can
change that to your liking if you want
it to take a picture of the thief or not
you can change that as well
pre will send you a list of programs
that are being run on your computer at
the time and it will also send you any
files that were modified as well as take
a picture using your embedded webcam
which is obviously my favorite part you
can have a message be sent to the thief
to actually pop up on your machine while
they're working on it and it can even be
heard by any passerby errs nearby but
you got to be kind of careful with that
one in case they're like really
dangerous or something that might not be
it might not be a good
so I just you know turn that part off
and hopefully the GPS works keep that in
mind and last but not least of course
pray is free for your first three
devices and it'll run on pretty much any
laptop whether it's Mac Linux or Windows
alright so I want to get into a demo
with you guys on pretty much how to set
this up and how to modify your tasks and
how it works
first off download pray on to the
computer that you wish to track click on
download and go through the installation
wizard the download barely takes any
time at all and at the end if you
haven't configured the tool it's gonna
prompt you to do so and it tells me this
is my first time downloading pray blah
blah blah so I'll need to do that first
thing I need to choose is setting up my
reporting method you have two options
you can either use the control panel
interface or the standalone interface
and the difference is the control panel
that one's accessed through the per a
website so it's really quick and it's
powerful and everything is sent directly
to you as the reports come in straight
through the pray project website the
standalone version is going to send you
updates to your email but in order to
use that you have to actually activate
pray and then you have to start
reporting you have to delete a URL and
then add a URL it's kind of weird and
confusing that's how they used to do it
and then they've made a brand new
version for their website which is much
much easier so I'd prefer to do the
control panel version so I'm gonna click
on that and then I need to create a user
account so I'll put in my information my
name email address my password okay I
click create and it tells me it worked
all right so now it tells me I need to
activate my email address so I'm gonna
log in to my Gmail click the link and
then I log in all right I need to add
devices ok real quick I'm gonna go back
to the install and then I'm gonna click
OK and it tells me congratulations your
devices are being tracked yay ok now I'm
gonna go add a device I fill in the name
and it's generated all my information
for me on my booklet 3G so I click
create and it's created hey it
if gives me my device key and then I can
click on the name to configure all my
settings now this is the cool part my
device isn't missing so I'm gonna leave
that be and scroll down alright I want
pray to notify me with any new reports
and then automatically update whenever
available I'm gonna leave the time the
same every 20 minutes it'll update and
then under action modules I'm gonna
choose to make my laptop make a loud
buzz noise every 30 seconds when the
device is nearby hey
so I guess anybody would kind of notice
if somebody was running around with a
buzzing laptop might be a bad idea for
the thief haha okay under report modules
I'm gonna cut on all these choices so I
get the most information that I can all
of these choices are pretty
self-explanatory and if you don't know
what you're choosing you can always
click on the little exclamation mark
next to it and it explains explains it
pretty well so I've gotten on to
Darren's computer and I logged on to
pray project comm to figure out what the
heck happened to my little booklet that
was just here like five seconds ago I
don't know what happened to it
alright so I log on and I go to snub C's
booklet and I click on that link and
then it tells me that I have a brand new
report so I'm gonna go in there and tada
it shows me a webcam picture of the
monkey really the monkey that jerk oh my
god I knew it and if I scroll down I can
see that he's looking at the hak5
website okay it's at least it's not
monkey porn so that's good and then it
also shows me any programs that are
running and it shows me that he's logged
in under snub Z which is probably
because I was already logged in under
snub see you before he took it that jerk
alright I got my laptop back and luckily
I knew who it was from the webcam
picture so I was just able to go over
there punch his lights out and get my
computer back although I would suggest
if you are planning to go and attack the
thief yourself don't like punch his
lights out make you make sure you get
like local authorities to do that or
something that might be a bad idea okay
so what do you guys think I like this
program
it's really cool how it works and I
really love the fact that it takes a
picture and it can possibly find your
location of the laptop like really
easily that's awesome

/ go to assist Express so welcome back
to the pirate garage it is time to do
part 2 of the homebrew router segment
that we started a week before this is a
fun one because we are building a
awesome little router based on a mini
ITX atom based chipset so sweet using
some open-source software that's going
to allow us to basically come up with
something so much more hardcore than a
little piece of plastic that you can buy
your big box shop this isn't going to
give you much performance when it comes
to your network gaming and other stuff
like that in fact that's one of the
topics that we will be tackling on this
particular segment because I'd like to
get into a little bit of quality of
servers yes QoS awesome concept that's
going to allow our skype to be Skype
here and our halo to be more halo II or
something
so I'm actually in the middle of an
install right now of some new open
source software that is going to power
this sweet machine but as you guys
remember we were doing smooth wall
before and I have since had a change of
heart and if that's okay you know here
in the garage you know my show can
change heart I actually got a lot of
emails about it and yes to answer a
couple of first questions you can
actually play with virtualization we you
can you can
set up a router in a virtual machine in
fact using VMware or Sun or I'm sorry
well anyway using VirtualBox you can at
Oracle you can you can play with virtual
routers if you will you can actually
assign Ethernet interfaces to those
machines and you could perhaps build
yourself a router that's a virtual
machine on one of your hosts just like
we have mounted on the wall over there
I don't recommend it now that's not to
say that I think virtualization doesn't
have a place when it comes to routers I
think it's a great way to play with a
lot of different router operating
systems and trust me there are plenty I
peek op smooth wall pfSense mono wall in
fact the one that we're playing with
today is I'm kind of new to but let me
tell you my first impressions I
absolutely love it I mean let me see if
I can be more Steve Jobs right there I
think you're really gonna love it it's
magical
so untangle as opposed to smooth wall
which hasn't really been updated in the
last year is a San Mateo based I know
it's like down the road so I got to
represent
just like the PBR woot it's a San Mateo
based Debian based open-source router or
bridge operating system that's going to
allow us to do so many freaking sweet
things and I thought that we would go
ahead and just start the install so the
turkeys already cooking and essentially
all you do is burn your ISO to CD boot
off of it you can choose a graphical or
an end curses based text installer of
your installed Linux it's super freakin
simple it's just gonna ask you what your
timezone and your language and your
keyboard and stuff like that are and
when progress bar hell is over you're
greeted on the machine that you're
building it on because remember its head
it does have a head right now we do have
a keyboard it will actually go ahead and
guide us through some really really
simple setup we could of course do it
over the network but this is going to be
high-performance and it's going to allow
us to do some sweet stuff because well
first of all its Debian based its Linux
you've got root it's not a toy you know
it's not one of these you know oh maybe
I can put some alternative firmware to
kind of almost give it some life you
know don't get me wrong open wrt is
great if you've got one of those
plastic routers kick it up a notch and
stephy an app to get that's my favorite
I got to say favorite package manager
Pacman's cool you know if you if you're
in the rpm thing hey that's that's neat
but I like Debian and this is good
because I'm familiar with it and makes
me happy ah
the other cool thing is see like he's
just like dude I want a turnkey solution
you know I'm cool with building hardware
I know what I'm doing with the PC stuff
maybe I'm a little new to Linux but I do
want a badass gaming router that's what
we're building right now gaming router
is why we're doing QoS quality of
service right it's fine this is so
freaking simple take a look at this is a
graphical installer and it's making my
head spin how far we have come in the
last 10 years so essentially when we get
through this we're greeted with a
beautiful web interface that's going to
allow us to annan sexy Ajax Ness going
to go ahead and configure our network
our interfaces
maybe a little port forwarding our
quality of service and they've made it
super super simple and then on top of
that because dude forward-thinking it's
got an app store I guess you can't
really have a platform without an app
store now and that is sweet because
there are not only free apps and yeah
you know I can't I can't fault him for
it there is actually some paid apps and
do hey if you can find a way to make
money on open source good on you
untangle so we're gonna be playing with
the free stuff for now and maybe if
you're you know managing an educational
institution or small business you might
like some of this stuff you know I
haven't played with it on a on a bigger
scale but it looks pretty good so far
we're just gonna have fun with the free
stuff right now because that's how we
roll and it's got some stuff even before
you get to the apps built in the QoS the
filtering it makes it so super sexy and
so easy because it's all like based on a
rack environment so let's go ahead and
speed this up fly through this install
and get tweakin so aside from the
beautiful boot sequence this is what I
really love about untangle at least the
setup as far as that's concerned I mean
you're gonna be doing it with monitor
and keyboard anyway so you might as well
go ahead and configure right here
locally don't get me wrong I've got two
plugged into the cable modem but got
plugged into my network or my machine
here and I could just go ahead and grab
the IP address
head over to it from my machine set it
all up board
gonna hit next next finish so from the
beginning it's gonna go ahead and ask us
to create an admin password and I'm
gonna give it a BS one for right now but
I'll secure this up a little bit later
and notice that in Pacific so that's all
good and all we really need here is an
email address and an approximate how
many I don't know why it does this
registration will say 254 of course
that's how many machines we're gonna
have on our network class see for the
win and it already goes ahead and sees
our internal and external Ethernet
interfaces and they are plugged in so
the lights are green the traps are clean
so right here I can say that my internet
is actually DHCP I can click test
connectivity so DHCP comes back for the
win we will have success everything's
shiny let's continue now here's one of
the magical features of untangle here
and that is that we can either set it up
as a router typically how you would
expect to with your little toy plastic
ones or a transparent bridge and that is
to say say look you already have a
freaking dope sauce Cisco or something
you really don't want to mess with it
you've got something good going but
there are some really cool apps or you
know features of untangle that you do
want to use you can set up as a
transparent bridge and it'll basically
live in between on the network having
fun with your packets and not disturb
what you already have going I love that
but we're gonna go with the router now
we get to choose our internal address
and by default it wants to set us up
with a 172 1601 we're actually gonna go
with something a lot cooler and I forget
who it was an IRC that suggested this by
the way hack five slash slide that's how
you can watch segments being recorded as
we record them and follow Twitter for
all the details on that but basically
we're gonna go with a 10.13 dot 37 dot
one and our net mask will be
255.255.255.0 that's a slash 24 of
you're keeping track and essentially
that's going to give us 253 addresses to
have a lots of fun with we're gonna
enable the DHCP server so that the other
machines on our network get an internal
IP address from the network address
translation or they're all basically
means that more than one PC can be on
the land I know I just told you what you
already know it's it's what happens here
on hack five but you know to that
awesome twelve year old that's new to
this congratulations welcome to the club
building a router it's fun and we're not
too concerned with the email
configuration now we'll come back later
so let's go ahead and finish so
congratulations the installation is
complete we're greeted with a wonderful
little wizard that's gonna try to upsell
us on some other stuff like network
management and security an email
monitoring and all this stuff and we're
actually not that interested so we're
just gonna go ahead and close this and
go straight to the config so you'll see
here on the Left we've got the config
we're gonna go to network and this is
where a lot of the magic is gonna happen
and click over to interfaces and you'll
see that both of our interfaces are up
and we can check the I then the MAC
addresses here our internal is the c7
which if I take a look here on my card
c7 and that is going to my internal
network that's our our PCI Intel 1000 GT
card and then the integrated NIC on the
motherboard is to the cable modem and we
can test connectivity we can run
ourselves a little ping test here make
sure that DNS is routing so run that
test and hey look at that we has packets
those are good we like those so over to
the network and of course we are
dynamically configured with our cable
modem and we have a static address of 10
1337 one netmask of 20 for our cider
address for our internal network and
DHCP server is enabled we're giving
addresses to our clients on our network
between 10 1337 110 1337 200 and what
I'm gonna do with this configuration is
put all of our static servers under 100
and then all of our VPN clients over 200
because we're probably not gonna have a
whole lot of those and we'll talk about
the VPN stuff on a later episode but
essentially it's open VPN which we have
talked about in the sixth season I
believe
DNS server if we really wanted to get
fancy and I guess you could reference
the season 4 Wow I need hyperlinks for
all these
essentially we could go ahead and use
something like open DNS or Google DNS to
get away from our horrid ISPs DNS which
tries to change things because they're
stupid but what I'm really interested
right now is QoS quality of service okay
we're gonna need to know a couple of
things but essentially what quality of
service is going to allow us to do is
shape our traffic make our traffic
better I'm not talking about a tiered
internet here it's not a series of tubes
what we're talking about is making your
net experience better especially if you
have roommates raise your hand okay now
if your roommate say likes to download
gigs and gigs of legal torrents well
you're trying to get some headshots in
your favorite first-person shooter that
might not be so good or say you're only
trying to do a VoIP call or you're
trying to do a little Ustream action or
a Skype call something like that this is
where quality of service is really
important so let me show you this will
very well dig into the concept and then
configure it to our desires so I'm gonna
go ahead and check enabled here and
first thing that it's going to need to
know is what our download bandwidth is
and what our upload bandwidth is and I
don't know why by default it's got 1.5
or 1500 kilobits a second as the default
download and 384 kilobits a second is a
Deval upload which isn't that great we
are actually on a DSL modem for this
particular setup here but it is about to
go over to a cable modem that's kinda
like I think 50 megabits down and 10
megabits up but for right now we're
gonna say our download limit is 2400
kilobits a second and 384 kilobits a
second up now we're gonna limit our
download to 80% and what that
essentially means is no one particular
client on the network is going to be
able to saturate all of our download
which means ok sure I understand you
need to get that file quick some other
people are trying to browse the web so
don't kill it all same thing with the
upload we've limited to 95% now this is
where on tango gets really nice right
down here we can see ping priority is
normal and if I pull this down you see
hi normal and low what that really means
is we're not adjusting what bandwidth we
have we have a finite
of bandwidth here in this case it's 2400
kilobits a second that's as much as we
can push down right so we can you know
so we would like to go ahead and
prioritize what particular protocols
packets ports whatever get you know get
priority through these lanes so imagine
the bandwidth us like I don't know eight
lanes of traffic going across the Bay
Bridge or something and I say two of
those are fast track lanes or one of
those lanes where you get one of those
little RFID tags and you get to fly
through the Tollbooth rather than have
to stop at the cache lane right so
everything normally goes through the
cache lanes but there's particular
protocols that we would like to just
speed through we're not widening the
lanes any we're just saying you you and
you can go faster okay so our acts are
acknowledgments are gonna go a lot
faster they're set to high and that's
good thing and what's really cool is
gaming priority built right in we don't
have to think about oh is it
thirteen three I don't even remember the
port but you know your steam game of
choice counter-strike whatever you don't
have to think about the ports the
protocols or anything for that they have
made it so simple they understand how
gamers feel you just set this buddy too
high and that means when you're playing
Halo on a 360 or whatever the crap they
have on ps3 or even a PC it understands
hey this is gaming traffic we're gonna
give a higher priority in fact it has a
couple of preset QoS rules here we can
see for VoIP voice over IP for DNS
traffic now we're going to go ahead and
add another one here I like to do a lot
of you streaming so let's go ahead and
make sure that our router is giving
those packets some priority I'm going to
go ahead and make a new entry here and
call it Ustream and I'm going to set the
priority to high it's enabled and I'm
going to choose what the source address
is now I've done a little bit of
research I know that the Ustream source
address is 19mm source poor is 1935 so
it's not source address source port
source poor
13 or I'm sorry 1935 the Great
Depression and we will go ahead and add
another and this will be our destination
port and we will set that to 34 890
we're gonna update this and there we go
we have a Ustream rule so it says any
traffic that is coming from port number
1935 and destined to port number 34 890
either of those just go ahead and give
them the high priority which means the
beautiful stream here is going to go a
lot faster and that's awesome it's not
going to get interrupted if somebody's
doing a massive download and somebody's
massive download isn't ever going to
take more than 80 percent of our traffic
I mean this is really just scratching
the surface of the power of untangles so
you can see why in a very sieve jobs way
I think you'll really love it I'm gonna
hit okay here apply these rules let's
close that and we can go ahead and futz
around an administration email local
directory whatever there are so many fun
settings to go ahead and play with I'll
leave that as an exercise for you but I
did want to show off something really
neat the App Store yes it wouldn't be
complete without an app store now they
have a whole bunch of open source
packages paid packages whatever we can
see here we've got web filters spyware
blockers antivirus a win failover that's
really cool so say like you have a DSL
modem and a cable modem it will actually
bond both or not bond but you'll have a
failover so in case one goes down boom
you still got packets you're still in
the Internet I mean it would be horrible
if you got disconnected could you
imagine we can even set up a captive
portal this would be great if we were
say running a network for a coffee shop
or something like that we're gonna have
an access point and we would like them
to be greeted by something that says
before they join the network that they
have to accept or you know or an
acceptable use policy or Terms of
Service or even charge their credit card
or whatever have you it can all be done
it's all custom super simple and
untangle is just oh I'm so in love with
the software right now open VPN will
play with later reports will play with
later but I did want to show you what
happens when you go ahead and add these
because they are very cool so the
open-source package has a lot of those
all built in
I'm gonna choose this it's free download
we're gonna say yes go ahead and
download this and it will take a few
minutes to install and there you have it
after a brief wait we have all of these
awesome open source packages installed
and if I scroll through this list you'll
notice something yes this is done in the
style of 19-inch racks all of these
little modules like our firewall our
protocol control our intrusion
prevention a captive portal open VPN oh
my god guys so happy reports you can
turn them on and off and I can go into
settings here and take a look at all of
them pups with everything I can get
detailed reports sent to me on a daily
basis I can set up you know web
filtering or VPN and I'm sure that we
will back be back here to play with some
more stuff but right out of the box not
only do we have so much power but it's
super easy to manage and I think that's
what's really sold me on untangle so
I'll be playing with this a lot more and
we're gonna be playing a lot more with
networks in the future I've got some
really sick stuff for that
virtualization server on the wall
they're gonna change some software out
and do something really cool with some
web stuff that allows us to do
virtualization easy as well as some
network-attached storage and while you
name it we're gonna be having fun that's
what's important wireless access points
that's next yes for the win so of course

ideas and software that you think I
should see or questions about stuff that
