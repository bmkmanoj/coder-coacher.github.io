by domain.com i don't recommend doing
that anywhere in public they're very
focused and so if you were to use one of
those like on a tripod pointed at your
target go to Botswana or I'm sorry
Bolivia Bolivia then you might be able
to beat the race condition maybe really
depends you know it's a good thing that
they're small enough to like hide places
- I'm just saying yes it does and that's
why we're really stoked to be using this
new platform we'd previously used this
platform based on a tharros 23:31 2385
anyway there is this Terrace chip that's
really awesome should probably take this
opportunity to mention this software is
hella cool we've spent like years
developing and making it awesome and one
of the things that makes it so awesome
is the the fact that it can run this
hacked karma driver that's now based on
hostapd
and you know you're thinking like oh
that that's freaking sweet I've got a
dd-wrt router an open wrt router I got
that old Linksys wrt54g
hanging in my closet will totally like
break that out and make one of these
with it and I so wish I could tell you
that we're the case unfortunately the
way that it works is it's only going to
work on an atheros chipset and that is
not us being douchebags and limiting it
to that it's that in order to do the raw
frame injection what we actually need to
do the only vendor that's actually
making radios of one gives us the like I
want to api's but allows us to do that
or we're - even the documentation to
figure out how to do that is it theros
so like what what to them or I guess
that's Qualcomm now you might be able to
do something similar with something
called air base ng which is part of the
BACtrack suite and it is a capable of
doing something similar with like one of
these even though it doesn't do
infrastructure I'm sorry even though it
doesn't do master mode because it
emulates it in user land and it's able
to do this even though it's only has
managed and monitor but it's hella slow
so I don't remember what the question
was
oh yeah yeah so originally we were using
this one ship that an AR 23:15 and it
was only like 200 megahertz and then
what was really cool and I this could be
a totally different discussion unlike
the intricacies and the fun that is
figuring out how to work with the
Taiwanese manufacturer and what does it
mean to have fo B Shenzhen actually not
Shenzhen because they're Taiwan but you
know to have container ships and and
value-added taxon and duty and customs
yeah that's that's real fun but it was
really cool to be able to work with a
manufacturer on a on a board with a
awesome chipset and so this one is 400
megahertz instead of 200 but yes you're
right the race condition relies on more
than just the transmit power you you do
have to have a speedy CPU
yes in fact that's exactly what we were
showing with the airdrop ng and that is
you know you can write a custom rule
that says you can actually specify in
airdrop ng not only am I like you can
say like only allow these clients of
those clients you can actually base it
on Oh ey which means to say I can say
only let iPhones connect to this and
only let you know things that are made
by Marvel or Raw link or D link or
TRENDnet or whatever tend to connect to
those and so yes you can Spearfish your
client in that sense and we also have if
I go over to configuration you'll see
that there's the ability to blacklist
and whitelist the SSID and also by MAC
address so if you had a target that you
were just trying to to get their device
to connect to you would probably want to
use like air dump to to find out their
MAC address and then put it into here so
that you're not wasting your processing
power providing animated gifts of
kittens to the rest of the users yes oh
yeah so a lot of vendors will actually
fight against this for their users
that's kind of Awesome yeah I got a
couple of friends I've done pen test in
the area have unfortunately found that
out but do you work for them okay okay
that's pretty cool
what's the name of the client yes this
goes yeah so it will basically discover
what's called the industry calls us an
evil twin I think is a little bit more
than that because it's not just like I'm
cloning Bob's Network it's like I'm I'm
showing up as whatever you want me to be
it's a chameleon in that sense but the
the essence of it is that those Cisco
Aero Nets notice hey that's one of my
users what does he do in connected here
this guy I don't know that guy the
awesome and so it's kind of cool it's
like a hacker attack but for white hat
stuff
Oh kittens right so sorry that's let me
see if that is working no okay
let me remove this and in a moment my
routing will change and there we go and
now oh come on
okay does anybody connected to pineapple
oh there we go all right so that's what
happens if you try to go anywhere on the
Internet
it's pretty cool one of the tools that
is on here as part of the Wi-Fi
pineapple or yowza got sweet is more
than your karma but we've taken a lot of
the awesome man-in-the-middle tools from
like d sniff and our cap and things like
that and put it in like a place with a
gooey front end where you can easily do
things like if I come over to
configuration I can see I have my DNS
spoof host and what I'm saying is if
anybody tries to go to the website
startup star which ironically looks like
a kitten and ASCII take them to this
website which is the IP address of my
server which looks like that
and so the shame of this unfortunately
is it'll play the song unlike a desktop
or laptop web browser and it'll do it on
an Android and I can't get it to do it
on I'm freakin iPhone because iPhones
don't support like mp3 streams or flash
so you know hack let me know because I
think it maybe if I like tell it's an
MOV I don't know they like those
QuickTime yeah we really go off the
rails aren't we are there any other
questions about this stuff cuz I could
do dive into this all day
oh well we've got 15 minutes of film
left so let's let's talk about
protecting your guys selves because
that's fun too so Wi-Fi how do you how
do you feel warm and fuzzy with it now
well I guess you could forego Wi-Fi
altogether you know I guess you just go
offline actually that that's always an
option you could use 3G that's you know
what I do I use these for my laptop or
whatever and it's just because you know
after having done this just don't run or
the caveat there and I'll just kind of
throw this out there and passing and we
could do something more in-depth and I
really want to is is this awesome tool
called open BTS if you're setting up a
website or starting a new business
showcasing your portfolio or publishing
your blog domain.com is the best place
to go for your next great idea if you
need to register a new domain consider
getting a dot-com a.com name is the
original we all know it's the best it's
globally understood and immediately
gives credibility to your website no
matter what name you choose Plus of you
and invest in and sell domains coms have
the highest after market value find new
domains at domain.com Shannon and I love
domain.com because they're affordable
reliable and easy to use plus domain.com
social networking presence is huge on
Twitter at domain.com they've got great
customer support and that makes it
really a fun place to do business so get
this the guys over at domain.com want to
hook up our fans with an awesome offer
get 15% off they're already affordable
domain names and web hosting when used
the coupon code hak5
at domain.com check out that's 15% often
big savings don't forget to use the
coupon code hak5 when you think domain
names think domain.com is this awesome
tool called open BTS which allows you to
emulate a base station of a 3G cell
unfortunately it's not advanced enough
to do 3G it's really only 2.5 GB but
whatever regardless that's the way that
the kind of like hacker scene is going
and so it's only a matter of time before
we've got pineapples for cell phones
fun you could bring your own encryption
what you do with SSH tunnels and or you
could do a VPN I love it I did this demo
for like CBS or something they were like
like all of this like of course
everything I told them they like just
chopped out the scary bits and then the
narrator's all like Wi-Fi is doomed and
all this stuff and then at the very end
they're like so get a VPN goodnight and
it's like what you know you can't tell
about the grandma
so unfortunately again like security and
convenience VPNs are not that convenient
for the hacker crowd of course we're
gonna have no problems with it but also
keep in mind all that you're doing here
is you're moving the endpoint so if you
connect to the pineapple or the AT&amp;amp;T
Wi-Fi or the gogo in-flight all of those
open networks are inherently insecure
and this the only way that they're
really gonna work in society even your
stream to the access point can be
eavesdropped upon by a third party in
monitor mode that well that's great fun
hacker fun right except if you if you
bring your own encryption if you say SSH
to your home is that where you guys to
sage to or are you going to Linda or no
he's going to let out where you going
okay well then you so your ISP still
spies on you so what you need to do is
ssh into epsilon and then just kind of
get it over with but really I'm just
mentioning that you're really just
moving the endpoints so it comes down to
like where is your where's your paranoia
level where's your comfort level like
think of it this way I'd venture guess
the half of all tour exit nodes are run
by some sort of government agency yeah
and yet people still use tor I mean
thankfully there are internal onions and
there's at least that but where you
don't have to use an exit node but I
think is the same thing with like I like
to use a service called witopia it's
like $35 a year or something like that
and they give me this huge list of all
of these different VPN endpoints that I
can use around the globe I pretty much
just use it to watch the BBC iPlayer
because you know the NSA is watching
that you can choose encrypted Wi-Fi like
it meant it's not gonna work at the
airport concourse and the WPA the
pineapple is not going to work against
WPA but of course any remembered network
at will and there's
any of those also and you can't see it
there's cutoff but remember to disable
or remember to forget your network when
you're done with it because
unfortunately the state of the industry
is that it's a manual process to remove
that from your phone Wi-Fi at home of
course you guys know weapons crap use
WPA PSK too if you can with a long-ass
passphrase like mary had a little lamb
or something put some space in there
make it an en cat yang minion unit okay
disable WPS because Reaver is awesome
and no not that River and yes it did get
my code on sale an encryption is only
one layer so it's like oh great you know
I'm totally secure now because I'm using
an SSH tunnel but you know use also best
practices HTTPS maybe even want to go
the it was so cool at RSA the NSA
released the set of documents about how
they secure their voice traffic over
IPSec so it's like I forget the name of
the protocol but it's basically a
encrypted rtmp stream over an encrypted
IPSec stream so it's like they're just
doubling up so you might as well - right
and also I'm crazy tinfoil hat and think
the AES one is but that's just me don't
be stupid Twitter for sure comm is a
website that I set up years ago you
would not believe how many people go
over there it says welcome to Twitter
Fisher give me your Twitter username and
password will give you a shiny badge and
noobs man I mean most of its crap most
of its asdf Paquito but you would not
believe how many times people actually
put their legit stuff in there and it's
like what be careful what you post with
your friends this is kind of this is
some of the stuff from South by
Southwest those guys didn't know we're
just there over sharers I'm sure that
you guys know that mal Tico can pull
your Doc's awesome tool look it up it's
got a great GUI front-end and integrates
with a lot of social networking for
Stockton's people I guess two-factor
authentication if you're not using
Google's two-factor bit yet you totally
need to it's pretty awesome it allows
you to to like when you log into Gmail
you have to run an app on your phone and
then enter a nut key and then everything
is scare you can move like on Windows
you can use the system ou've this is key
or you can use the Siskiyou utility to
move your Sam over to a USB key which
means that you can't log into your
machine unless you physically have the
USB key
so now you have something you know your
password and something you have the USB
key we just did a tool that does a
similar thing for Linux on our latest
episode of hack 5 with ATF dual core and
Chris of DoD net
it's called hack all the things drink
all the booze kill all the humans we
might even drunk when we came up with it
I don't know it works pretty nice and
then HTTPS Everywhere is a plugin that
the e FF sponsors and it basically
ensures that you're using HTTPS
Everywhere so it's kind of aptly named
full disk encryption with hidden volumes
for plausible deniability for crossing
borders a good thing to do or just zero
out your hard drive with like all zeros
because that way in friends of forensics
investigator gets there it's not even
encrypted garbage they're not going to
give you the waterboarding you just get
across the border and then you download
a DDD image of your own hard drive over
a secure SSH connection and and then
that way I mean it might be like
downloading 16 gigs and wherever you
went to but totally worth it install
some remote recovery stuff right now
pray is the only one that I know of
that's open source that I can vet Oh
another fun thing about going across
countries are going through borders is
you could instead of zeroing at your
hard drive you could put the
Constitution in ASCII on the drive like
moxie but then they don't like that and
then nukes before your recycle needs
like Derek's boot nuke - like we - nuke
your hard drive before you put it on
eBay because that's just good fun so in
conclusion the human-computer trust
model is flawed but then again
ultimately so are we and convenience is
a curse and computers aren't toasters
but come on neither are we so say we all
I'm Darrin kitchen
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of hack five how'd I do I think
that was a first first I'm doing a large
workshop like that I'm really glad that
you guys were able to tune in check it
all out live let us know your feedback
in the comments below and look forward
to some awesome stuff from black hat and
DEF CON next week as we roll into the
epicness that will be season 12
all right well with all of that I'm
Darrin kitchen trash techno West
now now I kind of like did this I didn't
walk off the screen ooh would you like
me to do it what should I exit stage
left
well I'm just gonna go just go
oh well go this way there's like a
curtain Oh see
I'll just ha ha ha huh yeah you gonna
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
