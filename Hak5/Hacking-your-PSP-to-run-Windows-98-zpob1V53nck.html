open alpha TV thank you so much n for
being you my pleasure and you have a
little PSP hack for us I do and that
would be that would be windows 95 or 98
on the PSP windows windows 95 or 98 I
know if you still have your cds you can
totally do this nice okay so uh first of
all does the service purpose I mean
having windows none whatsoever this is
one of those things you do because you
can oh yes yes the best kind of thing
the geek motto by far and so now since
we're on a PSP is this actually running
like Windows 95 ah well see this is why
we have tux on set because this is
running emulated through box legs so I'm
going to show you how to set up an image
of window is to move over to the PSP oh
sweet using box Linux music box Linux so
obviously that would be in the list of
things we need you need a pc you also
needs now yeah USB PSP cable because you
got to get it across and you need a
memory stick pro duo but it has to be
more than 150 Meg's because the minimum
installation from windows 95 is 150
Meg's you'll need more space for windows
98 and if you want any hope of using
your PSP for other stuff you need the
bigger stick I've got the one gig
sandisk stick this isn't it this is the
value pack one in my PSP right now and
that to me is the best one okay so
that's basically it except that your PSP
also has to be a 1.5 if you got the 2
point 0 you can downgrade but anything
past that in your stock it has to be 135
you need the colonel access okay so now
that we know what we have and what we're
doing mm-hmm how do we do it well we
gotta go into windows and all the
downloads for all the files are in the
show notes okay because there's a lot of
stuff that you need and I have to give
mad props to matt from hacker co IL
because he was one of the first guys to
get windows running on the PSP and
stinger wolf was actually gonna be
hosting most of the files on his account
and also configuration files if you
don't want to configure things yourself
you can get the pre-made files and get
er done get er done because it is a very
long install so you might want to
actually have like a book or a video
game to play in the meanwhile working on
your PA
here you might want to play your ps2
yeah basically so the first thing you
have to do to set up your image and
after you've downloaded all the files
you need you go into the box folder and
open bx image so we want to make a hard
drive enter now this is the part we're
going to make it 150 max becomes minimum
installation size now this is where you
get stuff you got to start paying
attention to mm-hmm you see how it says
30 for 16 and such as per track is 63
write that down you will need it three
to four more times I'm serious during
the installation yes or because even
though we have the pre-made installation
files you don't have to do the bare
minimum 150 if you wanted to make it you
know half gig installation will take
forever but you can do it so you got to
pay attention and write that stuff down
okay now i'm not going to remake it
because i already have my stuff i was
already set up alright but one of the
things that's going to happen in a
couple of steps from here is this going
to say like one of the steps is to
format see it's very important you're
not wrecking your hard drive you are
going to be formatting your image so
you're gonna be formatting your 150 Meg
image that you've created okay not your
hard drive it's okay go do it a lot of
people stopped at that step no I'm gonna
borrow my hard drive I don't want to set
up a new computer to make this
installation not like a virtual sidra
yes exactly gotcha if you follow the
steps it will the installation does take
a couple of hours because you're running
it emulated on whatever kind of pc you
have at home and you're going to move it
all over to the PSP and then boot it on
that and it's going to take another 10
to 20 minutes depending on the version
of Windows you're running 95 or 98 yes
and that's pretty much it so if you
follow the steps it's all very detailed
in the show notes okay see it and you'll
be good to go and can impress your
friends with the windows that doesn't
not much but I did it exactly do you
really want to play minesweeper on your
PSP just get the Lua player because it
comes included on that it's not as cool
as playing it in windows that is cool
this is the ultimate because you can't
think yeah absolutely windows through
linux on the PSP what more can you want
exactly so like we said on the show
notes detailed step-by-step and links to
all the files that will need yeah
totally thanks a lot and enjoy the rest
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
