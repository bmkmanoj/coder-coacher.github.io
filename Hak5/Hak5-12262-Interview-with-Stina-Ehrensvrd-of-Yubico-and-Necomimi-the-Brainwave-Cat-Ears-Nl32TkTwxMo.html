by domain.com you know this is very much
in the vein of what we've been talking
about on hak5 recently in that whose
responsibility is it to secure your data
we're not just you know your login your
data all of those things is it the
service provider is it the cloud service
or is it you should be you well it
should be you and it can be with open
standards you have this prepaid phone
card model where you know the prepaid
phone card you you buy it but you're
secure and anonymous you can use it a
service and you can buy several cards i
love that i have i do this i I by sim
cards with cash and I feel really good
knowing I've got an IP address that is
not tied to anything exactly so that's
sort of i think the privacy needs to be
put it on the you know we love the
internet we've just had that discussion
before this and the privacy on internet
is key we not sure we want your
government or your service provider to
own and control your identity so what we
are proposing is a model where the user
is owned in control their their identity
is not one but several and for that
obviously to exist it has to be truly
open it has to it's not gonna scale and
ubicool welcomes all the competitors to
come and do other tokens that you know
integrated in sim cards integrated in
jewelry or other form factors i actually
got a really someone answered my blog
when I brought the buds identity vision
they said he lined up with cool comic
books and and you know famous like
matrix and have cool gadgets that people
want to buy you know people are crazy
about gadget yeah yeah it's oh oh okay
if you want to brainstorm for a sec you
said sim cards bad idea because it
doesn't really move from phone to phone
easily what about people always bring up
biometrics why is that a bad idea I
wouldn't say it's bad but it has
limitations it's static identity has
time to you and you cannot revoke it if
it's misused because you don't want to
make a face Rick of you know face
surgery you feel like that I gotta log
in now so I would see there to sing
is where you would have this very
metrics if there are their initiatives
where you're putting the phone and you
may you have it to unlock your phone yes
if you're there is already out there
computers that has the biometrics and
you you know as a instead of logging in
without using password you take your
biometrics to log into your device and
then your fingerprint is tied or sort of
with that closed system of your device
which is okay security but if you would
have a service provider and having that
authentication for you we know there is
yes server somewhere with your face and
your fingerprints and that get hacked
and dude well one do you trust the
service provider that now has literally
your identity they have you know your
retina and your fingerprints and
moreover like you said when they when it
get tacked and then suddenly you know
talk about identity theft that's a you
know a true identity yeah and you cannot
really move between devices that are not
yours and you cannot have multiple an
anonymous identities because your
fingerprint and your face is not
anonymous so tell me about this what
what's the solution here where this is
great for me to log into my ssh server
on my laptop but now I want to browse
the way I want to login on my phone you
know what's what's the solution their
boat pose you no bluetooth you propose
different solutions for mobile devices
but if it is going to be if this you
know new global identity solution is
going to be adopted it has to be easy to
use on any device and we're in a boon of
new devices right now yes so I think the
two interfaces that has the best
potential is use B it's already there m
and NFC and NFC is now adopted in more
than 150 million smart devices and it's
coming even you know and I think the
reason why it's coming it's actually not
only because we have a little Yubikey
that has any sea but the credit cards
and that user experience is so great you
literally I mean you take your card and
you take your phone or your laptop and
you tap your card to your phone and
you've made
it secure payment that holds 16 digits
expiry date think you can just zip code
all the CCB number yes and that who has
all of your bank blocking your account
because they don't believe you did that
transaction and so so I think this
what's going to drive this and why users
will adopt it it's the privacy aspect
the simplicity if you have a token or
the identity you can literally just tap
it to your smartphone or your device or
tuck it into your into your computer you
don't have to retype anything you know
you don't have to be clever and this is
already happening is what you're saying
as far as like NFC with cards are
concerned yeah so will this just be the
adoption and that we didn't even know
that it just happened to overnight and
it's like oh well now this I log into my
phone or MasterCard is already driving
those initiatives putting NFC into
credit cards and so we're gonna you know
in a few years it's gonna be everywhere
this is gonna be great for getting drunk
on Amazon I've been wondering what shows
off on Prime the next day no I'm joking
uh you can make really fast payments
without having to think so what about
TPM yes so it isn't that the solution
that we've been talking that is that
that's been around for ages right TPM
has been around for ten years and in
almost all pcs you have PT p.m. today
again it's an identity that's tied to a
device and I personally I have four
different devices I have phones i have
tablets i'm different computers have
computer work at home sometimes i log
into my husband's computer or my kids
computer or am at a friend's house I
don't want to be my device I have my key
in my keychain and I can move it between
devices so I think TPM i would say in
the future you may want to see a
combination of TPM and biometrics and
the vision on my love Sonny I'm not
saying it's not going to be one
direction it's probably gonna make a mix
and for different use cases but we've
seen keep them for 10 years and why
hasn't scale I mean I don't know yeah I
think you're right that the credit cards
really have the most ability to get
actually some adoption because there's
so much industry behind that both on the
retail level and the consumer ease
banks that want that kind of security
and really just kind of adds a value add
whereas the TPM when you say hey the
value-add is we're more secure people
are like I have to do what now to be
more secure no no I mean the simplicity
at saving time and saving hassle is
really what's going to drive this so
with new protocols coming out in the
future what though can consumers do
today to be more security field moving
to two-factor like Google Authenticator
like you be keys like you know the range
of two factor authentication methods
that are out there is a good step and if
you want if your consumer you can tie
the two factor authentication to a
password manager like password safe
LastPass or pass pack and in that way
you can log in you know you can manage
and secure your range of passwords in a
better way than just having one static
password to everything all of your
identity I thought you deserted I would
say it's the best we have today is that
not the same problem that you're talking
about solving is that there's nobody
wants to adopt a system that is
controlled by one company I mean
remember in the 90s Microsoft with their
passport thing nobody wanted to just
trust Microsoft for the logins
everywhere is that not the same thing
when it comes to a password manager yes
but there are open source versions okay
so they are and and you can so the ones
who are really security aware they may
choose the open source version then
there are good security versions too but
i would i would use instead of having
bad you know simple passwords for
everything so i think there's a company
you know there's a balance between so
you're saying like any step is better
than ever step at all but if you're
really paranoid go with the open source
stuff maybe host it yourself put the
authentication put the control back in
your hands as far as your identity so
but really where I hope this to go is a
next-generation Internet where the full
potential of the internet would be
unfold if you can vote on your precedent
online if you can put your healthcare
records a lot you know
you and I don't have to sign send papers
physically with a post anymore to sign
contracts we can just do it with legally
binding signatures online that that
internet is gonna be so cool and that is
actually possible with new protocols
coming out that is so exciting are you
stina is a pleasure having you as always
