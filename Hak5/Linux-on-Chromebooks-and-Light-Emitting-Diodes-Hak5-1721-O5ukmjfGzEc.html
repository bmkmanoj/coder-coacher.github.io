you by domain.com hello welcome to hack
5 my name is Darrin kitchen and this is
your weekly dose of techno list
Shannon Morris is at CES currently but
she will be joining us later in the
episode with some awesome stuff about
Arduino and LEDs and I figured that I
would just go ahead and jump right into
it because we have been having an
amazing discussion about virtualization
and the comments in the forums and I
love all of the input and this brought
me back to thinking about you know
KVM and openvz these are awesome
projects and it really stirred up this
like one that I had shelved for a while
that I kind of need to get going for a
trip here soon and was like dude this is
a perfect opportunity to talk about
Ubuntu Linux on a Chromebook using ACH
routed environment now Chromebooks you
if you haven't seen these things are
pretty awesome they are light they're
cheap they run chrome they run SSH it's
kind of where it ends actually I have
one booted up right here and you can see
if you do ctrl alt T it's kind of epic
that you can just get yourself right
into a shell and Boop and crush crotch
is cool you can type help and see
there's well not a whole lot of options
here we can ping stuff and we can SSH
into things which is cool but you know
it's it'd be nicer if we would have like
a full Linux environment something with
all of the tools that we're used to and
this is where crouton comes in crouton
is they call it an acronym it stands for
the chromium OS universal CH rooted
environment and it's a set of scripts
that makes it really easy to deploy
Linux specifically they've got to set up
for Ubuntu and Debian on Chromebooks in
a chroot environment which is rad now
and this kind of ties in with openvz
in the way that CH rooted is a UNIX tool
that allows for like an isolated
filesystem is used by openvz project in
addition to many other things to create
independent on environments on top of a
single kernel which is what we're going
to be doing today what it means is that
the application is running running
within the CH rooted environment
typically typically can't see outside of
their own
container it's kind of sort of like a
sandbox but what we end up with here is
both not like a dual booting situation
more like a simultaneous like Chrome OS
and Ubuntu in this case utilizing the
same resources so the same ram same cpu
simultaneously but each within their own
independent file systems so for this i'm
going to be demoing this using the HP
Chromebook 11 but basically any
Chromebook will be supported in this
case and I love the HP Chromebook 11
it's about the year old and it's not
lightning fast or anything but this
thing is super light under the hood
dual-core 1.7 Giga her arm so already
tons of battery life on it because of
that 2 gigs of ram not much not
upgradeable either only a 16 gig SSD so
I mean nothing brilliant but you know
it's enough to run the basic Linux stuff
that I am miss like the bash utilities
and best of all it's only 2 pounds if
you've been paying attention for a while
you'll remember that last time I went to
Europe I complained a lot about the like
8 pound lenovo that I brought so maybe
this is where that came from but best of
all it runs off of microUSB I wish more
laptops would get in on this game
there's actually a specification for USB
to do I think it's up to 60 watts of
power so that's kind of RAD I just love
the idea of being able to run my laptop
off of a pineapple juice or actually all
of the equipment in my bag for that
matter so to get started what you'll
need is to put your Chromebook in
developer mode if you have an older
model there's probably a hardware switch
the newer ones you can do this in
software there's a three finger salute
that's holding down escape refresh and
power so I'll go ahead and do that here
and hope that Paul this stays on your
camera so escape the bloop and we get
this Chrome OS missing or damaged please
insert a recovery stick Paul do you get
that nope okay well it looks sort of
like that okay scary screen it doesn't
make any mention of this here but what
you'll have to do is hit control D
and we've press ENTER and then control D
and the system is now going into
developer mode
you basically have to wait here there's
not much you can do about it it takes
about ten minutes and it's going to wipe
the disk and while it wipes the disk
we're gonna have a nice little logo wipe
huh and once everything is wiped we will
be welcomed to setting up our Chromebook
as if it was brand new now the first
step after we've logged in is to go
ahead and download the crouton installer
you can always grab the latest version
from here we go HTTP come on
did I mention it's slow and now we can
go ahead and open up cross with ctrl alt
T and what's nice here it's is unlike
before we can actually issue shell we're
in developer mode and there we are we
are at localhost and if we go into our
download folder which is let's see and
slash home slash what does it user or
root it's not root hang on it is
whatever our current user is so that
would be in what user that's interesting
actually hang on let me just do CD and
then PWD AHA ok home and then Chronos
user there we go and now ah I was gonna
be the next step it's downloading all of
my extensions so anyway well it
downloads all the extensions in the
background I'm going to go into the
Downloads directory here and you'll see
that we have ok it's installing all of
the extensions sorry about that so if I
do an LS we can see we have our crouton
and then all we have to do is actually
execute this with SH so for that we will
need root or root it's fine so issue
sudo SH and then crouton or I guess in
this case it's going to be dot slash
because I'm in its directory and what we
can do is give it a tack T list and tack
our list so here we've listed our
releases as well as our target and I'm
gonna go ahead and install Ubuntu 14.04
because I love the long-term support
additions so that is a trustee and I'm
gonna go ahead and install that with
xfce you could if you wanted to run
unity I don't see why you would want to
on an ARM processor but so we're gonna
go with something lightweight like xfce
and actually if you want you can just
bypass all of the all of the gooeys
completely and just go ahead and
download the CLI version and then you
can just like pop into bash which is
fantastic for that just do tack T and I
think it's CLI - extras or just CLI oh
I'm sorry core core or CLI - extras
so for this what I will issue is I want
attack e for encrypted and then attack
our for trusty the latest version of
Ubuntu LTE and then for my target it's
going to be Z we X I WI extension and
XFC and we'll come back to ZB and
extension in a second oh right okay so
because we've asked it to do it
encrypted we'll have to set up some
passwords so we'll go ahead and give it
a good password and now we have to in
choose the past phrase for our actual
Linux install within that it's going to
go ahead and generate our key so move
the mouse for some entropy goodness and
there we go
and after that long and laborious
installation routine we pretty much just
give it a username and a password twice
and there we go now here's what's epic
we can pretty much just go ahead and
launch into the rooted environment by
doing a sudo enter th root
ah sudo enter - chroot and check that
out
I am DK at localhost and you'll notice
that this is a completely different
filesystem of ILs tak la slash this is
not the same file system as the
Chromebook which is fantastic that's how
our system is running and now I've got
you know bash and all of the other tools
that would love to be able to use on my
Chromebook and I can get to it simply by
hitting ctrl of T and opening up a tab
of of Krosh which is the command line
shell for Chrome however I would
probably like to get into the GUI at
some point and that's simply a matter of
issuing start xfce for so that's going
to go ahead and you'll notice here it
says retrying and the reason for this is
one of the targets that i installed was
the crouton integration extension here
so you can find this in the Chrome
extension market play or whatever it's
called and when you click that in the
top right what you'll see is loading I'm
gonna use the default configuration and
huzzah I have xfce and I've got you know
bash and my filesystem and all of the
other tools and I can go ahead and do
like a sudo apt-get install DOSBox and
start playing DOS games on my CH rooted
Linux environment on the Chromebook and
all sorts of other fun things like that
which is epic and what's really great
here is we can actually see if I go
ahead and hit exit here this is just
running within a window so if I alt tab
I'm back to Chrome and what's so great
about installing this crouton
integration extension here is what this
guy does is makes it so that you know
copy and paste between these if I I
actually select all of this and do a
copy I can now go into my terminal and
paste I spoke too soon well I had it
working but the idea is that this goes
ahead and synchronizes
chrome and your CH rooted Linux
environment so that the clipboard is
shared and also so that links to say
there's no need to then install Chrome
on your CH rooted boon to environment
because you know you already have chrome
so it makes it so that URLs will
actually open in Chrome's chrome that
makes any sense which is kind of epic
and I love having the option to you know
bounce into a very minimal Ubuntu
installation but have the ability to get
those tools even if it is on a slow
machine I love it I think it's pretty
rad and I would love to hear your
feedback on it so go ahead and hit us up

you think and we will be back in just a

it's time for the trivia question of the
week
our last trivia question was what
multi-purpose compiled language designed
in 1983 was super popular in the 90s and
has influenced several other languages
and the answer is probably kind of
obvious C++ now this week's trivia
question is who is the term voltage
derived from it's kind of easy answer
that over at hak5 org slash trivia for
your chance to win some awesome PAC 5
hoo goodies I decided to start off 2015
in a cool very fun way with more of my
Arduino segments so first off with this
year I would like to get started with
LEDs because LEDs are really important
feature of a whole lot of circuitry that
you guys will probably want to build
because hey they're fun and they're
pretty and there's lots of different
colors and they do blinky blinky things
and who doesn't like blinky blinky
things so LEDs that stands for
light-emitting diodes these are diodes
that can be found everywhere you can
find them in like your cell phone or I
could find them on the camera that I'm
currently recording on or they might
even be on the headlights in a car that
you might buy new LED lights on there so
they're really really popular you can
find them pretty much everywhere but
they're basically a diode is this little
device that makes current flow from one
positive side which is called the anode
to a negative side which is called the
cathode and not vice versa
luckily vice versa it doesn't really
work now the positive side the anode of
an LED is the longer leg I have a whole
bunch of ones here so let me get one out
for you if we take a look at this little
red LED you can see it has two sides to
it it's kind of hard to see on there but
you can sort of see it there's a longer
leg that one's the anode and then the
shorter leg over here is called the
cathode now the shorter one is negative
the longer one is positive so keep that
in mind now if you plug in it and the
LED backwards luckily it just doesn't
work because if it did work it would
probably blow up or screw it up into
some way but luckily no power can swoop
up into the cathode site it just comes
out the cathode side that's so the
negative side it always has to come
through the anode side otherwise it just
doesn't work
now diodes usually transmit energy and
that energy turns into some kind of heat
and it just gets kind of released and
then up into the atmosphere but LEDs on
the other side they create energy which
is released as light hence light
emitting diodes now LEDs drain current
the brighter that they are so if you are
running off of a battery a super-bright
LED will drain it faster than a lower
powered LED and LEDs are measured for a
certain amount of power so if you let it
have too much power it can end up
blowing up or it can burn out and you
basically know that it's dead Jim
because the LED blinks and then it just
turns off and nothing happens after that
or it might smoke or maybe it pops or it
just doesn't light up whatsoever then
obviously the things broken and you have
to get a different LED but luckily
they're all like a few cents so they're
very very cheap now try turning it
around if the power consumption is
backwards so luckily hopefully you just
put in the ground side on the wrong side
you can just switch them switch the two
legs around and hopefully it'll be good
then adding a resistor also can keep
your LED from eating up way too much
power now there are a lot of sites on
the Internet's that recommend starting
around 330 ohms for a resistor but you
can also do the math that we learned on
the resistance episode of hack 5 either
way if your LED isn't as bright as it
should be or the resistor is hot to the
touch
you're probably resisting too much power
so lower the resistor value now I did
want to mention something as well on my
computer over here I found a nice handy
graph over on Google because Google is
amazing this shows you a little graph of
an LED so the longer side is the anode
the shorter side is the cathode cathode
is negative a note is positive you'll
also notice this right here now if
you're ever ever looking at a schematic
you'll notice it's kind of like an arrow
goes from one end the anode side the
positive side over to the negative
cathode side and this arrow has two
little teeny tiny arrows pointing out of
it that means that it is a light
emitting diode if it did not have those
two little arrows pointing out of it it
would just be a normal diode like one
you would find on the inside of
circuitry instead of something that
lights up bright and cool like blinky
little LED lights you'll always notice
that
the anode side is the one that should be
pointing from positive the cathode side
should be the one that's pointing
negative that's where the power is
always going to go is the cathode side
now if you're not sure if an LED works
if you plug it in to your Arduino and it
just ends up not doing anything it could
be dead but there's also a really easy
way to test it out now there are these
little batteries called cr2032 batteries
so those are like the little ones that
you would find in watches or you could
find them at convenience stores like
Walgreens and stuff like that you can
just stick them between the two little
legs and clip them together kind of
pinch them in there with the plus side
of the battery touching the anode side
so that longer side and the negative
side touching the cathode so you'll
pinch it together and it should light up
because that is just enough power to
make a little LED light up yeah that's
kind of cool and simple and then you
could stick like a magnet on it and
throw it at things and make it stick and
you'll have LED blinking lights all over
your warehouse I totally didn't do that
moving on to choose your LEDs it's a
really good idea to take a look at data
sheet that comes with it now there are a
ton of LEDs that you can choose from I
have a graph up here that I also found
on Google and it shows you a bunch of
different sizes there's a whole bunch of
different colors there's the little itty
bitty ones that you usually find inside
of smaller electronics there's large
ones that you can find on breadboard
such as this big yellow wine in this
white one and the red one and then
there's also other ones that are clear
there's a bunch of different kinds that
you can purchase for whatever you need
them to do now it's very important to
understand the datasheet that you can
usually find on a website where you
purchase these from so I found an LED
that I want to buy it's called this
violet five millimeter LED it's 50
Cent's you know it's a good price and
it's violet and I've read the reviews
they all say that it actually looks like
violets so pretty
so there's this little datasheet here so
I can click on that and it takes me over
to this thing that's written in Chinese
now the Chinese part doesn't really help
me obviously but there is this nice
little graph and it explains everything
about the LED that you'll need to know
whenever you're working with it
so if we take a look at this graph now
let's scroll down a little bit on this
datasheet and you'll find this nice
little graph and this graph has some
pretty
interesting information on it now first
off we have this forward current so this
is the maximum rating of a current that
you can get out of this led so it says
in milliamps you'll get 20 milliamps if
you want it to just do something like
blinking at a really really bright color
and a whole bunch of times but you don't
want to leave it all in for a long long
time you can use this peak forward
current which is rated at 30 milliamps
but if you don't want it to burn out
over time if you don't if you're just
want to leave it on forever or something
like that the suggested use using
current is 16 to 18 milliamp now that
information is all really really
important when we get into some math the
rest of this you don't really have to
pay attention to unless you're soldering
or unless you're in really extreme
temperatures like you live in Antarctica
or something now maximum ratings these
are also very important the forward
voltage this is going to be rated in
volts and this is going to be a minimum
of 3.0 to 3.6 depending on which color
and which size LEDs you get that's going
to vary a lot so you'll might find some
like I have some red LEDs that came in
this little pack that are one point
eight to two point two volts so very
very important to check that before you
do anything with them you also notice
down here there's a wavelength the
wavelength is going to tell you in
nanometers what color it's going to end
up being so 395 to 400 will be violet
and luminous intensity so this it looks
like McDonald's but it's actually milah
Candela
that's the luminosity of your LED and
that's gonna be rated at 100 to 180 for
the luminosity to how bright it's going
to be and last off of course you have
viewing angles because not all LEDs will
be able to be viewed from every single
angle if you're looking at it and if we
scroll down a little bit more you don't
need to pay attention to this graph
right here but this is also important if
you decide to put this into any kind of
electronics you probably want to know
what size it is and here's a nice little
angle graph of exactly what viewing
angles you would be able to see this
violet LED from so it's pretty narrow
but it's decent
and yeah the rest is just about their
shipping containers so we don't want to
deal with all that information
so moving on LEDs they come in all sorts
of different shapes sizes and everything
but that data sheet is always very very
important now ones that I did want to
mention as far as different kinds
there's RGB ones that have four legs
instead of just two
one for each of the different colors
that you can get and you can mix the
intensities you can change the colors so
you can have like a whole rainbow of
millions of different colors
there's also flashing LEDs that have
integrated circuits inside of them to
make them flash SMD LEDs which are tiny
surface mountain mounted ones that have
little pads instead of legs so you would
probably find those robots making those
in warehouses not like this warehouse
there's also high powered leds like what
you find in fancy headlights and
flashlights things like that and then
there's also IR LEDs for remotes such as
turning your TV on and off that uses an
IR LED and UV LEDs for ultraviolet
now last off it's time for some math are
you ready because I am okay so this is
the fun part I have a board that gives
me five volts of power
anything else on my board has to share
that whole voltage for my whole circuit
to work so it can't go over five volts
ever it always has to be under five
volts so let's say that I have two LEDs
so I might have let's say I have two red
LEDs this is just example talk to LEDs
and both of these are rated at 2.4 volts
max for their forward voltage so this
was on that graph again I would want to
add a resistor with 0.2 volts being
absorbed through it to equal the power
because that's the difference so you
have two point four plus two point four
that's four point eight plus a resistor
with point two volts that equals five
volts total so you always want to have
five volts going in and five volts going
out now this is called and I might say
it wrong Kirchhoff's law I hope I said
that right
kirsov Kirchhoff's law is he German I
don't know I should probably look that
up now for my violet LED I would need a
280 M resistors so I could just do the
math for this this is Ohm's law five
volts divided by
0.018 so that 18 equals 277 and I just
rounded up to 280 because it's a little
bit easier now it gets a little bit more
complicated if you want to limit the
current to a certain degree so let's
take our violet LED again and this time
we're gonna use a 9-volt battery so if
we look at our spreadsheet our datasheet
it says forward voltage is rated at 3
volts so the minimum is 3 maximum is 3.6
so I'm gonna calculate it via the
minimum voltage that it needs I want to
limit the current of electricity to this
led to 16 milli amps and I chose 16
because that's the suggested usage usage
current that I want to use so I would
take my 9-volt battery and I would
subtract the 3 bolts for forward forward
voltage volts and that equals 6 volts
now after that I divide that by 0.01 6
because 0.016
is the milliamps that I want to use the
usage current now that will equal my
resistor ohms like how many ohms I need
so i wouldn't want to resistor that's
around 375 ohms now it's pretty darn
close to the average of 313 generally
would need now lasts off I did get a lot
of people asking about this and
commenting on YouTube so I decided to go
ahead and mention it do you need a
resistor so it's kind of an argument
there's a lot of people that say no not
necessarily there's a lot to say yes now
the safe answer is yes I didn't use one
for my previous example because I didn't
need one for that example now I'll give
you a quote exactly from Arduinos
website because this is kind of
important when it comes to arduino z' so
can i plug an LED into AD we know
without a resistor the answer is yes
although not necessarily the best of
techniques and atmega pen can only
supply about 40 milliamps which is not
enough current to damage standard LEDs
which is what I was using for my example
a better choice would be a series
resistor of a value between 100 ohms of
1k using that math you'll be able to
figure out if you need 100 ohms 1k 230
330 whatever it might end up being
connected between the LED and the ground
so that information is very very
important it's always important to
understand how much power you're getting
out of your pins and if this is going to
end up screwing up your LEDs so I think
that about explains LEDs and all the fun
times that you can have with them make
sure that you pay attention to the math
for doing your resistors if you need
resistors for your calculations of
course I think I'm gonna go build things
with these I know I've got a robot in
the mail so maybe I'll put LEDs on my
robot I guess we'll find out stay tuned
of course you can email me feedback at
hak5 org if you have questions about
LEDs and resistors and all the
calculations that you need to do to make
sure that you're building your circuitry
correctly stay tuned we're gonna take a
break that just about wraps up this
week's episode of pack five but before
we get going I wanted to thank you all
for participating in the AK 5 LAN party
this was an awesome success of our first
beta test of like hey let's pack a bunch
of people in the warehouse and play
Unreal Tournament until we're blue in
the face and that's what we did and it
was a lot of fun and we learned a lot of
things about how like warehouses are
cold at night and stuff like that
but otherwise it was kind of rad and I
think we're gonna do another even bigger
mega huge one in the summer so stay
tuned for details on that and you know
lots of other fun projects and the works
so with all of that you can find all the
ways to follow and subscribe over at
hak5 org that's where you can always
have your hack 5 delivered to you at
hak5 org or just google hack 5
there's revision3.com so Shack 5 as well
sometimes they post episodes of act 5
sometimes they don't otherwise with that
and for Shannon who's now at CES I'm
reminding you to trust your tech no less
I am starting off 2015 rate it's 2015
isn't it okay it's not important
okay good I am starting this year off
correctly and I'm going to get back in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
