life back to the US you know you know so
the project Jakarta is done but the
diplomatic mission to Alderaan continues
and I can't thank blue in enough for
making this so amazing I didn't expect
to get involved with the client as I did
but regardless it's delightful to hear
that everything is going well that means
nothing to you I know what does mean
something to you is that it has now been
16 weeks of hack across the planet and
we got another four to go at least and
and I've got a few things to report so
number one I'm off to South Africa next
week so if you're in Johannesburg the
last week of June the first week of July
sign up over act across the planet calm
it would be awesome to do a meet-up
similarly after that we'll be spending
some time in the United Kingdom so I'm
picking up a motorbike in London and I'm
thinking about doing I don't know like
actually if you're into riding that
would be fantastic but otherwise I was
thinking about doing some meetups in
London Sheffield Manchester Dublin
Birmingham sounds familiar
yeah we did this in 2010-2011 kicked off
the whole hack across the series or
whatever and this time I'm not doing it
in the snow I don't know why I was going
to everywhere anyway same goes hack
across the planet calm you're going to
find all the cities in the lower regions
drop down I would love to have a pint
with you but today I'm talking about
tech stuff so let's do that
I'm gonna talk about some toys you know
I was going to do like a full gear
review of like what worked what didn't
but seeing as I just came back from
shipping a bunch of stuff back to the
u.s. I have nothing but the essentials
here so we're going to focus on those
the bare necessities of being Darrin
kitchen and hacking and speaking and
vlogging and working across the planet
so if you're into gear enjoy this if
you're not
what are you doing here we're like this
is protect no lust so what didn't work
well you've got to know that when it
comes to travel I am a huge minimalist
literally that is all I need
ever but on this trip I have allowed
myself some luxuries that have already
shipped back like a super lightweight
tripod that I think I use twice it's a
little bit bulky relatively speaking
super lightweight so if you're looking
for those all bling kids in the
description it's pretty cool but I just
didn't use it as much as I think I could
have same thing with the DJI Osmo I
really wanted a stabilizer because you
know this is only so much fun and the
DJI is great but it's just too bulky so
I think I'm just going to give that to
Shannon or something as you can tell
I've kind of given up on it it won't fit
my mobile phone with the microphone that
I use which is kind of like really
important to me as far as sound greater
than shakiness and of course I've also
shipped back my wife a pineapple tetra
just because I'm done with client stuff
I love it they love it but I am now
pairing down and I'm just going to rock
the Nano which will be fine for the next
few weeks see I have this formula when
it comes to travel gear that really it's
all about value equals weight times
volume divided by necessity and if
there's a smaller item that'll work even
if it only does 80% of the job then go
with that I think a perfect example in
fact talking about the DJI Osmo would be
to start with the video gear because I
know stabilizer is important this is my
current stabilizer it is smaller than
the DJI Osmo and I like it because it
charges over standard micro USB like
where is it right here like I don't know
why that's such a big deal to me but I
love the fact that everything in charge
over one port is just like less wall
warts and stuff to carry on or less
esoteric cables I hate esoteric cables
so this is it right I mean it's it's
phone clips in there I wish I could tell
you what the brand is there's a bunch of
these but basically it's a one access
again 8020 rule applies here it's not
going to do all the accesses of the Osmo
but it's going to work nearly as well
same thing with that tripod the tripod
that I actually used is three different
pieces this is my go-to tabletop tripod
as you can see it's pretty sufficient
this is the Tinkertoy base which folds
up like this and it ends up being less
than 100 grams which is amazing this is
a selfie stick which is pretty good
considering it has a quarter side at the
bottom and at the top and this is a
little guy that holds on to my phone and
it's actually part of a system from Joby
which comes with it's very own base
which kind of looks like this and I love
this thing and it has this added bonus
feature where it can convert into a cute
little companion pet that looks like he
just came out of Burning Man of the
three pieces of gear that I absolutely
must have at any given time it's my
phone my microphone and my tripod and
they all fold down and fit my pocket and
the rode mic comes with a dead squirrel
which is an industry term for a thing
that blocks the wind now this little guy
I haven't used too much it is the theta
s 360 camera for VR shots I used to use
it a lot more having so much lately but
that may change in Kruger it's nice to
carry along and I also bring with it a
set of little VR glasses these are
awesome they just fold up like that
right and then they just like clip onto
your phone right there and you can look
at ik actually it doesn't
finally hacking gear aka getting it done
equipment basically the surface pro 4
has been my issue however I must say I
really should have just brought my Linux
box my XPS 13 from Dell and just deluded
into Windows for the bare metal goodness
of Adobe suite still though it was
alright never underestimate either the
importance of a good Mouse especially if
you're doing any video editing this is a
Microsoft Surface 1 it's ok it chews
through triple-a batteries which isn't
really the greatest but if there's
something out there that charge over USB
you can see a reoccurring theme here
then that would be all about it also
those noise cancelling headphones
because there's children on airplanes
and you should be getting work done
listening to duke ellington or wild
light or Watsky or you get the idea
USB power banks again I'm a huge fan of
all those I've been rocking the anchor
power cord 13400 plus it's rock-solid
this thing we're actually now bundling
with the Wi-Fi pineapple touch grip
because it's just it's that good then I
forget exactly how many hours is like at
least eight it runs a true for
ridiculous amounts of time and Thank You
LT taro for the recommendation on this
thing other than that I've been using of
course they are on hack 5 field kit and
I must say that the new micro switch has
been instrumental and basically putting
together little ad-hoc networks here of
pineapples and turtles squirrels and
everything under the Sun so I know it's
simple but it's kind of essential bag
wise who doesn't love bags I have been
rocking the peak designs backpack and
I've got to thank Shannon for the
recommendation this thing is awesome I
love all of the little like secret
pockets and
little areas here to keep more
essentials like bags of googly eyes all
right so that's the gear it's not
everything but it's the essentials and I
want to hear what you guys think so
leave messages in the comments and maybe
there's some better gear that I don't
know exists that I should have
anticipated or bulkier gear that you
know about that I don't and then we can
like share the brain thought waves
through the computer Internet okay to
little bits of news and then we get
going it's a short episode I know but
I'm trying to fly as I am literally
trying to fly have to be on a plane here
real soon this is really crazy cool
awesome vibe this show you're watching
turning 12
Wolff right the the site was registered
in July of July 21st of 2005 the first
episode came out August 5th
about this time 12 years ago I was
dreaming up the idea of what would
become this show and I had no clue at
that time that it would take me around
the world also realize I'm in the
kitchen now which is a little recursive
but I love that and thank you so much I
don't even I don't have a clue how to
genuinely thank you enough with like all
of the like appreciation in my heart
because I I can speak for everyone a
hak5 I know I do when I say that I can't
imagine our lives without this and I
don't know where we would be otherwise
and I'm so happy that we're here today
and that you're here supporting us when
this is just long I love it
I love it did you get Tim Tams put them
in the freezer they're awesome and
lastly I need to give you guys an update
yes the cow is alive and well sab tactic
has been admiring the skyline of Jakarta
the earlier the cow was having a cup of
tea with plenum so to be fair she's
probably the only animal that should be
drinking cow milk regardless and she was
even earlier today getting in an
argument with the Google home so I don't
know it's a but I think the cow likes it
here with me right would you ever take
the couch as a Sydney Opera House huh
like I said sub this isn't over
if you have a great idea bring it to the
web the way Shannon I do and head over
to domain comm with an awesome domain
discovery service and a quick media
checkout process you'll have the perfect
site up and running in no time
oh my guys over at domain.com are soon
taxed five fans which is why hak5 will
save you an extra 20% at domain.com or
just send my tweet and say thanks for
supporting hi-5 all these years so when
you think domain names think domain.com
this episode on the other hand is
because I got a boogie down to the
airport and leave my beautiful home here
in Jakarta I'm going to move to Cardo
Jakarta thanks for all the good times
thanks for all the fish tempeh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
