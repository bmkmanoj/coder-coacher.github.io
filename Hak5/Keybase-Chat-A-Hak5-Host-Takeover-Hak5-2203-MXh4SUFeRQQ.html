bass up all that and more this time on
hat 5 hi welcome to this week's episode
of hack 5 my name is Darren kitchen and
I'm saying Louis this week we will be
hacking pineapples with bread yes oh no
I'm going to be Wi-Fi pineapple eat
something and I'm gonna be fast burning
stuff yeah yes this week we have hacked
the hosts that's right ok I have
everything set up for my one host show
happy April Fool's Day by the way we
have a lot of fun here at the hack 5
studio so Jason and Sarah thoroughly
enjoy cracking me up
since darrid has been seriously knocking
it out of the park lately with all of
his hardcore segments on the bash Bunny
I wanted to tone it down take it down a
notch with some easily digestible
segments involving your own privacy and
security we recently reviewed new
applications on the show in the past but
it's always really really nice whenever
you can actually revisit them and
introduce new concepts that they have
been developing because a lot of these
applications have been in development
for years and they've been doing some
really cool stuff so I have a few quick
and really easy reviews lined up for the
next few snubs only episodes that I hope
will inspire you to keep up your own
security I think this is so important so
this week I am revisiting key base which
is over at key base dot IO it's been
invitation-only for a long time it's a
command-line tool as well as a website
that
helps you securely encrypt if you
haven't already checked it out keep a co
slash Shannon Morse that's my own
profile where you can see my public key
and I have two devices assigned to this
account which I just set up and I'm
going to show you how to do that today
and I also have my snubs Twitter account
verified as well as my github account so
you know that that's me whenever you
look at that public key because I've
already verified it with my Twitter
account and my github which again are at
snubs and I believe my github is snubs
as well yeah so you can follow people on
the key base website you can have people
follow you if they want to and they can
see any changes that you make to your
own profile and they can also send you
messages which you can easily decrypt or
encrypt on the website and you can sign
those with your own public key or
private key as well so key base takes a
very friendly consumer approach to
encryption that we've seen a lot of in a
lot of different PGP apps but it also
maintains a command line interface for
those that want more reliability and a
web interface so if you want the command
line interface you can go for it if you
want the web interface you can do that
as well we've shown both on the show so
take whichever one you want key base
uses the PGP encryption technique for
public and private key pairs and to
review you get a private key and it
stays private and then you share your
public key and people can use your
public key to encrypt messages to you
and then you use your private key to
decrypt the message PGP has been around
for 20 years or more for encrypting
messages it's a long time come in that
somebody finally made something that's
more consumer friendly because for the
longest time PGP was just something that
you know people this show use people
have hak5 use but not necessarily like
your your mom or somebody like that so
we have shared how to do simple message
and file encryption using the web
interface in the command line in hack 5
episode 17 15 and 1904 and both of those
I'll put links to in the show notes but
key base now has introduced a chat
system in their downloadable client
because surprise they also have a
downloadable client it's so cool
so a quick overview
from the key based blog says that it is
faster it has built-in encryption for
chat and file sharing it allows you to
build out crypto commands in the command
line which is really cool it verifies
identity proof and it is open source and
of course it's free because all of key
basis interfaces are free so I don't
necessarily want to give out like my
email address or my phone number every
single time that I want to contact
somebody and that's kind of what you
have to do with apps like signal and
whatsapp so I've used the second line
for or a second email for pretty much
forever and that's kind of an annoying
task to be honest is whenever I have to
you know remember to log into that email
or remember that I have that second
Google Voice phone number that I plan to
give out to people whenever I need am at
conventions and stuff like that I go to
a lot of hacker cons I want to be able
to contact people especially if I want
to interview them for the show without
the need to share my personal private
phone number that my family has so this
is where key base I felt is really
useful
just like via their web interface you
can find people through their public
Twitter account or their Facebook or
their ret reddit or github or hacker
news or whatever you want or you can
also find them from their key base name
as well and that's just a web link so
it's really easy to find so to install
it luckily it's very simple as well for
me I'm running Linux so I had to do the
command line version but of course if
you have a Mac operating system or
Windows you can also just download the
executable or the image file for those
and it's very easy installation for
Linux there are a few commands that you
have to put in so it's just using curl
and then D package and app get install
tack F so everything's written out you
can just copy and paste those over it's
really simple and then to run it you
just type and run key base so I'm gonna
go ahead and open my terminal here and
go back down to it I ran it yesterday as
well doing some testing so you can see
that I've already done it before that is
the adorable squirrel that you get and
then in immediately logs into your
account as you can see with this example
right now it's running awful slow
whenever it's trying to load my profile
so they do have a few quirks to work out
but if you click on four
sample the profile picture that's
supposed to be there it's gonna tell you
about your profile picture so this is
supposed to mean my profile there it
goes it finally loads for me so it does
run a little bit slow but you can see
all the followers that I have and all
the ones that I am following which is
not much I should really go through
there and find some more people to
follow the first time you boot it up you
are going to have to log in with your
key base account or you need to create a
new one since it is still invite-only
format you will need to get an invite
from somebody I don't have any right now
but if I do I'll put them up on my
Twitter account it gives you a special
word phrase that is tied to your vie
device the first time that you boot up
the key base client make sure and this
is so important that you copy that key
base word phrase over to something like
a notepad or a encrypted file document
or wherever you want to store it because
you are only going to see that word for
phrase once and you need that to verify
every other device after this so if you
want to install key base on more than
just your one laptop which I highly
suggest that you do you need to make
sure that you keep that word phrase
because it will need it to verify on
multiple devices I know I said that
twice but it's really important it is
your key and your key only it's very
very important so now you can add people
if you want to to your own profile you
can add them to chat luckily it's really
easy to use you can check out someone's
profile to see how they've authenticated
and it's really them so for example I
can go over to following and I'll find
Aaron kitchen on here so after it loads
his profile it shows me that he's
verified via his Twitter he really
should verify his get github - he's very
active on there and then it shows me his
public key and then of course I can see
who's he's following and his followers
and stuff like that so for example if I
wanted to add him to a chat I would go
to new chat and type in Darren I think
he's hack 5 Darren on here wait for it
to load and then choose him and go to
start a chat now to open up in I can
start a chat with him
hey you know now luckily I had a bunch
of people helping me out with this
experiment last night so I was able to
get some chats going so I could show you
those today thank you so much
buddy on Twitter for helping me out with
this I got a whole page of chats that I
can go through and give examples for
which is super cool thank you so for
example I'll go over to this one printf
he sent me some really funny duck photos
because I told them not to send me any
specific photos starting with a deep but
anyway he's you can make sure that he's
actually encrypted in signed all of
these images that he's uploaded by
clicking on those three little dots
right there next to one of the messages
and showing if it's encrypted and signed
by the person's device and then on what
date and time I can also click download
if it's a file which is super cool now
you will notice that Darin on here he
hasn't downloaded the key based client
yet I know he hasn't because I asked him
but when he does he will show up and he
will log in and he will already see my
message on here waiting for him which is
great because somebody doesn't
necessarily have to already download the
client client for you to actually
contact them you can go ahead and
contact them and they'll have this inbox
ready for them whenever they're ready to
download it so luckily the chat client
is pretty self-explanatory it's very
similar to other chat clients and I'm
sure you can make your way through it
without me showing you how to put in
emojis or something but I wanted to give
you some cool pro tips that are super
super useful for if you want to share
code or things like that so first off
key base chat uses the same markdown
method that you will find in github in
in slacks so if you used either of those
you will recognize a lot of this
markdown syntax so for example if you
use the backtick and put it around a
word like this it will show up with a
little highlight and in different text
it will stand out way better than it
would if it was just normal code so in
this example printf sent me over this
really cute little ASCII art of a duckie
and of course my first reaction was like
oh is that a code black and pretty much
it is it's code in syntax highlighting
highlighting so pretty cool that you can
actually add that in another really neat
feature that you can do with this if you
go over to your terminal you can send
messages from the command line so an
example would be
I can send a message over to I'll send
one to midnight slacker over here so I'm
gonna type in echo hey dude and then
pipe that over to key base chat send
let's make sure I spell it right
midnight slacker so that's going to open
up a private conversation with midnight
slacker and then it will show up that
it's sent him a message so he's now
going to show up at the top of my
message chat system up here and it'll
show my new message in the actual client
so you can totally just work within the
CLI if you want to there's also a whole
bunch of great examples of what you can
do in the command line on their blog let
me scroll down and show you those so
mine was this echo and piping feature
but you can also use key based chats and
Chris beers Saturday for example or you
can send to multiple people at once by
just putting a little comma in between
them so pretty awesome that you can add
those things and also the last thing I
wanted to mention too is JSON is
supported so you can write bots that
will work in the chat system so the key
base chat has this help API function doc
so you can go over to key base chat help
API and you can read up on a bunch of
examples of little JSON arguments that
you can include so that you can write
like math functions and stuff like that
I don't use a lot of things like that so
I probably won't use that but I will
definitely using the coding blocks
because that's something that we use a
lot here in the hak5 warehouse of course
with any other chat function you can
also mute people you can block them via
a little iock icon at the top corner and
the little folder that you can see up in
the top corner as well that is for
sharing documents too so this opens up a
little private folder between like me
and midnight slacker for example I can
put documents in here if I wanted to and
then midnight slacker would also have
access to those documents as well so in
a way it's kind of like thinking of it
as a drop box but encrypted just between
the two people and there's no access to
it
outside of those devices also you can
post public messages via the command
line interface so for that you can just
go over in type key based chat send
tactic public and then whatever your
screen name is so mine is Shannon Morse
hit enter and then enter in whatever
your message content is so I will say
hack five is Otho hit enter and then if
I want to go back I can also read these
messages with key base chat read tactic
public Shannon Morse
hit enter and it's going to show you any
of my public messages that I've sent so
you'll notice the first one nineteen
hours ago this is my public message the
second one fourteen seconds ago hack
five is awesome you also notice that in
this case I put quotes and the quotes do
show up so you don't necessarily have to
put those in the first one I did not
include quotes and of course quotes
don't show up so you don't have to
necessarily put quotes if you don't have
to keep ASA is going to be announcing a
phone app soon which is super exciting
and the desktop client currently
supports up to four thousand character
texts and file attachments as well
so when it comes to privacy of course
because I know you're all questioning
that all communications are encrypted
end to end with this key base client but
they're not using forward secrecy and
for me I was like why is that they read
up on the entire thing they explain it
all on their blog but coming soon
they're gonna have this thing called
exploding messages that will have for
its secrecy as an add-on so you history
chats will survive unless you turn on
exploding messages this is to make it
more consumer-friendly again the key
based chat doesn't use PGP keys remember
that weird word freeze when you first
started up the client it is your paper
key as they call it it's tied to the key
based device key base is trying to make
encryption really friendly for everybody
so you can read more about what they're
doing over on their blog it's key base
do slash blog and they have this whole
thing about their new key model that
they're going for but if you are a nerd
like me you can still find somebody via
their public PGP key as well you can
just type it into the command line so
for example I could type in key base
chat send and then whatever the PGP key
is I don't know whatever it looks like
and then you can type in your message so
in my case I'll say hey just like that
that's all you have to type and then
they would get that message via their
public PGP key now if you do want to tie
more than one computer to your account I
mentioned this before you will need that
weird word phrase called a paper key the
first two words are public the rest of
them are private are part of your
private key so don't share it with
anybody
your second computer will need to
authenticate with the first computer and
vice versa
so that way no matter what you have that
authentication going between those
different devices even though they're
all tied to the same account you will
also be able to access the same account
on both ones and if one gets stolen you
can go under devices and revoke it so
for example on mine I currently have two
devices set up I think it's just my
computer no I just have one device set
up right now that's it so I need to add
other devices but if anything happened I
could revoke this device I'm not gonna
do that though because I want to keep
that word phrase for a second device so
I can authenticate it because that's
smart but if you do have key base only
installed on one computer and that one
gets stolen you're not going to be able
to access your data so keep that in mind
all right I think that's about it with
the key base client but of course if you
guys have questions you can leave them
below or you can find me on the key base
chat to ask anything that you want of
course the key base the people that run
key base they're also really cool and
really excited to chat with people over
the client - for example I was talking
to Chris earlier today I think that's
awesome so thank you so much for
chatting with me cubase dot io / getting
- started is where you can go to
download it this wasn't sponsored by
them or anything I just think it's
really cool and I felt like it needed an
update on hack 5 because they've done so
many updates themselves so and I'll
definitely be reviewing the iPhone app
in iOS or Android app whenever they come
out with those - so I will be right back
after a quick peek if you've got a great
idea bring it onto the internets the way
