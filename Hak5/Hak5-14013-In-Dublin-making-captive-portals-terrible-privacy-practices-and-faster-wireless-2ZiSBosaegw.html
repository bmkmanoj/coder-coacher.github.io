by domain.com all right Darren what time
is it Darren Darren he's not responding
Darren okay fine it's time to check port
110 that's what he says right right okay
so Commish says my school has an online
interface used for all sorts of
administration and student organization
recently parents were given access to
this interface they can access medical
information that's weird parent-teacher
communications custody agreements
disciplinary information and other
private details parents were given login
details on a note given to students to
be handed to the parents if that isn't
insecure enough it is clear to see that
the password was the last four digits of
the home phone numbers in all usernames
are already easily accessible through
this online interface in other words all
students with half a brain can easily
access it private information of other
students I really want to inform the
school of my concerns obviously however
I don't know how to do it if I'm not if
I'm too soft with it I know nothing will
get done however if i push it too hard I
will shut myself off from advancement
and leadership on opportunities within
the community now Darren what have you
got to say to this nice young hema SH
there your toy just fell
well you bring up a really important
point and this is nothing new in
academia in fact if this weren't
academia say go ahead and take the rear
out of responsible disclosure you know
give the vendor in this case the school
ample time to fix the problem before
ever talking about this publicly that
said it's a totally different ball of
wax when it comes to schools in many
times they decide to shoot the messenger
and that's not what you want here so i
would say give it some time before you
want to tell any of your friends that
won't be as it potentially is
responsible as you are with this
information but to i would say is
probably a good choice to anonymously
send this to the administration and if
you look around the the net you're going
to find so many different ways to do a
non MC mail it's probably one of the
easiest things so just google around for
that and that's probably your best bet
as to be able to solve the problem
without drawing too much attention to
yourself good luck and thanks for
writing in cheers got an idea for a new
business want to publish a blog or a
portfolio domain com is the best place
to go you probably need to register a
new com domain name for that new site a
dot-com domain name is the original it's
globally understood immediately gives
credibility to your website no matter
what name you choose plus if you want to
invest in sell domains comms have the
highest after market value you can find
