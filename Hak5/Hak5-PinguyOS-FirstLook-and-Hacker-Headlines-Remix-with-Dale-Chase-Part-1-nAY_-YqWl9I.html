no one's getting paid here so hey tell
me what's going on this week we've got
so much great stuff planned for Season
ten we have the folks from quad shot
down to explain how to program the the
it's the open source they will the quad
job but it's they're talking about the
open source paparazzi unmanned flight
auto pilot thing really really cool
we've got a whole series with that so
we're going to kick it off this week I'm
really stoked about that project I've
ordered mine I can't wait to get it I
got to fly it I got to fly it yeah like
tandem like so the guys got the remote
and then I've got the other remote and
it's like tied into his okay so it was
like student driver we're taking a break
pedal too yeah it's just like that I
think it's like he keeps like okay
keeping it steady and then like once
he's got a steady like hits this thing
and the switch is over my controller now
I'm trying to fly it and I'm like oh and
of course it's the only prototype I I'm
flying there only one that won a
machined by hand it spent a week on or
something building just as one airframe
and so I was a little nervous and we've
got it over there where the dogs are
playing fetch and stuff yeah they're
like trying to catch the thing while
it's in the air but you know um yeah
that was good so we've got that and
we've got so many other great things I
know that we're I'm doing a lot of fun
stuff with linux this series 310 he too
oh yeah for real we were just in / dev /
knows we go girl I was in there in
Missouri dismal um yeah I checked out
this thing called pin guy OS which is
like a it's like a crossbreed type of
thing of well I have a feeling that the
Creator really likes Macintosh because
it's very mech related oh really yeah
it's a
so it's this operating system that was
basically as it was sent in by Wayne oh
thank you wayne oh and it's this OS for
pretty much anybody like not just geeks
it was made for it's made very very
simplicity yeah I mean a lot of the
Linux distros like you know arch and Gen
2 and stuff are not as beginner-friendly
they're not as like I always suggest one
two or mint as right oh yeah I God like
it's very easy but this one already has
a whole bunch of stuff pre built into it
and it already has everything configured
that you would think of that you would
have to you know configure yourself so
it's built off of ubuntu 11.04 oh yeah
there are a whole bunch of really nice
things that I like about it first of all
it's pre-installed with all those
programs and it's pre-configured like
for example with VLC like a lot of times
you open up a video and it opens up in
some random program yeah we're it's like
asking you what program do you want on
the surface it already has your videos
pre-configured okay the LC so you don't
have to do that afterwards and it's out
of the box ready to use it's very
polished and the OS looks very very
clean and similar to kind of looks like
that absolutely yeah like it's got um
it's got this thing down here called
dokie hmm I see it's even got the dots
under what programs are running so I
opened that up you like hell it already
yeah so um all that's already
pre-installed and donkey would you like
this and then this widget I don't know
what it's called that's that there's a
bunch of these well there's a bunch of
those different widgets but yeah it just
sits there in the background it shows me
way too much information but it's nice
to have even so so doc he was one of my
favorite things another thing I liked
about this is this one called known do
it's a search feature but it also has a
whole bunch of other built-in things
like for example you can twitter from it
can you set up your twitter client and
you can like open up files and folders
and you can choose to define something
so i could type in define and it opens
up that application look I could define
a word if I wanted to um samba is built
in and ready to go so file sharing yeah
I about to do is right click
I would expect it to and then add your
password and then on their website which
is pinned iOS com there how to area on
their forums is like super super handy
yeah they have everything that you would
want there's tons of good info there's
like an ubuntu terminal cheat sheet that
has like all the different sudo commands
and everything there's no there's dual
monitor setup guys there's a set-up
guide to boot it off so is this your new
OS I mean what are you thinking well I
had a couple of problems with it when I
set it up first off the internet wasn't
already connected and it couldn't see my
wireless card so it had a couple of
issues with that yeah that's and that
was kind of you should have sprung for
the i7 model of this laptop comes with
the atheros chipset I might have you got
the broadcom in there and okay and then
I also had issues with installing this
actually onto my laptop so i could dual
boot between 17 and ping guy so I was
having issues with like all this free
space my errors that kept on coming up
even though I have tons of free space on
Windows 7 so right now I'm just putting
off of the USB well we could get you
into like partition matter partition
magic gnome partition manager yeah so I
mean it's gonna take some time and i'll
have to go into other we can set it up
manually but it just wasn't doing it
like through the next next finish think
you would think cuz that's built into
boon to that this would have it as well
you could just like so yeah slider
uh-huh and change your memories oh well
yes but i was having issues so um I
think it's really nice and clean and
simple for anybody who's never messed
with Linux it's a great way to start off
and it's a great way to you know get
your feet wet in the terminal and
everything but as far as a dual boot er
I don't think this is the one well you
know what I think we're just gonna have
to ask you guys what do you think
Shannon should check out as her first
linux distro installing the hard drive
none of this USB stuff anymore snubs
yeah or you can multi boot off a USB
I've seen a couple of tutorials on doing
that I'm joking hey like what that's the
way I'm just gonna throw that out there
now you should definitely go gen 2 i'm
joking but but much love
work or you might like that anyway so I
hit us a pbl feedback at hak5 org we
should probably also check in with
Kirby's TCP packet of the week a little
later but actually I got any starbucks
yeah or maybe start war or maybe we hand
this off to Dale chase in just a bit
first we'll be back after a quick word
