Linux on an iPod Linux on an iPod that
plays Doom of course and here to show us
just that is our very own paul tobias
thanks for coming on and get in front of
Cameron so you're here to talk about
putting Linux on the ipod where'd you
hear about this man I first read it and
make magazine a while ago but I checked
it out back then and didn't really
support my generation iPod and there
weren't as many applications that you
can use it for but it was kind of
interesting but recently I checked it
out and they've done a lot more
development and goes all the way up to
the 5th generation iPods with video
suite so aside from the doom what else
can you do with iPod line um there's
other emulators for like the NES the
Gameboy
there's MAME and there's plenty of
writing programs other means like
letters I have it how do you write on an
iPod you got a there's lots of different
text input methods but the main one is
you scroll through the letters and
numbers and you press like and you write
one letter at a time with just the one
button gotcha
so what about everybody at home that has
an iPod that's wondering what the
compatibility is you know by generation
of iPod
well the wiki on iPod Linux that org
definitely helps explain it there's a
whole graph listening to generations and
what parts of the iPod it supports okay
but we're not gonna see it on a shuffle
anytime soon no definitely not
okay now if we put Linux on our iPod
we're gonna lose any of the original
iPod functionality um absolutely no
because what you're doing is dual
booting and you let you either boot the
Apple firmware or the Linux firmware so
it's just a grub if you were to put you
know yep Linux on a Windows machine or I
guess on this case on a Mac spiffy now
how do you get to that bootloader though
if you're in the Apple OS or you know
you want to switch between yeah oh well
when you want to switch you have to
press the center button and the menu
button at the same time that allows you
your iPod to reboot and it will go into
the bootloader program can you walk us
through the steps of getting Linux
actually on your iPod all right first
thing they do is you have to put your
iPod into disk mode and you do that
through the iTunes it's in the
Preferences under the iPod tab after
that you download
the Installer you unpack it and start
running it it will find your iPod and it
will give you a list of all the modules
and programs you can install on so it's
kind of like got its own built-in
package management system yes it's very
Linux like ok so is there any big
difference between installing it on
Windows iPod and a Mac iPod yes because
Windows has to format it to the fat32
file structure it doesn't really see the
linux partition too well so it's kind of
quirky but on the Mac it's a lot easier
because it's used to seeing the
different things like the hfs+ okay so
on the windows side it actually puts a
linux partition on there
yeah and windows obviously can't see
that just if you were to dual boot like
Gen 2 and windows you would be able to
see your gen to file system unless you
had some additional software as there
any recommendations you have when we
were researching this problem we came
across L tools which was a neat little
application that kind of set it up to
view as in like of the Windows File
Explorer and you can see the whole both
the fat32 file structure and the UNIX
files
Linux file structure sweet so what's the
trick to getting doom on your iPod the
thing is since the iPod isn't capable of
running both the Linux OS and do them at
the same time you have to launch it from
like the BIOS and the way you do that is
you get a launcher we use C launcher it
took a little rewriting some of the C
out of your your are cpsel starts up
Linux you know rather than going right
into your GUI you get the option to go
into different things definitely so that
kind of sounds very similar to back in
the day if you remember trying to play
something like Duke Nukem 3d and you
would just you know get a flaw special
floppy that would your boot off that and
get you know optimal system performance
because when load and all that other fun
stuff or kind of AK into may be exiting
Windows 3.1 or going to five dots and
playing them and quake 2 there yeah dude
that's awesome now would you say it's
actually playable though oh yeah you
have lots of fun just one round blowing
a little bad guys away and opening up
all the little secret doors we're good
controls like the controls a little
quirky you don't get the stray if you
don't get to walk backwards but
everything else is there you can't and
you can't change your gun unless you
want to have ammo that can be kind of a
pain but we've successfully beaten it on
the iPod the fifth gen and I gotta say
man this this is awesome now if anybody
is interested in trying this out where
would you say that they had you the best
resources resource is iPod Linux wiki
everything's there all the things need
to download even the iPod firmware
updater is there you go there and it'll
explain it it's a little daunting at
first but once you get you see idea of
way it works on the iPod you can also
figure out how it works on the wiki
suite well thanks for like I'm not
showing us the Linux way for our iPods
now we're gonna head over to Ali and see
what's coming on next in the show
