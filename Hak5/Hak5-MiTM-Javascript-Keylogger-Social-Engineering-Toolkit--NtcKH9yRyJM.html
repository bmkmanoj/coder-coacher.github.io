muak Slayer doing a little bit of
man-in-the-middle attacks with Midler
social engineering toolkits Spotify in
the United States MAC address spoofing
and a whole lot of fail
my name is Darrin kitchen you're
watching hack 5
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by Gamefly go to assist Express and
domain.com got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain hello
welcome to hack 5 my name is Darren
kitchen and I'm Rob fuller and you are
watching the show that is all about
Technol us and void warranties breaking
in stuff you know scaring yourself way
too many films in the beginning it well
you can have rap to me it's the internet
they're all good with that I feel very
I feel very diggnation right now
hack 5 is on the road what we were in
Toronto it will see Hospital Toronto now
we're in Casa de Moo bik's nice place
guy here thank you diggin the studio
lights that you just got set up for this
or something well the contractor set
them all up on the same light switch so
I can't really do anything about them
look good to me yeah and yeah and then I
think right after this we're in Vegas
for CES so one of these days we're gonna
have an episode back at the studio but
until then let's get our technolon
alright yeah so what's up well we have a
couple of feedbacks and other fun stuff
to get into in a block I'm talking about
this is not a twist-off no it's not
that's why I said well okay well um
let's see I'm going to be playing with
some man-in-the-middle stuff you guys
remember last week I was talking about
some thank you some and tools bad idea
oh yeah yeah because you know especially
some of these open source ones that
aren't completely fleshed out so I've
been playing with the midler and you
guys remember it digs all right no no J
builds really cool and if you if you
haven't seen it already go back to the
shmoocon 2009 episode and check it out
because we did an interview with JBL
about mendler and it's a very cool tool
so and finally like playing with it here
because it had a lot of development
since then it's got a 1.0 we released
candidate that's out and so will gonna
be playing with a little bit of that
later on I know that we've got some
Spotify some ether pads some encryptions
and some virtual machines and all sorts
of good stuff we do yeah okay yeah sure
oh you mean I don't know okay
whatever I refer to well let's go man
all right cool well
one of her first questions comes in from
Mohammed as well as many other viewers
that wrote in to ask about the previous
segment where we talked about Crip setup
for Ubuntu how you can go ahead and
easily encrypt your USB drives on just
about any Linux that's using the two
point six point four kernel or later and
look where did I get it backwards two
point four is when I said no two point
six before and yeah it's good stuff but
no it's not cross-platform you plug it
into a Windows machine it's not going to
know what the hell to do with it which
could be good or bad depending on your
situation but yeah if you're looking for
encryption cross-platform we can't speak
highly enough about TrueCrypt are you
still in on Trouper I mean is that still
your ban but what do you need
cross-platform hard full disk encryption
for well it's it's um you know just for
your thumb drives and not like your hard
drive ah yeah but you know it's nice
when you're you know going from machine
- I mean how many machines you use in an
average day a lot yeah Ali are you at
the physical keyboard of though a lot
okay and mixed operating systems I'm
sure true everything but BSD pretty much
yeah we got a hit on something no I'm
trying out BSD yeah all right cool yes
axon from the hir report yeah good guy
he really had a awesome post on make the
holy war and what BSD what different
well FreeBSD and open BSD and so I don't
start going all crazy on just pick two
operating systems to say holy war and
yes it exists okay but anyways I started
playing with some FreeBSD and it's okay
it's it's secure I was using it on the
shelf for the longest time but then I
don't have right Yellin it's a good for
show yeah but yeah I mean unless you're
only doing shell stuff mm-hmm
I don't I'm surprised you're using it
I'm surprised you're in Windows here I
mean you're in Windows and in backtrack
so you know saving grace there and then
noticed you had about a bazillion
virtual machines and uh your VirtualBox
guy too right well uh so I'm a virtual
box guy except for on this laptop which
I'm hating it really a lot right now
because
when I do the pipe and I use pipe a lot
yeah you can't help it it does a greater
than sign so I can't figure out we many
things you need to be doing yeah well I
switch to the UK and it works but all
the other keys don't work yeah this this
show isn't brought to you by Asus or
anything but yeah we are reeking of the
UK oh yeah okay so you want to get into
that now
sure okay well this is this was brought
up when we were talking about shells and
last week we were talking about that
music service Spotify and we went ahead
and and did a little bit of testing to
see you know what the deal is if because
as you guys know Spotify also new web to
Oh music service basically download this
play any music you can ever think of
make playlists and you don't have to be
like Pandora Penn doors awesome
I'll open a door and Pandora's jar the
one that rips the music to the hack
platforms and so no comment
I Love You Pandora but Spotify you can
pick the songs and put them in the
playlist just as if you had them it's
just like iTunes and and it's all stream
well it's mostly streaming except you
pay something I there is a ten euro a
month a premium service and I haven't
looked into it too much but only if you
want to download for offline mode right
it's either that or if that's for the
the streaming to your mobile handset I
know that they have it for the Nokia
stuff and as well as the iPhone and
Android platform I would I would
consider I mean ten bucks a month you
know or ten euros what is that like
fifty bucks a month us and um it's like
18 bucks ok or 15 or something like that
but I mean to have your music in the
cloud I don't know I so but the service
isn't available in the United States and
I don't know what that is about the IFPI
the RIAA and a couple more letters with
you know music royalties but we're
hackers we really don't care about music
royalties we just want to you know get
what we want have it for free or cheap
so we went ahead and and thought about
how we're going to use one of your
shells in the UK right to go ahead and
tunnel through and create this but then
somebody mentioned in fact yon mark
they remember him as the guy that
brought us some of those awesome PHP and
Python SSH scripts from a couple weeks
back said hey you know from what I
understand you only have to have a geoip
in one of those countries the society
dumpster yeah it sign up for your
account so I said really
so anyway I need to profusely thanked
and I'm gonna butcher his name for music
because he's from the Netherlands so
send me a WAV file or something but
Yanni and I'm not going to say your last
name in case you're afraid oh yeah the
Finns coming and busting you but but
went ahead and on my behalf
and thank you for people that sent me in
invite codes I now have a couple extra
one so ah don't ask me for him just
gonna tweet him out there but yeah I'm
I'm then I'm from Finland now you're a
Finn did you know this yeah you're an
awesome Finn I am from zip code two zero
eight one zero that's nice yeah so but
you have to provide more you can't just
like go ahead and give them a fake zip
code and Finland view it you do have to
have an IP there so as we were saying
before just own up some windows 98 me I
mean get yourself a shell right and and
they're so mad cheap its neighbor or a
friend on IRC or just go to Lynn node
which has UK shells
oh is it yeah all right cool well let's
check this out because I just gotta go
in here in in karmak which I may or may
not keep for mint but we'll see and yeah
I got it I've gone ahead and installed
it with wine doesn't me pull this up
here nice sweet okay so here we go
I've already looked up nine inch nails
and double click on closer so it has ad
in the right-hand side
I mean it's about it oh yeah I guess
that is an advertisement but it made
named a band or something do you feel
clones little columns in the air tonight
uh see Phil Collins in the air tonight
and instantly starts way hopefully and
it would if the internet had not gone
out now now I'm still online
oh I don't know I'm gonna chalk that up
to wine it's working now it is it we're
so playing with it yeah I mean it's just
plain 90 snails
maybe this is Michael Collins maybe
that's it true it does die every time
we've gotten to fill call yeah awesome
but so there's the trick there and I
don't know let us know like what what
your experiences with it I am going to
be trying to get it on my android phone
next and if I have to pay a subscription
service for it I don't know maybe I can
find some easy way to transfer some
euros around make happen yeah you might
run into some issues where it goes
Oh Master Card o master cards everywhere
you want to be or visa right I don't
know I'm gonna have to talk to Shannon
about that she works in a merchant
services doing a bunch of fun stuff with
credit cards and I think you could maybe
tell me if there's something coding that
let you know where the countries from
probably it's like kind of like how all
these are started with 4/4 and stuff
like that
I wonder if a pal so you can do pretty
much resume that may be good well anyway
we'll find out but yeah hit us up your
feedback on the forms and tweets and all
that fun stuff about that so one other
thing before we move on out of this
block you showed me an awesome site a
couple weeks ago and it's perfect that
you're here to talk about it because I
know that you're a VirtualBox kind of
guy what is this
VirtualBox image is all about so if
you've ever used a VMware appliance
appliances are basically gift-wrapped
vm's
a nice term gift wrapped yeah now we did
a segment on virtual appliances a little
while ago and I guess you think I
butchered the explanation but I like
that gift wrap appliances gift wrap you
and VMs yeah so you just drop them into
your VMware Workstation and they start
running and you have a username password
whatever it takes to get it going well
you can do that in VirtualBox it
actually has the ability to take in a
VMware virtual appliance and run it
however it doesn't come with the VMware
tools I mean it comes with VMware tools
installed instead of VirtualBox tools
whatever VirtualBox
images mm-hmm comm I believe yeah that's
where it's a virtual box image comment
has all kinds of differ
appliances and sometimes and that I
found this site better in a sense that
it's more user friendly like you go to
exactly what you want and download
exactly what you want and the VMware one
is kind of like addy not really doesn't
have ads but it's like it seems more
corporate it was designed by some
marketing guy yeah I mean a lot of those
though are commercial services that have
open-source distributions I mean same
thing like we did an example of AB
dimdim which you can run your own dimdim
local instance with their open source
edition and it has a commercial side to
it with their subscriptions and stuff
like that but well yeah you're right
this does seem a lot more community
focused in fact looking at the featured
side here I like this idea
Ubuntu 9.10 went to 9.10 server you're
going - I'm getting hell for it so it's
boom - it turns out and just be already
tomcat and lamp I mean a ton cat lamp
it's pretty easy to deal with 9.10 but
also we've got backtrack for pre-final
we've got you know sue so we've got Jos
you're just there I mean it's just one
or two clicks and you're got it and the
virtual appliances won't be painless
yeah anything that makes open-source
easier yes yeah so the cool thing is
that you can pretty much set up a
virtual Empire or virtual Empire a
virtual statement Empire fully
operational battle station sorry wow you
want that you can take that if you want
no no no no you don't want to start at
let's start track I just did Star Wars
ok yeah whatever the kid in the back of
class but like in a couple of those you
can download and get going like you know
like a virtual enterprise and have and
there's another reference their progress
and get going for your like exploitation
stuff like man milling or port
forwarding or pivoting or whatever
that's what I do do it in fact later on
in this segment I'm using virtual
machines I mean I love this little 1.3
gig her goal core because it can edit
that's a nice little tie yeah just 17
inches little heads 13 is the perfect
size but the power brick says it all see
you tube for that but the UM you are
enclosed - what yeah
what you wet you left you went upstairs
to get some beers so I did a little bit
of you tubing I hope you don't mind I
didn't show off your desk or anything
but anyway um yeah I don't run my DMS
local right now let's go for a pot
putting a podcaster up in your house
thank you
lend me your couches we'll put together
a Google map and start a hack across
America tour and I'll put everything on
the cloud of all your personal stuff
well no we're not going to do that but
no I'm putting my virtual images and
stuff are in the cloud if you will
they're back at my quad core at home
because I can't do these demos quite as
well as I would like to on the local
machine just doesn't have a power just
funny dude I swear I am about to move
all of my research and development
virtual machines into the cloud I just
made a dedicated server and then there's
this VirtualBox front-end web interface
I'm going to show it off on the show
here real soon if it's really slick and
then since you've got RDP Remote Desktop
to all of these different VMs I can do
all my segments here and that like just
using the cloud and have like a network
out there that I can because the
beautiful thing is you know I fire up a
we use in samurai WTF operating system
I'm going to be used in a backtrack for
I'm going to need a couple of XP bitches
to puck with and bam there you go you've
got you know like God do you remember
when we used to actually build machines
like physical mute and then we put them
on a network and it would take like a
day just to you know take a couple of
old P twos so we could try out some
exploits my god yeah this thing can run
all those all at one time that makes me
sick he's got like a dozen VM sitting
there
Oh anyway so long in a block of course
but that's just the way we do it but
let's go ahead and move on and just a
bit we're gonna be doing these midler
stuff and find out about the LAN party
but first I do want to thank our
excellent sponsors for making this show
happen tonight
and that is domain.com ah domain.com how
I love thee let me count the ways
I mean aside from the obvious stuff like
calm names for less than nine bucks a
year or awesome web hosting for less
than six bucks a month private
registration and all the fixings without
the crazy upsells that you you know
might find somewhere else and let me
tell you I absolutely love how quick and
easy it was for me just recently using
domain comm to set up a site for a
client that needed a little prototype
action got an awesome VPS from
domain.com and it's like boom got a
domain name and like within minutes I
mean I don't know like how long it was
ago that it took forever to get a new
domain name but now it's just like BAM
here's the name server and whoo look at
that like minutes later and I can like
show the client and it was so great it
made it so easy in this VPS the cPanel
you get them with Plesk you can get them
with Windows whatever you want to makes
things so easy it's also great when you
come down to the movie Slayer and you
don't want to be using anything on this
network so you want to SSH tunnel
everything because you know your packets
they're safe with domain comm so if
you're interested in their services go
check them out they're super cool and we
love them for supporting hack 5 you can
even tweet them at domain.com if you
want to show your support there and get
15% off all your orders over at
domain.com
when you use the coupon code hak5 you've
got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain at domain.com so check it
out counter-strike 1.6 - you remember
that game is the very first land party
of 2010 for hack 5 you'll find it at
game dot hack 5 dot org January 30th and
31st but stay tuned we have an actual
special announcement for the land
parties so see you there
recently on the show I talked about a
beautiful little man in the middle tool
that among other things lets you do
something really cool with injecting
JavaScript and specifically a key logger
so it turns out the tool is Midler and
thank you to like the billions of people
that emailed me and yes it had just
slipped my mind in fact go back to I
forget the episode number but it's the
shmoocon 2009 episode we're actually
talked to the author or you know a
project lead JBO from-from in guardians
about the tool and it just was off my
radar for a bit but let's go ahead and
dive in because this is such a cool tool
for doing man-in-the-middle type of
stuff hence the name Midler so I figured
I'd show you guys a little demo here of
it now the JavaScript part of this that
this plugin in particular and let me
just go ahead and show you here so I
have this up booted in samurai WTF if
you're not familiar with samurai WTF it
is a web penetration framework it's it's
an operating system it's kind of like
backtrack but basically geared towards
web penetration testing and it makes it
easy to get set up with Middler you
could do the same thing ubuntu or
backtrack if you really wanted but I'm
here logged in in samurai and let me
just pull that terminal back up to get
set up simply go ahead and check out the
latest version from subversion and let's
go ahead and take a look at the Midler
tool so will notice in Lib Midler we
actually have our proxies our plugins
and all the fun stuff relays happening
in plugins so check that out
now currently there are plugins for HTTP
as well as sip right now I'm just
focused on HTTP but if you're you know
into the whole like sip VoIP hacking and
stuff like that might be something to
check out so in HTTP you'll notice that
we have a couple of plugins here now
this is all Python so we've got a iframe
injection we've got a 301 302 redirect
going on and we've got an iframe
injection that will actually tie in with
Metasploit if you're so keen I actually
have copied in here the plug-in
underscore key logger and I'll go ahead
and
more that and you'll notice here it's
it's it's set up pretty simply in fact
the readme is make it pretty easy to
understand how to set up if you're
familiar with Python a plugin for this
and you'll notice that we just have them
what kind of content we're trying to
match here you can see we're matching
HTML and we're looking for a specific
destination to send the keys through
expect to and you'll actually see here
our is the JavaScript that will be
injected into every page that falls
within that category and I've gone ahead
and actually done this not even with
Middler but just with this JavaScript
and I did just a simple little double
you get to go ahead and download
facebook.com locally and pop this
JavaScript right there in the head and
basically what this wants to do is
whenever you type a key it sends a get
over to your web server of choice of
course I was just setting up a netcat to
listen to port 80 on one of the you know
IPs and I think a backtrack for machine
here you could probably do net grep or
many other different ways to capture
those packets coming back to you but the
point being if you're doing a
man-in-the-middle attack with Middler
and you get this plug-in working the key
then essentially whatever key presses
are on the keyboard specifically in a
password field mind you they are in real
time sent to your now your blackhat
webserver whatever it may be and this is
beautiful because think about it how
many times have you gone to a website
and you've typed multiple passwords like
oh which one is it and and this is great
because it would even get like the
backspace and you know typing in another
password so I love the concept here
however somewhere in the long enough
ways there's a few borked bits and i'll
explain that when i first started
playing with this tool I was using the
1.0 release adding the latest version
from SVN as you should but it seems that
since 0.95 released something or
whatever the JavaScript plug-in was
removed as well as another plug-in or
two and
and it's no longer in there and it's
kind of disappointing and I'm not sure
why that is but then again this is open
source it's a work in progress but I
have not been able to reproduce this so
that is my sadness for the moment but
Ghana had done all this research I've
got it going so why don't we just go
ahead and take a look at what does come
with 1.0 release and I'm sure if you're
savvy enough and have more time than I
have and in research you'll you might be
able to get it so let's go ahead and
quit out of this and I'm going to go
ahead and begin a little ARB caching of
one of the clients here one of my
virtual machines you see I've got like
little windows XP bitch box hanging out
here on the network and let's just
pretend we've already scanned it but we
know that its IP is 1010 Oh 188 and the
nice thing about Middler is that it has
functions to go ahead and use D sniff or
ARP spoof if you will to go ahead and do
the ARP spoofing for you or Scapa which
is another another way to do it as well
that's a Python module so getting it set
up supposedly Middler does all of that
for you actually look at the latest
version of the code however all of that
seems to be commented out like I said
work in progress still a cool piece of
code but we will go ahead and begin our
man-in-the-middle attack ourselves now
you know me technically I like to use a
font outer a phone plus router and
whatever configuration yoga interceptor
but it's also fun to go ahead and do it
the old-fashioned way so let's go ahead
and get our target spoofed so first
thing we need to do is make sure that
our machine that we're doing the attack
from is set up in IP forward mode so
let's take a look Wilke at this file
here and that is in /proc sis net ipv4
and it's IP underscore forward and you
can see here it's actually set to zero
and I just need to go ahead and set that
to a 1 to enable IP forwarding so we'll
just echo 1 to that right there
oops I forgot a Wacka and I don't know
why I call it a walkabout I do
and if we cut that file again we can see
now it is in fact a 1 so we've gone
ahead and done that let's go ahead and
tweak our IP tables so that 80 is going
to come back at ourselves and then you
know midlet can have all its fun
so IP tables and tack T we're going to
use NAT tack a for pre routing and tack
P for our protocol we're gonna use TCP
destination port is 80 we're going to
redirect it to port
80 locally and I should probably also
make sure that Apache is down because
it's probably listening on 80s so
alright and now we are ready to go ahead
and start spoofing our victim here so
we're going to tell it that we are the
router we're going to tell the router
that we are it and essentially we are
going to position ourselves right in
between to have a lot of fun take
advantage of those TCP packets let's go
ahead and ARP spoof our interfaces f20
and our target is 10 1001 88 and 10 1001
for the router there are two O's an ARP
spoof and there we go so now let's come
back over to our new terminal just being
a little funky but that's probably
because I am remote desktop tin to a VM
that is not a very happy VM at the
moment so we'll open up a new terminal
here now it's simply a matter of running
sudo python and Midler py now there are
a couple of command-line arguments if we
do want to tell it not to ARP spoof it
will need a specific interface but
actually you really don't need to
specify anything because by default out
of the box it just uses all of your
interfaces and if the code wasn't
commented out for the ARP spoof it would
go ahead and do everybody on the network
supposedly I like having the control
just by doing it yourself but as you can
see here it is running and it's
redirecting you know UDP TCP it's
looking for port 80 and it's going to do
all the fun stuff that we have in our
plugins directory all those plugins that
were in that slash plug-in are just
going to go ahead and execute and one in
particular is looking for any traffic to
one of my favorite websites slash dot
org these two have quite the addiction
then I got the slash dot patch now I'm
all good so we're over back to the XP VM
and let's just make sure we can go to
example comm
and there we go so we are online
everything is going good so let's grab
you and browse over to slashdot org and
you notice something a little strange
about this yes there we go we actually
have the Midler logo at the top of the
screen in an iframe and that's the
beauty of this right so it is just
taking advantage of the HTML that we
asked for it said oh hey you want our
web page cool let me give you the web
page a little bit extra right so this
iframe sure it's the Midler logo at the
top of the page maybe it could be the
goatse image at the top of the page
maybe it could actually be something
malicious there's actually a payload in
here that will basically I forget the
name of its beef no not not beef I'm
sorry it's the the Metasploit iframe
which mu books probably talked about a
lot more in-depth than I could but
suffice it to say once you're taking
advantage of the page that's displaying
on their system you've got local
JavaScript and a bunch of other fun
things that you could do to you know
social engineer your way and or whatever
to take advantage of this machine I mean
if you really just want to put kittens
on the screen you could do that too but
anyway that is the Middler I'm looking
forward to your feedback I'm going to
keep playing with this because I really
want to get that JavaScript working so
I'll go ahead and post what I've found
on the forums hopefully we can
collaborate together and get this
working all snappy and stuff so anyway

restrictions apply suicide for details
continuing on the theme of this episode
the awesome tool is if only they were
well documented
what is this framework we're looking at
the social engineering toolkit actually
it's done by David Kennedy also goes by
a relic from the offense of security
guys yeah and so he created this toolkit
I don't know if you had helped or not
again documentation lacking um but what
is this what is the framework this he
mentioned social engineering I
understand that is the like you know
hacking the human OS if you will righty
I'm going to convince you I am Who I am
because I happen to be wearing a you
know a Comcast polo shirt and I have a
lineman's handset so there's a bunch of
things that this thing can do
mostly it's three male it can clone
websites to fake like a JavaScript
attack and that's what we're going to be
showing there's there's there's a bunch
of other stuff in there that I can't
exactly remember right now but that's
okay because we're going to show the one
I do remember excellent well let's do a
demo awesome so you're saying duplicated
website what do you really mean by that
it takes it basically takes the just the
front page of it okay and W gets it our
sense and I don't know if that's how
it's Python so it doesn't you shared
area but but it shows that main the page
that you want and then it will initiate
a Java payload against you
using Metasploit so you'll have Java a
little pop-up saying would you like to
run this and you're like sure it says
Microsoft on me okay alright so we're
gonna we're going to show you and all
right so let's walk through so I'll go
ahead clone some web sites and then do a
little bit of fishing and fun stuff like
that so there is there is a legitimate
purpose for this right no oh okay well
oh no yeah infront testing when you when
you actually have the go-ahead of the
green light for social engineering via
email this is one of the definite ways
you want to go because Java is so easy
and you it's a full payload so you get
the meterpreter shell back nice instead
of any like browser hits where you
have to get the browser exploit that is
required and I mean that this stuff is
really difficult and really really
technical and sexy but but this is the
human aspect human aspect I like that
you need heat interaction but the
important part of what you just said
there was this is for the you know when
you get the green light on the
penetration test from the company that
has hired you to this isn't forgetting
your ex-boyfriends myspace password just
throwing that out there
my boyfriend is okay your boyfriend
outline no really not today alright so
first you want to edit the config oh
sorry config inside you got second fig
I'm a nano guy all right down and I've
already ended it in web attack
underscore email he just turned on sir
we're gonna do a web attack via email
whoo
it's real simple set all right next up
website Java applet attack cool and
we're going to send it to a single email
I'm going to hack you who do we want to
send to Darin at hack five org and we're
going to use my gmail account how do you
want to do Facebook yeah Facebook there
you go go ahead and just own up my
Facebook so you can all right check
subject of this is check out this new
Facebook yeah I just click ignore in the
top right on all of those but cheer
let's let's go for it because thanks
because I'm sure there's someone in the
organization the link crazy about
farmville or something here's the link
below you're actually typing into the
body right now so it's asks you that the
subject and the gmail account your email
you can actually use your own server for
relaying it or any open relay if you
want to so you don't have to use Gmail
but it's nice to have Gmail built into
the tool yeah
so you actually have to put a link in
the email like I didn't do it right
because you're not
this isn't going to be facebook.com/
obviously so you know it's just poor
Davey yeah all right so this is where
the Middler would come into play if we
were you know our spoofing the victim
and we use like a 301 redirect so that
as soon as they went over to
facebook.com it would actually Ford them
over to like the IP address of your evil
server that is waiting right with help
me with that and baby mask the URL
somehow okay so so I put in anyways I
put it in the link and put it in like
here's the link below control seeded and
the email so it's actually going to send
you an email but I think this is a
little reversed in this sense because it
sends you the email before it sets up
services oh great so I get the email and
then I start checking in if you check it
right now all right it's not gonna have
any why would you just be quick and I
will slowly check my gmail as soon as it
I can't be quick until it sends email
okay so of course as soon as we wrap the
segment we get it working right that's
just on how it is so what was the trick
well first of all it didn't like Windows
7 or bun - like we said and nothing
likes windows 7 sometimes
so we got an XP VM going didn't have
Java had to install Java all right and
reboot all kind of but it's vanilla XP
with Java I mean plenty of those clients
out sleep at all except for like one
patch I think I don't have window nor I
II ate on it great let's give a shot all
right news all right Facebook oh there
we go and then we have Microsoft Update
Microsoft Corporation yay finally
actually working exactly and what do we
tell our users use Windows updates so go
ahead and run it run okay they don't see
anything they can actually even close
this and it's not gonna do any and
really like that okay cool so so we've
already done what we needed to yeah
we're going to return for show that's it
and now we can pull up a shell on them
get into this session I am hahaha
beautiful absolutely beautiful so once
again Windows 7 what for the win we get
to give mad props to it yeah it was nice
windows 7 the Ultimate Edition and the
enterprise whatever it is has a XP
compatibility mode it does to get
exploited easily oh right II more nearly
easy well you have to get user
interaction first - well I guess what's
where the social engineering comes in
true but nonetheless nifty and I'm glad
that we could get that quicksave in
there real quick I did guy I want to
mention to you guys something about the
Spotify that we were talking about
earlier in the show we did a little bit
of research between now and then and it
turns out that if you use the service in
the free default mode or whatever and
you'd like you have your friend in
Finland set you up with an account well
every 14 days you need to re log in to
that account from that IP and Finland
otherwise your account will get disabled
sad but if you pay the 10 euros a month
or whatever it is you get a premium
account so that you can use the iPhone
app the Android app the Nokia app and
then they really don't care if you're
aware of because you're a world traveler
nice and they're taking paypal and I
love business models based on well
everybody knows what's going on yes
you're saying that there's another way
to do it on the iPhone as well oh yeah
I'm sorry the iPhone app actually has a
app called spot which is the Spotify it
uses the open source library file for it
and you can actually tunnel that through
an SSH zone so you can be home all the
time just use yeah nice anyway thought
we would run that by you guys let's go I
think one of y'all some people that keep
hack flap on the air so you've heard me
talk to you guys about go to assist
Express before and you know that I
absolutely love it when it comes to
supporting my workforce because it's
just so simple to send them a link in an
email award just go to a website and
type in a like 9 digit code and then
boom I'm on their desktop helping them
with whatever they broke and trust me
they find a way
to break it but there's another feature
of goat wishes Express that just like
saved my day just a little while ago
when I was in Toronto seems that I went
out to a hack 5 meetup and had a blast
and I don't know how but I ended up a
pro no bozos house instead of back at my
other friend's house where I was
encoding the episode and I really needed
to upload it to revision 3 so that you
guys could see it in morning and I was
not at my PC to get that going but I was
smart and I set up go to assist Express
on my laptop with the unattended support
so BAM right from his desktop I
downloaded go to assist and boom back on
my laptop
you know gzipping hack 5 to 20 mega bit
chunky and using that beautiful Rogers
internet in Canada to upload a grueling
1.5 gigabytes San Francisco point being
go to assist Express is that awesome it
helps you reduce your travel time my
case it was travel time across from
Toronto to Etobicoke that saved my butt
when I was in any state to be moving
anywhere and it will totally do the same
thing for you I know that you guys are
gonna love it it it saves the day at so
many times it's so much cheaper than
doing all that stuff in person and it's
totally secure 128-bit end to end so go
ahead and get yourself a 30-day free
trial you're gonna love it just go over
to go to assist com /h aka the number 5
and that's how you get that awesome
offer help support us and you know just
give it a shot you're gonna like it
all right this one's contest the best
2010 wallpaper we've just rolled in a
new decade and I really want to see your
images for that hack $5 org slash forms
to submit it as community images the
biggest consumer electronics show in the
world is happening this week in Las
Vegas
it's CES and revision3 is out in force
with HD nation tekzilla and it will be
there reviewing products checking out
all the booths so be sure to tune in at
revision3.com slash CES to stay up to
the minute on all the goodies starting
January 6 tune in
but just about wraps up this episode of
hack 5 but of course you guys know
before we get going we got a couple of
your questions to answer and a whole
bunch of fun stuff like that so let's
just go ahead and kick it off we got one
in from Blum and Chuck what was that I
don't know I think that's his handle is
he's like and this came in from Twitter
he's wondering hey when are we get to
see some MAC address spoofing because we
were talking about we were talking about
on last week's episode IP spoofing
because you you know the misconception
about IP spoofing
well like yeah so so what's what's the
purpose of MAC address changing first um
okay here's and and this is just based
on my paranoid this is the only thing I
can think of is if I'm on an open Wi-Fi
and I'm having a little bit too much fun
or maybe you know taking my pineapple
vodka as a conference exactly yeah I
want to change my MAC addresses just so
that you know when the NSA does do that
you know search and seizure the MAC
address that they have at the coffee
shop with the exploit isn't going to
match up to mine or if you do something
like man and middle and then they start
lurking at their logs and start seeing
oh there's this mega douche let's find
it on the network right now I've heard
that there's like maca just be authentic
I mean you know that when Wi-Fi there's
MAC address based authentication right
but max really does does anybody use
that really in your experience have you
ever really seen it yeah Cisco what is
it called port security port security
does it outside of Wi-Fi have you ever
seen mac dress as authentication mm-hmm
no just I recall yeah it just seems like
really cuz it's not a fun occasion it's
not you know something true yeah I mean
it's one more layer I mean okay fine
throw in some more layers but yes you
can go ahead and smooth your Mac it's
actually pretty easy in Linux there are
a million ways to do it it seems in fact
let me just go ahead and pull this up
like I think we showed this off with the
with the zip it's but basically yeah
right here I am the wig and then yeah we
just say hardware ether and then you
just give it whatever you want and and
boom there you go
I mean bring down your interface change
and bring it back up yeah but one one
one is
show up okay fanned out so you'll come
up with something a little bit more rich
so let's try mac changer well with mac
changer the gnu version you have three
options that i like tech are is
randomized so it's just completely
random tech uppercase a lowercase a do
it by vendor like a random vendor so it
would come up cisco or it'll come up as
whatever index assistance whatever
there'll be a pseudo random so if you
get on a network where it's a whole
bunch of intel next and you just kind of
want to blend in mm-hmm
you can actually do it by name i believe
so you can actually go I want this
vendor okay I like that
so that's Mac changer I think of Asians
once before yeah that is Linux um there
are ways to do this in Windows there's
actually yeah yeah there's um well our
boy Adrian I am geek ranking the magic
has a way to do he's basically put
together it's called Mad Max and uh and
it's basically based on an auto IT
script it's all compiled and easy to use
and if you head over to iron geek comm
we'll have links in the show notes or
just google mad ma CS you'll plug it
some Mac fanboy stuff but you'll also
get iron mix app that makes it easier to
change your MAC address in Windows as
you can do the long and hard way through
the registry where you can just go ahead
and get this tool yeah he's got a lot of
good tools over there so they should
check out the rest of it stuff yeah it's
great site in fact he even links to at
the end of his article a tool called Mac
randomizer even on the hack 5 wiki
awesome place to go it's a shell script
that just makes you easy to go ahead and
do the same thing in Linux again so
there you go there's a couple of options
for you awesome yeah we also had a
question I think that came in from stone
33 was asking about online collaboration
he wondered what we thought about Google
Wave and was looking for something easy
easy to do collaboration now you know
that the scripts we do and when I say
script I mean it's a loose term just
saying what we're supposed to talk about
what block but but that's all done in a
Google Doc that's just the way it's
always been done on act 5 and makes it
easy
it's
not really real-time in Google Docs is
somewhat real-time but not really I mean
you have to wait till you someone edits
and then saves and then yeah engine save
it's nice in Excel or the exam whatever
changes Reggie you can see like the
people move and ran we're gonna have
little fights with them what's this one
that you're all crazy about right now
ether pad and we've actually been using
an unsecured bit for a while and they
showed it to me so that it's not
definitely not my your pan all right
hello this is Rob and it comes up pretty
fast
that's excellent I mean that really
reminds me of rumor like tty on unix
back in the day so we'll do that with
screen yeah yeah this is great yeah I
could not remain billion kind of showing
you sure I don't need to be shown screen
again that's where everybody shows the
screen I'm like alright this nice anyway
I know still don't use it well as soon
as i grok it better i I'm sure I would
if I used it but I just opened a new tab
you know whatever controls you demonize
any chigan yeah anything you demonize
anything just the thing that when a
demon eyes have like a tack B background
option or I'll just you know oral
control Z it and then it BG alright so
what the best thing that what I'm it
that that's the same I say you partying
or you ss-18 something right huh
you run something yeah and you you don't
know if your connections gonna get or
say you're in a Wi-Fi spot and you run
something or you want something to
complete but your flight starts going
right or your flight starts boarding
yeah so then you want it to keep running
but how are you going to get keep it
running as soon as you get out of that
console you're done so you in a screen
you just control AG screen goes off into
note la-la-land
keeps running you get on your flight you
get them back down screen back again
right now all the linux guys are going
uh-huh
and and everybody else is gone what but
that's okay no no I read it ok well I'll
figure it out I would I will that's my
homework so yeah I just got homework
that's what happens when you come out in
MOOCs this place so yeah this looks like
ass so this looks like a great
alternative a lightweight alternative to
something like Google
wave which is big and awesome and as
soon as we figure out what do with it
that'll be great as soon as we figure
out what it's for it says it's a great
solution it's like IRC without the mic
though no it's nothing like IRC what is
it focal I don't know okay define it
then it's efficient my name define it's
a solution we just don't have the
problem for it yet our places email yes
speaking of email you guys know you can
always email us feedback at hak5 org is
the way you just round up the troops and
you let everyone know on that one
district or if you want to email us
individually I'm Darrin a hack five dot
org oh yeah I'm movin sacrified all
right it's only kick and uh and just
just guess what everybody else is is
because it's exactly what you think it
is and yeah you can also tweet us you
can find at hack five on Twitter and
that's where you'll find a listing of
everybody else and friend us up on
Facebook there's a I'm I finally figured
out Facebook got like a couple weeks ago
and now I'm just up to YouTube on
everything now I just add one by one it
just clicked one day same thing will
happen screen so my facebook calm slash
has it techno lust yes she has a fan
page yeah so and I couldn't even figure
out how to make a fan page Wow we are
noobs when it comes to social networking
but it asked about Mac spoofing and I
broke my laptop here now I really do
feel like it speaking of which there was
actually a cross-site scripting in the
iPhone app for facebook yeah yeah yeah I
saw that link it looks good so the the
thing is it renders HTML in your notes
so I'm sure that the racers have the
notes portion of the iPhone app okay
rendered HTML yeah beautiful so I mean I
don't know if you can I don't know if
there's any other places where it
renders nice to know like on some fuzzy
is in order
yeah so interesting stuff is going to
happen sweet well anyway with all of
that said we are going to be back next
week coming to you guys mom from CES so
if you have anything that you're
interested in seeing from behind or
shoot
be sure to be sure to keep an eye on AK
5 org for all of that excitement and
tune into the blog's in the Twitter and
all that fun stuff follow it boy doing
out there in Vegas and then hopefully
hopefully hopefully we will be back in
studio with red walls and for unison all
that good stuff here shortly but I want
to thank you guys for tuning in and we
will see you next week
till then reminding you we are reminding
you all that again yeah yeah that again
yeah
Spotify from the United States MAC
address filtering that's wrong it's
spoofing hello and welcome to hack 5 my
name is Darren kitchen
holy we're starting oh yeah that's
how it goes ok sorry about that I'll
give you a little bit worn now oh I
thought we were right oh well you can't
do a full start and then keep going
oh well because now the audience is very
confusing we look very unprofessional
I thought unprofessional was the key to
success well there's there's
unprofessional and then there's
unprepared oh well I'm always yeah yeah
on something let's try that again this
time it did yeah so check it out the
very first land party of hack 5 does
that work the man in the middle attacks
with Midler the social engineering tool
kit using Spotify from the Isetta
I don't even have mouse anymore it's
stuck inside the VM if we were at the
mobic Slayer doing a little bit of
man-in-the-middle attacks with Midler
the social engineering words welcome
through the MU bik's Network sure I have
never had so many network issues in one
night but I think you need a new router
dude and well I don't know what's going
on with it I guess a word tethering now
you're happy this time I had good bet
this week's count is a weaker month I'm
sorry this time on hack five we are at
the MU bik's player or yes that's where
we are somewhere along the way there was
a board fit and you know at this point
four hours later I'm just I'm happy to
say that that you know borked or not the
demo fail yeah okay fine we're gonna get
a little bonus yeah yeah
I'm bad at this point well I don't have
Java installed on that VM yet more fail
awesome
