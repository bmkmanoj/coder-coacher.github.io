by Netflix
all right it's time person feedback
write some Q&amp;amp;A yes so we got tons tons
of feedback emails and of course we
don't have time to go through all of
them we've read them all and we got some
really really good ones so I read every
youtube comment including that one that
said first did you see that I saw that
yep well I read every single say that
anyway okay so the first email comes
from metal x1000 and he said this is
regarding the sshfs in the command line
in in in linux he said okay I love that
you showed how to do it this way but for
anybody in the world who really needs a
GUI you can always just open nautilus
and in the location bar type SFTP colon
slash slash user at server and then make
a shortcut to that in the left sidebar
of not wait a second what is that well
we're with that okay wait a second I
gotta try this so if I go to places I
know that I have connect to server and I
can choose SSH from here so maybe it's
the same way as doing that like if I do
mango dot hack five or gun port 22
folder would be slash home slash
aardwolf username would be aardwolf or
if I can just go ahead and share I'll
add a bookmark now up okay so I do this
and now anything aha there we go cool
how awesome mmm-hmm they sure are thank
you so you don't need one but I like the
type you type II okay and again I wear
boxing gloves when I do my emails
so what else spectra kick kid wrote in
and he said regarding setting up an ssh
server on linux and typing in apt-get
install
SSH he said I thought you needed the
OpenSSH tax server package to set up an
ssh server in debian based systems ssh
is a meta package that simply depends on
OpenSSH server in open ssh client dude
with linux there's like a million ways
to skin a cat so yes you could do like
apt-get install open ssh - server that's
gonna work just as easily but there's
always a million ways yeah I like I mean
is it that you're like I mean literally
like it can be like sudo apt-get install
lamp stack boom table flip you know or
whatever it is yeah I don't know
stack button can we get that make it do
the thing get some of that action going
on thank you I appreciate it Paul yeah
some stacks yeah our next email was from
a wire rat one and he he's regarding the
keeping connections alive um he said the
client alive count max zero does not do
what Darren thinks it does you're right
however so is the manual entries they're
both right and I'll explain that in sec
the man page or the manual entry says
that client alive account max that's the
number of client alive messages which
will be sent to the sshd without
receiving any messages back and
basically what happens is if this
threshold is reached without hearing
anything from the client they're gonna
go ahead and disconnect the session it's
also important to note here that the
client alive max count and the client
alive interval those have to do with
sending a keepalive over the SSH tunnel
unlike TCP keepalive which does it
outside of the tunnel and therefore it
could be spoofed I don't know why
somebody wants to do like a man the
middle attack keeping your session alive
but there's probably reason why somebody
would want to do that so the default
value to keep in mind though is three so
even if you don't set anything to client
alive max account it's going to be three
so we can imagine if this is three and
our client alive interval down here is
set to fifteen what will happen is every
15 seconds it sends a packet that would
be one another 15 seconds to another 15
seconds three forty five seconds go by
and hey person still idle disconnect
them you're supposed to be able to set
this to zero saying just keep sending
keep alive packets every 15 seconds
forever and ever and it doesn't work
that way so this is one of those things
with where practical differs from the
manual and so what I've been doing and
maybe there's a better way is I'm
setting my client alive interval to like
60 for a minute and then I'm setting my
client alive max count to nine nine nine
nine nine nine nine
9ya night too soon yeah fine all right
so the next email was from Steven and
this is regarding Padgett and putty for
the windows side yeah yeah
so anybody you don't need the pageant
program to use the private key select
your profile and hit load so that you
could edit the profile on the right go
to SSH auth and there you will find
private file for authentication you hit
browse select your private key go back
to session and select your profile and
hit safe so all that can be done in
putty so next time you open a connection
putty it'll automatically use the key
although he does note that the key will
not be stored in memory so you'll need
to enter the past four H each time you
connect to the servers absolutely have
to think with the pageant not only does
it store it in memory for the entire
session of your computer so you know
like you need to connect to it a couple
of times before you read Bennett well
the other thing that I noticed was what
was the name of that product you did for
using SSH FS you know and then there was
Andrea yeah expand drive yeah span drive
supports the pageant so if you were then
you'd only be typing it once for both
money and that but that's one yes yeah
if you use expand grant we might need to
do another follow up this isn't in the
list but there was somebody just see
mail bus just like right before the show
about an awesome open-source alternative
to to that product and it's family
yeah it doesn't cost $40 well it's I
think it was good I haven't tested this
yet so it's a good bargain compared to
others well I mean yeah that's the
windows unless you use Linux those
you're not using a Mac because as you
know hak5 hates max we don't hate max we
just don't use them except Paul that's
like I'm on exploit my machine like by
default boots Linux yours by default
Windows is is a Mac so we're like the
whole trifecta here and yet Paul just
likes to stay on that side of the camera
okay looking like Lou I'm poor the
camera guy
