the ben heck show the next one that i
tried was rikomagic Lubuntu and that one
worked pretty good but it still wasn't
my favorite they made a couple of
changes and some upgrades and whatnot
and I was just like I just want you know
normally boon to just like just like
vanilla you don't like different window
managers yeah exactly unity Nick you mix
it up and you like throwing nuts with
the brownie yeah I don't like it you've
been using unity for a while it's going
on you hasn't it yeah I like unity just
tell me that is switch to gnome 3 and
that's just where my heart is free I
mean everybody has their own opinion and
that's okay that's the cool thing about
linux in fact we're in which one are we
in right now yes so this is mini and
ubuntu 12.04 so this is the pretty much
the newest up to date the best one and
it is personally my favorite because
it's just like the ubuntu that i use on
my laptop that I boot into so it's very
very nice and you can do a lot of the
normal commands that you can usually do
for example this one is mini and the
password okay i'm at all your normal
packets so after trying you know puppy
and rikomagic and Lubuntu i also tried
on ubuntu 10.04 and 12 point 0 4 which
is the one that we're using over here
and I did want to mention you know ten
point 0 4 is great if you want to use
that one you can it works fine on this
on this little mini android pc but i
prefer 12 point oh four that's just me
you know you can use either one and also
whenever you purchase one of these micro
SD cards make sure you get one that's
Atlee at least eight gigs guys
preferably even if you want to you could
get like 16 gigs because a lot of the
installs the images are really really
big and I also notice that we did it
both ways we did one where we installed
it on the micro SD card using Linux
using the command prompt for that just
using DDT and then we also did wine in
Windows using a disk imager I believe it
was called and I prefer disk imager just
because it had a taskbar oh yeah see the
person we actually just covered this too
recently there's a you you kill attack
us are 12 the process idea of D because
yeah I don't know why Shan why like w
yeah give you a nice little boo boo Boop
yeah but but you can't get that with DD
so it was weekend but I was sitting
there for like an hour so and I was like
come on how long is this gonna take how
long yes yes slow is your SD card
adapter yeah which is well this is
really cool because I mean it's just
like any other computer sudo apt-get
install whatever you want I got IW on
here and now check it out i can install
the IW I've got one of the tools that I
commonly use in fact so what does iw do
I've never used that one it's just for
doing fun wireless stuff what expanding
in fact I still get the pineapple
running so you see like all of these uh
oh they occupy an apple stuff once
everyone is that pineapple years um
which one another pineapple pineapple
089 a yeah no that'sthat's that one
right there oh yeah uh haha that's
awesome how fun is that that's cool I
just loved the idea that you I mean it's
what's a computer tiny what is it a
puter know what it is under 100 bucks
what's a computer that Paul says I'm a
computer oh but I love that because it's
like it cuz kind of blurs the lines of
life what's an Android was the computer
what yeah it really does like when I was
I was selling these at der beek on there
like 70 bucks in the in the hack shop
and people would come up and they'd be
like white in the world is this thing
and I'd say it's Android in a box yeah
and they'd say like on your cell phone
said yeah basically it's it's the same
thing oh it's recent I got into it cuz
she on your TV cause turned me on to
these and you know the cause of it oh
yeah and stuff with p2p lady because
cable yeah well so with the p2p adb
where i can like plug it into your phone
potentially route you or something he
was saying like hey take like a
pineapple juice and one of these guys
because it already runs android it's
already rooted and it's already ice
cream sandwich so basically just plug in
a micro cable and then tie these guys
together because can be powered off mini
USB so i don't know i just love the idea
of like a little tiny and very cheap and
disposable almost kind of living i like
it hey that's all your what kind of
crazy stuff everybody else is doing with
these hits up feedback at hak5 org let
us know I would
to hear from you guys and of course like
I'm already having a lot of fun playing
with weird stuff like there's no
backtrack on it yet but basically you
can W get air crack crack you can just
double you get aircrack compile that guy
make sure to change the sea flags and
they totally figure out how to do that
yeah all right I like that actually the

you know what I actually really like is
that there's been a whole lot of Awesome
development in linux porting to arm and
all these different chipsets the reason
the mk802 is so popular is because the
all winter chipset has is already built
for at the colonel but the colonel is
already being ported to other of the
cooler to other cool chipsets like the
rock chip and so many others it's really
yeah Wow in fact this is actually
another implementation of that same em
