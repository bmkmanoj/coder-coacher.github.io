us here today on hack point five and
that's Lehman Lee a professional DJ from
ETF em online radio hey Lehman how you
doing buddy how you been good good good
it's a pleasure to have you here
pleasure to come down and so what we're
here to find out from you is how the DJ
spins in a digital age and so I guess
we'd like to have a little background
from you right now as to how did you get
into DJ well what I really start off
with was just a computer and I Donald
soul for a call bro turntable I'm not
sure anybody heard that before but what
it was was to mp3 players and it give us
a little pitch control and that's all I
did oh I didn't have anything idea I
cannot q my thing I can I cannot kill my
vinyl I could like an acute any handle I
just play two records what you do act
like the way one and then play the net
exactly everything is everything is a
train wreck it was horrendous that's
that's bad and sent you have since then
evolved from that particular state
that's correct and so we've got some
equipment in front of us right now and
what do we got well we look at what
you're looking at is two turntables and
a microphone yeah yeah and DJ mixer and
a headphone and yeah okay so so so
what's what's the special sauce I mean
we're talking about a DJ in the digital
age so obviously something's got to be
digital what is it it's this model right
here looking at that's it less
additional part that what you're looking
at it's the time conant digital vinyl
and this side is ten minutes and this
size 15 minutes long okay so you're
telling me that this analog vinyl has
been encoded digitally yes and Ben
timestamp hmm okay so I mean and that's
working in what kind of package like
what is the entire package the package
juice go something like this well the
hope had to contain this scratch have
this software right here and two vinyls
and a CD CD player LCD city the city
right here see you right there hey you
got this ad right here let's take a look
at that and this CD is encoded a digital
time-stamped yep just like the vinyl
yeah mm-hmm okay and what's just called
here this is called a serato scratch
live this made by rain american DJ
company they did a lot of DJ mixers and
that can
late 90s but they the first program
software hardware the day was this and
it works terrific i doesn't work like
how does this all interface together and
let you spin how you want to spend well
like well these time code of vinyl right
here mm-hmm allows you to manipulate
vinyl with your computer and is what
what's going on is that when you play
these finals it's like a dial tone or
something like that and the signal sent
do right here to scratch amp and the
using USB to connect to the software and
everything is real time when anything
you can do with a vinyl maybe you can do
with a binary you can do with this time
cotabato here okay and in system
requirements for that or Oh 512
megabytes of RAM minimal requirements
1.5 ago hurts again promise so the
standard machine better yeah well
obviously the more the better than
anything like this yeah actually when
you're dealing with real-time audio
encoding yeah we're sampling yep may you
know whatever it may be but as far as
today's standards we're talking about
minimum system requirements 512 1.5
gigahertz sets that's not a lot when
we're looking at p force at three gir
yeah I know so so you know it so what
you're saying is it takes the mp3 and
you'd load it in your deck and the
software here and then you have complete
manipulation over it on the vinyl here
on the turntable yep so you can scratch
you can jog kabhi juggle you can't do it
turntable as you can do all kinds of
stuff in that that easy choice yes now
what kind of bitrate are we looking at
here like for your mp3s I'd imagine the
higher the better the higher the better
to hide about 300 to 320 phila 440 4
kilobyte 44 kilohertz for mp3 wise wave
it will play anything argh wave AFF aiff
I think I guess you're like whatever you
can do whatever you do for more i'm at
is it will it will play anything nice
I'm gonna start remix in my podcasts
actually it does it does i think it does
connect with your iTunes library or some
are you kidding me I'm not kidding wow
wow that is a very very powerful piece
of software and a hardware combo now did
you have like as far as like sound
quality digital versus analog what are
we looking at here I mean well let me
give you an honest truth I still think
vinyl like 30
mmm sounds better than digital because
what you get is a lot of a lot of bass a
lot of beats a lot of hyacinth as well
the only problem these are very fragile
we break them that's it it's done it's
done deal we break one of these you can
just go store and buy another one all
your all your mp3s are located as hard
drive you don't have to worry about by
another vinyls like cause like 10 clay
dollars for important maybe a five seven
five to seven dollars for domestic you
don't have to spend all that money
everything that doesn't sound like a lot
right now when you're talking about one
vinyl but when you have to walk around
with three or four milk crates with 30
vinyl apiece you yeah you can definitely
spend a cassette with the final but this
is definitely versatile then versus 30
okay when you get where you get a 30 gig
hard drive that's like 10,000 mp3s
versus you know having to have 30 vinyl
which are only like one or two tracks a
piece a side-by-side yeah so yeah you
definitely have a much better sampling
their know if anybody wants to find any
more information about you or where you
DJ or how you DJ where can they go they
can go to trouble w DJ dash Lenalee
