t-mobile and the Samsung Galaxy s3
so I take it you heard about what
happened with Facebook yes I did
the their email fiasco yeah I'm sure
everybody watching is familiar with the
matter at this point but it's just kind
of wondering you know what's your take
on it um personally yeah I heard about
the news pretty early on so I was just
like oh they changed my email I'll just
change it back and it didn't really
matter because my first one was private
anyway so nobody can email me anyway
via Facebook did you did you have like
other people if it was contact books her
dress books were updated no you got in
your facebook i I've never seemed my
facebook context ever and that's the
reason why is because I didn't want
Facebook updating random crap that I
would be unbeknownst to me so you know
with my iOS contacts I'm organized
enough that I just updated everything
myself when I first got my first iPhone
I just kept it like that you know and if
I feel the same way about like Android
contacts when I installed Facebook I
absolutely did not let it do that but
then you know at the same time what was
it Gmail in fact I believe booths
default behavior when I first started
using Gmail that and you have a
conversation with somebody it would
automatically add them to your dress
book I don't think anything of it until
like five years later I couldn't had a
contact and I'm like why can't I not add
a Content recon tactful yes there's a
limit of 10,000 contacts and I hit it oh
my god we get a lot of emails yeah we do
hey Becky Mills
so I had a problem where like one of my
first Android phones I was like why is
this going so slowly every time I pull
up contacts and I realize I'm like
scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
and it's going
reven I'm like oh my god so it synced
everything and I had spent plague an
afternoon basically going through by
hand removing stuff one by one and it
was kind of a pain yeah so so basically
what I got out of the Facebook email
Fiasco was that Facebook just changed
everything over to at facebook.com/ yeah
nobody really knew because they didn't
put out any kind of information about it
apparently this was known in April well
apparently they mentioned something like
really do you really think people are
going to you know remember that until
June July of this year no of course not
the way that I feel is it's not the onus
on the user to choose whether they
should or should not like sync contacts
I don't you know changing somebody's
email and file and then going and
pushing that to anybody else who has
contact sync I don't know just it's it's
like it seems like a move of desperation
I don't know right well yeah that's like
why else would you do that
I don't see why Facebook needs to do
that I mean they're the largest social
network can they just be like what they
are and not trying to be your email -
yeah I don't like what if I don't want
it to be my chat don't want it to be my
email and just want it to be a wall but
you know what Facebook say they said oh
it was it was if they pulled an apple
yeah
and they were like oh it's because the
users are confused give users a
comparable or not when we're putting the
email that we're taking from them yeah
if this happened on like a Windows box
10 years ago like this one here's the
thing it sounds like if you just change
some of the names it totally sounds like
a like a like a hijacked Outlook virus
from from the late 90s or something you
know basically what they did are they
saying your address book you know like
hey I jacked it
I think pilot Baloo has the best write
up on it on CNN to love to link to that
in the show notes yes
this is bad tempting from that one I'm
like whatever go camping or backpacking
one of these it's not not awkward at all
that's what you need when you go camping
signal
s-see you know this is a much better
situation now Paul Tobias I plugged your
slipper and camera guy and studio
engineer and editor and encoding
specialists and all guy
how bad huh
you
you
all right check it out I've turned on
the interface I've got a alpha aw us
zero three six
Nha connected to back track five Linux
laptop here and I just used iw to scan
and then grep for SS IDs and what's
funny is okay yes I do see my pineapple
as well as the Linksys and some other
stuff that's always fun and if I do IW
config my interface
ESS ID pineapple I'll go ahead and
associate let me run iw config and you
can see I am in fact associated here's
my Mac here's my signal level link
quality and let's go ahead and DHCP get
ourselves an IP address and boom there
we go 172 1642 dot 166 I got an IP
address and from here I should even be
able to you know ping it or actually
what I did is I put together a script
signal that SH which goes through iw
config and then grew up south the signal
and then it does that every second and
you can see I've got a consistent 70 out
of 70 quality negative 30 DBM and if I
actually tilt this antenna so negative
63 and the link quality is greatly so
you can see how very directional this
parabolic antenna is not that for a
first test shot with the parabolic units
I mean pretty easy it's a third of a
mile line-of-sight right - Shannon great
conditions and you know these are really
really simple to aim and they're also
really high gain and so we're probably
used to working with like yagi antennas
when it comes to directional obviously
the you know benefit of these is that
you know you have like a much smaller
form factor and it's not difficult to
haul up a mountain 27 or 20 571 feet but
you know regardless we were able to get
a site-to-site now I was taking a look
at some of the actual
patterns here of these two different
types of antennas and I thought I would
just kind of mention out you know we've
talked briefly about yagi antennas in
the past this particular one has a 50
degree beam width and so that you can
see here this is what a the network
diagram looks like and how what you do
is you take between negative 3 and
negative 10 and you see this width here
of this this shape here and if you just
take this between 300 and 35 degrees and
25 degrees over there that right there
is about 50 degree beam width so I
wouldn't with this antenna have to be
actually all that accurate I could move
it around just a little bit as long as
I'm in the general direction I can cite
it pretty well the parabolic antenna the
it's actually a lot a lot thinner in
fact the the beam width on this
particular unit is more like 10 degrees
so it makes a huge difference when
you're off every little bit and you know
it's really the same concept of what
might be on your roof a satellite dish
pointed at the sky you know a dish
antenna is parabolic antenna they can be
huge in Puerto Rico there's like this
massive one you may have seen at the end
of that double-oh-seven movie goldeneye
and they can also be very precise that
down to like a tenth of a degree so I
don't know I think this was a pretty
good test I've got her I've got great
signal and I can even SCP files over
which is pretty cool otherwise if it was
pretty poor building quality I could
probably even still get a consistent
file transfer if I used our sink to take
care of partials though we hiked a
mountain yeah hey Shannon hey Darren
what's up so turn on your Wi-Fi direct I
want to send you a photo from up here
okay all right cool we're connected so
now I'm just gonna take a photo app all
here oh that's cute
hi Paul I know isn't that so cool all
right we'll be down in a bit
you soon it's a Shannon have you read
the ics-cert that's about how to make
ice cream sandwich certification yes if
the industrial control system cyber
emergency response team control systems
security program it's a department of
homeland security incident response
report that they're doing now and
they've been doing it since 2009 and
this is the latest just in 2011 and you
can totally see Paul check this out
Oh 9 2010 2011 and so these are like
tickets and on-site like incident
reports it looks it looks at first
glance like holy crap
you know the nation is getting here I
think right yeah that just means that
like these first two years I don't even
know if they knew how to do insane
response yeah but what's interesting is
that you know for it what in the
breakdown looks like within the
industries that it was energy and water
it looks like it's mostly energy a
little bit of water and what's really
fascinating here is to read the
government's incident response reports
yeah like the different municipal yeah
those other utilities things that keep
this nation going and SSH brute force
scannings
scans and attacks at the top of the list
of some of these are my god and it's
like that's the stuff that's like right
no not at all because that's the thing
is like if you've got port 22 opening in
fact you could even literally you could
open net cap on for 22 and just listen
and you would have a bot connect to you
in five minutes that's trying to quarry
you not even an SSH server you're just
you know listening on for 22 because
those bots are just constantly trying to
prove for us and I remember back when I
even finished here the windows box that
had SSH looking through logs and and it
would just be like root password root
root root tour weird god logs secret's
out somewhere else
yeah and then the other interesting
thing that I found here aside from the
SSH was that spearfishing accounted for
seven out of 17 in sis so it's pretty
high and only one though one at least
one incident infection from removable
USB device we're using the switch later
that that means securing their
facilities they're not training their
people to understand security like they
should they say that in 12 of the 17
cases implementation of security
recommended practices such as logging
limitations segmenting networks
firewalls of that so could have
significantly reduced the time to tech
the attack or at least reduce the impact
of the incident so it's like you know
all of those archaic systems that I mean
you think your IT shop is bad can you
imagine what it must be like it like
some power plant where some system was
custom developed back in the 80s you
know and nobody wants to touch it
because I don't want it to stop working
anyway so that was a fascinating read
there's a whole bunch of other good
tidbits in here so if you're interested
in seeing like what the government will
or how they're spinning it you you can
check that out in the show notes it's
the ICS circle I filled out something
interesting and it kind of goes long
since we have been playing with the
Sansa
you see Lu yeah so if they created this
new application called police tape and
it's for if you if you're going to like
a protest or you see a police police
person you know tasing somebody and you
don't think it's right and you want to
record them yeah it gives you legal
information as well as lets you record
in secret okay so it'll it'll take down
the application so it'll just show you
so the open operation and then it
disappears yeah as soon as you hit
record it disappears the super
background so you're recording but if
you show the policeman your camera or
your phone they won't think otherwise
because they just see a home screen yeah
personally I think you you're still
going to have the same issue because
you're still gonna be holding up your
phone unless you like have it in your
pocket or something yeah well I'm gonna
notice that you're holding
I think the novel thing about this is I
mean there have been apps where you can
like record it in the background or
something like that and I think what's
novel about this is that it has the
ability to submit your findings to
submit your audio video photos to the
ACLU I think before anybody runs out
there and starts doing this with
recording you know public officials
police officers in the public and you
know serving the public it depends you
know there's a lot of caveats to that
for example if like the cops are doing
an investigation and there was literally
a police tape like they had a police
line out and they're like doing the
chocks and you know talking the guns
yeah because that is not a place that
has a reasonable expectation privacy
they're like they're forbidding you from
going into that area so there's a whole
bunch of caveats I just want to like I
think it's fascinating I think it's
great and it empowers people but it's
really important to understand that
while it's getting a lot of news right
now that's coming out of the ACLU new
jersey yeah which has different laws at
other states and then of course you know
abroad it could be quite different so I
always you know I I don't feel like you
should
you should just not do anything it's a
citizen just like you know be like oh
this is hard
yeah yeah but you know it's important to
learn facts about your yeah I agree
so it is nice about this application
that it does come with legal information
for how you can record but unfortunately
it's only for Android right now what's
going to I all right it's coming in fact
I'd love to hear what you guys think on
the matter
there was a great discussion going on in
Google+ earlier about this and I'd love
to hear you guys chime in what you guys
think about you know surveillance in
general or surveillance of the man yeah
so speaking of surveillance Cisco I
guess all of you have probably seen this
by now but Cisco do blink sister who
makes the home router for everybody in
their grandma no hackers would but you
know unless it's a deputy or dd-wrt
based o NS L you or n SL you to the help
they up all the wrt54g but Francisco get
this they push this firmware update
pushes you even if you've got the
checkbox and says hey rogue
automatically update and it's this new
firmware locks you out of the ability to
change or manage your home router and it
plays with and when you go to sign up
for their cloud service that this now
has it gives you this license agreement
you know they're like you know there's
like I don't know there's like the
Constitution there's like laws and then
there's n user license agreements and
nobody well the Terms of Service for
this grant Cisco the ability to shut
down your connection if they see you
using it for obscene pornographic or
offensive purposes to infringe another's
rights including but not limited to any
intellectual property rights or to
violate or encourage any conduct that
would violate any applicable law or
regulations or give rise to civil or
criminal liability since when are you
the police Cisco oh yeah they're just
helping out the feds they're just
helping out the RIAA it's like you know
we're like laws have like you know you
process all these other things and use
their license agreements it's just like
you write whatever you want and and they
even you know there was actually an
update from Cisco as this court pointed
out that like hey they've made some
changes to the privacy policy but it
still says that they can disconnect you
at any time and it says that they can
change the terms of the license
agreement at any given time it kind of
is so what I'm the way I'm feeling about
it is you know thankfully it's not like
you were born into Cisco and you're
governed by Cisco's regulations or
anything you just happen to a bought a
product and if you didn't root it you
don't own it so in this case if you do
own it and you're not happy with it you
don't have to sign these license
agreements you don't have to let the man
spy on you you can take your router and
smash it to bits and send it to 150 West
Tasman Drive San Jose California nine
five one three four because that's what
I'll be doing you know
yeah I mean it's not like they're gonna
deport you you know thankfully you can
vote with your wallet you can make those
decisions it's just I don't know there's
a great write-up on going one by Cory
Doctorow you guys should check that out
as well I know that that was a little
bit heavy here with the Department of
Homeland Security and Cisco and the ACLU
but it was fun to kind of get out here
and start talking about some stuff that
we don't normally get into I am looking
forward to getting some German food you
know so if you guys have any thoughts on
the stuff that we've talked about we've
got great discussions going on in hak5
forms we'd love to hear from you
personally feedback at hak5 org and i
also oh yeah the hack shop adds h a k h
JK shop.com and we have the new Wi-Fi
pineapple in a pack of hair which is
really nice and i also want to thank
t-mobile for hooking us up with galaxy
s3 these things are okay we've been
playing with a lot of fun Android phones
recently and we just want to like thank
t-mobile for letting you know us do that
because it empowers you to do things
that you might not have imagined the HD
cameras are wicked so they want to let
you guys know that if you head over to
this URL you can learn more and you can
maybe even win a phone or other Samsung
products by getting in on their spin to
win contest so thank you so much yes
thank you
Hey all right well with all that said we
will see you guys back in studio next
week also stay tuned for some wicked
hack tips from Shannon here coming up
all right well with all that said I'm
