by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is Shannon Morse and this is
my dinosaur Greg and this is your weekly
dose of all things tech no less
specifically this week i'm getting into
linux games but more on that later
you'll notice that Darren is still not
here and I kind of decorated with some
Easter colors you like it I guess it's a
little early for Easter isn't it Paul
yeah a little bit yeah okay alright so
it's a little too early for Easter but
whatever I like these pretty colors yay
pastels so I wanted to go ahead and get
right into it linux is now accepting
steam games steam or valve the creator
of steam has created a software version
for linux so you can play all your
favorite games or at least well 60 of
them on linux hey now they do recommend
using 12.04 for their new version of
steam for linux and i'm usually i'm
actually using 12 point 0 for of ubuntu
so i'm pretty good there one thing I did
want to mention about this is they only
do have 60 games currently and if you go
over here yeah there's a celebration
sale there they're currently celebrating
with like 75 percent off some of your
favorite games a few examples of ones
that currently play on steam would be
tf2 CSS serious iam you'll see half life
down here and a whole lot of other games
that I have not played before but I'm
glad to see that there's a few oh yeah
and if you get tf2 you can get a free
little tux item in the game how cute is
that now the reason why I wanted to
check this out is because there has been
a steam platform for linux for a few
months or so there was a beta going on
and there were a lot of bugs and i
wanted to take the time to check it out
and make sure that there weren't any
more bugs see what games were available
currently and also see if there were any
kind of issues when I wanted to go
and download it on my little laptop and
I figured this thing is so old it's an
it i think i believe it's an i3 if i'm
not mistaken and it's an old acer aspire
timeline x so i've had this thing for at
least three years and yet I was still
able to run games pretty well one thing
that makes this stand out from the
windows platform for steam is this one
apparently it includes big picture this
is a new mode of steam designed to use
with a TV and a game controller so their
plan for this and we've been hearing a
lot of information about valve wanting
to create hardware platforms like the
steam box I believe that this is one of
the things that they're planning to do
is bring steam on linux into the living
room so you can play it with game
controllers on a big screen TV which I'm
really looking forward to now let's
check out steam itself so i'm just going
to minimize this i'm using this crazy
mouse right now so if I'm a little off
that's why so i already downloaded it
luckily the download only took about
five minutes or so to actually download
onto my obutu platform and i usually get
like 15 Meg's down point 5 up or five up
I don't remember anyway so you know
decent speeds and let me go ahead and
log in here yeah that's fine they can
friend me friend me I'm yep all asterisk
dang it what you guys didn't know my
password that's terrible it's a whole
like ten characters or something dang it
so yeah it takes about five minutes I'm
gonna go ahead and bring it up right
here real quick now I did have one error
when I was installing this it said it
was missing some packages to download it
but luckily these automatically
downloaded through the terminal so no
problems there i just had to you know
sudo put in my password and then say yes
to the download and it was just fine so
i logged in with my normal account i'm
going to go ahead and close this it says
you can install an extra package
repository for better driver performance
but it actually works pretty well right
now so i'm not going to
worry about that too much you'll notice
on my screen I have CSS over here in my
library killing floor tf2 tf2 beta and
world of goo of about the 20 different
games that i have downloaded or maybe 40
now I don't know it's quite a few those
are the only ones that were available on
linux so they automatically came up in
my library that way so luckily i didn't
have to go back and figure out which
ones are going to download and which
ones are going to give me errors and
whatnot i went ahead and downloaded
world of goo so i'll go ahead and start
that up make sure you can see that on
the screen i did have to reinstall some
of the games on my new computer let me
turn down this volume computer Shh there
we go ok cool so we have the game
running and you can see this is just a
little intro area at all so I'll go
ahead and go into a game you can also
get into your regular steam app right
here during the game so you can see your
friends achievements guides whatnot just
like normal you normally would with mac
or windows and let's see if this works
small divide ok yeah let's look let's do
with that the game is really smooth I
was really surprised that it works so
well on this laptop just because i know
that this machine is like three years
old and I've ran so many different
operating systems on it I'm surprised
it's not like completely dead now
alright so let's take a couple of these
guys and build them I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do in this game I
haven't played it in like a few years go
away Dropbox I don't care right now I
know I need to fix you Oh too high yes
this is my job playing
this is fun haha eight meters to go Oh
am I supposed to be going sideways i
think i'm supposed to be going sideways
yeah supposed to be going sideways all
right to make more of these dudes go out
here so that falls ball thing fall there
we go hello friends yay alright so it
works yeah I can move around just fine
no problems I can play with my friends
by going into the steam app so you can
tell that there's no lag that I can see
I did notice a slight little bug like if
I wanted to use any key strokes that you
normally would use in ubuntu you have to
make sure that you actually exit the
game before doing so or it can be kind
of complicated to get back into the game
it's a little bit of pain in the butt
but overall I it works just fine let me
go ahead and quit out of this game quit
little and go ahead and exit what all
right the actual interface of the new
steam on linux looks just like you would
imagine it to be you do have to
redownload any games that do work on
here so far like i said there's only
about 60 that do work on on linux
currently out of like the 1900 games
that are available so we will have to
wait a little while until those are
available but they are currently working
with a lot of developers to get those
ready for linux so hopefully we'll see
that change in the next couple of months
but i can't express how excited I am for
this I think it's awesome and I love the
fact that my games that i recently
purchased on windows are still playable
on linux even though it's a different
operating system obviously you cannot
play the same account on two computers
just like you know you've experienced
that land parties and whatnot you do
have to get on to your account on you
know login and logout on your new
computer but overall i gotta say i'm
very excited about this I think it's
really cool that I can download it and
it works really smoothly on my old
piece-of-crap laptop and I
no problems running it and I just I need
to see more games I need to see more
games steam come on let's get this time
let's get it done right now all right
that's about it for steam and Linux very
exciting I think Greg appreciates this
thing that he likes to eat rubber
duckies and whatnot so we'll be right
back with Darren after a quick break if
you're setting up a website to start a
new business showcase your portfolio or
publish your blog domain com is the best
place to go for your next great idea
need a new domain name consider
registering a new com a dot-com domain
name is the original and we all know
it's the best it's globally understood
immediately gives credibility to your
website no matter what name you choose
plus if you want to invest in and sell
domains comms have the highest after
market value find a new comm domain at
domain.com Darren and I really like
domain com because they're affordable
they're reliable and they're really easy
to use plus domain coms active social
media presence on Twitter at domain com
and they're really great customer
support make it a really fun place to do
business so the guys at domain com want
to hook up our fans you guys with an
awesome offer get fifteen percent off
their already affordable domain names
and web hosting when you use coupon code
hak5 at domain coms check out that's
fifteen percent off and big time savings
don't forget to use coupon code hak5
when you think domains think domain.com
we attack across America day 5 and guess
who I just discovered this is you know a
good to meet you and just kind of a
chance visit gotta email em i'm now at
CERN check this out oh yes in fact that
right there is part of the large hadron
collider so let's go in and find herself
the Higgs boson so this is a this is
what it looks like on the underground
how far underground is it already 50
meters 150 meters
and so what is it filled with with
helium the pink Lisa comes through the
pipe there's two hosts inside okay and
the piece of the throttles cross in the
opposite directions and so is there a
specific point in the in the tunnel
where they hit each other in the exactly
in the each experiment one of the four
magnets family so the jihad mountains
and that's where the the first Jurassic
amber was found so not on some crazy
island where some doctor recreates
dinosaurs who right here in Switzerland
is on the other is France is France on
the other side so where's France just
show me yeah you can just pass the gas
station yeah go ahead got it not this
one but that ought to run the next block
over I could I could literally just walk
to France from here yeah there's no
border is there yeah there's a porter
but there is no wonder oh okay hmm I
have to just go to France we both are
the control center start the computing
center sir what is that these the that
controlled experiment oh where they
control this nice all right well let's
take some more looks
maybe
maybe there is the first station the
first ever web site
what is in here the first web server
this is the first web server is another
one the control longer computing center
oh my gosh we the first one 1989 yes
this is Tim berners-lee's server yeah
 that oh my god consider the
paper and what his was right that right
up and what did he write he says hey but
interesting hey but it's exciting
exciting before read it before YouTube
yeah
how they are celebrating the problems so
where's that at the bottom except where
we are right now yeah yes here's the
press America there is a linear
accelerator to get some air energy and
then go to the small one then the bigger
one and the huge one yeah so where are
we on this map oh I see so Alice Alice
CMS and LHCb
turn this is spread around award for the
transfer rate yeah 11.99 give a bits per
second you just for a job 283,000
running jobs yeah don't run kill minus 9
so this is what the simulation looks
like when it comes out of the
supercomputer yeah this is what tech
 is going on hide the detector
how did support colors 30 most hard to
study the first one
the energy is a circular machine 27 or
discomfort but if arias beams of protons
to all 99 99 percent of the skill right
and Eliza in for 20 points for huge
directors take snapshots of each
collision up to 600 million percent
and it is transformed articles just like
in first fraction after the Big Bang
will we find reason why antimatter and
matter did not destroy each other
completely
we understand state of matter before new
transport will be fine particles that
make up and students don't
we finally expose that is responsible
for giving master the particles the
village see open is close to an
understanding
well do they they sell the Higgs boson
over at the gift shop can I get one but
I actually can I find him before the
announcement he was yeah before just you
you found the Higgs boson before they
announced it what actually the Higgs
boson but he said oh you found it where
was eggs just lunching at the restaurant
oh oh pigs gotta eat
long did it take the bill how long did
it take to build it over thank you use
it to 12 years so if one particles in
this one going this direction the other
particles that one going the other
direction where do they meet very
correct on points of the experiments so
they have them just combined y'all had
that is is that I think they apply some
magnetic Oh put it together okay the
entire plectrum phone I know the
intersection points at LSC msn topless
okay Oh CERN is in the Guinness Book of
Records a terabyte of data sent over
10,000 kilometers in under an hour I
don't think they did that with floppy
disks floppy disks and uh Volkswagens
what is this this is a represent the
amount of Zeta they taking seven hours
on thanks / 10 these are cds okay so
let's see 700 megs 700 megs have 100 Meg
yeah okay so what are these pieces at 50
experiment and the 50s it looks
everything I like it it's it's like
steampunk these are nice and compression
oppressor flush other guy like I said
you see okay there's another girl that's
the piston that right there yeah oh my
god there's massive maybe I'd made one
look at all these cards hahaha
that's a brute-force computing approach
this is just on the logo electronic
stuff ok so like pong this is kind of
romantic before super computers you just
project the film and draw it by hand
look at that Wow imagine staying late at
the lab drawing these what is that over
there yeah crazy space capsule oh I
think that's Barbarella's ship
barbarella no you don't have barbarella
here you're missing out off to send you
a link
and so the piston would go all the way
up this yeah what was it compressing huh
there is another part Wow has a lot of
character I like it it's a huge white
wait oh this part rather what was born
so what is the the control system viq
vidieos using the control system of PA q
what is da cute without the addition or
that acquisition so so you're saying
that the adage and other sensors go
through this now this is just a
validation board that becomes an craft
no board oh I say
what is this be careful with email and
web the cyber criminals are tricking you
pineapples really hahaha at CERN the
pineapples are tricking you oh my god
yeah oh oh yeah I know that guy so this
is the test board for this and this is
the validation unit so the data from the
sensors comes in through here yeah over
internet novelty disconnectors Teresa it
should be PCI Express is HTTP yeah
that'd be a PCI Express which okay they
communicate here and then go to the fpga
is in the other board how many FPGAs 44
yeah for huge wines and so is that part
of the upgrade is moving 24 pgs know the
part of the update is a movie for a high
hiker speed high speed yeah so where's
the bottleneck is it the CPU or is it I
underlit disappear that I have a deeper
here you can so the so the network is
the real problem yeah but this is just
for the control okay season this is as
low blows slow speed control that's cool
so this is a computer try the car pc
computer ooh i have a high passage heat
sink yeah I have my mother running here
oh oh I say so and so how many of these
power the control unit or one for each
board there is a 100 for anything why
don't you 80 120 100 plus we can I cpu
is this without them oh okay so it's x86
706 your finger but but it's it's uh you
just a regular x86 processor yeah yeah
no Jenna or it's a little bit just for
the local control unit out Wow + ctrl
season oh wow that's a board yeah this
clock signals are oh yeah boy they took
the clock signal from the elite seem
machine mm-hm for 40 mega mega ha sido
and then spread for all the DQ boards
me
oh wow look at that acoustic coupler
pick up the handset stick it on the
suction cups there we go get your 300
baud on I wanted one of those so that
and as a kid so I could use them on pay
phones dial-up bulletin board systems
from a laptop and a pay phone how rad
would that be i love that i had that
floppy drive didn't have the Playboy
bunny on it and I had think this hard
drive was in my ex T or hard drive that
too is very thick so maybe it was a
different one big poker Wow 40 mag yeah
this was a 40 mega 14 a hard drive
fantastic we might have been a 20x on
whatever was it was huge I could have so
many fast files on it thanka those
puppies home
where's the Unreal Tournament server
sorry the quake 3 feet out which one
ones quake okay but saturday
we gotta from
your computer
he was rising
II there's one thing about computers
they're hot so you're gonna have to vent
all of that i'm sure this temporary I
think I used to do that that are there
during LAN parties no I get that
dashboard
we speak too softly all experiments
hey little guys hey yeah i see this is
the cern animal shelter for the computer
mice you can see they've taken up
residence here look at this one just
kind of hanging out hey little guy oh
he's a logitech now we are in France how
wonderful is that
I wish I could say something like
welcome to France yeah I know Bonjour
can you yeah that my friends is the
control center this is exciting and so
this controls what aspect what
experiment don't beats farther all of
them all of them the for the decelerator
just for the accelerator this is the
control center for the accelerator it's
so cool Oh battery exhausted yeah Thank
You Darren that was very interesting and
we miss you over here I hope you come
back soon now it's time for the
technology of the week this one comes
from Ken he said from what episodes i've
seen you really seem to like retro stuff
in or deadly meets cute stuff sorry i
don't have the ladder but here's my
