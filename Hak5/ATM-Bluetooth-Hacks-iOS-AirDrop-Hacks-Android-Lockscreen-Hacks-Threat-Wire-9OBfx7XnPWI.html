owned with Bluetooth and airdrop and
Android is owned with copypasta all that
coming up now on threat wire
greetings Internet I'm Darrin kitchen
and this is threat wire for September
16th 2015 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom and we start today with a fun
story about sophisticated card skimmers
that's right there is an epic read over
on Brian Krebs blog this week detailing
the sophistication of some of these ATM
card skimmers we should all be aware of
some of the ATM card scams involving
like dubious attachments keypad overlays
and things of that nature but this seems
quite different this scam involves get
this wiring a Bluetooth circuit board
directly to the ATM on the inside a feat
achieved by organized criminals by
bribing ATM technicians and once
installed the get this encrypted payload
can be downloaded to a smartphone from
afar over Bluetooth now Brian documents
how this you know on a semi vacation to
Cancun and down Mexican coast he
encountered numerous ATMs all beaconing
the skimmers default Bluetooth signal
that signal is free to move as in free
to move your guests from your bank
account you can go to Krebs on security
talk and read more it's good stuff a new
Android vulnerability was disclosed that
enables an attacker to bypass the lock
screen even if encryption is enabled
this was documented in CVE 2015 38 60
the vuln affects Android versions 5.1.1
and below and when successfully employed
it crashes the lock screen providing
full access to the phone's home screen
the apps and of course ADB the attack is
carried out by opening the emergency
dialer filling in the buffer with random
characters repeated over and over with
copypasta and then opening the camera
app and pasting that huge string into
the password field when prompted from
the Settings icon in the notification
drawer and at that point there's a
little bit of fuzzing that eventually
crashes the app and drops you into the
home screen fun times
there even lets the attacker enable USB
debugging so you can have all sorts of
fun over ADB the vulnerability was
reported in late June and a fix was
released with 5.1.1 on September 9
that version also patches some of the
previously reported bugs talked about
stage fright most notably which was the
remote code execution vulnerability in
the media server or basically getting
owned by text message let's not let the
iPhone folks feel left out this week
also brings a pretty good reason to
update to iOS 9 see a critical
vulnerability demonstrated by Security
Research mark Dowd shows how an attacker
can install a trusted application on an
iOS device by sending a malicious file
over airdrop the attack requires nothing
more than proximity to the target and
for that device to have Bluetooth and
airdrop enabled the malicious app is
installed regardless of whether the user
accepts the airdrop file and using
enterprise certificates that same file
that the same technology that enables
like organizations to install custom
applications on entire fleets of iPhones
well the attacker is then able to
install a trusted app without even
asking for permission and so if even
coupled with say a jailbreak exploit one
could really have wreak havoc on a
device the attack relies on a directory
traversal flaw which hasn't actually
been fixed though the attack is
mitigated in iOS 9 you can check out the
video to see how the dialer app is
replaced with a hello world in just
seconds and before I go I want to give a
huge thanks to everyone who's supported
the show on patreon thus far if you find
value from this and you can spare even a
few cents in episode please consider
becoming a patreon over at patreon.com
slash threat wire and we may even be
able to support your awesome pet pals in
the next episode and our plan is to do
this three times a week as a milestone
goal with the rotation of Patrick Norton
Shannon Morse and myself and I hope you
will help us continue to keep this
completely independent and AB free if
you can't donate a like and subscribe
those go a long way too you can find all
of our other episodes links to our
social networks and all our the other
ways to contribute over at threat wire
net with that I'm Darren kitchen and I
will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
