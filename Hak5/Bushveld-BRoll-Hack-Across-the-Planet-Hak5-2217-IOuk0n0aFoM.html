thank you wow that was wonderful I was
about to say that the diplomatic mission
to Alderaan is continuing now in Durban
South Africa which I've never been too
good a lot of traveling to get to
Alderaan still I hear it's beautiful
this time of year this is the part of
the trip where the vacation starts which
is also the part of the trip where I'm
the most nervous because DEFCON is now a
month away and this is like stress time
as everything gets printed and delivered
and is the booths going to be built in
time and I'm doing everything remotely
so fingers crossed
should be good should be able to fly a
drone here soon though that's going to
be fun
I'm going to assume his name is Babar
attacks across the planet day 116 on
this adventure and I'm here in Pella
Bora in Kruger National Park in South
Africa on the border of Mozambique I
really don't have anything planned for
you guys I'm spending the July 4 weekend
ish thing is July 4th here nobody's
celebrating to everyone happy day that
happens to be special to us and here's
some beef matched b-roll clips
got a great idea
bring it to the web the way we do and
head over to domain comm we've got a
slick domain discovery system and an
easy checkout process so your site will
be online in no time and the domain comm
guys have been supporting hack five
years and they want to celebrate with a
massive promo code use HHA jumbo for 35
percent off new domain registration now
through November 30th it's a limited
time offer so when you think domain
names think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
