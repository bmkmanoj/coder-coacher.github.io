three tracks build it break it and bring
it on
schmuck on is the premier conference for
hackers and security professionals since
2005 we have had the pleasure of coming
here to talk to the best and brightest
hackers in our community so today we
would like to bring to you our
interviews and conversations that have
tickled our technological
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by goto assist express support smarter
with go to assist Express domain calm
got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain calm and dead space
- in stores now I'm just like looking at
this board just thinking what what
inspired you to make your own Bluetooth
board I mean what was wrong with ones
that you could buy off-the-shelf right
yeah well you know Bluetooth ports just
didn't do what I wanted to be able to do
and in particular they didn't do passive
monitoring you know like like pretty in
promiscuous mode like you would exactly
exactly
and like you can take a Wi-Fi card off
the shelf doesn't cost very much money
plug it in run Wireshark run kismet and
tools like that you just can't use or
haven't been able to use with Bluetooth
because the off-the-shelf equipment
doesn't have that monitor mode
capability well so are you saying that
with this you can just fire up Wireshark
and sniffily shoot packets that's the
idea yeah and I'm demonstrating today
how to use this with kismet and you just
plug it in and run kismet with this
plugin to talk to this board and you can
snip bluetooth packets and how does that
differ from Wi-Fi I mean are they're the
same kind of terminology do you still
have like beacons and probes and stuff
like that no well there are different we
did very quickly rewritten for this only
part of kismet and you know Mike Kershaw
has has created kismet it's been around
for years and and it's a wonderful tool
that a lot of people use and and but in
the last couple of years he's created a
plug-in framework so that someone like
me who comes along with some new device
and and wants to get it running with
kismet has a much easier task all I have
to do is write a little plugin that
tells kismet how to talk to my device
and how to display Bluetooth information
to screen instead of displaying Wi-Fi
information is green and it's all
integrated into kismet it has kismet
slogging built-in with a Mike and I are
working toward having a GPS logging
built in so that he
working on abstracting that so that any
plugin that you have like this or
anything else into kismet will
automatically get that that GPS tracking
like war driving for war driving
bluetooth exactly I just went bored
driving Bluetooth the other day with
this and picked up like ninety devices
on an hour drive that's really
interesting because Bluetooth devices
have basically a bssid
or not a VSS ID but what is the name
what's the term for that uh Mac a
bluetooth device address that's and
that's unique for every Bluetooth device
right um so you could potentially you
know with the GPS and whatnot with
enough of those you can put up spots
where if the same person passes by them
you can track them with that right
absolutely and it's kind of similar to
the way we're used to doing war driving
with with Wi-Fi except that in that case
you're usually mobile looking for fixed
stationing yeah with bluetooth the model
is different because the stations tend
to be more mobile right you might be a
fixed station looking for mobile because
we've all got these Bluetooth radios in
our pockets you know our cell phones are
just you know if we've got it turned on
there are they broadcasting I mean well
before I even get to that what was what
was wrong with just you know finding you
know the least expensive Bluetooth
adapter you could order there had to be
like one that special model number that
you get from China or something that had
the chip that could go into promiscuous
right well that's another kind of the
Holy Grail in the Bluetooth hacking
community for years a lot of people were
working on trying to figure out how to
hack dongles how to hack an
off-the-shelf adapter into doing things
like monitor mode and and there has been
some limited success but there are there
are there are technical features of
Bluetooth that make it fundamentally
difficult if not impossible for an
off-the-shelf device to be used for
passive monitoring and their their
technical challenges that have solutions
like two years ago at makan 5 Dominic's
bill and I presented
building an all channel bluetooth
monitor and we showed some technique
that was using like a u.s. I was using
USRP but it was a proof-of-concept that
showed that these these challenges can
be overcome but they're more expensive
more complicated challenges than to do
passive monitoring then for normal
bluetooth operations so it's unlikely
that a consumer bluetooth product is
going to support passive monitoring
because it wouldn't be designed for that
yeah so that's what you did you - there
was nothing out there you had to go out
and design a Bluetooth adapter
specifically for monitor mode does it
also allow you to do things like packet
injection yes and that's actually my
original plan was that it would just be
a sniffer but I eventually migrated
toward this this architecture that uses
a wireless transceiver
so it has capability to both receive and
transmit and it potentially has
capability to work with other
technologies like right now I'm just
doing Bluetooth basic rate which is like
what most Bluetooth packets are but
there's a new Bluetooth Low Energy
standard that devices are just about to
hit the streets this will be able to do
sniffing an injection of injection of
Bluetooth Low Energy and potentially
some other technologies in the 2.4
gigahertz band as well so how do you go
from security researcher to chip
designer well I didn't mean this isn't
off-the-shelf so I mean was there a
reference board that you used and then
made modifications - yeah it's um I I
didn't design any of the chips on there
but but I you know put them all together
and designed the circuit board and
really when I started this project two
years ago I didn't know much about
electronics at all yeah I I knew a bit
about software radio and software in
general but I didn't I had never
designed a circuit board for example
ever so getting it to the getting from
there to here has been quite a journey
I've learned a lot yeah did you like
partner with a designer or manufacturer
how hands-on did you have to get I mean
are you sitting there with a soldering
iron late at night and yeah a bunch of
bunch of chips on a breadboard or a lot
of late nights with soldering iron oh my
gosh it's just awesome you must have
learned so much and then what is it to
take so I'm assuming at some certain
point you've got this giant breadboard
with all of these you know wires going
everywhere and it's hooked up to your
laptop and you're trying things and then
voila hey it's actually working right is
that that right I remember specifically
a first go to the parent no no I was so
excited when I when I decoded that first
Bluetooth packet you know because I had
done I had done the decoding with good
new radio in the u.s. our PE and so I
knew exactly what needed to be done and
I knew from the software side on the how
like this plugs into a host computer my
last we were talking about that game
using wireshark for blue sure so you
already had that right yeah there's
already a Wireshark plugin ready for
this to be said sending packets to and
so I had a lot of that groundwork
already laid and it was just a matter of
getting the packets to be delivered you
know decoded and delivered to the PC and
when I got that first with my prototype
couple of prototype boards strung
together with our wires all a world and
yeah and and I just picked up with my
first Bluetooth packet and I was so
excited and that amount moment but you
pull out the digital camera and like
take a picture yeah and then write down
like where everything is connected right
trying to turn that into it was I so how
do you get from that breadboard to a
circuit board you know how do you and
and I'm assuming this is not the only
one there are four working models so far
oh so you've had these made in the US
yeah well I made them myself so like
this one this is one of four the first
one I just got working that you did all
this this particular neuron huh of this
particular model this this is the first
one got working on Tuesday and I got
four more three more working since then
and I'm giving them all away this
weekend and we're gonna try to make some
more yeah
is that was that your goal is to go into
manufacturing of Bluetooth dongles or
not originally because you're just
scratching an edge right I mean right
this is totally the
Matan is like I want to do such-and-such
and then there's everybody else that's
like interested as well right I mean I'm
sure you've been hit up for more than
just four dongles right you got here yes
I have and well it really the the
primary goal for this project from the
get-go was to bring Bluetooth monitoring
technology to everybody right I wanted
to have an open source solution that
anybody can build that's an affordable
thing so is the hardware open source the
hardware is fully open source so you can
download it's designed in kicad which is
a an open source electronic design
automation package so it's entirely
designed in kicad and the software is
completely open source and and the
hardware design is open source you can
take this thing you can modify it you
can get your own boards manufactured or
you can manufacture them yourself I
could go over to digi-key or Mouser or
Yammer and you can get all the parts
that are needed for this from one of
those places and and assemble it
yourself but I also I know that there
are a lot of people who don't want to
necessarily go through that effort and
write and do all the surface mount
soldering and acquire the tools to do
that
so especially to build one of them it
must be pretty expensive to you know buy
these chips and all the transistors and
everything that you need one by one a
little bit yeah it's the build cost on
this one alone not not to even think
about all of the R&amp;amp;D that goes into this
probably a really expensive chip it's
not it's not as expensive as you might
think
I mean not counting not counting extra
parts that you need because you messed
some up or lose them
not counting some of the tools that
you're that you'd need for this kind of
surface mount soldering which aren't
that expensive but not counting that
stuff if you're just looking at the cost
of the board itself and all the
components it's under a hundred dollars
to build a single unit and and of course
costs go down if you build you know more
than that is that is that JTAG on there
is that what that is yeah yeah it's a
JTAG interface for debugging and
programming there's also a an expansion
interface that I intend to it doesn't do
anything yet is that for an SD card no
that is for a serial programming
I have a little have a little programmer
that has these little pogo spring-loaded
pins you can push up against that and
program it and the future I'd like to
have a near future I'd like to have a
USB boot loader so that you can update
the firmware just by plugging it in dual
USB like red boot right or how do you
have you flash to this guy well you
flash it today you have to have a serial
programming device sometime and it works
with like a 15-dollar part that you can
used as a program how do you even go
about building the firmware for this
well this is a the microcontroller on
here is an ARM Cortex and three and so
there are good open-source tools I'm
using a GCC toolchain to compile the
firmware and one of the reasons I went
with this particular model of chip is
that there was an open source USB driver
written for it already so what about the
Bluetooth stack I mean the Bluetooth is
entirely my code but for the most part
I'm doing all the complicated Bluetooth
stuff on the host computer that this is
connected to okay
I'm tuning the radio and I'm telling us
demodulator till to to try to decode
Bluetooth bits and then just having a
stream right these are the computers
it's not like this guy is programmed to
hey you are a headset associate and do
this right yeah in the future it might
be able possible to have more
sophisticated firmware options that do
stuff like that but for now for passive
monitoring all I have to do is tune the
radio and then stream bits into the host
computer and then use software tools
that I already have this is a Wireshark
perfect for you know right for for
sniffing already mm-hmm so that that's
taken care of
right Chuck my kismet that's great for
you know identifying hosts you know
enumeration if you will but what about
for like you know is there is there like
a I don't know like an air crack ng kind
of equivalent what about the injection
and how do you are there tools that are
designed to say oh this is a headset do
this kind of no not so much yet but I'm
hoping that the availability of the
software part where platform like this
will enable more software of that nature
to come out
there are some interesting tools that
you can use with like a blue sea stack
and linux that allow you to do a lot of
that kind of stuff but but they all
presuppose that that the that you have
prior knowledge of the address of the
device that you're trying to target and
that's been the that's been the missing
link is that there's never been any way
to passively discover non discoverable
Bluetooth device right all of the the
tools that I've ever played with you
know the ones that come with backtrack
and stuff they were only ever able to
like find my phone if I put my phone in
that mode where I was searching for
other devices and broadcasting out so
you're saying even if your Bluetooth
isn't set you know is it you've got
bluetooth on on your phone mm-hmm but it
isn't set to discoverable all right till
discovery I can discover it with uber -
yeah so that's like you know the whole
like oh I turned off broadcasting my
SSID now my access point is safe right
not so much right exactly and it's taken
ten years for for them this was there
become available which I which just
drives me nuts I mean I can't believe
that we've we've gone that long without
having things TSM you're just starting
to see dry some hacks next actly if we
had the hardware like this those
Motorola phones you know recently that
we heard from CCC about right have those
you know been readily available to
everybody with the drivers and
everything we would have been hacking
gsm ten years ago absolutely instead of
just TLS doing that right yeah so I mean
even just that one tiny little function
of just being able to identify discover
a non discoverable Bluetooth devices and
get their address that right there that
is not huge because then you can take
the existing tools for regular Bluetooth
dongles and actually do useful things
with them
and test those Bluetooth devices in ways
that we already know how as long as you
can identify them and total violation of
privacy but you could imagine some sort
of marketing company loving - in a
shopping mall but B can't put little you
know modules at the corners of all of
the different like intersections and
stuff in front of all of the stores and
then you could have a beautiful readout
of where people walk and you'd have a
heat map and stuff and you could
you know there are actually some some
companies already doing that that's in
it yeah yeah it's a little shady but
okay so what about like the injection
side have you done any fuzzing like no I
haven't done any injection at all at
this point and I've totally been focused
on getting the hardware done and working
on sniffing I've done some some
rudimentary transmit tests so that I
know that it's capable of transmitting
but I haven't what do I like association
and no I haven't done any like real
communication real early research right
right well how can people how can people
get involved like get the tools and then
build the parts and whatnot well there's
a there's a project site at uber tooth
sourceforge.net and that is the that's
where all the design files the the open
source hardware and software everything
is there that you need to get started
and also I'm trying to make it available
for people who don't want to build their
own boards so I have I'm starting this
little company called Great Scott
gadgets and and I'm going to try to do
an initial production run here really
very soon where I can get some boards
built for people that people can buy
yeah
far along are you with that well I'm
just today launched a Kickstarter stew
site on Kickstarter calm where you can
you know pledge to support this project
and essentially it's like a trusted
third party to take pre-orders right it
sounds pretty cool yeah that's when
there's enough interest then you'll have
the capital to go and and have that
first run done right so I have a 30 day
period starting today and at shmoocon
and ending at the end of February and so
if we if we're able to get enough
support to meet the prej goal then then
I'll be doing a production run and
getting a whole lot of people's and
boards so have you already talked to a
PCB a I mean you have like an moq to
work with I'm sorry it how would you
talk to them and getting a little too
geeky for the show now um do you have a
good budget if you already go oh you
know what we can start talking about
like packing ejection all day long no
follow we started talking about you know
a PC board assembly Hong Kong and
minimum order quantities and you know f
OB Shenzhen and anyway because you know
I'm interested in that kind of stuff as
well so so you are you that far along in
the process I'm just starting to explore
those options I have some referrals yeah
but I don't have you know I don't
actually have a vendor selected yet and
so I'm looking for I'm still looking for
more referrals and looking around and
what the best way is to get these
manufactured obviously step one is
getting the board done and proven yeah
and step two is getting some help with
funding to run and step three is
actually building it isn't that an
exciting thing though because that in of
itself is hacking a new system you know
when you're just like I've never built
computer chips in China but right hey
you know like whole new world of stuff
to learn yeah that's great man you know
to go from from a security researcher to
to the chip designer and and you is this
your first like hardware project that
you've built on this kind of scale oh
absolutely I mean when I started this
project I had never designed a circuit
board at all and I mean were you done
with soldering at least I I was somewhat
competent at soldering but I had never
served I had never surface mount solder
and IC before I'd never designed a
circuit board I've never really done any
digital circuitry at all and I just had
no idea what I was getting myself into
but I got involved in a lot of other
smaller projects along the way that
really helped me learn a lot of little
microcontroller projects and other
electronics things and and just read a
lot and did a lot and talked to people
at cons who are doing interesting
Hardware things and well you know there
are a lot of I was inspired by a lot of
people who do who hardware hacking like
Travis Goodspeed and Amanda Wozniak and
I mean there are there are people who
who have come to these hacker cons and
and really showed me over the last few
years how much can be done with a little
bit of effort in the hardware world and
there are so many of us who have you
know pretty good software knowledge but
don't have the hardware Experion
so just haven't made that leap to try it
out and and I think it's I'm really kind
of astonished that I was able to come as
far as I was in I'm really kind of
astonished that I was able to come as
far as I was in two years
well yeah cuz now you're a double threat
hacker you know we're in South software
lookout right some social engineering in
there and and you know making that leap
actually isn't that hard well sure you
have to learn some stuff but you know
you're learning new stuff about software
all the time anyway and it's just
learning new stuff about hardware and
and you can that habla that totally
tickles my Technol s I mean that is one
of those things that just so neat it's
like the first time you ever you know
got like you know bash prompt or
whatever right you know right like all
of a sudden the world looks so much
bigger uh-huh yeah it does it really
does I mean so many I I'm continually
amazed by the fact that we've put up
with a lack of tools for Bluetooth for
10 years there are a billion Bluetooth
devices manufactured on this planet
every year which I believe is more than
Wi-Fi and yet we just I mean as security
professionals we we just have just
ignored security vulnerabilities in
Bluetooth because of a lack of tools and
I don't think that is a good enough
excuse if if I'm able to build something
like this with zero Electronics
experience before you know why didn't
somebody else beat me to it we really as
a community I think we're getting more
into hardware and we're realizing more
that we can do this there's a ton of
stuff with like especially Arduino
hacking scene was there not an option
there for you to like just go through
and do that with like an Arduino and
some special you know riser boards or
whatever sure and actually the first
working prototype I had of this
architecture was a little breakout board
for the wireless transceiver chip
connected to a microcontroller
development platform which could have
been an Arduino but I wanted to have
something that I could I could
eventually shrink into a smaller form
factor and have integrated USB
so I didn't use the Arduino in
particular but that's an example of the
type of tool that absolutely could be
used to prototype this stuff and the
popularity of that you know kind of
microcontroller hobby scene is is just
enormous and skyrocketing and it's
really it has an important overlap with
with the hacker community and people who
are the zoo there's a growing number of
us who are kind of in both worlds and
and it's a really exciting place to be
so right now sniffing right now you've
got you know you can home make them
however you like going to manufacturing
what is what's net what do you see next
for hacking Bluetooth you know the
injection fuzzing well my my my dream
I've given Bluetooth talks at shmoocon
for three years in a row now and my
dream is that I can stop and somebody
else will come up with some more
exciting things with Bluetooth the more
exciting security research than I've
ever done using my platform remote I can
only iPhone if right if I can help to
enable if I can do a little research of
my own that's great but if I can enable
a lot more researchers to to be able to
do this kind of work I think that's
what's really important bluetooth
security has really kind of languished
there there have been some improvements
in the Bluetooth standards that have
been made over the years that haven't
really seen the light of day and I think
that's just because there hasn't been
any market pressure to get them
implemented whereas if you look at Wi-Fi
security right early on we had tools
like monitor mode and injection that you
know within I don't remember exactly but
within like two or three years of the
first mass-market Wi-Fi devices
everything was blown wide open WEP was
broken there were tools like air snork
available and that anybody could
implement at a low cost immediate
because all of them were the same and
whereas Bluetooth you have different
flavors of the spec you've got this one
is an a2dp
this one is a headset this one is true
thing but those are all kind of higher
level flavors they all operate on the
same lower level okay and and like what
I'm looking at from from my perspective
doing this passive monitoring they all
look the same to me
2.4 gigahertz or gigahertz and and so
you know Wi-Fi has had the benefit of
that early security research and it
Wi-Fi security you used to suck but now
it's pretty good yeah because there's no
lack of exploits or hackers out there
you know that fancy playing with it you
know right right and and I think you
know Josh right is a big proponent of
getting affordable tools out there and
and and yesterday in in the ZigBee talk
they were talking about our rights law
which which if I may paraphrase it is
you know vulnerabilities will be ignored
until tools are accessible and that
totally was true with Wi-Fi and I think
it's true with Bluetooth as well with
Wi-Fi we had the tools earlier on and we
actually made progress and we have a
more secure standard now with Bluetooth
we haven't had the tools and we still
don't have secure system it's the same
that we're starting to see with GSM and
that's interesting to see you know
rather than a very general purpose
device that like the u.s. RP which is
for most people inaccessible just
because of the cost and then something
like this where you know if you get that
done overseas or something you could
bring that down to nothing and then we
could all be hacking Bluetooth right
yeah right it's really interesting man I
love talking to you about this stuff is
so great what have I not asked you what
have you not asked me what what does
everybody at home need to know that we
haven't touched on is everybody at home
need to know I don't know I think we've
covered all the important points I mean
we talked about we talked about it's
open source
hope this resource-poor is the hardware
Tim it's so cool oh absolutely I mean
it's a core a core principle of mine and
you know I wasn't going to do this
project in any other way you know that
was the the whole goal was to make it
open source and now I'm trying to make
it commercial as well but that's they
can't live together I mean it's ready
that you know I in fact
you know dabble with this stuff as well
and we even sell like stuff with open
source firmware and then you know on our
site where it's like hey you know if you
want to buy this device from us cuz you
don't want to build yourself here you go
however we actually incurred you break
out the soldering iron right here's the
episode where we show you how to do it
here's the you know where you can go and
download the the squash FS files and all
that here you know watch your own
whatever yeah yeah and I think yeah and
there are a growing number of people and
companies who are who are actually
commercializing open source hardware in
this way we're doing as a great exam it
is that's a perfect example they're huge
and and they've had so much success with
the fully open source design and there
are clones and variations all over the
place and that doesn't diminish their
success in any way no no you ain't there
is some opposite clone there's some
great source hardware funds that can
actually use the open source software
right and that's like why not if you
know if that's what you want to do right
you know right yeah it's such a such a
great world or in that aspect and thank
you so much for making this more
accessible for everybody I'm sure the
next MOOC on it's not gonna be just you
talking about Bluetooth there's gonna be
like 40 other hackers that have broken
everything what do you think's going
down first iPhone or Android that's what
I want to know Oh blackberry
nice yes yeah our camera guy Jason over
here is nodding his head yeah he may he
may have had a little security research
on the kitchen from the glass device to
jail yeah it's been a pleasure and take
a blonde for having me as you guys know

never really had anything that spoke to
who we were yeah knowledge is right yeah
yes okay HFC is that let's take what we
have and use it for good you know for
people that need it now how did you go
from hacker to a philanthropist oh it
was kind of a it was it was kind of an
accident in some way oh really
my wife went to Uganda on a short
missions trip and brought back this
footage which just rocked my world
really no saw these crooked footage it
was a it's stuff that you're used to
seeing you know absolutely you know
absolute poverty kids that have nothing
but this was my wife's my wife was
seeing this yeah but these kids weren't
the sad kids that you're used to seeing
these kids were happy cuz those are
these two yeah yeah it's so much joy but
they had nothing you know and I was like
you know I was comfortable and happy and
everything with my career in my life but
I was kind of miserable yeah I was like
what are these kids have that I don't so
I went to Uganda with her and they put
me to work doing computer stuff and I
found that computer work in a place like
Uganda third-world country can have such
an incredible impact and out there
there's all these people that are out in
the world trying to help the poor that
have computer problems yeah and they
have no idea what to do they don't know
what to do about it
and so basically we're alongside them
and we're doing our best to help them
with their technology issues so they can
you know save people that are in
desperate need know you just went over
to a Ghana right yes actually I've been
there we've been there for about a year

conferences I didn't do any speaking

point a man yeah that's good but after

very true
so for all the hackers out there that
really want to get involved like can
they bring in hardware can they donate
money to make donate their time or yeah
the hardware thing was a problem for a
long time because shipping stuff to
Uganda is expensive yeah so we don't I
don't have a whole lot of stuff anymore
yeah what we do is we try to take that
hardware use it locally our biggest need
right now we we still need money you
know we're operating on a budget of
about 20,000 US dollars a year which
