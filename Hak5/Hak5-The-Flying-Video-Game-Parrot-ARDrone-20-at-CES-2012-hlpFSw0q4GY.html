with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse coming to
you from CES 2012 and here I am with
Jillian hello Jillian it's nice to see
you every year one of my favorite things
about CES is checking out the parrot
ar.drone
and I know you guys have been working
hard on it for the last year so what is
new
so the basic big news you have on the
air drone 2.0 is that we brought a HD
camera so the frontal camera you have
here is 720p and you will have live
video streaming in HD now on your tablet
or smartphone and you can also record it
and share it very easily
that's know I also know that there has
been a couple of changes with the outer
surfaces of it as well as that correct
yeah it's totally correct actually we
weight something that is much more
resistance yet also much more
good-looking so that's one of the
amazing of change but also inside is a
big change where we had much more
sensors to make it much more stable at a
higher altitude so basically something
still very easy to pilots but you can do
much more stuff with this so the people
that live in the mountains they'll be
able to use it pretty well now they will
definitely be able to use it pretty well
because we have a pressure sensor here
that observes manage the altitude and to
know precisely as to which altitude we
are so it will be stable everywhere in
the montains the plane just to see is
not good now last year when I discussed
this Pat in the past CES is it was only
for the iPhone and the iPad I know a lot
of people really wanted it for Android
so has that been updated yet definitely
that's a wish we can actually grunt very
easily because right from the moment
where we'll release the air drone ship
on oh we're really is the application
for the Android Market tube so
everything will be available with the
full features and full optimization for
most of the biggest Android devices
that's excellent news I know a lot of
our viewers are going to be really
really happy to hear that now does the
Android version run pretty much the same
way as the iPad and iPhone app
it will definitely be the same
application with the same features for
both versions awesome now what is new
with the iPhone and iPad app so
basically we wanted to have an
application that is more much more user
friendly easy to control and something
that the user will be will feel familiar
with so you see the design has changed a
lot but also once you have float you can
retrieve all your videos very easily so
is there a stream right in your tablets
and you can find them back here so for
example here you will find examples of
what we've shot in Paris I'll show you
doing a little site saying that's been
oh and I see you can see bit too exactly
what kind of format does it save in you
save it in QuickTime formats
actually and then once you are recorded
they say oh this one is crap let's do
another one okay this one is good you
know still power through stuffs and you
can share it very easily for example on
YouTube or Picasa for the pictures but
soon on Facebook too so it's pretty
pretty much that you know you have a
good quality of video HD and you can
record it easily have all options around
the recording and then when you are
happy with that share that with
everybody have you guys developed any
more of the video games for the moment
we're really concerned trading on
bringing the best for the HD video so
recording sharing making some automatic
move with the video just like a director
but of course we are still the ar.drone
which stands for augmented reality and
we'll bring more of that in the coming
weeks and you're still open source right
we are still open source happy
developers hello
now what is the price point for the
newer in ar.drone 2.0 so this will
release in the second quarter of this
year 2012 for 299 dollars yeah
perfect price point thank you so much

hands on the new parrot ar.drone
