at Derby con 6.0 recharge well welcome
to hack five my name is Darren kitchen
my name is Shannon Morris
it's a weekly dose of technology when
back to another amazing episode is that
a Dave Kennedy for president sticker on
your face yes of course it is best
candidate ever maybe it could be a
write-in gonna go political in the show
now
well everybody should register to vote
yes even if you're not in the US because
you should probably register to vote you
know I actually had no joke I had a
dream I'm not gonna mention the
candidate but I had a dream that the
other candidate you know the worst one
got elected but through a computer
malfunction
something got miscommunicated and they
ended up becoming the Prime Minister of
Canada instead of the president of
United States and we're like oh sorry
glitch it happens
you're gonna take I don't want to say
him or her insert insert into your
candidate and um and then and then we
ended up with Harper
so it was like a terrible dream oh yeah
so that's funny oh well hey yeah we are
back from Derby comma Mordor penis for
you yes we do let's see what are we
doing today oh so first off we're
talking to Tim Malcolm better so he did
a bunch of interesting analysis on
tokenization of credit cards and then we
are also talking to render man I'll let
you explain what render man's doing a
friend was doing serious research about
Internet of Things connected devices
that happen to be sex toys so we're
gonna find out all about that and we
will see you on the other side be mature
in the comments hey guys I'm back again
here at Derby con in Louisville Kentucky
for 2016 here at the convention I'm here
with Tim Tim hi how are you doing good
good we're gonna be here so Tim I was
really fascinated by your talk I read
about it in the synopsis in the guide
and I was like cool I used to work for a
credit card processing company so I'm
really interested in the security that
different companies can use whenever
they're processing credit cards
obviously so can you tell me a little
bit about what your talk was
so yeah so over the last few years
worked on testing some ecommerce
applications at credit card organization
M which is a technique to try to take
credit cards out of certain apps to keep
it more safe and so we came across a can
pull of some interesting things that you
could do to attack them kind of attack
the seems not really the crypto but
attack the seams of how these
applications tie together and you could
get credit cards out of and potentially
so it's interesting stuff so why did you
decide to start researching this in the
first place because it's kind of a weird
thing that a lot of people think that if
I deploy tokenization then that's like
that's all I need to do I check the box
I got that not to worry about anything
else but it turns out there's a lot of
stuff in the details that you really
can't dig into and understand
so is tokenization something that
obviously the the company that is
wanting to accept credit cards they have
to make sure that that is check marked
but is there any way that they can look
into that themselves or is it all just
up to the company that gives them the
acceptance of processing credit cards so
this would be so in my scenario we're
not really talking about payment
gateways we're talking more like a
really large enterprise that wants to
take their own credit cards just put
them on one spot on the network right so
we're talking about all the things that
they would do so some of the attacks
that we do and we demonstrate could
carry over to a payment gateway but that
wasn't the intent right so the intent
was definitely for like a DIY enterprise
conduct organization thing right so what
did you find whenever you looked into
this tokenization so we found there's
like six attacks we cover or six
scenarios it could be everything from
weird brute-force scenarios you can come
up because a lot of times what happens
is the payment server doesn't actually
do anything it doesn't have
authentication because it's actually
tied it's a separate stuff so you
actually you're shopping on one site you
get your cart you go to actually
transition over momentarily and you may
not even notice it because a lot of
times it's JavaScript a little trickery
magic that I've seen that happen all the
time and sometimes you get lucky and a
website makes the checkout cart look
just like their webpage right so
sometimes it's like you'll notice your
address Mart will change it'll be
different domain name and you'll that's
a hosted example a lot of times big
enterprises don't like that they want to
keep the branding and maintain it so
what'll happen is in the browser your
your browser ah should grab that credit
card number or send it off to another
server and that server will get give you
back a token and then the JavaScript
will then post that back to the
to the checkout site right to the actual
commerce site and say oh here's this
token and that's how you process that so
we we're talking about that handoff is
kind of weird sometimes you can actually
just hammer on the server that's
actually giving the where you give it a
credit card you get a token and you can
hammer on it and 50,000 guesses
sometimes and it's all you need on
average and some scenarios in order to
get a card to credit card out which
might seem like a lot but it turns out
it's really not right with automation
you can actually get that out pretty
fast how fast were you able to make this
happen well so you can actually generate
all the potential credit card numbers in
a matter of a few seconds with some
Python code but actually testing the
transactions in really depends on
latency the application and how much
noise you're willing to make right so if
you want to do really targeted after one
person you might spread it out for hours
you might split the load out to like
kind of bit Bitcoin mining kind of
techniques where you spread it out
through a bunch of hosts and kind of a
cloud scenario or there we could just be
really noisy and just do in a matter of
a few minutes or an hour right so did
you end up doing any kind of like
man-in-the-middle attacks with this oh
no we didn't know but there are other
scenarios like account takeovers so like
let's just say for example Yahoo just
had this breach right so we don't have
the data yet but chances are like all
the other breaches they'll be passwords
that are dumped somewhere and some
torrent right so when people get that
the bad guys like to go grab those and
do account checking where they go and
say hey is this using a password ballot
on the site and if it is now I take it
over and if you have like a lot of
websites like that I have like a like a
safe credit cards thing in the profile
so it's another scenario we talked about
where you've got safe credit cards in
there where I can actually see that
number and say hey it's a Visa these
last four based on the fact that it's a
US company and it's a Visa ah blah blah
I know a lot about the prefix and so I
can actually guess those middle digits
that are missing pretty quickly and we
can hammer on yeah there's interesting
it's it's not don't be too alarmed of it
because we're talking you know
potentially hundreds of thousands of
hits per per user per card that you want
to steal but it's potentially there
another scenario that's kind of fun is
same scenario I would get the account
takeover but rather than just try to
guess and get that - same token back
what we can do is we actually can
emulate the user actually adding a new
credit card for the profile and so let's
say you have three saved credit cards I
go to add one based on I see the billing
address I see it's a visa and these are
last four I take a guess what those are
if I have four credit cards now that
means I missed right and it's kind of
like playing
like I sunk your battleship right so I'm
going to here and like okay it's amiss
delete that one try again miss okay and
eventually when I sit yeah exactly right
so it and it's just illustrates that
it's really important for for defenders
to just not just harden their
application but also to monitor right so
you need to watch and that means you
have to have customized logs because
your application will be unique
right so everyone's special snowflake
you need to know what your what your
logs would look like an S scenario so
that's basically what it's about so if
I'm implementing credit card processing
on my side or I'm working for a company
as their security person how would I
other than just doing logs how else
could I prevent this from happening on
my own face so the spoiler I said in the
very beginning my talk was if you take
nothing else away like be very very
careful about roll-your-own organization
right like don't do it yourself right if
you can use payment processing companies
that are out there that are established
because they've kind of figured this
stuff out right it's just like anything
else the security you don't want
roll-your-own but if you're not going to
do that and you want dig into it you
obviously need to take like there's lots
of scenarios to consider I have a blog
post about this alum medium you can go
fetch and it'll be on my Twitter and
LinkedIn account stuff and the slides as
well so these are things you can look
into and there's certainly not the only
things I and this is not an exhaustive
list by any means but this is certainly
like a good step in the right direction
right is there any kind of payment card
processor that you would recommend or no
comment no comment whatsoever right
awesome well Tim did I miss anything is
there anything else you would like to
share with our audience I think that's
about it there's more stuff there's a
couple other scenarios in the in the
talk so catch the video once they posted
once Adrian gets it up online so and
that's it now hit me up a Twitter say hi
sweet thank you so much and where can
people find yo you on the Internet's I
know you mentioned Twitter of course
yeah sure so Twitter at Malcolm bitter
it's mal CMV et ter or you can hit me up
and LinkedIn as well I'm out there yep
let's go drink all the booze and hack
all the things here at Derby con 2016 it
wouldn't be a hacker conference without
drinking all the booze and hacking all
the things and an expert on both in fact
is our good friend render man hello
again it is awesome to see you I hear
that you are now an expert on on both
drinking all the booze and
hacking all the things the Internet of
Things scary buzzword mm yes well one
specific kind of thing that would be the
Internet of dongs dongs yes sex toys oh
right right cuz sex toys are vulnerable
to all sorts of exploits question mark
this is new territory for me all my sex
toys are an internet-enabled - right you
know why it's like you know flip phones
and anyway so there's a whole generation
of connected devices you know it's
amazing about technology they're putting
into these things now you Bluetooth
connect you know there's apps on your
phone you can invite people remotely
over the internet to control these
things it's kind of a brave new scary
world but what's really scary is when
you start looking at the security of
them and realized no one's ever actually
done that no but you know this is this
particular branch of the Internet of
Things no one's wanted to touch with a
10-foot Pole
when I think about Internet of Things I
think about connected doorbells and and
and you know do security log you know
door locks and webcams and things of
that nature
right I don't think about sex toys I
think that those those first branch of
kind of elements you know your your
smoke detectors and things of that
nature
security is probably a forethought is
that what you're finding with the sex
toys you you think that security and
privacy would be aforethought in these
things I mean just like those other
devices here are smoke detector your
door locks what is it it's a Bluetooth
elite chipset
you know there's - if your phone and
there's an app you know to unlock your
doors to do what you need to that's all
these are is your you know if using an
app to send a command over Bluetooth to
these devices to activate whatever so
they're pretty much the same as use of
their devices and as we're finding with
other Internet of Things devices the
secure home is kind of terrible well if
they're both using the same underlying
technology and it's just gpioa to you
know hit a relay and in this case
instead of you know opening a door doing
something else activate the motor
then why wouldn't they both be about the
same level of security or is there not
frameworks that they're all using that
are based on best practices well you're
assuming that they are you know that
they aren't the same level of security
well they are it's terrible
with these devices it's you know the
Bluetooth you know okay we know those
issues you know it's short range you
know limited exposure there but once you
connect it to the app now you have to
worry about the application security the
back-end API and back-end servers that
these things are talking to you know how
is this communication we facility over
the Internet you know our you know 100
milliseconds away from you know three
billion jackasses know so so give me an
idea give me an example of what you
found when you started going and
researching this field so just started
you know this research getting other
interested parties and and trying
sponsorship and get things set up but
just tearing apart some of the apps no
one knows how to do SSL properly even if
they are doing SSL just all sorts of
really good you know API keys left in
there there's all sorts of things that
you you should know better but
unfortunately in that industry and you
know like we're funding a lot of
internet of things they don't know any
better is their first time they've done
it can only basically are now adding
connectivity to what has previously been
an independent and manual device so not
understanding that they have to ask
questions about security you know is
part of the problem they just yeah it
work I think it's an interesting example
of the fact that like every industry as
they approach new technologies it's like
having to reinvent the wheel or even
understand that there is a wheel to just
be had off the shelf that has security
built-in or even the security is a thing
so what kind of like just you know
failures have you found across the board
in any of these well complete lack of
SSL is a big one asking for just like
requests over HTTP or other plaintext
protocols yeah just XMPP no encryption
or anything if they are doing SSL the
vast majority if they're using you know
hostname identifiers allow all which
basically will accept any certificates
even if it's not you know so man in the
middle is really easy
so that let's encrypt certificate that I
just generated no use your self signed
certificate it doesn't even need to be
the other one is asking for ridiculous
amounts of permissions like why do I
need to that this app the music control
is you know Bluetooth device need a
secure system settings change ability
like there it's scary how much they they
are asking for and it's just developers
that don't know any better they don't
you know knowing that they have to turn
off debug and you know restrict the
permissions it's just a case of well it
worked it was easier ok we'll ship that
well it got the job done which meant
that you could you know get go home at
5:00 does does that mean that perhaps
installing one of those apps to control
any of these sex toys might actually
create like an a new attack surface on
your device quite possibly because
having a if you get a malicious app on
there that is looking for sale blackmail
material or other interesting
information knowing that these apps are
out there and depending on you know a
whole bunch of factors could you figure
out who you know you're allowing to
remote-control this is that necessarily
who you know the public may think that
you're allowing to and maybe someone
else there's lots of weird privacy
implications with it because people are
really weird about sex so you know it's
right for things like blackmail and
extortion and what-have-you so what kind
of feedback have you gotten from any of
the vendors are you that far along in
the research yet so just starting to
reach out to vendors
he said research is just kind of started
but the reached out to a couple of them
already and basically trying to get to
the point where they're setting up a
vulnerability disclosure program to
where there's actually a path for
researchers to report vulnerabilities in
that they'll you know take them
seriously research them fix the problems
because that this is an industry that
has never had to deal with this before
this is totally new you know they need a
little bit of a guiding hand so you know
people have sex people masturbate get
over it
want them to do it safely
you know you don't want to have to worry
about the fact that gee you know if
Alice and Bob you know are in a
relationship and Alice invites Bob to
control this vibrator remotely well what
happens if Eve hijacks that session Ella
still thinks it's Bob you know she gave
Bob permission not Eve does that know a
sex crime oh wow actually that's really
interesting I didn't thought about it
that way but that brings new aspects to
all sorts of things about men in the
middle and getting back doored and all
of the other implicit jokes here the
amount of euphemisms mm 200 something it
it just goes over my head now I don't
see it the jokes write themselves good
luck in your next talk on that one yeah
it'll be interesting to see how many
times they try to censor that but that's
why I use you know I think it is a prime
example though of just how any industry
so you could just pick any facet of the
world that now has to compete with all
of the smart devices that we have in
that expectation that everything must be
connected so it's like let's connect the
refrigerator and let's connected so the
connected home that's been like touted
for for you know decades right and so of
course everything will become connected
and this is just one you know funny cute
example right but it's going to happen
to every industry and they're all going
to have to learn so what is the what's
the best best path that we as security
researchers can do to kind of pave the
way for a more secure future for all
devices regardless of whether it's you
know a vibrator or a doorbell
I think researchers reach out to vendors
providing that that helping hand
pointing out to them because yes it's
Internet of Things but there's a bunch
of discrete industries in there you know
your refrigerator company you know
doesn't necessarily ever build doorbells
so they don't you know those two don't
talk to each other they don't learn you
have to teach the same lesson over and
over again to each industry but when you
spot you know a problem somebody doing
something wrong you know reach out to
them sometimes they'll respond sometimes
they won't in you know this particular
case there's a lot of your doing what to
what
but it's it's a responsibility thing you
know there's a potential for you know
things like harm there's potential for
embarrassment extortion excited we have
to do something you know it's a good
civic-mindedness you know being a good
hacker of just not not leaving these
problems where once we know about them
it's what we do we solve problems so we
see you know pay attention to these
things let them know and break it and
make it better they need to understand
that you know we're here to help yeah
yeah we're not trying to extort you for
money or things like that it's just you
don't want to see anybody hurt be it you
know the doorbell refrigerator you I
really don't wanna see a vibrator like
sending spam you know participating to
detail us or something I mean but
there's a very real chance of something
like that happening in the future
like that's just mind-boggling it's
crazy to think that we live in a world
where you may potentially need to
firmware update your dong yeah it's just
a lot of things you never thought like
doing this research has been you know
for me like memory open-mindedness do it
even for me it's weird like some of the
stuff you find you know when you're
going through an application and there's
a function you'll get orgasm who gets to
deal with that sort of stuff we are
going into a brave new world of like
robots and everything else so it's just
gonna get weirder so might as well you
know get it secured friend get that
mindset of security from the forefront
where can people find more info on what
you do in the research in case they're
also doing similar stuff we want to
collaborate and all of that sort of a
website for this project it's the
Internet of Dawn GS so internet of dongs
all right render man it's a pleasure as
always thank you so much I'm looking
forward to seeing your research evolve
and for all things derbycon keep staying
tuned at hack 5 it's time to take a
moment to thank our friends over at
domain.com and if you've been watching
hack fire for a while you know that we
love doing mancom whenever we have these
awesome ideas when we want to register
domain that's where we go and over the
summer we've been making all sorts of
cool things thinking about the amazing
possibilities with this new top-level
domain
dot club when domain.com told me about
this I was just hooked because you know
it's a really cool top-level domain and
we wanted to celebrate by featuring your
club ideas and we did just that we got
an awesome tweet here from Paulo Deb who
says hi hack five club idea a recipe to
style IT tutorials nobody bothers
reading blurbs nowadays it's all TLDR
thanks domain.com for supporting and
thank you Paulo we are sending you an
awesome doc Club and let me tell you
these are perfect they are universally
and globally understood and not just
here in the US so if you're building a
new business or maybe your startup it is
perfect I mean really anything like a
business or an idea could be a duck club
and it's the internet we're talking
about it's all about community and
collaboration so dot Club is really the
ultimate social domain so when you're
thinking about building your next
website a dot Club is awesome get yours
over at domain.com slash club register
those they are super affordable let me
tell you they are still literally
thousands available and just make sure
you use that coupon code hak5 that saves
you 20% and lets our friends over at
domain.com know who's Sencha matter of
fact go ahead and tweet at domain.com
and say hey thanks for supporting hack 5
all these years and really appreciate
everybody sending in those awesome ideas
thank you and when you think domain
names think domain.com then the crazy
thing was like Angela Merkel was the
vice president oh we're back another
episode of hacked five wrapping up the
show here it's fantastic to be joining
you guys over the Internet once again it
turns out I'm gonna be in Vienna Austria
teaching with Robin wood and subpoena
yeah all about the Wi-Fi pineapple the
land turtle and the USB rubber ducky
those dates are November I want to say
around that November 8 in Vienna Austria
it's a deep SEC find the links over hak5
org to sign up for that workshop as I
will have to I guess though absentee
yeah you won't be in the country when we
find out who wins you might just want to
stay in Vienna I don't know if you can
apply for air like political asylum you
find out who your new presidents and
you're just like nope I just won not
coming back men with the shiny shoes
know that they are just the sweetest
the sweetest I love oh you're so funny
hey guys guess what we have a technomage
photo of the week this week every week
we are going to be giving away something
from the hack shop that's hjk shop.com
if you want to support us there and you
guys can send over your tech no less
photos we'll choose the best one our
favorite as long as you use the hashtag
hack 5 to be honest though this one
didn't have the hashtag hack 5 but I
loved it so so very much really yeah
we're spoiling it oh I know so this is
from Kim Thompson our checked our jecht
no kitty no can has Wi-Fi pineapple book
oh I just I want to cuddle it that is
awesome and seeing as you most likely
already have a Wi-Fi pineapple might
entice you with a land turtle that we
were sending you for free from our hack
shop get all sorts of fun men in the
middle now wired instead of Wireless
check that out in the middle train your
kitty to plug it into how about how
about kind of 5 port on the lantern well
we love your cat so thanks for sending
in your picture and use that hashtag in
the future yes epically nerdy and and
it's you know I feel like that is
preying on the social engineering human
vulnerability of cute animals yes cuz as
we know we're all susceptible to that
don't try to pretend you're not you it's
true I really like cats yes indeed you
know what else I like I like finding out
about all of the awesome workshops and
other fun stuff that we have going over
hak5 org and then I scroll down and I
see the pictures of all the hey we're
sending now we're pictures of the snubs
and you can see all their social links
and you can be like I like cats - here's
a picture maca what you need to do and
then you subscribe to all the podcasts
I've done this before I swear you we're
so Donnie yes we're gonna grab a beer
right it's been we've worked every
weekend for the last three weeks
probably have we're tired this is why
I'm wearing the same shirt
last week hey supported directly a check
a shop comm hak5 dorg for all the
goodies you can leave comments below or
emails directly feedback a hack five
dead org something about micromachines
i'm darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
stress your technology
smells interesting it's not a scratch
and sniff smells odd though you dancing
there's no clips mcgaffey there are none
of those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
