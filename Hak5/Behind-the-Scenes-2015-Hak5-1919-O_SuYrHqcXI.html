on a walkthrough of the warehouse and
our newest project of the EM work today
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen my name is
Shannon Morse your weekly dose of techno
welcome to the show everybody and happy
new year because it's probably 2016
where you are right now
maybe maybe unless you're like on the
hack 5 YouTube channel just hitting
refresh good luck oh man this has been
an amazing year I can't believe it has
been just over a year in fact since
we've moved over to the hack 5 warehouse
and man what an adventure it has been
Lou scenes such a transformative year
it's been an insane year we've done a
ton of new projects here at the
warehouse and we've also done a lot of
new shows for example that's right tech
thing which yeah I mean it's you know
what it brought back threat wire brought
back threat wire we've we launched pen
test with hack 5 yeah amazing yes I mean
people had been asking us for the
longest time like it'd be so cool they
did security training and makes so many
cool security tools and they're right we
just never had the space to do before
and yeah we do and now we've been able
to do open houses with like like what
was it like cage match and we have
barbecues and everything we even have it
had a garage sale yeah we have like a
little mini hackerspace going on here
and it's because of you that we've been
able to live the dream and do this which
has been so exciting I'm pretty stoked
well tomorrow I am leaving for CES so if
you're watching this in the future I am
there right now so I decided let's do
something fun let's walk around the rare
house and test out my new rig I know
right so you okay don't by the way I am
like not envious whatsoever ever have
fun at CES I'll be like you know
watching the tech blogs or something but
this is really cool your rig is much
different than what we've typically yeah
in the past we've taken something like
this like a just a regular legit video
camera something with a nice XLR input
so we can put on some nice wireless mic
packs like I'm wearing here and you're
going a little out of your you've got a
hard core Oh too low
without this thing what is that camera
it's called the Sony a7r - it's really
nice I actually talked to my friend
rustle Tammany who pretty much made me
techno lust after this thing so I
decided to splurge and get one
especially for my trip to Japan in May
so I got this and then on top of that I
have a 3.5 to 6.3 24 millimeter to 240
millimeter lens on it so it's a honking
Beast yes machine eye I can't wait to
see what you get back from the CES show
floor with that thing I think it's
pretty good really you know we should
test it out and what better way to test
it out than to take you guys as we wrap
up the year and as as as we wrap up
secret projects we are now finally able
to show you some of the stuff behind the
curtain because like all of the things
have come to fruition and I can breathe
again but but yeah it would be really
fun to show you guys what is transformed
in the last year since we did this and
what better way so let's let's do just
that let's start right here in the magic
Co in fact Shannon check out these
buttons mm-hmm I think yeah it works
better that way actually I'm gonna hand
this to you to talk about those little
guys a little heavy huh okay so as you
can see the studio has changed a lot
since the last time we gave you a look
behind the cameras it's not barren
anymore and we actually have a couple of
different sets starting with the hack
five slash tech thing set we have a
couple of different hacks that we've
been using as a couple of hosts so that
we can work behind the scenes at the
same time if that makes sense so first
off we have our cave cabinet button so
no we're not playing games while we're
hosting which would be kind of weird but
these actually run to a little USB box
down below at my foot and these will
change the cameras as we're talking live
while it's recording into premiere Adobe
Premiere so we're able to switch all the
cameras from our hosting or hosting
places which actually works pretty well
surprisingly these were pretty easy to
put into this table it wasn't too hard
so yeah it's it's in our
now and then we have our Super Nintendo
gaming controllers so this is us be
charged with a little micro USB on the
top basically this lets us start and
stop the recording on premiere as well
so these this is programmed to run into
the computer the same one that these
arcade cabinet controls are and it will
start the recording and then end the
recording we can also switch with B's
too and you might be able to see on the
TV back there when I switch from a B Y
and X it'll change the it'll change the
different cameras as well so pretty cool
lastly we have our teleprompter rig so
this is a Logitech keyboard you can't
find these online anymore unfortunately
and if you can they're like a hundred
bucks which is insane because I'm pretty
sure this started around 20 also charged
off USB so very easy to use and it's
just a regular keyboard you can plug
this into any PC you want so we rig this
up with our PC that runs our
teleprompter so this is nice because I
can start and stop it with the spacebar
and I can also control where I want to
start by scrolling up on the little
mouse pad and so on and so forth so very
easy to run and then I simply escape to
get back into which script I want to
check out other than that yeah we've
we've created this set and then we also
have a couple of other sets on the other
side so we have our threat wire set
which is basically where we stand once a
week and talk to you about the internet
security news and freedom that you want
to know about thank you for supporting
us on patreon by the way for that and if
we lift up we have our green screen
where I did a lot of hack tips and
hopefully I'll bring be bringing those
back if we can get more sponsorships for
that show really really want to bring
back hack tips
from here I think yeah that's about it
for the studio everything over here is
probably the same as what you saw at the
firehouse so I think it's time to check
out Darren's office
beware last time we saw it it was really
really messy what it's not that bad okay
it's pretty bad it has it's come a long
way since the firehouse but I'm like a
goldfish you just give me a bigger tank
this is my most prized project that I've
been working on this is a curve ball
which is what happens when Kirby gets
into a little ball shape and she's she's
actually just helping me build my up
goers my spaceships which are not doing
so great but I don't have a lot of time
to do some gaming in any way over here
we're doing some 3d printing as well as
the large-format printing which I love
to do and this is fun because I can
actually show you now some prototypes
that we've been working on so this is a
case for a prototype of the Wi-Fi
pineapple tetra that we just announced
as well as the Wi-Fi pineapple nano
there are extra cutouts in this one so
we can access the serial which is a is
actually not populated in the header but
you can find the pins right inside of
there so this was one of those things
we're in development having a 3d printer
was so useful instead of having to deal
with like for instance this monstrosity
and and you're like oh it's the only one
and it just came off the assembly line
and you don't want to damage it so you
put it in a 3d printed case I'd say I'd
put the STL's up but there they don't
really benefit anyone but yeah that's
what's going on there otherwise I doing
on IRC a lot doing a lot of illustration
Photoshop Illustrator Premiere over
there and then of course I'm fighting
with some Python over here there's a
really cool project from one of our hack
5 viewers that incorporates a is as well
as as well as a DSP and then puts it on
a nice Google map but it's very complex
in that it uses node and
and a bunch of other dependencies that
I'm just kind of struggling with but
that's that's neither here nor there
otherwise of course we have the hack
five monkeys chilling out doing their
things what else have I been doing oh
you know what lately this is a fun one I
actually just had to do a video
demonstrating how to make all of this
fit so that's the pineapple Nano in its
tactical case and here's kind of like
the evolution of it which is kind of fun
to see that one was too small this one
was too big that one is just right so
this is the funny thing about this one
is it will actually fit like one of
these massive batteries so if you need
like a you know a two day deployment or
something and I'm so so stoked to have
like I said I said we did the same thing
here for the tactical bag for the Tetra
this is the original sample and it was
too small it's so I had it customized of
course because I rock massive laptops
like my 15-inch Lenovo and I'm pretty
proud of that so this thing is just epic
and of course got the hack five print so
happy with the way that this turned out
of course this one is like covered in
Kirby fur because that's just what she
does she leaves her mark everywhere but
that's like the biggest thing that I've
been doing here in this office for the
last year really is working on these two
guys so so so happy to be moving to the
next phase of that project otherwise
that's that's pretty much my office I
know it's not much just a Windows quad
core i7 and a Linux quad core i7 and
this mess and I know you know what I got
beef with synergy this is it I fought
with synergy for the longest time and
right now this is what I'm doing I can't
you know I admit it I just give up and I
grabbed the wrong Mouse every single
time and I don't care and I know there
are better ways and I've tried to KVM so
don't even tell me in the comments
you're right the lag on KVM is going
from Windows to Linux is insane but from
Linux to Windows is perfect so it's like
ah maybe I'm
the wrong distro I just need to get on
jet to or something let's go check out
Shannon's office see if it's any better
come down the hallway oh actually right
now where are we where are we where
where is the kitchen yeah the kitchens
in the kitchen with his pizza John of
course gotta have one of those Superman
ducks YouTube pineapple pineapple
pineapple hack across America pineapple
pineapple New York Times pineapples and
girls only oh hey there I was just
trying to fix my lovely little dinosaur
patch over there I have a whole bunch of
dinosaurs that are hanging out with my
nativity scene from Christmas with my
little baby Jesus yeah it's pretty cool
I know right
and obviously they belong in the peace
garden he wended do they not so I have a
short story about this room we knew that
this was gonna be like the lady's office
so we can stay away from all the guys
cuz they smell really bad so when I got
back from my honeymoon
turns out Sarah really took that
seriously if she decided to decorate so
we have this beautiful like princessy
thing going on up here and I have this
gorgeous little poop of thing going on
here of I don't know what you would call
that but it's cute I really like it so I
think they did a great job I try to keep
this room to just working on office type
stuff so I write segments in here I
research publish do things of that
nature hardware wise I don't really keep
anything in here except for like I don't
know past projects that I might keep
like the DEF CON badge from DC 801 that
was pretty cool from back in Def Con
this year and then I keep all my books
up here so that I can get to reading
them eventually but the really cool
spaces that we wanted to show you guys
are the work horses the warehouse this
is the big guy this is where everything
else happens
are you ready are you ready Darren
you're ready let's go
so you probably noticed everything on
this side is specifically dedicated to
the hack shop and yeah compared to the
firehouse we have a little bit more room
just enough for all of our things over
here is our chill-out lounge where we
can sit on these what do you call these
things poof which oh well they're very
squishy but it works so we have our
chill-out lounge dedicated at this space
and then we have a projector setup that
we can run down right there so you can
play some video games
like those but my favorite part of
course is my workspace so I have a
beautiful table right here where I can
do all my soldering and everything away
from the office that doesn't have really
good fans who are external I guess then
you have external ventilation so I have
this set up so I have my nice match most
recently oh this is kind of cool so
we've been doing build videos for tech
fling and we've been giving them to our
patrons only for patrons so if you sign
up on patreon you get to see all these
cool build videos that we do so most
recently I did this one with a cute
little snow pie which is basically a
little Raspberry Pi GPIO ported device
that lets you light up a whole bunch of
little LEDs it's super super cute when
it lights up so I love this thing I did
too so I might do a giveaway or
something I don't know we'll see I also
have my Arduino powered skull head so
this one would basically basically be
triggered by photo sensors photo
resistors and as the shadow passes over
them it would move as if it was
following you around the room it totally
creeped out everybody who was drunk at
my party it was awesome and then of
course you guys remember the nyan cat
he's so cute and he still exists and
that was a spider
don't ask moving on and this is where
Robert herring reviews a bunch of TV's
it's awesome to be able to let creative
people do their cool stuff here it's
also the home to the giraffe which just
he just doesn't fit in the studio studio
so maybe if we start using the actual
warehouse section as a studio more we'll
do that you may hear some dogs on the
other side of this wall though so that's
kind of that's actually Shannon but this
is one of the reasons why we don't shoot
as much out here but I really want to
because a lot of fun stuff happens over
here as you can see I've done a little
drum nuts it's kind of like my one
little like escape from PAC 5 and all
the other development stuff that I have
to do so I like it though because it's
very much like building a computer back
in the 90s with like picking the
different parts and figuring out like oh
please generate that amount of thrust
and if I impair them with these motors
and I those ESC s then I'll be able to
lift a kilogram and it's just fun so
some of the coolest builds around here
lately let's see I think I already
showed up there xugong I love that guy
the xugong Pro I just built this guy I
love it this is an f3 30 using these
2204 s at 1200 kV with these drop neuro
50/30 props or no they're 50/50 props or
80/50
these things are insane I'm getting like
a 30 minute runtime off this we just
recently used it on texting with a FLIR
camera to do some infrared imaging or
whatever that is and that was awesome
fun otherwise I've been doing a lot of
racing so I have a 250 basher this is
just a QA v 250 I built with a nase 32
and I've been learning to fly a crow or
rape mode which allows me to do cool
like you know flips and stuff like that
but this guy just like takes beatings
like I've honestly run this thing into a
telephone pole at 60 miles an hour so
that one of course is going to need to
get registered
this one isn't gonna need to get
registered because there's only a
your grams this is a I think a hundred
and twenty millimeter rudder to rudder
and the guy is rocking these 1104 motors
I love this thing to fly around the
warehouse with it's just so much fun on
a rainy day to be able to fly indoors
and it's brushless so last forever
otherwise some other builds that have
been doing over here include this zmr
180 I'm rocking these four inch dowel
props here
alright now these are HQs alright I just
went trying HQs at the Berkeley marina
if you're in the Bay Area Berkeley
marina in most Sunday's fpv quadcopter
racing otherwise we've got a little
underground thing going over here in
Point Richmond as well and this has been
a blast what I'm really excited and
proud about is I love a case I mean if
you've been following Wi-Fi pineapples
obviously you know that I love things
that fit perfectly the Nano is a perfect
example of that and this is this is my
210 I I want to say it's a QA v 210 but
it's kind of a knockoff but this carbon
fiber frame this is built low-profile to
fit in this Pelican case with the
batteries and all of the other
accessories just velcroed in here and
what's epic about this guy is even with
the battery and the antennas and
everything whole thing weighs 240 grams
which means I'm not gonna be registering
this fpv eraser anytime soon unless the
law changes we'll see what happens
otherwise other fun stuff that's going
on over here it's pretty much just a
laser cutter just started using this guy
again to make art and stuff let me see
if I can get this guy going this is kind
of fun basically there's a bucket here
just got to make sure that I got water
flowing through the bucket there we go
so it's actually water-cooled and
there's a 40 watt laser tube in the back
I've been doing a little bit of art and
crafts projects and stuff like that so I
mean you know it's just CNC so I can
move around here and actually like draw
lines with a laser normally I take an
EPS file or something like that into
CorelDraw and there we go I've created a
box it's Friday
yeah so that's pretty much some of the
fun projects that have been working on
here in the warehouse let me know if
you're interested in any of this stuff
too because it'd be fun too
do some hak5 stuff regarding my other
hobby that is quadcopter e goodness
but with all of that let's just work our
way back over to the studio there's a
there's a back door in the studio did
you know all you have to do is go should
we show them the code Shannon yes yeah
so you just kind of learn the pattern
after a while it's really intuitive and
we're back in the studio if you've been
watching hack 5 for a while you know how
much we love domain.com and you know
what hey guys thanks for the hoodie and
they're affordable too fast they're
reliable they're easy to use Shannon and

names think domain.com well that just
about wraps up this backstage episode of
hack 5 I hope you guys enjoyed it was a
lot of fun to do behind the stage and

so I'll figure that out and I actually
what we haven't gotten confirmation on
this but there's a good chance that
we're all going to be out and
guess again in January so it's just
gonna be a wanted time more stuff soon
on that one man so that's what I hate
about the secret this one though is like
