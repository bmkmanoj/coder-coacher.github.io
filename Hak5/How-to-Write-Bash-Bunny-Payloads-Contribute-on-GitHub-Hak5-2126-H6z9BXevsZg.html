contributing to the library on github
this time on hack 5 hello welcome hack 5
my name is darren kitchen my name is
anna-marie through weekly rozsutec nola
welcome to the show everybody
yes now everybody stop what you're doing
grab some candy and enjoy just get that
sugary goodness going off doodlee hate
year so much and it I'm doing no month
one month of no sugar has nothing to do
with went you would know if you seen my
Twitter profile food my pants just don't
fit what you sugar
is smells like smells good there's a
rainbow coming out of the ass above
unicorn on your vlogs yes I'm imagining
is made out of sugar it's Carol I don't
know why I did this it was a terrible
idea but I don't fall asleep in the
middle today from my sugar crashes so
that's good how many weeks are you into
no sugar
this is my eighth day okay she's a
delight to be with this week hey if
we're gonna talk about the bash bunny
we have hacker so there's been a lot of
buzz about the bash money and fYI since
I haven't been eating sugar if I'm like
totally off the loop in this episode
that's why because my brain doesn't
think so well if I don't have sugar but
we wanted to answer some very basic
questions that we got about the bash
money so on this episode we are going to
cover how to write a payload and also
how to submit it to the bash money
library that we have up on github so
parens mmm Darrin I have a question for
you yes tell me that we're not making
the bash money just like blink the LEDs
in Morse code or something because we've
already done a hello world on the show
are we doing more tutorials of course
you would want it to blink Morse code
well yeah uh what did I think that that
is actually kind of cool I hadn't
thought about that
oh well that would be but now we're
going to a proper payload we don't have
to do just like a boring hello world
yeah proper pilla yeah I think that you
know and it's a fun example of kind of
what's possible we're gonna attack this
locked Windows machine over here like
right there there we go wake up alright
so I'm so let's just dive right in
because we've kind of covered some of
this in the previous
episode a little bit but I want to go
through it and a little bit more depth
so here on my Linux box I have if I go
over to files get my bash bunny down
here great and I'm just going to go
ahead and set switch 1 I'm going to
delete all of this stuff that's in there
its current whatever that existing
payload was ok and I'm going to create a
new file with G edit because I feel like
using G edit and we're just going to say
led are for read attack mode RNG is
Ethernet ok and I'm just going to go
ahead we already whatever what that
means exactly so that means that when I
boot up the bash money and switch 1 it's
going to turn the led to red and show up
as an rng is ethernet device save that
is P load txt there we go you Jack my
money good to go
cool I can just unplug it switch it to
switch position 1 ok plug it back in and
if I now just come over to my computer
and run if config check a you'll see ok
I ETH Bureau and wlan0 like I expect
yeah
alright light is red and now hey look at
that I have eth 41 hi and i get an IP
address on it want that but it and i
have the ethernet IP address right R&amp;amp;D
is uther net is the Microsoft
proprietary one but it's also supported
by a lot of Linux distros so well ECM
Ethernet is like more specific to Mac
and it'll work on like most other
devices like Linux I have a great
success with R&amp;amp;D is so anyway now that
it's just a computer with that I got an
IP address from I want to SSH over to it
show you some fun tools that we can do
to kind of attack the host and then
we'll all make that turn it into a
payload yes ok cool alright so seeing as
it has the IP address 172 1642 won and I
got boy sorry
64 won and I got the IP address got 10
from it from s DHCP server I'm going to
adjust SSH as root over to it and never
connected to it before so I'm like yeah
it's my key fingerprint and log in with
the default password hacked by Bunny and
there we go I'm on the bash Bunny
in /root i am on this linux box cool if
i go to pen test so slash pen test let's
see I've got a couple of tools right now
I only have in packet and responder but
there's a bunch of different tools that
you could install and one of the tools
that I want to run is actually from in
packet and it's under the examples and I
feel like it's a it's a good example of
what's possible unlike lakhs of machines
when you show up as RNG is vo tonight
I'm just going to run what is it called
RDP check py and what this does is it
allows me to pass it various arguments
for the domain and the username and all
of that really what it's doing is it's
just going to check whether or not RDP
services are running on a machine which
is pretty cool so if I go ahead and run
that again and specify an IP address in
this case the IP address that my
computer got from the bash money which
is 170 2.16 dot 64 10 it will come back
and in just a moment and it'll actually
this is this error is actually because
hey guess what is now running if it were
it would actually say that we're granted
and then I would see like it'll give you
more information right exactly gotcha ok
so we know how that part works but how
do you actually turn it into a payload
well the kind of the first part of
making a payload is testing to see hey
what works you know because I actually
want to go through the steps as if I
were physically there on the Box yeah or
at least is you know if I actually had
say remote access into the - money as
you connected to that machine so what
commands would I run to systematically
check because really what I want to do
is use for instance the the LED here to
kind of give me that interaction I want
to just log it into a computer and then
based on the LED knows something whether
or not RDP is running kind of the simple
example in this payload so I'm assuming
you're going to do like red means no and
greens yes basically okay cool so for
that let's go ahead I'm going to switch
it back over to arming mode ok I have to
switch there and now as it shows up as a
USB thumb drive I'm going to go ahead
and edit payload txt and just kind of
show you a quick and dirty payload and
what that's going to look like ok cool
all right so
come down here there we go shows up as
storage and in my payloads folder I'm
going to go over to switch one and let's
edit this payload txt we were working on
before so so far so good let's set the
LED to purple so RA yeah
so we said it's red blue which makes
purple and now it's setting the attack
mode and then we'll go ahead and in this
case we know it that flash pen test /n
packet plus examples slash what was it
RDP underscore check py and then we
specify an IP address and here's here's
the thing we know that my computer
received an IP from the bash money as
where that 1073 dot no sorry 170 2.16
264 10 yeah it'll most likely be that
however there's actually a function in
the bunny helpers this is the coolest
thing
unlike the USB rubber ducky which has
like a static language yeah the bash
Bunny has the ability to get more and
more functionality as people contribute
to the repository and there's already a
few built in right now
awesome so the line available maybe a
get some more languages it's going to be
able to decipher exactly more commands
like LED and attack mode and all of
those like there could be potentially
many more so all I have to do to use
those is source this bunny helpers
script and now I can use all of that
extra functionality ok so one of them is
the ability to check hey what's the IP
address that the victim machine got from
the batch money so how do you source
that it's just like any other but I mean
it's bash so we're just going to before
we do this command will do source Bunny
underscore helpers dot SH and that's it
that's all we have to do it is done yeah
that's a little easier to read
now one sub two instead of doing the
actual you know IP address of the victim
I can actually just do dollar sign
target underscore IP right and so what
that's going to do is you know instead
of just spitting that outs with console
I'm going to actually redirect it to a
file called I don't know RDP underscore
check okay and then we'll just simply in
bash
doing its grep because we know grep is
going to allow us to look for a specific
word in a file little for the word
granted okay and in the file that i just
made plush TMP / RDP underscore check so
by looking for granted that's going to
tell you if it's turned on
yep and then if that's true so the then
statement this would being true and then
else would be not true mm-hmm and then
Phi is how you end an if statement so
basically if it is in there we'll just
set the led to green Oh kind if it isn't
there we'll just set the led to our okay
and and that good that's it
yeah so that's literally taking an if
statement which you learn with any any
program any programming really that
turns on the LED green if it's if the
RDP is on because I didn't read if it's
off it's not quite hello world that is
kind of a simple example yes based on
that condition you might but that could
be really useful Oh totally because if
it does have already P enabled now we
can kick off other stuff later on and we
can actually say like okay the light one
green RDP is on now it's blinking yellow
because it's now running another attack
or whatever have you with this work if a
computer like that one is a lot yeah
it's the same thing as we've shown with
like quick creds the same thing you
probably seen before with like poison
cred and stuff and they're poisoned top
it's the idea is like hey I'm a new
network adapter insane you know machines
really cool network adapters let's be
friends so can we demo it now yeah we're
ready yeah it's basically ready okay so
I've saved that file let me go ahead and
check and make sure it was that in there
yeah cool cool and I'll now safely eject
my batch bunny as you do and I'm not
going to house your door and I'll just
eject that that was in position one so
we'll plug it in like goes green and
booting green I should go can't leave
embed red see I told you guys no sugar
now it'll go purple when it's setting up
the other attack so that's purple or now
how well that comes off on the podcast
yeah you can okay so now it's it's doing
its thing and it just went to read
because it checked and guess what
RDP isn't running on this machine it's a
Linux
box right but we've got this locked
windows box over here I got it
not the login screen so go ahead and
just plug this guy in green green here
we go
put it over there you want me to hold it
yeah okay I don't want to drop your
computer over here all right so it's
done booting it's now purple ball just
like your hair oh my gosh it is just
like my hair I said oh my hair that
color lighter Hey look at that oh it's
green it's green it's green because RDP
is running on this machine okay so there
you go
awesome okay cool so you have done
exactly what they asked for and you have
made this thing like FBI agent foolproof
we love those guys ha ha ha ha ha yeah
it is only an FBI agent can use it
that's very cool
you can put the switch into a position
plug it in and look for if it's red or
green you can know which suspects
machine to toss in the evidence bag I
guess so
huh turtle anyway this shows the
potential next up we are going to talk
about submitting your payload through
the batch money library at the github
repository but first we should probably
take a quick break I'm going to take a
quick moment to thank our awesome
sponsor domain.com who has been
supporting hack 5 for years and it's
where Shannon and I go whenever we have
brilliant ideas I want to bring them to
the web because they have this super
awesome domain discovery service that
helps you find the right domain just for
you and with our quick and easy checkout
process your website's online in matters
of moment can you guys remember when it
took like twenty four hours to
synchronize DNS Wow
we are living in the future web sites in
moments I love it and get this the guys
over at domain.com huge fans of hack 5
they've been supporting us for years and
they have a coupon code just for us it's
hak5 and it saves you 20% all when you
check out over at domain.com and get
this send them a huge tweet say at
domain.com thanks so much for supporting
hack 5 throughout all these years when
you guys think domain names think
domain.com I wonder if the Nintendo
switches are DP enabled ok I have we
contestant I would love to test it one I
don't let a picture on Twitter I well I
really doubt it would have my
her soft remote desktop protocol running
on it but it is BSD under the hood
yeah so considering it's a unix-like
operating system there's a very good
chance it would have CDC ether drivers
Milton and there's a very good chance we
could like port scan and do all sorts of
other fun automated d'italia probably K
against it because like it's it's
connected like ATMs and other embedded
machines but just you're not expecting
to be able to just plug into a USB port
show up as a network adapter no no no
but yeah I doubt it's running Microsoft
Darby are you I hope it's not haha so
now that we have written a very nifty
payload if I may say so and we want to
share it with the world how do we
actually do this so with the USB rubber
ducky I would just I well I could paste
the code on the hack five forums or I
could put it on paceman and then link to
it in a tweet or I could put it on ducky
tool kit.com or I could put it on my
blog or I can make a YouTube okay yeah
that's kind of the exact problem yeah
and it ends up everywhere yes and that's
what we're trying to solve with bash
money because I feel like we've really
done a lot of learning as far as how to
you know curate awesome communities and
Chris yeah but that's a pain point that
I want to really solve with this one and
I feel like by just having a centralized
repository we're gonna spend more time
getting the job done in less time you
know looking around spending time trying
to track down try to google other
people's code yeah so and with that I
feel like you know it is almost like the
difference between proof of concept code
in 2004 from like some exploit site and
meta point where you're like a live
version the framework this is code that
works that's a good point so it is a
little bit more involved than just like
pacing on the forums and if that's all
you're coming with please at least do
that and share with community but on the
forums on the forums on that code forms
but otherwise if you head over to the
bash bunny wiki so bash bunny comm
you'll find the link to the wiki
there's links up here to the forums as
well as you know the ability to go ahead
and and find the payloads right so
there's forms and here the payload so
the payloads are all centrally located
in a git repository and it's actually
really simple to to contribute to this
because you
do all through your browser so you have
mentioned github a bunch I mean both of
us have and we are very familiar with it
on hack 5 we do a lot of demos of a lot
of really cool open source projects that
are hosted there but we've never
actually on the show uploaded something
to get how we both done it before but
we've never shown how to actually do it
so I think we should do a quick rundown
on git itself and how to do this it's
awesome stuff yeah it's ok so the kind
of crash course is it's version control
software app and if you know it's for
software development and it essentially
allows giant teams of developers to all
collaborate on one central project and
share code and and there's been so many
of these throughout the years I mean SVN
is an example but lately it has really
become kind of the go-to go figure it
was created by Linus Torvalds really
yeah back in o5y I didn't know that
that's awesome you know that guy right
oh my guess is great yeah you can use
little operating slam called Linux
hahaha so github is basically a it's
like a central web-based git repository
right yeah there's there's a bunch of
these get held in there only one that's
a web-based git repository
yeah even I'm on hack tip and they
aren't sponsoring hack 5 I should
mention by on hack tip I just got a new
sponsor bitbucket someone go and they do
get repositories as well for like team
collaboration and stuff so yeah there's
plenty of them not just github right and
you know get home pretty much they it is
just get but they add some of their own
special features and we like it you know
it works under the hood is basically get
yeah and you can just you know you can
clone the code just like you would any
other git repository you can pull up the
command line you can hit get clone
whatever like I can add I can I can head
over here and you know they make it easy
where I can just download a zip file of
the environment so they know about yeah
so if I do this I'm just going to get
basically all of the payloads and every
you know all the good stuff right or if
I want to get into it I can copy this
and I can you know throw it in my
terminal and I can do like a git clone
and paste that all of that jazz or we
just do it in the website what's so easy
so that brings up a good question like
we already know about git clone because
we've done it so many times but what
other
from terminology should I be looking for
as far as like a crash course in this if
you want you but so you're right we have
cloned a lot of repositories because
it's a lot of awesome open source stuff
and defeating it is easy so we've been
saying repository and reposes to just to
give you like a a quick crash course
those are just words that mean the place
where the code is hosted yeah
essentially and then you mentioned clone
basically cloning is making a copy of a
repository and it's doing it in such a
way there where we can actually keep it
updated which is pretty cool to think
that like as the community continues to
contribute to it if you clone this
repository onto your own computer you
can do like a get update command and
then you can kind of like synchronize it
you can kind of think of it like Dropbox
yeah
I always have the latest version so so
in that case you would be like syncing
up your own local copy right exactly
okay yeah that differs from forking
which is one of the other things you
should be familiar with where it's just
like cloning except that you can make
your own changes to your local copy okay
and then you can submit those changes
over to the main you know the original
repository everyone can enjoy your work
okay so I could fork the best bunny
payloads the repo and then add my own
copy and submit it back to the hack 5
version that's exactly what we're going
to be doing and got it so let's you want
it you want to see how to do that just
in the website yeah it's super simple
okay so let me go ahead and first sign
in and your password is Kirby it is it's
absolutely Kirby one two three so this
is just like another github account that
I created to show as an example so I'm
on the hack five github and I'm in the
bash Bunny's payload repository and what
I'm going to want to do is just go ahead
and fork this so I come over here and I
click pork side a picture of fork yeah
basically that's adorable
yes takes just a moment and now notice
the URL I'm I'm still in the batch
Bunny's payload repository but I'm not
in flash hack five I'm in flash I don't
know aardwolf 204 because I'm using my
hammer call today okay 204 isn't
important and basically
I can now you know add my payload to
this so remember it's in fact I think
class you know what I did I did that
thing you're not supposed to do and I
developed the payload on the actual bash
money so now I have to plug it back in
and arming mode so you even get that pay
load txt again that's funny yeah yeah
it's it's not best practice to code on
the device that you're gonna because I
have definitely done some like Wi-Fi
pineapple module development on the
pineapple and then when to do a demo of
flashing the firmware and then lost
everything
oh they're in the bad I know it's okay
the openvpn module was beautiful you
just never saw it so if I go over to
payloads I think it since which one is
this file right here yeah great it
doesn't have any comments it's just a
quick and dirty thing but this is just
an example what I'll do is I'm just
going to rename this isn't the way to do
it guys but I'm just going to as an
example show you I'm going to call this
check are to be enabled I don't know
terrible name for a payload but we'll
just use it as an example and on my copy
of this repository if I go into the
payloads folder and into the library
just say okay here's you know all of the
different payloads that we have
available okay I can just drag and drop
the payload over into my fork now come
down here and I'll give it a name I'll
say uh example payload that checks our
DP for fun and profit
and then I'll say submit changes okay so
now I'm making this commit to my own
repository okay and there we go if I go
to payload and library I see that my
check our DP enabled repository or sorry
payload is right here but you'll notice
that this is in the orbital to a fourth
my ash bunny payloads thing okay so so
you have published your payload but it's
only on your fork right right so how do
you get that over to the hack five one
ah
so this is where github does this really
cool thing called submitting a pull
request which is pretty cool it's
basically saying hey hack five I'll get
this awesome gold wanting to pull it
from me and grab delious very generally
and then everyone can enjoy it and we
will do just that okay got it
so let me head over here and basically
right under where says you know my
username and then bash many payloads
you'll see it says forked from let me
make that a little bigger fourth from
the original which is to hack five -
many payloads so if I come over here to
the hacksaw bash Bundy payloads I can
actually go ahead right from the top
there and let me make this a little
bigger so you can see I can go ahead and
click on through new pull request rate
right and then I just have to compare
the different fork so what I'm doing is
I'm comparing the hack five version two
in this case
come down here to my version and it says
hey yeah this is able to be merged
there's a we see there's a change here
so let's go ahead and you know then this
is my commit and we're going to go ahead
and make a pull request for this commit
and I can say like this is an awesome
payload okay truly awesome and leave it
spelled wrong and click create pull
request cool there we go so now it's
pretty much share to the world kind of
its clothes I basically five has to
approve it right yeah so there's a bunch
of different collaborators on that side
that are going to take a look at it and
what's really cool is now it creates
like a thread in the discussion so
everything is like very sane we can say
somebody could look at this and be like
yet it's really awesome but like awesome
but you spelled awesome wrong I know if
you ever have if you wanted if a hack
five wanted to come back and like make
some kind of edit or change to it or
tell them like include a readme or
whatever it might be
exactly including a review is important
so when you do that would they would art
will have to send in a new pull request
yeah you just get like a notification
like a still pending and you know make
these tweaks and then there you go and
that that way we would get high quality
stuff it's always in one place everybody
can like you know have a synchronized
copy of all of those bad payloads yeah
it's exciting so all we need to do now
because that's awesome I like that it's
so easy
I need a github account and then I can
send a pull request to the hack side -
bunny repo right from my browser is
there anything else that I should know
about this just the readme thing like
and I just feel like that's kind of
me saying like it's good to document
your code I did not document any of that
in fact actually I'm using this as an
example but if we actually come over
here we'll see that from this repository
did this the other day under payloads
library I actually called it our DB
checker and I added this little readme
MD file and you can see it's nice and
pretty it's like it was about the
versions in their class and they you
know the status of the led in this
pretty little table this is just a text
file it's called readme MD for markup
language and it's really simple if I hit
edit you'll see the syntax is stupid
simple like that that table is just an
ASCII table that's claw and you know
those headings are just like downtown
whatever so it just just wanted to point
out that it's probably best to kind of
continue with that theme just so that
yeah everybody can enjoy your payload
and know what it's going to do I also do
want to mention with github - I don't
think I mentioned it previously but
github does have two-factor
authentication so when you sign up with
an account on there make sure to set up
2fa and you can also combine it with
your key base your public key so you can
you can pair your account with github
with your account on key base to add
that additional I guess authentication
that you really are who you are so I
thought that was pretty cool and you
know you might want to include it on
your key base again that's good stuff
you know and the other fun things that
have been doing I love key bows could
check out the episode on that that is
the key this is all about like tying
together all your different like social
community profiles and stuff one of the
things that I've been doing with my
payloads is to add in a link to the
discussion thread that is specific to
the actual thingy thing you hear so
things that say anything you so that you
can head over to that platforms and see
like oh hey this is the discussion
related to that and that way we can
garner feedback and speaking of feedback
you can leave that right below feedback
a hack five or even emails directly
otherwise in degree just excited to see
how this project is just like I think
we're setting up with the right tone
having a solid foundation that we can
build something that's just going to be
wonderful for everyone and it's based on
everyone's feedback that we've developed
such a thing that's awesome yeah I love
it - great job again with
money I think you put a lot of heart and
soul into this collaboration so I love
it having a lot of fun with it because
they're doing an awesome job and of
