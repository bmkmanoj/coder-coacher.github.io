time on hack 5 hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen hello and my
name is Shannon Morris I can't I can't
do it the other way right now we're
gonna go with that
welcome to the show welcome everybody
this is our last episode from der beek
on so we got six interviews tell me are
we going back I really like Tudor
because I was here oh then this is on
our last step so this is the last one
from Der Beek on 6.0 this this time we
are interviewing Nick Kanno about
hacking video games which I personally
thought was really cool cuz I don't know
if you guys remember but back in the day
I hacked a Nintendo Wii I think it was
no no see I'm thinking audiosurf you
know you know so it's one horrible I was
so nervous Shannon's first second
terrible so we are interviewing him and
then we're also talking to gene
Bransfield about the dopes go oh this is
so much fun I love this thing there's
something really intuitive about it
you'll have to see it's it's really cool
it's very very cool so we will see you
on the other side hey everyone Shannon
Morse here from der beek on 6.0
recharged
we are back in Louisville Kentucky or
should I say Louisville is that how they
say Louisville Louisville I I think
that's how they say it I'm not sure I'm
here with Nick can oh he actually gave a
talk here at Derby cons sounded really
really interesting so I wanted to get
you on the show
hacking video games I mean who doesn't
like to hack video games why don't you
say well first of all thanks for having
me but I think there are people who
don't like to hack video games but it's
not because they don't like to they just
don't know they do yet like it's it's
very fun to me because you get to take
reverse engineering skills and coding
skills and apply them to games which are
literally the funnest thing in the world
you know so I think everyone who's
watching this and doesn't think they
like hacking games should try it and
it'll probably change their minds so
I've actually hacked a couple of video
games in my lifetime I hacked a Nintendo
Wii and I think it was Legend of Zelda's
which Twilight Prince no Ocarina of Time
one of those I don't remember which one
but what exactly did you do in this case
because that's kind of a wide variety of
what you could do so what we did it was
actually a team of people and our
project was there are open-source
servers for the game we were working on
and we wanted to create our own server
and we wanted our server to be a mirror
image of the official servers made by
the official game company but although
none of that data is available all of
the like the map data the monster data
you only see that when you're at those
locations in the game you only see parts
of the map when you go there in the game
you only see certain monsters when
you're fighting them so we said we could
do this all by hand because we all know
the game very well we could meticulously
map everything out by hand but let's not
do that we're all programmers take
forever yeah it would take forever so we
kind of got in the spirit of
crowdsourcing without everyone knowing
that we're using their stuff because
there is for this game called tibia
there's a service called tibia cast made
by a third party and it's kind of like
twitch TV but in a sense that it replays
the game packets to game clients and
then the game client renders the game
over again so let's say you're playing
the game it records your entire packet
trace it records your entire packet
trace and then it replays that to my
game client and my game client thinks
I'm you and it shows me everything
you're doing so this service has a large
archive of all the all the plays that
everyone has ever done on it so we're
talking millions and millions of
sessions of people playing the game so
what we did is we pulled down all that
data we wrote a program that acted like
the game client and then the tibia cache
service plugged into that thinking it
was a game client and started replaying
the package to that we sped it up in
time because the game client can't
handle of things going on super fast but
an arbitrary parser that we control can
so we speed up tibia cast and we made it
replay the packets to us at maximum
speed and now we had tens of thousands
maybe even a hundred thousand players
that were broadcasting their sessions
now feeding their data into our
algorithms that then turned it into a
map that we could feed to our server
so you're you're mirroring the actual
videogame into your own thing could the
server's tell any difference between the
two so it's an open-source server so
it's actually people who went in they
reverse engineered the protocol back in
2001 a long time ago and it's been
actively developed ever since then so
they have their own formats for
everything so part of what our tool did
was take the game packets and translate
them into a format that's readable by
that server and it wasn't just the map
it was like the NPC dialogues what
different monsters look like where
different monsters spawn basically ever
everything we could do then like we
can't do quests we can't do complex
interactions but everything that was
repeatable we we did like that so what
programming skills was somebody need to
be able to do this kind of thing so we
used a lot of core hacking skills so
there was a kind of memory forensics
going on where we had to replace data in
the client such as encryption keys in
order to man in the middle connections
so we had to like replace encryption
keys and we had to replace domain names
and stuff in order to man in the middle
of the connections and capture packets
there's a lot of programming involved so
the algorithms to piece stuff together
we had to there was some like big data
type stuff so for like monsters that
spawn and different they spawn in
different ways and when a player
encounters them they're not going to be
in the same location every time and
there's multiple monsters with the same
name that might spawn in a location they
might be dead because someone else might
have killed them and we're looking at
them over dozens or hundreds of
instances so we had to kind of cluster
them together do use pattern matching to
match different clusters of monsters and
decide how many we had to spawn at
certain locations and stuff like that so
what's your intentions for this project
in the future are you planning to like
release it into the world obviously it's
open source so I guess you could so this
was the project was actually mainly done
by a few friends of mine I'm talking
about it because I want to share their
work but really I want to give a
shout-out to Caboclos or blow over
Joseph bink bink am nico Kooning I think
that's how you say his name he's a
German guy
Samuel Graz and Joshua Kelly these are
the guys who came up with the project
and stuff I helped because I write a bot
for this game and I'm kind of
subject-matter expert so I help them
where they needed help and I know the
project well but they started it and
their intention was they just wanted to
run a one-to-one server they wanted to
run a server that looks like the real
game and I mean they just because they
could yeah just because they could you
you can monetize it but there was no
real money made on it we shut it down
for now until we decide what we want to
do with it we might we might release it
but it was it was a lot of work to do
but some of the tools are open-source so
for instance sharp map tracker is a
thing we use to capture the map packets
and turn them into the map so we wired
that up to work with tibia caste it was
for an old version of the game it's
written by a guy called Ian Ober Miller
he used to work at Microsoft now he's at
Facebook so he wrote this back in like
2008 or 2009 maybe and one of our guys
wired it up to talk to tibia cast
without a client and do more parsing and
then so we could plug that into our
algorithms so that's open source and I
can send you links and then the whole
game server is open source to a couple
hundred thousand lines of C++ so yeah if
you want to learn how to make game
servers and learn architecture we'll
have a link for that too
sounds like you need to know a little
bit of C++ to be able to hack your own
games together what did she say yeah you
need to know a lot of C++ it's like the
de-facto language and if anyone wants to
just learn game hacking in general not
specifically about game servers and
stuff I do have a book through no starch
press called game hacking developing
autonomous box for online games and if
you know programming you've got to know
a little bit of programming going in
like if you know C++ it's good enough
and it will teach you everything from
what data looks like at the low-level
low-level data structures different
tools and then we'll teach you about
hooking reverse engineering and then
it'll go into all the algorithms you
need to make different hacks there's so
much in there that I don't know yet and
I seriously feel like I need to get my
learn on Nick is there anything else you
would like to share this with us Anna
where can people find more information
online do you guys have like an article
available or anything like that so for
finding more information online the
Derby con slides will be on my github I
can give you a link for that and then
that will also have the links to the
source code that we do have available
and if you want to find other stuff
about hacking games just google it
there's four
online and people have done a lot more
crazy stuff than this I'm just one of
the few who's lucky enough to come to a
conference and talk about it so googling
game hacking going on to like em PGH or
unknown cheats or even like their sub
reddits for it you can find a lot of
cool information and where can people
find you people can find me on Twitter
at Nick Cannon 93 you can find me at
cons I'll typically either be talking or
at the no starch booth signing my book
you can find my book at no starch calm
or Amazon thank you so much Nick that
was really awesome and now I kind of
want to get my hack on with some video
games I need to bring it back to those
Nintendo Wii days you guys remember it's
good times Thank You Nick it's pleasure
to talk to you here at Derby come to
find out all about the white pie hacks
I'm here with Jean from we're coloring
to show you what Jean thanks for thanks
for coming on thank you very much for
having me so tell me about war collar
industries because I'm like wait that's
that guy from that DEFCON talk right yes
yes about DEFCON 22 I gave a talk
weaponizing your pets the war kitteh and
the denial of service dog it was very
popular it exploded and people said hey
you need to make this stuff and I'll buy
60 of them so I incorporated his war
collar industries shortly thereafter the
company I was working for for eight
years before that they sold and they got
consumed by a corporation and so I was
able to branch out on my own and
incorporate cyber security consulting
underneath the war collar brand as well
but we're our main passion is to do
Internet of Things development oh cool I
love the serendipity of those things
before we get the IOT stuff tell me
about the the initial talk and like the
inspiration that led to the formation of
war color absolutely so my initial talk
was while I was working for my former
company I was often asked to do lots of
presentations on security and I'd look
out in the crowd and I'd see people
glare eyes glazing over and so I'd had
to do something to get their attention
and so 15% of the world's Internet
traffic is in some way dedicated to cats
unverified statistic and so I started
incorporating cats and pictures of cats
and stories about cats into my
presentations and people were much more
receptive to that and so I got my point
across to a wider wide audience that
wasn't really familiar with information
security you're exploiting an inherent
flaw vulner
in fact in the the source code of the
humans that the affinity to the cat yes
that and I was just trying to keep their
attention so somebody can't walked up to
me and said they're going to give me
this wife I caught this collar that they
won at a raffle and it was a cat collar
and it had a GPS chip in it and a
cellular component and you could send an
SMS to the cat collar and it would
return to an SMS to you with the
geolocation of your cat and me being the
guy I have aside well now all I need is
some Wi-Fi and I got some more kitty so
so that's what started the talk and I
went down that road and I finally was
able to do it and it was very well
received and so that's what started the
whole thing so I named the company war
collar after that cute and so what kind
of projects have you been getting into
since then so since then I've been
expanding on the war cuute thing I
figured if it would fit in a cat collar
would fit in it fit on any human being
on the face of planet it will fit in a
hat and I've got some components in my
hat right now I can do Wi-Fi war
scanning as a pardon me Wi-Fi scanning
as I walk down the street and and we
also got various other products that we
have so we have the Wi-Fi dope scope and
what that was was we were trying to
smoke on this year we were trying to
raise awareness of our brand and what
we're trying to do so we came up with a
Fox and Hound competition and we had a
Raspberry Pi station that was the SSID
that everybody was looking for that's
the Fox and we came up with some scopes
that we handed to five hounds and their
job was to find the Fox and scopes had a
directional antenna in there and they
would be able to water around shmoocon
and actually find the Fox and
specifically the Foxes SSID when the
scopes got close enough to it and the
signal strength was appropriate then the
then the scopes would log in to the SSID
and present a password to the user the
user at that point had to find the guy
with a war collar logo on their person
they weren't always wearing it was just
somewhere on their person and tell them
what the passphrase was and that's how
they won the contest in 150 bucks and we
had people coming back to our table hi
Odie was nice enough she said we can set
up in the shmoocon like lounge because I
was too late and getting the sponsorship
stuff and and people would come to the
table and they're like what's that it's
like hi We're war caller we're doing
this blah blah
what's that this this is our dope scoop
this is our marketing scheme ously I
want that I want to buy that well you
know that's just our market is shut up I
want that
how much and we're like I don't we
hadn't thought of it how much did it
cost to make and we told them and they
say I'll give you twice that and we're
like okay show back up after the con and
we'll be happy to present you with one
and so we're like is that real and so we
went to b-sides Baltimore and we had a
bunch of them with us and said okay hey
we're selling these things and they sold
out like that and we found out later
that we were supposed to be selling
anything at those cons and we're like
totally apologize to the b-sides
baltimore crew and we gave a full
apologies that didn't know but they sold
out so we're like okay let's bring them
to Derby and see what happens and
they've been selling very very well here
in fact we've sold out our entire stock
and we're doing back orders right now
what would you say the number one allure
is to the dopes cope it's very user
friendly it's very easy to pop it up at
your eye and you can look around and see
what all the Wi-Fi access points and
it's got a directional antenna inside of
it and to get this big ball of you know
water behind it so it attenuates any
signal from the back and it projects
energy that way so it's very good at
directional finding and the way you you
could find all kinds of rode rogue Wi-Fi
access points with this little scope the
only alternative there eaten out right
now besides that is like a laptop with
the yagi antenna and the scope is
drastically drastically less expensive
than that not to mention the fact it's
got an esp8266 chip inside it's got the
chip antenna on there and we've extended
the ports out and we've given a
programmable interface on the side such
that people can reprogram the chip to do
anything at once and attach the ports
they can add new hardware and there's
plenty of documentation online about
this chip so people can download code
and flash it onto the device and they'd
be good to go it's a very open-source
product that the the 80 to 66 is is like
basically hackers wet dream it's an
amazing little tiny chip what's you've
been your experience with that
development with it the experience with
the development has been very easy I
mean that you can it takes a little bit
to get your head around it if you
haven't coated stuff before but right
now you can flash a
looook ode to it you can use Python with
it and we've got all kinds of user
experience stuff we got we're gonna have
a forum up where users can come and
donate their code and download code from
so it'd be very easy to get hooked up
with it and learn how to use it and what
kind of beam with are you getting with
it I don't know - the answer to that
question we've never actually gone out
and measured things like that but
suffice to say that it's very easy to
find a specific Wi-Fi access point if
you're using the scope and then what
about client devices I'm sorry
client devices I don't know what you
mean by that well as in as in the actual
the stations rather than the base
stations the the tablets and phones and
laptops for your like if might might
pull my phone up there it's gonna say
jeans iPhone right and yeah so we can
reprogram them to do that we haven't in
our base flash it comes out there it's
just doing Wi-Fi scanning but some of
the projects that people have mentioned
there's is looking for hidden Wi-Fi
access points looking for specific
phones that are just probing out there
for other stuff it's certainly capable
of doing all that we have not provided
the code to do that but I'm sure
something's gonna be up there on the
website very shortly that's really cool
so do you have like a github on this is
there a place where somebody can go and
like get involved in this yes forums or
caller.com is where we're going to be
hosting that awesome and where can
people find a job scope from themselves
so you can pick one up at Derby con
we're going to have a bunch of amateur
move we're going to be selling them on
the website shortly okay and what's the
website
ww-what caller com all right well hey
Jean thank you so much it's really been
a pleasure I can't wait to see the
evolution of this I love the you know 3d
printed kind of nature of it is a 3d
printed or not so we started out with 3d
printing but 3d printing doesn't scale
very well when you're trying to do a
bunch of them so that we went it to
silicon injection molding and we learned
that if you do something really small on
a 3d printer when you try to pop it out
of the silicon mold it tends to break so
we're learning all kinds of interesting
things about this it's just awesome to
see like them the maker element of it
and it's really cool because it's so
intuitive it's like it's it's like that
viewfinder that I used as a kid to look
at pictures of Mickey Mouse you had one
- oh shut up yes I did I definitely did
and I didn't know when you said that
it's like wow we could do stuff with
Mickey Mouse chasing the thing around
yeah that'd be great so much good stuff
cool
well I I can't wait to see how this
evolves thanks for coming on crazy and
cool ideas like letting your editors put
epic dance videos in at the end of
episodes without you knowing deserve
domain names and when we need domain
names we head over to domain calm
because they have an epic a main
discovery system helps you find the
perfect to make just for you and then it
lets you bring it online and just
moments your website will beep and
running and no time flat that's what we
do seriously like we do that all the
time and it's just like by the way they
have a 20% off discount code it's hak5
that supposed hack 5 and you can use
that at checkout when you head over to
domain calm and you know what else you
can do you can tweet at domain.com and
say guys why why are you crazy enough to
sponsor hack 5 we love you for doing
that tweet them and say seriously guys
domain.com it's awesome check it out
when you think domain names think
domain.com well that just about wraps up
this week's episode of hack 5 but before
we get going I'm very excited because we
have Technology Oto's don't we Oh
holy sh Anna yes we do actually there
were a lot this week it was really
really hard to choose one so I might she
is one of the other ones next week is
that cheating it's cheating so as long
as you contribute a photo to a
technology for the week to any of our
social networks that can be Facebook
Instagram or Twitter all you have to do
is use the hashtag hack 5 and we will
see it so you don't even have to act
reply us or anything like that but this
week I chose eel keV ill keV oke Oke I
don't know how to say your name but I
love your photo he said building robot
spider for school project was my first
time soldering was a blast thing to tear
drone videos at hack 5 and this is his
spider oh so cool and it looks like it's
running a Raspberry Pi with a little
screen a shield on there and that thing
is huge
Wow I would freak out if I saw that
that's like she's afraid of spiders yeah
it's not a big fan at all like one thing
I'm afraid of freaking spiders man hmm
including mechanical ones I don't know
it's creepy that is awesome but so cool
I thought he deserved
ADEs it needs a Wi-Fi pineapple touch
whoa what's hats rad son of a Wi-Fi
that's right cool yeah so we're gonna
send you a Wi-Fi pineapple tetra I'll
get in contact with you over direct
messaging and and you guys can always
send in your photos hashtag hack five at
any time it doesn't have to be during
the same week as an episode so you can
just send it whenever you want and we
were gonna search through and find our
favorites yes and if you want to just
grab yourself some awesome hack five
hacking gear over at our very own a che
k shop comm that's the hack shop and
that supports us directly and we really
appreciate everybody who has for the
longest time kept us going so thank you
yes thank you to everybody who
contributes and helps us with everything
that we do here yeah you can actually
find out all of the other things that we
are doing as of late you just go over to
the homepage hak5 org at the top we're
gonna have the latest workshops and
other events that we're doing as well as
all of the social media links to find us
online absolutely I think that's about
it you can always email us feedback at
hak5 org that's it yes and we are out
with that i'm darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
trust your technical s oh wow that was
amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
