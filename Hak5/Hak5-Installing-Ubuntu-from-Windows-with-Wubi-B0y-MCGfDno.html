by netflix interested in ubuntu but you
don't want to commit to partitioning
your drive or turning your pc into a
linux machine quite yet there is a
really easy way to run it alongside
windows and still get the full OS for
both of them Ruby aka windows-based
Ubuntu installer is an official
windows-based free software installer
for Ubu to Louise goal is to assist a
Windows user who isn't too knowledgeable
in Linux in trying ubuntu without
risking any loss of information due to
disk formatting or partitioning what we
can also uninstall a boon to from within
windows kind of like an application or a
program that you would normally install
in that OS now you may be thinking that
sounds kind of like a virtual machine
inside windows but it's not will be
creates a disk image that can run
directly from the hardware no virtual
machine needed it adds a new entry to
the boot menu so a user has the option
to run linux ubuntu or windows in this
way it's a little bit different from my
usual portable apps because you won't be
using grub to boot on to the linux
distro 12 but it'll still be installed
on the actual windows file system and
linux is going to think that it's a real
hard disk giving you the option of boot
from it it does sound very epic win and
like super easy but there are some
limitations first off hibernation isn't
supported and second of all hard reboots
can happen also if you get a blue screen
of death and windows you do have to
reboot windows and then shut it off and
then boot your computer again to access
the linux distro as ubuntu won't be able
to mount the drive successfully until
your machine has cleanly rebooted very
important process their performance is
going to be a little bit slower than a
normal boon to install but not by much
so it's not really something you need to
worry about that much this is because
you're going through the windows file
system to access the abou to distro
instead of just booting directly off of
Abu tube I also wanted to mention that
you can have booby on a USB Drive there
are a couple of other versions of it too
there's Looby for linux and movie for
mac which is still in the works but yeah
maybe a Paul will get some use out of
that one if all this sounds really weird
to you I'm going to do a little bit of a
step by step of how Ruby works and what
it looks like to dual boot from Ubuntu
using this program okay so let's go
ahead and get started on installing
ubuntu so first off you need to go over
to the Ubuntu website and go to the
windows installer page under download
under one she's start download this is
the Ubuntu installer for windows Ruby
exe so I'll click on that and click run
of course ok you're about to install
ubuntu 11.04 please like username and
password for the new account so I'm
going to be snubs because that's some
easy password so after you choose your
username and pass where you're going to
have to choose your installation drive
see is my default one installation size
the default is 17 gigs so I'm going to
go ahead and stick with that too that's
like how much room that you want to
actually make for your linux box the
desktop environment you do get a couple
choices in here you can choose Ubuntu
which is 1 i'm going to go with ubuntu
netbook kubuntu which is cool because
it's KDE of course there's ubuntu and
mythbuntu i'm going to stick with ubuntu
of course english and choose install
okay once the progress bar is finally
complete it took my computer like 10-15
minutes to actually install everything
it'll ask me if I want to reboot later
or reboot now I'm going to go ahead and
reboot now so we can see what happens
yay okay so now that i have ubuntu
installed i have the choice to go into
windows 7 or ubuntu so i'm going to
choose ubuntu and now it's going to
complete the installation I think it's
working
you
all right login as snubz yay i have a
boon to i'm kind of excited right now oh
look it's pretty look at all the neat
things i can do snugs chat accounts okay
so this is unity all right well I think
I'll spend some time playing around with
unity and see if I actually like it i
mean it is pretty the icons are huge
they're like grandma I icons but it
looks nice and it seems that ubuntu
installed correctly so ruby from using
movie i can tell that this is a really
really good way for someone to actually
get their feet wet in the world of
ubuntu without having to actually fully
install it it does make it super easy to
get into linux and it feels like an
actual install well it was an actual
install especially when you get the
option to boot windows or ubuntu on the
boot up screen that's like really cool I
feel like it totally went through the
whole dual dual boot process it's kind
of pretty it makes it feel like you've
installed ubuntu completely separate
from windows even though from its
limitations you know that that's not
actually the case but you don't really
have to tell anybody that right yeah i
think this is really good tool for
beginners or just to make life easier
