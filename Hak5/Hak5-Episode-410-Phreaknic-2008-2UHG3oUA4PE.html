go daddy.com Netflix calm and
sharpshootin snubz now with less recoil
after hearing all the crazy stories
about freaknic it was time to make a
hack five road trip and see what it's
all about we had fun we made a few new
friends and we're thankful the cameras
weren't around to the parties for the
most part so in hak5 tradition we bring
you a sampling if you will of this
year's freaknic starting with an
incident response switchblade and some
software defined radio check it out so
Russell tell me about this you three
Incident Response tool okay well
basically when how came up the idea was
I was working for a company that had a
lot of remote sites and there were
places I couldn't get to easily so I had
I had these Incident Response standards
I had to meet from the parent company I
had have something that was easy for
like the guys on remote sites to use if
there was a problem crap we're on a
machine whatever so I develop ish I saw
the hak5 switch blade perfect and its
really great if only it were white hat
yeah yeah exactly you know and you know
what else can I do with this the
delivery mechanism was really infuse a
you know USB response or a USB device so
I decided to write a simple batch file
sauce commands what are the things i
would do if i was sitting on a machine
and i thought of in home right you know
just go through you know there are
tables look at the you know IP
configuration machine what kind of
process running machine and that's kind
of how i came up with it and like any
good hacker it's just taking the stuff
that you normally do and then just
automating it to make your job easier
exactly yeah we do there's a system
administration tool you know so what
kind of stuff does it do basically it
runs through a grub sub basically what
four sets of information from the
machine it grabs like the network status
like Windows Firewall what ports are
open windows firewall is the service
running like exceptions that kind of
thing it grabs IP configuration the DNS
cache our tables has obtained a
man-in-the-middle my guy with pineapple
um you know the routing table off the
machine that's the first set of
information network information the
second set is it actually grabs
information about the local user
machine you know so you can look at me
new user accounts been created in a
nation takes a show you using some tools
from sysinternals which one are you guys
talk about good stout up quite a bit and
one of the things I actually hit him I
talk was I like using tools that are
from Microsoft don't sysinternals now
and that way before antivirus picking it
up right you know kind of had that
problem with the lightest with it
exactly exactly so you know I use a PS
logged on people just real simple
command-line tool dumps all the users on
the machine that blocked on what time
they logged on the third set information
it gives is actually go through to
calculate via in device patches of the
1si windows directory see windows system
see one of those 32 so so you just
compare that against right image they
have the too many of these things you
can be fined by using yes or you can
also get it from microsoft tech okay so
it's not that the entire directory it's
every file in the directory so then you
can go back today yes you know yours
rootkit your ini or whatever has been
modified some correct yeah so somebody
might have rootkit when you're that's
where all your you know windows just mix
cute I explore everything little so yeah
there's somebody root get it you know
you're going to do i find it beautiful
that we've got to use tools from
microsoft so that it doesn't get picked
up by antivirus because we're checking a
machine that had supposedly been owned
right obviously yeah it's said that it's
to Cuba with the antivirus at of course
yeah you know and one things I also hit
on my talk was in my job I have to go
around to different job sites places
maybe I've never been before so I can't
create exceptions for these tools you
know something else need to kind of keep
it vendor neutral you know or whatever
so um and that's all I like he's lucky
man like fools gustos already own
machine alright that mean so you don't
even have to you know be the one
actually doing this right nice to you
pop it in it runs and if it it's an
incident it's like a first responder in
an incident it's not going to do your
whole investigation or I don't feel like
an automated tool is going to be as
smart as a human analyzing information
making this
so but just to get an idea of at what
level you need to investigate it right
yeah right you know what what kind
things are happening on the machine you
know do I need closed pores in the bar
will serve IP addresses that kind of and
since it's just a physical object all
you have to do is plug it in and went
like 30 seconds later right he writes
all the information to uh what's
location of your choosing based on where
it looks for it dummy file you 3i are
that it's and there's BB script launches
and what you don't actually go right
like any of the you know anything I'm
jeans you don't worry about over i
deleted files things like that so easy
an mts you could do it exactly awesome I
have an mcse solo oh come on yeah it
comes as a territory so um Microsoft
server but solitaire there you go yeah
that's a new one for me so um are you
gonna have these tools available and you
have like right now I actually missed
that in my talk I've got all the stuff I
want but on a website just writing stuff
I don't have it right now no I'm happy
somebody must email me of course you
have a horrible last name throw it on
the box or great right awesome and and
we can hit you we can also hit you up on
the heck platforms absolutely yeah
what's your using in there is GCS tool
TCS feel awesome a Russell it was great
talking to you thanks for sharing that
with us I appreciate you know on a
little show so Dan I show your talk
about software defined radio and I was
hoping you could kind of tell us to some
of our viewers about what software
defined radio really is well
software-defined radio is kind of a new
way of looking at radio it takes a large
section of radio spectrum and you can
import it into a computer the whole
thing and then look at it on individual
on an individual basis so you could you
could take the entire FM broadcast
spectrum and then look at each each of
radio broadcast simultaneously so that
that that's a lot of dated obviously
you're going to need something pretty
specialized to be able to do that what's
the sort of software and hardware
requirements that we would have to do
something as crazy as listen to every
radio station at once essentially well a
one thing you need
as a computer and general just a regular
PC computer will fill that the other
thing you need is a piece of acquisition
hardware like some sort of data
acquisition card those can be very
expensive but a less expensive option is
the universal software radio or
peripheral and that's what that's what
i'm using it's a kind of goes along with
the new radio and things like that and
they work together and to get that data
into the computer so this is a
specialized hardware that's designed
specifically to be listening to all
those frequencies rather than like you
can get a US game radio ad you know
tuner premium puter but that's not
really the same thing is this no co a
radio tuner is going to listen to one FM
broadcast station and then it's going to
bring the audio in to your computer what
this is doing is actually bringing in
the radio signal data into your computer
for processing so you're doing more
inside of the computer and so it's more
flexible so you've got a piece of one
example of that hard work here you want
to tell me a little bit about that yeah
well what God is is a universal software
rated peripheral device and it's a it
comes with a motherboard and then you
buy daughter cards to talk to different
parts of the radio spectrum I for
example I have a basic receiver board
and that works up to about 30 mega hertz
so which is all the am band and some ham
radio bands and things like that another
one I have is a TV radio receiver and
that can tune in anything from about 80
megahertz to 800 megahertz which
includes everything including TV FM
radio and a lot of different other
things so it sounds like the way that
it's built is very modular you've got a
motherboard and then different daughter
cards that do different frequencies so
are there other daughter boards for like
cellphones or their daughter boards for
the cousin were you know there's more
than just a there's tons of spectrum I
mean right yeah absolutely uh there's a
website Eddie's calm and this guy he
sells a lot of these different boards
four different parts of the spectrum
resells one for 2.4 14
some of the cell your cellular bands are
900 megahertz 800 megahertz and then
just kind of up and down from there okay
so you use this piece of hardware to
bring it into your computer but how are
you going to deal with all this data
what kind of software are we going to
need to listen to all these stations
well that's what you use good new radio
for and that's an open source project
you can you can download for free and
it's basically just kind of a processing
a signal processing framework that you
you write these simple pipe up Python
programs and you kind of connect to the
blocks together and you come in raw data
and hopefully what you get out is either
some some kind of digital information or
audio information or something like that
so you use this to tune into radio
frequencies or you can use this to
retrieve like data over over the
airwaves or video all of that ok so
there's just like different codecs and
stuff that are yeah just different
different D modulation schemes are
different blocks in new radio ok so that
must be a lot of data that's going to be
pretty taxing on the bus what are the
kind of considerations we need to keep
in mind there well USB which is the u.s.
RP is a USB to device so it's limited to
something under 480 megabit now it does
a lot of down conversion on board so say
you're looking at a piece of spectrum
that's 30 megahertz why well on board
you can select what exactly you want to
look at and only take what you can fit
over that USB channel into Guinea radio
so if I knew say like I were somewhere
where I suspect that there's a device
proprietary device operating on 27
megahertz I could tune it to that and
then do kind of like the equivalent of
Wireshark just packet sniffing but for
the radio right exactly and you could
you can do even better than that if you
think it's somewhere around 27 megahertz
you said I think so put some targets and
start sniffing well you can you can look
at that band and then you can say well I
think it's
it's here because you see a big peak on
your on your spectrum that you're
receiving and then you start to kind of
focus down on it and look at it so yeah
yeah so it sounds like you can do a lot
of fun stuff with this other than just
listening we were talking about
transmission boards sounds like there's
a lot of hardware involved if somebody
wants to get into this today and just
start experimenting and seeing what's in
the air beyond what they can just tune
to in their am/fm radio or their AM
radio where should they go what kind of
stuff should they be anticipating to
build or buy well the new radio org is a
good place to start it's it's kind of a
meeting place for all the information
it's a wiki and all that stuff is there
as for the hardware NS com Attis
research he builds the u.s. RP and that
is actually kind of expensive it's a bit
a little bit prohibitive I think the
base cost of it is about seven hundred
dollars and then cards are 100 start
start around one hundred dollars apiece
for the daughter cards um it's a really
great thing if you're like a ham radio
experimenter or you just want your just
really interested in and want to try
things out it's a little bit of an
investment but I feel like it's really a
while it could be a lot of fun
especially when it comes to open
spectrums like you know 25 27 megahertz
and then proprietary protocols
proprietary communication so you know
rather than just sniffing your 80 to
that 11 traffic with our Wi-Fi radios
you doing something a little bit more
vendor specific so i find the value
there at least i have some crazy ideas
think around my head anyway i want to
say thank you so much again for speaking
to us i appreciate you giving us some of
your time thank you let's take a moment
to thank one of our fabulous sponsors
godaddy.com godaddy has it all calmed
ohne names for as low as 1 99 plus
world-class web hosting fast and easy
website builders and much more plus as a
fan of hak5 you'll get five dollars off
any order of thirty dollars or more when
you check out with the coupon code hack
to now let's check in with 80 of dual
core and droops of hacker media so
a lot of your music with dual core on
the torque line episode of act 5 and a
lot of people been asking about you and
I was hoping that maybe you could give
us an idea of like the story about the
war came together sure I used to
freestyle when I was in college and I
basically was it not a con 3 in
Cleveland Ohio and I was at the sperm
party and they had a PA system going and
all of a sudden somebody comes over the
PA and they're like we've got somebody
from Cincinnati here that can freestyle
I don't like cool who else from here you
know who else from Cincinnati can
freestyle I'm expecting to me some new
people and they're like they come and
grab me and they're like come on man
come on and I was like oh hey so being
one of my friends justice admin me and
Remy were we're just freestyling were
have fun and I had met this producer
online on an underground hip hop forum
and which turned out bc 64 and he said
hey I want to do an album with you and I
said cool this is what I want to do is
what I do every day nerdy stuff less
let's make an album about nerdy stuff
and he said hey I know you're a good
rapper let's do it and I was that was
the story of dual core so would you
define your style its nerdcore yeah i
think so and I mean really whatever
people want to call it is fine because
to me that's just a label right so we
all did Shakespeare in high school you
know I roses a rose etc if somebody
wants to call it something different
that's fine I think it's nerdcore but
whatever everybody else interprets is
that is fine well how do you think
nerdcore relates to hacker culture I
think it's pretty deeply intertwined in
most cases a lot of nerdcore artists
that I hear have pretty strong technical
ties you know they reference nerdy stuff
that's computer related so I think
there's a good thai to hacker culture
you know hacker culture is just finding
new ways to do different things or
finding new applications for different
stuff that's already been invented and
so I think that's really what a lot of
nerdcore is and I think therefore those
are very concentrated tie or a very
strong tie to it so
so this is my third time seeing you in
the last 30 days yeah I used to be on
every conference are you on tour what's
going on I don't know I you know I
really don't have a strong definition
for tour I'm a normal guy you know I go
to work Monday through Friday 85 and I
do regular security stuff but I guess if
you wanted to consider it or you could
we just just play a lot of hacker
conferences and you know it's it's
awesome that people like our music and
I'm just here having fun time
appreciative 11 so what's on what's on
the horizon you've got three albums out
now what's an extra dual core hard to
say we're working on our fourth album
but we want to do something that's
different so we definitely want to
release a fourth album that has a lot of
good audio material but we want to add
something extra and we're not sure what
that is so we're thinking like a DVD on
top of the audio album or we're still in
the planning stages back please we do
you have ideas we're going to hit you up
email us dual core music at gmail com
you guys are all over myspace and all
socials yep myspace.com / tool for music
flickr.com / tool for music youtube.com
/ dual core dual core music down below
yeah you know we're very consistent for
sweet so maybe you could do some little
so you freestyle just an act I freestyle
movie sure yeah sure i could freestyle i
could free style a little bit and it's
live and y'all see me up in here rapping
on hat 51 time for my mom what i say
i'll raise to heaven y'all see me on
episode 407 that's where we have when i
spit the ill blow y'all see me out there
California San Diego so droops you are
one of the guys behind hacker media and
I was hoping it could maybe tell me
about what hacker media is and how that
kind of came about um well there was a
lot of well port was called podcast with
internet radio shows that people were
putting out and there was no repository
like itunes or hacker media or anything
to find these things so a guy named
kizzle started a wordpress blog and he
would host shows and host about him so
that people could find out more
information about them and as the site's
grown we inherited it and it's all based
on RSS feeds right now and we try to
filter the content somewhat that it's
not shows that are going all the time
out promoting
we can promote the the under dog as it
would be the new starting out show
exactly the guys it's you know yeah yeah
and and I find it an invaluable resource
for a lot of these little niche within
the hacker space but the niche the shows
yeah the stuff that's not on iTunes and
usually we have to convince people to
make an RSS feed so that we can get
information about their shows so what's
what's new with hacker media where is
that kind of evolving too well we're
we're working on a lot of things to grow
the site we get pretty good traffic for
a little site that aggregates podcast
feeds but we're working on adding a
magazine section or zine zine however
section for cons we have a featured show
that we're trying to change a lot more
when something really cool single comes
out we're working on taking shows from
YouTube and Vimeo that people are just
putting their shows there and posting
them there we're working on a nerdcore
music section okay so it sounds like
you're getting all trying to grab
everything in the room or culture the
hacker culturing and advocacy like that
the most important thing about hacker
media is not that it has these shows for
us to find now it has these shows for us
to find later right there has been a lot
of shows in Justin hacker media in the
last three years that have come and then
they're gone and then if they're not
hosting anymore where are they there are
on textiles com or they're on people's
computers or archive.org so we're
aggregating that and trying to maintain
that archive so that we have that
history of that we have a private
archive that we try to download every
show and put on okay so that we can
actually do that one day so you've got
another project going on it's kind of
like NPR but for hackers you're kinda
one tell me about what that is oh yeah
we have a show called hacker public
radio I had a network well we have no
hosts people send us content and they
don't send it to us every day like you
wouldn't make three shows and send them
to us you'd make a show like every month
or every two months or once a year or
just once but it's something you thought
was really really cool so if you think
it's really cool and it's your one month
cool thing then other people probably
think it's neat too so everything you
can listen to someone else's one month
cool thing
that's so cool so if you're passionate
about something you got somebody's you
get on skype and you record it but
you're not in you're not going to take
the investment of actually building a
show you just got it like a one of the
whole thing that you think the world
should know about and it's a really good
way to syndicate your one-off thing yeah
and it's a you guys are like 200 and 250
some odd yeah we've got a bunch of them
we can find a bunch of shows like twt
radio had a 300 show or 200 shows or
some number and vinner of radio had
several hundred shows so why not
aggregate and a lot of the people that
are our hosts have their own show so
there's thousands of you know shows that
have been made that have come into this
okay so if people want to find more
hacker media or want to have like an
awesome idea that they just want to do a
one-off like they're a monthly cool
thing where can they get involved in
that kind of stuff Jack amenia is hecka
media org and hacker public radio is
hacker public radio org and they just
sign up to this order yes there's a wave
just send it in and enigma is the admin
of the site and he goes through it and
make sure it sounds okay but we don't
edit for content because something I
like is maybe not the same thing you
like hmm sounds great I love the idea
well thanks so much for talking about
those drips yes sir we want to thank
netflix for sponsoring this episode of
act 5 with netflix you can rent over
90,000 titles online including lots of
blu-ray titles with free shipping both
ways to your home they now have over 14
shipping centers so almost all
deliveries happen in just one business
day the netflix plans start from 499 as
a new member you can get a no-risk two
week free trial membership at ww
netflix.com slash hak5 remember to type
the ww it's very important when using
the code next up let's check in with
Adrian Crenshaw you may know him better
as iron geek so iron geek I've seen you
around the hak5 forums just about every
floor impossible in the hacker world and
I just kind of want to know what is it
exactly that you do uh basically I take
what other people have created giving
full credit for it but try to develop
the documentation they don't necessarily
there's a lot of people who are hella
laois ously better developers and I am I
suck at development however people seem
to understand what I right and what I do
in video form so what I do is I take
what they produce try to understand it
my
elf digest it and regurgitated is
something I think that most people is
easy to understand and since a lot of
stuff is stuff that I've just recently
earned myself I had this pet theory that
the best person to teach something to
someone else if someone who's just
learned themselves hundreds have you
been at C++ programming for the last 20
years those things that you go take for
granted is you're not gonna be able to
introduce to a brand-new programmer
because you're just go to go right over
the head however you just learned until
yourself you know all the common
pitfalls that someone might have and so
you know what to tell them so they can
get up to your level and I've met a
whole lot of people who I've started off
doing stuff and then I go talk to him
later on and I'm like okay you know way
more an idea like operator I start off
Peter kept filters I think eating some
google searching on it and he only knows
142 cat filled with an i do i just
happen to you know get him started then
they take it and they run with it so how
long have you been doing this oh I
bought the site domain name back in like
two thousand four at one time I had a
private site someplace else about 2002
I've mr. alpha package called a cam
studio and it's like it was open source
and I used that in fact i'll use it all
throughout the first season of hack five
and then like there was a cam studio
that got bought by it was like another
one that had the same name but it was an
open source and the open source one is
awesome yeah i heard trying to be start
to develop it not but I saw that I was
like huh this is back in like two
thousand two of something and I was like
I can make little screencast to this and
they were really rinky-dink things at
the start with and then I've watched
that for a while and I know people have
mixed feelings about Kevin Rose then I
I'd stop doing it for a while there I
saw Kevin and also doing the broken I
was like what the hell i think i'll
start hypermedia things you have to be
working when they don't have interested
what people were doing like hack of
media stuff that's how I found you guys
and civil of a video podcasts and you
know I got hooked up with in Fermanagh
Khan and droops is group and all that
and then I start going to these
conventions and so forth so were you a
hacker at heart a programmer I mean
where was your professional background
for the truth I'm basically a help desk
monkey I have a really bad help this
monkey who has a website on the side
that makes a little bit of money but you
know it's more of a hobby at this point
about Alexis time on my hand like that
you know learn stuff and then teach
other people my current career goal is
to become a teacher that teaches
information security concepts people
that's awesome so you are here at
freaknic talking about keyloggers yeah
keyloggers are fun now you're not just
talking about that those software ones
everybody seems to program that's the
first thing they do when they learn like
visual c++ of those and the problem of
most software keyloggers at least the
ones that are three from monitoring most
AVS are going to pick him up right so I
was reading about all these different
Hardware key loggers and I'd seen him
advertising finge in other places and I
always want to play of them but I really
couldn't justify dropping a hundred
bucks or more on one some of these ones
are like 300 bucks but I start getting a
lot of traffic to my website well I
taupe if I have this much traffic I'd
like to get a review unit will you send
it to me yeah and they would send it to
me so I saw testing them and I was
really curious the thing they sell them
on is that they're completely
undetectable how does that really been
the case well not a hundred percent
because it's weird at least with the ps2
ones haven't found the way the USB ones
sometimes odd vindo IDs will show up on
the device manager when you plug it in
use that like USB view in Linux or does
the USB version for windows near softer
USB d view is also great and some of
them will show up as like hub devices so
they'll give you an idea sometimes
they'll cause weird effects on a USB bus
were other things hooked in line of them
will not work like other hubs of a mass
storage media odd things like that and
if you put them in recover mode they
seem to have a non valid vendor ID
sometimes Oh once I can't least look up
so you found some ways to my software
identify these I mean none of us one
hundred percent practical none of it is
good is actually physically looking but
found a few things that should be should
show some promise as far as detecting
them really for example well if
someone's be covered on the same machine
that they were logging on you could do a
search for the registry for vindo IDs
and when you see certain vendor ideas
like I believe it was a time of Mitch
one it was but I think it might have
been key goes if you saw 8880
hexadecimals of endo ID I haven't found
who that belongs to and only times I've
seen it ever occur is with key ghost
keyloggers so that might be a quick idea
that if you do something like well I'm
couple mostly a Windows world sorry guys
but you can do the same thing in Linux
what I script searches through all the
machines on your network if anybody has
this particular vendor ID log as a u.s.
device that's connected to the machine
you may wanna go investigate it but
that's only of use if the person has
uncovered the keystrokes on the same
machine they were logging if they decide
to take it home with them yeah now look
hey when you you were even talking about
some more sophisticated once in your
talk about like keyloggers that I'll
actually use blood bluetooth yeah those
one purpose i'm talking with the exact
site but yeah i'm sure you can look up I
have my show notes a show notes why not
I slides up before long pyar suszek at
home but they had this bluetooth based
hardware keylogger so essentially you
have to have physical access to the box
when you're going to install it but
thereafter you just have to cruise by
were like a yeah bluetooth phone or some
grab the log keep going great and I know
key logs also developing something along
those lines they said they're not using
bluetooth what are going to use it can
maintain the power level you need i'm
not sure but talk about me getting a
review unit so it sounds like you're
getting into a lot more the hardware
stuff yeah is that is that the future
that iron geek is taking up what are you
looking at now well the next things i
really want to mess around with in this
bears mind that i have to find someone
living let me play if their equipment i
mean i have access mostly this is like a
zero budget operation I didn't find
someone let's we have access to the
video over IP systems for a security
monitoring I just in my mind has to seem
like a credibly bad idea tcp/ip was kind
of designed for reliability and routing
around problems not necessarily for
security but it's used on a security cam
I'm curious of how easy would be the man
the middle it we placed the video stream
blog I love this idea that's imaginably
fairly easy on IP network if nothing
else just block it because it's so easy
the Dawson IP based network if you can
get on the same local area land as them
if nothing else yeah sounds well I
noticed well it sounds very very
Hollywood and I like that idea so where
can people go to check out more of your
research and hopefully upcoming embedded
devices stuff we're on the video stuff
video camera stuff nothing as of yet but
all my research is on our geek com
