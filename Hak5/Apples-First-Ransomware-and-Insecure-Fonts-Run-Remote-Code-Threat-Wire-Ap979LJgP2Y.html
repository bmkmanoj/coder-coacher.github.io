the website malicious fonts and more all
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Patrick Norton this is threat wire
for March 9 2016 your some way of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom so much news this week
and I'm just going to say one thing
before I start Google is back in the
lead for being the germinating roots of
Skynet search Google and go if you want
to know what I'm talking about nobody
knows yet have the code goes snuck into
transmission to dot 90 that's a bit
torrent client for OS 10 but if you're
running it upgrade to to dot 9 to the
290 version was stuffed with the key
ranger ransomware says macworld the
first official ransomware attack on
Apple whoo ransomware is hard to catch
and frankly most OS 10 users don't use
antivirus tools anyway how palo alto
networks which trace the infection back
notes that the key ranger application
was signed with a valid mac app
certificates which means it can sneak
past apple's gatekeeper that certificate
has since been revoked palo alto also
notes that the ransomware does its best
to encrypt files stored on Apple's time
machine ouch remember in your 321 backup
system make sure one of those backups is
offline so that in case you do have a
particularly gnarly piece of ransomware
it doesn't encrypt everything in your
networked universe rats and where is
getting nasty and while this attack
asked for a single bitcoin to unlock
your data around four hundred dollars
today remember that hospital in LA that
paid seventeen thousand dollars to
decrypt its data after spending days
with its medical records completely
locked down if we try to run a hospital
without medical records Pat's Tuesday
people update your software and make
sure auto updates are turned on for the
operating system security and frankly
everything else on the systems of the
people you provide tech support for why
am i mentioning this patch tuesday was
yesterday in Microsoft Adobe Chrome
Google and everybody else are hammered
hard on security issues on a regular
basis and if you don't update you don't
get the benefits of those fixes worse
yet if your AV or anti-malware isn't
automatically downloading updates you're
pretending you're secure when actually
you're not nearly as secure as you could
be I
you know this you're a hoopy frood it's
just a reminder to remind everybody else
who systems you work on or with or those
folks that call you up for the
occasional moment of tech support my
personal favorite patch this past
Tuesday security update for graphic
fonts to address remote code execution
that's microsoft security bulletin ms 16
dash zero to six critical attack fonts
people or attacked by fonts makes the
whole idea of attacking via light bulb
seemed kind of cool in comparison fonts
insecure fonts really at 90 for a MGMT
yesterday the let's encrypt certificate
authority issued its million
certificates as the eff just three
months and five days after the beta of
the service launched if you're not
familiar let's encrypt is a free
automated open certificate authority set
up so that anybody can get a trusted
certificate to get their transport layer
security on their website and zero cost
that's the thing that makes the s in
HTTPS possible the certs are now
accepted by all major browsers let's
encrypt was co-founded by the eff
Mozilla and researchers from the
University of Michigan Akamai and Cisco
quote provided significant financial
support for the launch as the eff
there's a ton of new sponsors funding
the project and frankly I am all for
free tools that make the internet more
secure way to go eff our featured
comment today comes from Marquis
Richardson who in response to threat
wire security tip 1 VPN says
unfortunately this is the internet a
broken system of out-of-date unpatched
machines using broken security or none
at all a world where all dns lookup
should have been encrypted by default 20
years ago but aren't a world where you
can encrypt all you want but often
forget about the hundreds of trusted
certificates in your browser thanks to
the comment marquis not the most
cheerful comment i've seen in a while
and the underlying idea is that hey not
only are we responsible for security but
all of the agencies that work to make
the internet possible have to work
together to bring security up to a
higher level which usually pisses
somebody off which makes it harder to
move forward but it's got to be done got
any thoughts on today's stories leave
them right down below and a huge thanks
