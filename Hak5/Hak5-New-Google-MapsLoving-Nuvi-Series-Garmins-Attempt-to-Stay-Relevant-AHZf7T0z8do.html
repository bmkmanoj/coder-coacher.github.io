coverage for hak5 I'm Darrin kitchen
here at CES 2012 at the Garmon booth
checking out the latest this is part of
the new V 3500 series and if you're
familiar with the new V series this is a
huge improvement on it this right here
is the 35 90 LM T model it's gonna run
$299 and it is pretty interesting in
that it has a feature that if you're an
Android user you might really like so
basically say you've got an Android
phone in your pocket and it has
bluetooth obviously and it's connected
to the internet through your cellular
provider right well this guy can sync to
it and use your phone's internet
connection to get things like traffic
weather fuel prices even traffic cameras
and then guide you to your destination
is any other Garmin Nuvi would and
that's kind of interesting because it
doesn't need to bring its own internet
connection it can just use the one that
you already have in your pocket now
those services some of them are premium
services and while the app is free those
premium services will run you anywhere
between five and twenty dollars a year
for the you know live traffic cameras
for the fuel prices for advanced weather
but you could still get the basic
weather service for free as well as
updates and this is an interesting
feature and this is the free one as well
you can send a POA or of a point of
interest from Google Maps on your
Android phone to your new V so your new
V can get you there so just imagine you
get in your car you pull out your
Android phone you open Google Maps you
find the destination that you want to
get to and instead of hitting the
navigate button you can send it to your
new V and have it take you there so
there anyway that's the 3590 LMT retails
at $2.99 and for a continued coverage of
CES 2012 be sure to head over to
revision3.com icees for all the coverage
and of course I want to thank Ford for
powering our CES coverage no one likes
the difficulty and the precision needed
when parallel parking but when you use
the act
Park Assist feature found on the focus
you remove the stress by using
ultrasonic sensors to identify an open
parking spot pair this with the rear
view camera and the car practically
parks itself for you what is so crazy
whoa okay that was awesome thanks to
Ford for powering our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
