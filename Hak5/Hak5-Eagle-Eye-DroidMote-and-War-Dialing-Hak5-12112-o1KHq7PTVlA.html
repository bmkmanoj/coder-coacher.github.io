Sail University hey guys so today I
really wanted to get more into the MK
802 Android PC that we also sell in the
hack shop if you're interested I wanted
to have a little bit more fun with it
turn my Android device into a remote
control and this could be your Android
cell phone or an Android tablet if you
wanted to pretty much anything that you
can access the Google Play Store on you
can do this little kind of a little hack
with it so first off you needed to
download this new image from Mini and
for the MK 802 the original operating
system that you see here doesn't quite
work with the droid mote remote control
apps so we have to update it to some
nerf new firmware this new firmware from
Mini end will basically enable the MK
802 to access and to use the droid mote
client that is on your cell phone or
your tablet now to get this image onto
your your MK 802 pretty much do the same
thing that we did last week with all
those different linux distros you just
use disk imager on windows or your
favorite program like DD and linux to
flash the image onto your micro SD card
and just boot it up into your MK 802
when you do so it's gonna look just like
the original operating system but don't
panic the firmware has flashed onto the
image so you're good to go and hopefully
it booted into the micro SD card instead
of the original firmware now I did pull
up the lilliputian website and this had
a whole lot of directions on how to
install this image onto the actual
firmware inside the MK 802 but it was
like using this little live suit program
on Windows and going through like 12
different steps so I just decided disk
imager is so much easier so why not use
that on a micro SD card big deal I had
to buy a micro SD card that's like eight
gigs I'm not too worried about that it
was like 15 bucks on Amazon or whatever
so you know big deal so anyway once you
have that ready to go and you've booted
into it it may take a few minutes to
boot go into your google play store
and you search for this thing called
droid mode server so you'll notice that
droid mode server is going to cost about
250 or maybe like 280 now I'm not quite
sure of the exact amount I already paid
for it so I was like that's cool it's
only 2 dollars and 50 cents to get a
remote control app for my phone and I
can access it from any sort of tablet
that I want to I'm ok with this so I
went ahead and installed it and then I
just stuck it down here in my
applications oh it's up here droid mode
server now I have that running and then
on my phone I can go ahead and download
the droid mote client app now this
version is free you only have to pay the
two dollars and fifty cents once which
is really nice now to get them connected
after you have both of them installed go
into your apps and go into your droid
mote client it looks kind of like this
it's kind of plain and simple and
there's not much to it you would think
that you just automatically be able to
get it connected but you have to make
sure that you're on the same Wi-Fi
network for both the MK 802 and your
phone or you can set up tethering on
your phone as well and then you need to
click that big green button on the MK
802 screen so you click that with your
keyboard and it's gonna give you an IP
address now on that IP address you want
to type this in so you click down here
on the settings and click connect and
enter in the IP address that you also
see on your MK 802 so hopefully this is
correct and 73.3 1.1 97 hit connect and
you want to give it a moment to actually
connect to it hurts it might get a
little confused
so if I move it around on here on the
phone ah now you can see my mouse is
moving on the screen on the MK 802 that
is so cool now if I go back a couple of
times anything that I do on this phone
whether it's hitting back on here and
going to the home menu or you know
click on on the little house the little
home menu button it's going to do all
the same stuff on the MK 802 so for
example let's go into a video game and
to click on anything I gotta just press
a hard click ok now I can go into Angry
Birds for example so I can click on the
big button on my remote and I can go up
here to start playing Angry Birds skip
through all the extra stuff so it's a
little bit harder to actually play a
game on here
there we go oh and I totally screwed
that up I really don't think I'm gonna
end up hitting the piggy so it is a
little bit harder to play on here as
you'll notice with certain things there
are a couple of different sections that
you can use on the phone as well so the
first one is the mouse where you can
just move around on here just like any
other Mouse the second one are
directional keys so you have the you
know left right up and down and you can
also hit the middle one for home you can
hit back search power button to turn it
on and off the HOME key of course in
settings the third one
even though it looks kind of like almost
like a Windows one it's a it's a music
box so you have the choice to play any
kind of music that you want go forwards
and backwards whatever you like with
music and the last one is pretty cool
this is a gamepad so you have your
directional key you right here your
directional pad and you can also hit
right and left up and down all those
little keys and you have the right side
trigger over here and you can use the
different keys and play video games with
the that as well makes it very fun so
there are quite a few cons it's a little
unresponsive at times and it is easy to
switch from one tab to another on the
phone for example if I'm messing around
on here with my mouse and I'm looking at
my MK 802 the whole time I might
accidentally move all the way down here
and hit the play button on the music and
all of a sudden I'm wondering why is my
mouse not working that can be kind of
annoying so it might be easier with a
tablet so if you guys have tried a
tablet with the MK 802 with droid mote
let me know cuz I'd like to know how
easy that one is also it's not free of
course but it is pretty close and it'll
disk disconnect after a while of no use
so you can't actually sit on your couch
for a really really long time press
pause on a movie and expect for that to
actually happen and you have to start
the server up on the MK 802 every single
time you want to start using it but as
said earlier it's really easy to set up
and it's really easy to use as you can
see and it gives you one more way to use
your Android devices all as one now stay
