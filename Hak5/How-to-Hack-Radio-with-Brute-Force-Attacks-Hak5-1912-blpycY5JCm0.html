binary phase-shift keying theory all
that and more this time on hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com hello and welcome to hacks
fitted vibe weekly does so techno last
time during kitchen I'm Shannon Morrison
we're having a great time today because
we are going to get into some
brute-force attacks so great ah yeah
we're doing a lot we've been having a
lot of fun with all of the RF stuff
lately the yardstick 1 and the RTL se
are great the epic radio duo radios
doing fun with that holy but because
today we felt like getting more in depth
today in this episode we're going to be
checking out a Python script for RF
brute-force attacks because apparently
that's the thing with RF cat and a
compatible dongle like the yardstick 1
we're gonna do some maths which I'm
gonna let Darren do that part because of
regarding these types of modeling
brute-force attacks because I'm terrible
with math we also get a tiny bit but not
too much into clock signals and binary
phase shift keying and we're gonna
answer some of your questions too that
we've gotten feedback from so very very
good questions from you guys right and
so if we just do a quick recap here on
the replay attacks before we get going
into brute-force attacks we got a little
demo set up and if you remember from
episode 1909 what we were able to do is
determine the key that our wireless
power switch would use by checking out
the FCC ID on the back of the remote and
if I press the on button here the clock
turns on there we go
can I be honest though like I've been
checking the frequency is on every
single one of my remotes around my house
now I'm like oh what's this 60 I do so
in our case this that thing is 315
megahertz likewise you could just scan
around until you see the blips because
that works too and they seem pretty
obvious in a tool like GQ RX SDR sharp
gradient ball you've got ser sharp on it
up top going so let's go ahead and take
a look at these signals so I'll just hit
off yeah you saw that blip right there
yeah I'll hit it again
yep there it is yep yeah got some nice
long blips as we go down the button look
at them blips
he already blip to say so then what we
do is we
that we used you here actually record
that or whatever have you we record it
as an audio file and then we pull it up
in audacity and we get something like
this where you know you see the little
ones and zeroes in binary that is
amplitude modulation on-off keying it's
a little waveform that basically comes
down to binary and we can convert it by
hand and then we convert it to hex and
then we feed that into our FCAT and when
we do that lets see the lights off so it
will look something like this
I'll go ahead and enter RF cat tech R
and I have it in my clipboard because I
don't feel like typing all that stuff
but we set our frequency to 315 we set
our modulation to Oak we set the baud
rate and then we transmit and this is
the binary equivalent or the hex
equivalent of the binary data and we
send that 20 times and if your areas
where we got that watched our previous
episodes right and so when I hit enter
boom so that was just me hitting Enter
and then I also saw it on SDR sharp as
well so a nice little blip and there we
go that's you know and the the signal
goes on but it what if we just knew the
frequency and how many bits of data
there were in this signal right well
that brings us to an awesome tool which
uses the RF cat libraries to do a simple
brute-force attack so to do this you're
going to need a yardstick one or other
compatible dongle as usual RF cat Python
in through utils which all of which
we've covered before and then you'll
also need the bitstream python module
oh right forgot about the bitstream
python module you go ahead and download
that over at pi pi python or a blanket
stream py pi unzip that I think I've got
it right here wait out of this guy but
bitstream o is in my downloads
and then at that point it's just a
matter of doing sudo python set up dot
py install alternatively you could also
just do an easy install so anyway just
make sure you grab yourself that and
then at that point we can get ourselves
the RF PI script and actually this came
in from a fan and I want to point out
the blog because this is really cool
this is over at exploit agency or the
legacy security group comm and here you
can find the RF brute PI basically blog
post including there it is there's all
the code and you'll just go ahead and
grab that and I've actually put that in
too I don't know why I've got in my RF
cat folder but if I cat what is it
called RF brute PI you can see there we
go that's that's basically all of it and
we'll put that link in our show notes as
well yes and thank you see for sending
that by mad props this is an awesome
tool and I love this because the
illustrates kind of the the just the
nicety of having a framework having a
library like RF cat to interface with
these CC 11 11 dongles so let's take a
quick look because it is pretty
straightforward
obviously like many Linux utilities it's
going to accept TAC TAC help so we'll do
do to do RF root PI actually I haven't
made it my haven't CH money to X so I'll
just do it like this will do Python RF
brut PI tak-tek help and you can see aha
we have a couple of standard options
here what we're going to need to do is
feed it our frequency or baud rate the
bit length of how much we're actually
going to brute-force we can specify how
many times we want it to repeat by
default is going to be 20 we can
actually Pat it with some any data we
want beforehand and after hand and then
this this small thing is important to us
so those would be like the zeros the
padding zeros or just ones and zeros
because we've run into both and we'll
get more into
that later but I just want to like real
quick just jump in and show you what
happens if we go ahead and try to and
I'm gonna turn off okay clocks off and
we're gonna now go ahead and try to
brute force this guy okay so let me grab
that command and just pop it into my
clipboard to make things easier okay
oops
so if I come over to my laptop and enter
in Python RF brute PI on the frequency
315 Oh 600 the key length we know it's
64 bits and we knew that from when we
decoded it the long way using audacity
and then tack T that's going to Pat it
with these zeros afterwards and then
we're doing raw mode and that is to say
we are literally just sending these
zeros and ones as we see fit okay and
then tack keys will also display this
out for us so we'll be able to see it
like the like the Whomper cracking
joshua or there's such wargames
reference okay and you can see haha you
can see what's you can see the hex
equivalent of what it's transmitting
that's gonna take a really long time
hey by default remember it does use I'm
gonna go ahead and control seek and stop
that but it does it sends it 20 times in
a row so it's not the fastest we can
actually speed this up now if we go
ahead and let's see I've got that right
choose the time how many times it goes
through yeah we if we do this that right
here and do the tagging this tack our
option right here that's gonna specify
how many times and we actually send that
signal and I'm gonna say just five times
and you'll see it will go much faster
boom boom boom boom you know yeah and
you can actually see the binary right
here as it is it's sending and as you
can imagine we know what the signals
supposed to be if ya come over to
audacity it's a lot of ones and zeros at
the beginning and this is starting here
at the end so it's still gonna take a
while yeah I'm gonna I'm actually gonna
stop this attack because once you guys
want to sit here for a long time and
watch for longer episodes you want to
wait for it yeah yes so
yes sir the jeopardy music here right so
first we're actually just going to do
some quick binary math Terran is so we
know that each bit only has two
possibilities either it's going to be a
1 or it's gonna be a 0 because yay
computers so for a single bit we know
that there are two permutations there
are also only two combinations but hey
let's not confuse the terminology
because this is something that
frequently comes up when talking about
brute forcing so we're gonna do an
example so with the 2 bits there can be
4 permutations there can be 0 0 1 1 1 0
and 0 1 makes sense yeah but there are
only actually three combinations because
the 0 and the 1 and 1 and 0 are the same
they're just used in different positions
just swap coding the combinations so
essentially with combinations position
doesn't matter so you could think of a
ham and cheese sandwich versus a cheese
and ham sandwich in Darrin's case he
does it give a crap don't wear it on top
or bottom they're both delicious same
personally I prefer permutations because
I like the ham to be on the bottom
because it's closer to my taste buds yes
Matt no I bring that up because this
does come up a lot of times when we
don't like how many possible
combinations of the note we're using the
wrong word here because when it becomes
yeah when it comes to binary like the
binary bits really do care because the
difference between 1 and 1 0 and a 0 1
is 1 is the correct code and the other
is not at all so when brute-forcing
binary we definitely care about the
deliciousness of our ham sandwiches and
specifically the permutations because of
depending on how fast we can make these
attempts on our target it can either be
a really fun and exciting process like
watching a wet key
instantly become a string of hex or long
tedious boring monotonous excruciatingly
less than wonderful event so to figure
out how many permutations there are in
the case of binary
let's let's look at this okay so for one
bit there's obviously only yeah but it's
real simple so for a single bit it can
either be one of two things a 1 or a 0
so there you go it's it's 2 to the 1
that's 2 right for 2 bits it
would be 2 to the 2 or ^ 2 which would
be 4 because there are like Shannon even
just illustrated for possible scenarios
there
likewise if there are 3 bits it would be
2 to the power 3 that would be 8 4 would
be 16 5 would be 32 6 would be 64 7 128
8 is 256 so you're kind of seeing where
it was yeah you see where this is going
in it's why we have 8 bits and a bike
because 256 and all the good stuff so
the question is how many permutations
are there going to be in our 64 bit key
and to do that we can actually use bc or
bash calc to do a little math for us so
you can either just go into bc here and
do your math or you can echo it to it
with a pipe but if I do say to carrot 64
oops that's an ampersand to carrot 64 we
can see that there are oh I know this
number
you know this quintillion 446
quadrillion 744 trillion 74 billion
seven hundred nine million five hundred
fifty-one thousand six hundred and
sixteen I just know my numbers really
well yeah of course I we didn't write
that down no if I were to try this five
times per second in what we call an
online brute-force attack rather than
say the thousands or tens of thousands
of times per second that we can try an
it offline brute-force attack how long
would it take Shannon
Oh Darrin just 117 trillion years so
we're actually not going to do that
because as much as everyone really likes
the long episode of hack five just
eventually I want to go home and hang
out with my cats yeah
so instead for the demo we're actually
going to cheat and set the first 48 bits
as our preamble and let our F brute take
crack at the last 16 bits which has a
mere 65,536 permutations yeah sixteen
bits are fun that won't take it no it
won't so to do this I'm going to go
ahead and drop back in here and
clear this with control L which I don't
know like I always get sorry tangent but
people always ask me like why do you
type clear it's like as if I type if I
hit ctrl oh yeah
so anyway Helen Basch clears things but
if you didn't know that's what I did
because you didn't see my hands might
get confusing so anyway yes the magic of
television so for this what I'm going to
go ahead is do my pseudo Python RF brute
actually I think I have that command
right up here yes
but I'm gonna give it instead of just
the attack what is it tack you have
Tecate this tack T option which adds the
padding to the end I'm going to add
padding to the beginning with the tack P
option and in this case it's going to be
the the binary representation that we
already know and then we're gonna send
it on its merry way so let's take a look
at that I actually have that in my cheat
sheet here because that'd be really
funny if you got it that's the problem
with ones and zeros right okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and run this and it is
going to complain because sometimes you
actually need to reset a dongle so
unplug and replug your dongle I'm gonna
go ahead and up that happens with lots
of dongles by the way run this again
there we go it's transmitting
transmitting transmitting so I'm gonna
go wide oh yeah let's take a look at ser
shark you see look at all this yeah
that's all right go back to this camera
you can see eventually eventually how
many tries are we up to a lot a lot
we're up to a lot of tries but it'll
still take a while
Wow it's you're basically like sending
out a denial of service over yes so in
this case now what you would do we're
not quite fun what kind of fuzzing well
yeah let me control see that is we would
actually scroll up here and find okay
well we knew it was one of these name
probably either it's either this one or
this one
or this one we really have to like stay
here and watch this thing and then stop
the attack as soon as what we expect to
happen occurs because otherwise we're
not going to know like it's one thing to
it's one thing to like hack the thing
it's another to like know why it got
hacked which is kind of why we've taken
so long to get to this point where we
can brute-force it yeah so we understand
how it's working and why it's working
the way it is right you want you want to
talk about things that could take a
while I actually know this guy that
scanned the that transferred the
Internet his name is mu bik's and he had
to hit every IP four address on the
internet which is really fun because we
can actually see that you know because I
people our dresses are 32-bit let's just
do that again if I echo 2 ^ 32 because
there are 2 possibilities a 1 or 0 and
there are 32 bits and I send that over
to bash calc you will see a really large
number and that is how many IP 4
addresses there are there's like what
4.2 billion awesome if we likewise do
for her IP version 6 which is the new
hotness much larger number Wow
much much so mad props anyone that can
name that number in the comments yeah
and with that yeah speaking of which we
are going to take a quick break thank
our awesome sponsor and when we get back
we have answers to some viewer questions
and other fun stuff and talk about some
projects in the future and all sorts of
good stuff so we'll be back in right
after this
we've got a great idea you need to get
yourself a great domain which is why we
are huge fans of domain comm and if
you've been watching for a while you
know how much we love domain coms are
fast affordable reliable easy use fun to
go drinking with they have a website up
and like no time and getting started
with domain.com is a snap whether you're
looking for a new comm or some hosting
or whatever have you because they've got
an awesome domain discovery system but
here's the thing right now is the best
time to head over to domain calm because
they are having an epic made a huge sale
seriously this is like the big one for
the year so what you want to do is use
the coupon code hak5 percent off new
domain registration it's a limited time
offer it's between now and
member xxx so act fast head on over to
domain comm use coupon code hack jumbo
and be sure to tweet some love up the
kind folks at domain.com and support
hack 5 for so many years so remember
when you think domain names think
domain.com by the way probably shouldn't
DDoS a whole bunch of frequencies all
willy-nilly like because that could
cause complications don't want to where
you live yeah actually we should really
be doing this in a Faraday cage or
something because the last thing we need
is like industrial control system at the
next place over like suddenly the
refrigeration units fail because like we
sent the right combination why is there
fire from Chevron what's going on yeah
that would never happen now wouldn't it
would not okay so we some we have some
user questions yes we do some feedback
the first one comes from Anna Molly who
says the RTL 4-3-3 program you got from
github specifically targets the signal
from the accurate 592 TX our temp and
humidity sensor there may be differences
in the signal compared to other sources
for example the baud rate might not be
set the same also looks like the program
assumes the signal is encoded via
Manchester these issues could be the
source of your inability to decode the
data ah yes and it's a fantastic place
it's west of Sheffield you go to the
Peak District it's beautiful they have
lots of sheep there they also have
Manchester United which is obviously the
best team or no is it Manchester City
let me know in the comments this is a
sports ball thing but anyway yeah and
it'll take you straight to Holly head -
ok off the geography tangent basically
what we're talking about this Manchester
encoding and I should probably preface
this by saying RTO 4:33 has the ability
to understand lots of different
temperature sensors humidity sensors
lots of different things and so I don't
know maybe there is a way to get it into
just like a raw mode but you bring up a
very interesting point that we haven't
really talked about and I know it at the
beginning of this series we said that we
weren't going to go down the RF rabbit
hole as it were but let's just take a
quick look at this one because to
understand my interests
cutting we first need to understand
something about clock signals and
basically in RF communications and
actually in various other telecom
technologies you'll see a signal the
oscillating between high and low or one
and zero for the purpose of coordinating
actions and you know so far we've been
ignoring this in the demos but if we
actually look at say the signal for the
light switch that we've been taking a
look at recently here I will pull up
that audacity again and if i zoom out
actually I think this is the version of
it where I have stripped the ones and
zeros let's see if I can up yep so I had
it actually cut so this is the signal
down here to the right where if I again
zoom in you can see one zero one zero
yada yada yada but right before then it
looks like that preamble is just a set
of ones and zeros that's exactly what
this preamble pattern it's a pattern
it's basically just 101 o 101 oh so
that's the clock signal right yes okay
cool so it's telling the receiver that
hey I'm about to send data it'll be at
this bit rate so we can think of it like
that for on the floor based beep that
defines the rhythm of a techno track
samples yeah I'm not gonna do that
because it's annoying
now once the receiver in the transmitter
is synchronized in beat the data will
line up yeah it's kind of like going
like I'm about to send you some data
this is about the rate something of
course you're like Bill Nighy for
hackers
oh no that's a good thing
Oh in Manchester encoding the OSI you
say that and then I pressed the wrong
button on the arcade comes a Manchester
encoding the idea is that basically we
don't again I hit the wrong thing
because you got me so screwed up Shannon
let's start at the top okay
Manchester encoding is a really cool
idea because basically rather than doing
like this guy has been doing where we
send this preamble of ones and zeros we
actually combine it so instead of having
that kind of like beginning message one
zero one zero
we just cut to the chase and to do so we
basically are going to encode the data
with the clock signal together using a
method or as or I'm not gonna listen
there's so many look yes the god of fire
no of one zero and again there's so many
rabbit holes and this is the reason why
we don't get too far down these because
we've done that before and then you guys
end up leaky with hour-long episodes
about ORF theory and nobody wants that
so the resulting ones and zeros that you
end up getting though it's really
interesting because what it does is it
takes the data it takes the clock that
one zero one zero and then it soars them
together in such a way that instead of
looking at the bit like when I look at a
bit here I'm looking at that part and I
say hey that's high that's a one I see
this and I say hey that's low that's a
zero rather with Manchester encoding you
look at that and you go oh that went
from high to low and this one from low
to high there's a great Wikipedia
article on it this image really does it
justice because basically what you're
seeing is you always have that clock
oscillating up and down at the rate and
then you have the data that you actually
want to transmit and using one of the
two different methods for Manchester
encoding you end up with either high-low
being a 1 or lohi being a 1 it's just a
really basic form of binary shift keying
or binary phase shift keying or BPSK
it's it's super common method to do this
kind of stuff and you know what we're
just gonna leave it at that for right
now it's so cool
yes and as for systematically decoding
any kind of arbitrary binary waveforms
we'll take a look at that soon with a
tool sent in from one of our fans named
Steve thank you Steve now we did get
another question from the general one
two three and he said from point 26 to
point 27 is there a subliminal insert
there he's talking about the blips and
the welcome to the fun of editing and
motion JPEG we could do an entire
episode on the back end of how this show
is made to catch those oh man I watched
him do it and it's just one of them is
just gonna be something wrong one of
these days but no there are no
subliminal message
in this show we don't do that that would
be really weird so take it as yes hmm
we can get into more about the editing
system later but you know what I think I
think we have the cure in the form of a
very expensive Nvidia Quattro of
graphics card that will make the thing
go better I will keep watching you do
your thing also like with that ocean
JPEG get another point here from J right
oh you poor poor thing
Jai McGee writes I love your channel but
agreed it needs to be longer please make
it longer now it is all about
commercials oh man what commercials I
know I love this I got this one I was
just like totally sell I almost said a
bad word is it because we sell things
well I guess I mean we do fund the show
through the hack shop where we do you
have things like the rtl-sdr is and the
yardstick ones and the hack RFS but I
mean those are cool things anyway so
while there it may be a little influence
there and obviously we prefer you buy it
from our store because you know it helps
us keep this thing going as far as there
being ads on the show if you're a
longtime viewer of a pack 5 like so many
awesome people like David Ellington he's
been watching for forever you guys know
you've been watching for the longest
time there used to be like three ads per
episode yeah and now it's just one so I
think if anything we've done a great
service to the community and keeping it
very light on the odds but I do value
your feedback and your right shows we're
a little shorter for a little while and
we're working on we're having a lot of
fun like experimenting with the show and
that's the beauty of podcasting is we
get to define this medium and figure out
the best way to do it for us and we're
honestly just doing it for us to first
so the fact that you can join us and
enjoy it along with us makes it all the
better but to be honest about the length
of the shows part of it is because we're
in a uber crazy ridiculous dev cycle or
at the very end of it we're at a crunch
period we're gonna be talking about some
new stuff that we have coming oh yeah
and that has kind of taken over a lot
but I honestly Shannon
I've been having so much fun just
working with you directly on building o
segments so I'm not gonna hug you though
cuz you smell and from Tet Tet Ron Tudor
on cetera
Tet Ron to try he says why hak5
interlacing did we record on VHS we are
recording to a Betamax system that no
black magic San Premier and about $4,000
to buy a new mixer that we need to do
real soon which we will as soon as we
have money - until then you have two
choices you can either have interlacing
when we move or you can have interlacing
when we cut to our computer screens and
we do like this and you'll notice we use
like really big fonts because otherwise
you'll see the interlacing and if if I
live in Swami yeah it will if I start
moving windows around you might actually
really notice it so weird little
programming aside but it has been coming
up a lot people asking both of those
questions about the blips and the
interlacing so figured we'll address
them and yeah so it's one of the other
you know we can either have bad looking
video and great computer screens or
great video and bad computer screens
it's pretty much what happens when you
have a very small company it's like one
guy we're gonna figure it out but I
think we're just gonna have to replace
the HD video mixer and unfortunately
there's only one available and it's a 4k
machine and we're not going for No
stop asking we're not going for K
actually nobody's asking the only one
for can have this guy ask and I told him
no too expensive
they don't want 4k on this camera
obviously not but they definitely want
to unpack camera I can see yours it
Thanks just kidding wow we really
devolved on this episode okay so I thank
you for watching all the way to the end
and you're welcome if you stopped right
after the ad with all of that I want to
remind you that if you want to support
the show directly I'm going to grab
yourself some cool kit I think we
already mentioned it but these guys and
all of the other fun stuff like ducks
and turtles and pineapples no good
yeah the hack shop a check a shop calm
that's where you can support us directly
and you can comment down below or if you
see this on Facebook you can comment
there or wherever the heck here of
watching the show yeah three you can
send your C++ programs that do awesome
stuff thank you Steve and with that well
your oh well you're at hack five dot org
check out the show now let's check out
act but that also followed by all the
