by domain.com hello welcome back live my
name is Darren kitchen and I'm Shannon
Morse
editor weekly dose of technomage you're
on uh yeah what what does that mean that
means hello in French Polynesia well
there you go how was French Polynesia it
was amazing I seriously like detoxed
from all technology I don't have
anything off no I can't wait who are you
in what I have done with snow it's
amazing like I think seriously like once
a year so you just need to turn off
everything and enjoy nature and that's
what I did it was totally worth what
kind of nature did you uh um I enjoyed
the the beautiful landscapes of the
islands and I watched some ladies do
some hula dancing so I learned how to do
that
they're called bikinis women are Vahine
'yes yes yes they are and I saw I saw
sharks oh yeah
up close that's something we can hack
get a couple of laser pointers oh and I
saw stingrays and stingrays are like
puppies like seriously all they want to
do is love and hug you in like they'll
come up with their gigantic wings and
just be like hmm I have to deal with
this on a regular basis it was amazing
and then I was just like oh hey what's
that stingray hey fantastic friends with
you and you didn't get the you didn't
get did you know no route to host
jitters as they are sometimes called a
little bit I just drinks just like that
did you sneak an Instagram here and
there I took photos but I didn't share
them until this week they were all later
grams
they were later good yeah I did it that
recently over the weekend in Tahoe but
not by choice just because remember the
app that we showed a couple episodes
back that shows you how far you are from
your tower yeah 25 kilometers whoa
gee I didn't have anything whoa I have
negative G's so you you didn't do it by
choice but you were also pretty
disconnected yeah Tahoe is nice also I
found out that when it comes to drones
it's kind of important your altitude
turns out at 8,000 feet thrust you just
don't have as much oh no did it go in
the lake no no no okay of course not of
course not that would be awesome that
would be irresponsible and we of course
all practice responsible flying when we
go draw
especially in parks thankfully this was
not a national park therefore we could
actually drone anyway
that's totally tangental let's get to
we've got a great episode this week
could you we've got some new additions
to the set as based on your
recommendations so thank you so much
everyone for including what you would
like to see on the set I loved your
youtube comment and we have kittens
James took one out I just I love this so
thank you for voting any way to type it
actually you know what we should do
every episode we should either have a
vote or there's this there's this
program that we keep kicking around I
think we can do it in PHP with node but
basically the idea is that you would be
able to upload say I don't know your
favorite image like different wallpapers
we used to do hack 5 wallpaper contest
Oh keeper yeah so it is a little that
entire back with wallpapers okay that'd
be good too
but I was also thinking of either
putting 640 by 480 wallpapers oh oh sub
sing schools take it upon himself to I
don't read ASCII and I sure would I do
read some ASCII I believe it's I wrote
the let fix school's equal no it doesn't
so equals yes we would love to get
everybody involved in what goes up on
the walls here so maybe we tie in the
projector with a PHP script and a bot on
IRC have the IRC ops moderate the images
that go up on the wall during the live
show with no dive we want to get the
live stream yeah see that Alex just cuts
so anyway that's just kind of one of the
various warehouse projects that are
going on but I in to find out about file
transpose yeah so you didn't come here
to find out about sharks you found you
came here to find out about file
transferring securely from one computer
to the next without the need of clouds
so that's what I'm talking about this
week is all about this thing called
pulse and this is previously called sync
thing so you might have heard of it you
might not but it's basically this open
source thing that you can download over
it INDD ie slash pulse it's totally open
protocol it's a cloud sharing program
without the need of an actual server
move wait wait
are you saying without a sense
as management infrastructure that
somebody could send a national security
letter to we get all of your data so you
know it's not like Dropbox it's not like
box I wasn't about to you know call them
out but yeah well they're not a sponsor
so I'm not sure not like it would matter
regardless but stuff exactly so whatevs
so yeah it's not like any of those
really really popular ones that you
probably use now and then for your nan
things you don't need to worry about
this well okay so what you're telling me
is it sounds more secure which means
it's gonna be hella not convenient it's
pretty convenient for real surprisingly
yeah right um I only ran into one little
issue when I set this up on my computer
a couple of weeks ago but it was easy to
fix I just had to turn off my firewall
and I have that on anyway because I work
around it you just open the only the
port's you need yeah but yeah you can
only open the ports you need just turn
off your firewall whatever you know
strikes your firewall on just the ports
you need we open well that's what I did
getting that so anyway yes whatever so
the data is only stored on our computers
as opposed to sharing it up in the
server so there's no other devices that
are within your vicinity that you have
to worry about
so you just send it back and forth
between computer a and computer B also I
should mention on their website that
they talked about their security and
their privacy so they say that it is
authenticated is encrypted and it is
private it's encrypted securely using
TLS encryption yeah you probably know
that as SSL but yes
sounds good I don't know man SSL to your
heart so it's available for Mac Windows
Linux FreeBSD and Solaris as well so you
can get it on pretty much anything
including your servers so yeah good for
you guys hey and it's open source so
that means you can probably port it to
Android or iPhone if you were so keen on
doing so there's also so a third-party
port for this for Android on Google Play
you can also get it on F droid if you do
want to get it on your Android machine I
didn't put it on mine just because I
didn't feel like it so you just go over
to there download page which is
concurrently a github so there github is
over here it's called sync thing you'll
notice that it's under the old name but
you can just compile your
version if you want to or you can run
the version that's best for your
operating system so I'm using Windows so
I use the one for which was just a
simple zip amd64 once you actually run
this it'll run in the background and
this is what it looks like so it's going
to run everything that it needs to
compile in your haha so it's like a
server it is yeah that's exactly what's
happening on here you're running your
own little server for files okay and how
do you interact with it very easily so
luckily when it runs this it
automatically opens up your own
localhost connection on port 8080 so
mine would be you know home colon 8080
yeah yeah so it's got a little webserver
going on it does good stuff this is what
the webserver looks like on the first
side under the green the green column
you have your data which is going to be
your hard drive and whatever folder you
decide to share it to it'll tell you if
it's idle if it's currently syncing or
whatever it's doing it'll also let you
know if it's connected or if it's
disconnected if there's a problem with
it it'll give you options to change the
folder if you want to I set mine up with
a default user Shannon sink and then you
can choose what kind of states it'll let
you know if it's out of state and more
and more so if I go under edit that is
where I can choose the folder path if I
haven't changed that already you can do
that when you set up your account and
rescan intervals how often it's going to
rescan for new files and then some other
little things that you can edit under
there as well so I'll go ahead and close
that I love that we keep reinventing
things like our sink you know and all of
these all of these coals that are like
you know all of these instant messaging
platforms I'd like what is it we were
perpetually going to reinvent FTP our
sink and email but you know it so be it
this sounds really cool and then over on
the other column the grey column that
Shannon w8 so that's my Oceana in
Windows 8 laptop that I'm using here
this is just the simple gray column that
shows me my current download rate my
upload rate and then whatever kind of
utilizations are being used at the
moment so my CPU how much of that is
being used as well as RAM I'm not
transferring anything right now so the
CPU is obviously at zero
% but you'll see that go up as you're
transferring different things from other
computers it's kind of nice that they
believe that wonder case oh I wonder how
they synchronize all of the other
different computers right so that's
pretty easy as well under the purple
column this is where you'll find all of
your different computers that you've
decided to sync with it
currently you'll see this this one
called txf tj2 is disconnected that's
because I went ahead and disconnected it
while I was on vacation I haven't
reconnected it yet but very easy to
reconnect I just have to open it back up
to them just open at that port so you go
to add device right here this is going
to give you a device ID so you want to
put in their device ID which will be
there it's like a fifty six digit code
ID that you'll receive when you first
sign up and then you can also access
through this through this online browser
that will be a 56 ID and let me see if I
can find mine real quick yeah so you
just go down here under your settings
and you can click on show ID when you
click on that it'll give you your 56
letter and number ID so you can either
copy and paste that or you can scan the
QR code to include this computer onto
the next computer so you go under add
device you add that new device ID and
then you can name it whatever you want
to name it under addresses you can just
leave that as dynamic if you need to and
then use compression and introducers so
this means that any device is configured
to in on an introducer device will be
added to this device as well I didn't
check and I specify introduce your
devices because it sounds like they're
using a third part I mean obviously for
all of these to get together and know
each other they have to all go to like a
third party Authority I wonder if that's
configurable probably need to look into
that because well everything's yeah yeah
I'm not sure I wonder if you can roll
your own maybe look into for sure
so once you have all of that stuff set
up you just go to your settings and you
need to click restart if you don't click
restart it won't set up the sync
automatically so it'll have to do it
every time that you restart your your
sync thing so once that's done after
about a minute or so you should connect
to the other computer and you have to do
the same protocol on the other computer
as well so that you can connect to this
machine and the whole device will turn
green and it'll say that it's connected
as opposed to being purple and
disconnected and again if you have any
kind of troubles with connecting the two
machines to each other open up that port
and that should fix any kind of issues
that you have in both computers will be
allowed to share towards each other see
then you can share any kind of files you
want whether those are mp3s movies text
files whatever you have so for example
in my folder right here I was sharing
just simple text files to make sure that
it worked with Sebastian so I had my
little snubs file over here that just
says hack five rules because it does and
then my test file which I was sharing
back and forth was sub so I asked him to
go ahead and say something click Save
and it automatically syncs with mine
after that sixty second wait time that I
set up in my savings and my settings so
that cool yeah very easy to use and I
was surprised that it was easy to set up
because you know sometimes you get these
and they are completely abhorrent I
think that we've come a long way from
our sync and I love seeing this not only
because it's open-source but because
it's cross-platform because it's
documented because I'm looking for a
solution where say we don't have to go
up into the cloud and back down every
time we want to save something and I'm
also a huge fan of the I guess in this
case it's unlimited storage I mean it's
however much yeah yeah exactly it
depends on how much harddrive space you
have because obviously it's not in a
cloud anywhere so sure the disk space is
a lot cheaper locally than it is up in
the cloud so there you go so easy easy
peasy let me know what you guys think
feedback at hex artwork oh I wonder if
it sinks over the LAN I wouldn't have to
yeah all right yeah well yeah cuz we've
got like a cheap one worth of worth of
bandwidth here it's so sub sink so the
bandwidth we have here stay tuned we'll
be right back after this quick break
it doesn't matter whether you're into
file sinks or file washing machines when
you've got that killer idea you gotta
snag yourself a domain and let me tell
you domain.com
is the place they've got this awesome
quick domain discovery system and a
super easy checkout process so get this
you're gonna have that website up and

question of the week
the last trivia question that we had was
which planet in our whole solar system
is known to orbit the Sun the fastest
and the answer is mercury with 88 days
around the Sun now this week's trivia
question is what electronic device needs
to be factory calibrated to the Earth's
magnetosphere you can answer that over
at hack 5 org slash trivia for your
chance to win some awesome hack 5
goodies from out there
Shannon your trivia question made me
think about my favorite website no
teller Mars now joking is mercury in
retrograde comm that's right you two can
be hated and check it out it's not given
not said no something else must be
bumming you out but just in case a like
yeah and mercury must be in retrograde
cuz the crap is just hitting the fan
right now no no I think opportunities
are abound uh hey last week we got a lot
of feedback about the hacking SMS
segment that I did I know it's just
sending emails to gateways but NX add a
tmon and X admin pointed out that he's
not sure how many people in a text but
you can get a thousand people four
thousand numbers for six dollars I
checked out the link next mo comm so I
guess this is just one of those SMS
gateways you can buy those so that you
can do short codes and cool stuff like
that if we could have like text for 255
that spells hack five or something like
that but six dollars for a thousand did
the math on the five 100 area code here
yeah we have like almost 800 prefixes
and with 10,000 numbers in each prefix
that comes to $48,000 so thanks let's
see if maybe we can do this with
asterisk let us know in the comments I
would love to figure that out there's
probably no inexpensive way to do this
for this exact reason or else we would
all get crazy text messages asking us
how many cats we have also by the way
thank you for everyone who has texted me
asking about my cats including 6 for 100
I guess that would be rude I don't know
if they feel as comfortable with you as
your father yeah anyway no but thanks to
everybody that's actually just the
number on this SIM card which will
hopefully get swapped out here as soon
as that dang Nexus 6 comes out yeah
techno lusting on that I really just
gotta say my note 4 is just rocking it
it's good to see with a phablet I
conserve been a long time comments thing
I've had it for a week in like two days
and I love it so far
