in seattle this segment of pack 5 is
brought to you by domain.com at the
living computer museum here in seattle
washington and so Ian walk me through
this how long has the living computer
museum been around it's been around in
one form or another another for about
ten years mr. Allen first bought the
toad one that you saw in the other room
because he was nostalgic about the
pdp-10 architecture then later he bought
some real PDP tens and got in touch with
the man who sold in the toad to ask can
I run this thing well rich has been here
ever since in 2008 they were having
problems keeping up with the owners
expectations about restoration and they
said well we don't have enough people
and Paul said well get another person
and that's how I got a job i've been
here since 2008 we have had sort of an
online presence since 2005 we started
with a Spartan experience upstairs it's
really just a warehouse up there and we
had a couple rows of machines we could
bring people in and talk about them and
we did that for a couple of years and
there was enough response that Paul
Allen decided I'm gonna put some money
into this and that's what you see here
we open this officially in October so
this is Paul Allen's museum yes all of
these artifacts belong in the ground
really and so what does the artifacts
that you find here well right behind you
is a metadata 732 that I found in
Arkansas it was from a man who had
designed an electrocardiogram analyzer
and this was his work machine and when
the company folded he took it home with
him and had it in his living room for 25
years then you have machines that have
come directly out of industry you have
machines like our PDP 7 that came from
university of oregon's they had it up
and running for 40 years and some of the
machines we find from other collectors
one of the the sad things about the
economic downturn is that people have
had to adjust their expectations and so
people who've said I'm going to start a
museum someday are now saying no that's
not going to happen
and they want their their items to go to
someplace where they will be preserved
and will be loved and quite often that's
us and so what are some of the
challenges including together the museum
with all of these pieces here well in
addition to the usual challenges of
trying to find the right story to tell
on the right pieces to tell it that's
something every museum has for us
sometimes you find a piece that's in
beautiful condition and you can almost
just bring it in and plug it in and run
it and and on one side that's really
really nice but then you have some
pieces for instance the ki 10 in the
other room have been standing in water
about 10 inches deep for a number of
months and in a different kind of way
that's a lot of fun because they're a
much bigger challenge to restore
sometimes pieces have been removed
sometimes you have to find them
sometimes you have to make them and it's
not just the electronics we find
ourselves having to do milling matching
paints recreating plastic panels the
switches on the PDP 7 were made by one
of the employees of the company with his
microwave and so what about the
documentation and the program were you
were you find too old you know programs
to run on a PDP a
fortunately the private collector
community over the years has been great
about retaining all of that in fact ten
years ago I was known to say the history
of this year is being preserved by
strange people like me who have stuff
like this in our basement and by the way
I do have stuff like this in my basement
so if you were if you were lucky you
managed to snag the documentation at the
same time there's a gentleman down in
California al caso who's been running a
thing called bit sabers for a number of
years and his mission in life has been
to find everything he can in terms of
documentation scan and put it online al
we love you man and then we do our best
to just find it wherever we can and as
we've gotten more publicity if more
people have learned about us they come
forward and say you know got this box
that I've had in the Attic for 30 years
do you want it did anything know what it
is oftentimes not you know somebody has
passed away and oh yeah this was my
husband or my uncle or whoever hears
this stuff and sometimes we end up with
five copies of one thing but then
sometimes we end up with the only one
for instance a machine we just brought
in unisys V 380 from santa ana we have
the full set of the system operations
guide and the last customer engineer for
that product who met me to decommission
the machine said nobody has this so
what's the most unique piece in the
collection you tech boy that's a really
tough one because there are so many
things here that are unique in different
ways for instance our PDP seven is one
of four known to exist in the world it's
the only one that works they're rolling
120 of them ever made we have the ki the
KL the KS 10 line of PDP tens we're
currently in negotiations to acquire a
k8n the initial machine so we have so
many unique things I would I don't know
where to start so we just think that any
of these you know archaic machines them
paths are still in production use yes
absolutely sometimes we have to compete
for parts you'll find manufacturing
plants all across middle America that
are still built on the PDP 8 for
instance that was its original purchase
the purpose was
to be essentially a process controller
it's a very small machine but it's so
beautifully and elegantly created that
people have done amazing things on it
when I first experienced it when I was
an undergraduate at the University of
Washington it was doing laboratory
analysis in a neuro pharmacological lab
but yes you'll find PDP PDP 11s all over
the place still in production usually
running some kind of factory anything
slings it the total amount of processing
power
that's a great question one of these
days I actually need to sum it up but
i'm estimating it's less than in a
smartphone the amazing thing about these
machines was well it's the old dancing
bear argument it's not how gracefully
the bear dances but bit of dances at all
and when you look at some of these
machines they chug along they can do a
few thousand instructions a second but
they do them tirelessly they do them
without error and human beings don't
have to sit there and do this mind
deadening work so that's their value but
having said that you know some of these
machines could potentially still produce
a lot of value one of the things we want
to do is reproduce some of the older
online communities that used to exist
things like BBS's and time shared
systems a single computer would serve a
couple hundred people and there would be
a community that would develop through
that not just technical but also social
of course computing is a technical
social and cultural phenomenon and it's
one of the fascinating things is seeing
all the threads that weave through them
is their VBS running at the Museum not
yeah that in the works big okay
I grew up on the board so it's near dear
to my heart how much
thatthat's well asked because on most of
the smaller machines like the eights the
eleventh and so forth it's actually
pretty straightforward you get them up
and running you do a little preventive
maintenance on them every so often
because component values drift and we
think digital it's on it's off right
well there's this point between the
analog and digital worlds where we have
circuitry that has to be adjusted every
so often because it drifts over time
values change now the bigger machines
have a lot more complexity and so
there's just a lot more to go wrong
there's a lot more where a connection
just becomes a little too resistive or a
card gets lucid in fact one of the
failures we had on our KL 10 early in
its history was it was intermittent and
of course I hate intermittent it just
would break I can fix it but with it's
intermittent ah that's where you lose
hair and we found out that there was a
board that had the master clock that was
connected in a way that its resonant
frequency matched the fan and so over a
number of years mechanical stress have
broken the connection so have any of the
you know engineers that build some of
these machines come by the museum yes
and they are just so thrilled to see
what we're doing engineers users with
our PDP 7 the gentleman who initially
bought it for university of oregon in
1966 professor Harlan the favor has been
here several times and his grad student
who ran it comes up and helps me every
time that I've got a question so they
helped us put it back together it was
running when we got it we had to take it
apart to ship it and it took us several
months to get it all back together
because there are so many connections
and so does the museum work with any of
the other organizations that preserve
internet history like archive.org ah not
yet so again we're still getting on our
feet we officially opened to the public
in October and we've had a lot of work
to do there are only four or five five
engineers now when I started I was the
third in 2008 so our plates are very
full just
machines up but we're having a lot of
conversation now with other
organizations we're looking at software
archiving especially software archiving
that relates the software to its
execution platform it is great if you
got this bucket of bits that says oregon
trail on it but if you don't know what
to run it on it's not a lot of help so
that's an extension to common practice
that we're working on what about you
know maintaining the actual data on
these machines today you know do they
have like a shelf life or are you
actually running into problems where
because of the the years that the actual
you know like bit rot it depends on the
media now the debt tapes that we use on
the PDP eight are incredibly robust and
we're still using those 40 years later
and we've only had one fail with an
actual data error nine track tapes are
much more fragile and so we've been
developing a practice how we're going to
migrate from tape to take to make sure
that we can always low 29 track tape
onto a machine that needs one but it
does depend on the media so what would
you say is the most robust machine in
this room you know I'd probably say if I
were going to bet on one it would be the
PDP eight really it's simple its
straightforward deck tapes one of the
things that the marketing people used to
do out of digital is they go to
conferences and they pick up a deck tape
they punch holes in it with a paper
punch they put it on the machine that
would still read so it was built very
very redundantly both the machine and
the tape so I've had one shipped across
the United States and a soft envelope
and I got it loaded it up and it was
fine nice that would be my bet for the
one that would survive the war and if
you could take any of these home which
would you take well let's see i have
seven pdp-11 three PDP eight I've lost
track of how many vaccin think they
actually breed in the corners it would
probably be the Xerox Alto over there
that's just such a unique machine there
were so many incredible innovations in
one box it's almost like if you were
making this up nobody would believe it
but it's reality sitting over there and
running well we have all the software up
and running I have sources for it in
fact really I think she said it wasn't
oh it isn't running well I'll take a
look at it because I'm the person who's
responsible for it so yes I could bring
it back up ok cool and when you look at
these machines and the kind of community
you're talking about it that this was a
very social and community thing there
were computer clubs there were bulletin
board systems where people would meet at
the pizza shop and talk about the door
games and the other things that they
were doing and again you look at how all
of these machines kind of grew out of
you know fundamentally everything was
open source because there was no way to
really close it or there was no reason
to and you look at computing today how
do you see like this museum in a hundred
years and what kind of challenges this
museum in 100 years will have today when
say we put on display you know a
modern-day windows 8 box well you really
hit it on the head is that the market
has changed so we have all of this other
stuff going on people are still buying
mainframes people are still using
industrial computers process control
computers and so forth but this consumer
market has just blossomed and the
products there as you point out aren't
necessarily all that open so we're
looking forward to being able to work
with vendors we're starting to talk with
them now to create relationships so that
we can preserve this information so 20
years from now 30 years from now when it
is not a threat to their economic
viability we can open it up so when we
want to archive software one of the
things we have to consider is creating
dark archives that won't be open until
some point in the future because I do
understand the company's economic
interest and I want you know argue open
source versus closed source there there
are good arguments on both sides but
you're right in terms of preservation
how do we do that we can try to preserve
just a box of windows 8 today but I
think we have to go much deeper and
we're starting to do that in
conversation with companies like
Microsoft I speak with the chief
archivist there regularly and so even
thus far has the museum had any
major considerations when it comes to
licensing issues with these old machines
we had a challenge around the pdp-11
operating systems and long story short a
couple of gentlemen in the United States
managed to acquire the intellectual
property rights and they're putting
together some kind of licensing program
for a time there were there were
restrictions for licensing but there was
nobody who could grant licenses they
have granted the museum a site license
so that was really a great boon to us it
opened up a whole slew of both operating
systems and machines that we had sitting
we had running we really couldn't do
anything with them because we didn't
have the rights to run software on them
and so what would you say is the biggest
thing that you notice when kids come in
here who grew up on broadband and
haven't known you know anything outside
of the world today with Facebook and
what not what would you say is the the
overarching response to these machines
at first is total confusion is this
really a computer what can I do with it
and that's one thing that modern
software vendors have done a really good
job is creating systems where you don't
have a high barrier of entry you sit
down you start moving things around they
respond to you I was thinking just the
other day how I can convey this
experience to people of the day when if
you wanted to do something with a
computer you needed to know a
programming language and it may be that
you needed to know the machines native
language its assembly language in order
to be able to make it to anything other
than flip on the lights conveying that
is really sort of interesting and what
it's about is telling them this is what
you did with this because Facebook all
of that you know that's what most people
now think of when they think about
computing but 30 years back was a much
different story and conveying that is
really important in order to explain why
these things even exist this is very
cool Ian thank you so much I really
appreciate you showing us this how can
people find the museum get involved
donate come and see it well we have a
website living computer museum org and
we're here in the Soto area of seattle
we're open thursday through sunday 10 25
and we have a we have a wish list by the
way if you have something in the attic
and you're looking at it and thinking
i'm not sure what it is go to our wish
list or just drop us a line there's a
link on the website so that you can just
send us a question send us some
information say i think i have one of
these what do you want to know and one
last question what was your first micro
let me think that would have been my
first micro actually was the TI 99 for a
that's the first one I owned my first
computer experience was punch cards on
an IBM 370 so kind of similar to what's
behind you right now exactly very cool
