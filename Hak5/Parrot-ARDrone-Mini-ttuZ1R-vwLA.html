by Toyota rock 5 i'm darren kitchen here
at CES 2014 a have the great pleasure of
being here with yoni yoni what's up fine
thank you
so when I say the parrot drone the
parrot ar.drone people typically think
of your big guy with the big foam stuff
around the rotors that you can fly
around indoors and annoy your cat with
what is this guy this is mini drone from
Perrin
so we could say it's the condense of the
technology from the drones that we
placed into that small drone okay and so
what is powering this are these what
like twenty by eight brush motors here
or what yeah that's actually 20 by a
toothbrush murders and we've designed
the propulsion system and our own
propellers to to make it fly so the
thing that that you guys are known for
is your ability to loiter and stay in a
place because you have a very unique
take on your stabilization system can
you tell me about how that might apply
to the mini so it's we have the ax 0 in
gyro so that's quite standard six axis
and we have a barometer also an
ultrasonic sensor for the altitude so it
makes it very precise it's you don't
have to care about the altitude though
and we also have a vertical camera that
tracking dot on the ground to make to
measure the speed of the drone to make
the hovering very very precise is it a
3d camera or is it one CCD or what are
we looking at it's a it's a simple VGA
camera and so is does this guy like the
other drones from Meerut provide
first-person view no not this one we
only provide we can take snapshots with
our bottom camera oh so you can get a
640 by 480 snapshot of the your cat from
above actually we can take qvj snapshots
here and and so what about the battery
life I saw that this is running a single
cell
it's a single cell 500 medium per hour
and what kind of flight time you're
gonna get with that we're gonna get up
to 7 to 8 minutes with them and what is
this unique cage I honestly have not
seen this in a micro quad so these are
wheels actually that you can remove but
when you place them on you could
actually land on the floor and actually
roll on the floor roll on the walls and
on the ceiling so it's a new new
approach for a new way to use your
quadrotor helicopter right so so rather
than rotor guards you actually provide a
means of like adding more fun and you
can like quickly take off and land
without having to worry about your
orientation
yeah well it's also protection you know
it prevents it from banging on the walls
and well you can just you can just roll
on the floor when you want and when you
tire that you just take off and so does
this does this separate the wheels to
this add a lot of weight a little bit
lower around an 8 to 10 grams to that to
this stuff so it will you will you can
fly with it like up to 6 minutes 6
minutes of battery out of the 500
milliamp hour three point seven volt
battery I'm just in awe because this
seems like the perfect travel kit while
it is slightly larger in in distance
from rotor to rotor than some of the
other micro quads on the market what's
really nice and what you guys have done
a great job of doing is augmenting the
user such that you can actually control
it realistically over your iPhone or
your Android whereas say with a walk era
or something you're just going to go
slamming into a wall is this iPhone
Android and how do you do that it will
it will be iPhone and Android and we
communicate with the drone over
Bluetooth for connection and so we just
we just use our knowledge about the the
quadrotor helicopter to to make it the
flight experience very simple so if it's
over Bluetooth what kind of you know
range and what kind of throughput are
you getting with that we can now we can
have a 30 meter range
yeah pretty pretty easily and we have a
pretty good latency for therefore the
commands so that was a pretty
challenging with this work outdoors it
would work out those yeah won't you
won't take it into windy conditions
right I mean a five mile an hour gust
would probably blow this thing rubber
right well would it carry a say a 20
gram payload no no you couldn't no wait
no weight at all
okay well still this is a very promising
of I hope first of many minis from
parrot where can they find more
information when is it available what
kind of price point we're talking so I
will be available this year and we don't
have any pricey idea all right thank you
so much it's been a pleasure for
continued coverage of all things CES
2014 head over to revision three.com
slash CES thanks once again to Toyota
for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
