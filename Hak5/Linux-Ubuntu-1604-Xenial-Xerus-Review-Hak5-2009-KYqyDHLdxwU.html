I am ready for some ground squirrels
Ubuntu 1604 LTS has dropped this time on
hack 5 hello and welcome back 5 my name
is Darren kitchen
hello and my name is Shannon Morse no
way you did like I thought it was pretty
good yeah welcome to the podcast welcome
to the show the YouTube video that what
do we call this again yeah attack 5 hack
5 there is no point in hack 5 in fact
we've been keeping it pointless for at
least a decade we have thank you for
joining us today special it is brown
squirrel Dan very say it's the gray
after Flo 20 which means it is not a it
is squirrels a well for us at least
everybody else did so today I am
checking out not drones but I'm actually
checking out the new Ubuntu from
canonical it's ubuntu 16.04 LTS the
limited support version it's called
xenial xerus hopefully I said that right
we're an Ubuntu shop here so we get
really excited when there's a new
release because I mean most everybody
here runs Ubuntu either as their main
machine or as their secondary Linux box
so I've had mint as the secondary Linux
box for forever call that an Ubuntu
derivative yeah it's a derivative
there's like a family tree where you can
trace heritage back with like Red Hat
and you know Debian and and arch and I'm
gonna give love to everybody now so for
the next half hour we're gonna list
every single distress and no one feels
like that no actually let's go ahead and
move on so I had quite a bit of a
headache going into this because I was
like cool it's the first day I'm gonna
download it early in the morning because
it might be super overloaded yay
torrents so I downloaded oovoo into 16
auto 4 installed it on my computer
except I wanted to dual boot with
Windows 10 the problem is I have you fee
or UEFI on here in
stead of a regular bios so that gave me
a bit of a headache
rikes again yeah so I know from Windows
8 on here that using a live CD is very
complicated you have to like shift
restart go into your BIOS every single
time change it to legacy SH save then
restart again and then you have to go
into these Advanced Options and Windows
8 and you have to do the same thing with
Windows 10 so it turns out that Linux
1604 are trying to install it as a dual
Ubuntu 1604 trying to dual boot it it
does not recognize that I have a Windows
boot manager so I was like you know I
know I could fix it yeah I know that I
can't wait wait so you didn't fix it no
I just frickin erased Windows 10 I was
like I was like listen Windows 10 if
you're gonna be a jerk I will have to
figure something out when it comes to
you know reviewing but this is your
laptop you just jump right in
you're just like I screw it I just
converted because you made it too hard
to dual boot sorry wouldn't Windows 10
but I just broke up with you
Wow I don't burn I mean I mean I you
know you you know I actually I just
switched from Linux to Windows 10 you
have a surface yeah actually no you know
what I'm doing this this is my 15 point
O for at least the box yep and it's now
getting replaced with the 16 Oh point
sixty point overlay Linux yes for what
this Acer Aspire gorgeous lovely machine
and I was like you know if I have to
download apps for Windows specifically
for tech thing reviews which I do have
to do time and time again which is why
I've stucked with Windows this long I'll
just do that on my PC at home or I'll
just borrow Patrick's laptop before you
get yourself of a.m. so we're talking
about 1604 today it released on April
21st if you're watching this in the
future so I've installed it I erased
Windows 10 if you didn't know who's any
old zeros well the zeros part stands for
African ground squirrel so that is why I
have a squirrel on my desktop oh so cute
look at
yes he is in fact I think there's a
resemblance would you not agree there oh
yeah adorable now uh-huh yeah yeah a
long-term support or LTS that's that's
what long-term support is it lasts for
about five years it's supported for five
years and then they have smaller
additions which are supported throughout
that time so this one specifically is
going to be one of those oh wait did you
go vanilla Ubuntu so you get the unity
experience yeah so I'm sticking with
unity right now for the review I'll
probably switch that up in the future
once I'd start doing some customizations
but just for this I'm sticking with
unity so I can explain to you the
differences with 16.04 right so if
you're like me who will be getting the
gnome Ubuntu flavor because I love me
some gnome three then you're only gonna
get three years of support which is fine
because they get beyond 1804 which will
be the next time keeping your OS
installed for that long without like
cleanly reinstalling it no it's Linux
you shouldn't have - this isn't Windows
98
okay I was gonna say this isn't Windows
but yes
so hope this version of Ubuntu brings
some really interesting changes there's
quite a few different kinds of upgrades
on the back end so I figure let's go
ahead and start with you you know that
the invisible spark we got going on
right here so first off linux kernel
that is what everything basically runs
on it's version 4.4 it does have some
updates there's an Intel skylake
processor update so they're bringing in
more support for newer laptops
I've been grading for this release yeah
for months to put on this machine now
unfortunately there's a lot of AMD users
out there that require AMD Radeon for
gaming and things of that nature so
unfortunately for graphics intensive
purposes AMD Radeon drivers aren't quite
ready so if you are doing like video
editing or if you're playing lots of
video games I would suggest waiting and
sticking with the older version of LTS
support for the time being until they
actually get those drivers upgraded and
ready until their credit AMD is also
making a big push in open source so I
mean I'm hoping that you know
they're behind us yeah they might be
like trying to move over to their open
source AMD drivers let's let's let's see
where it goes see there's some other
random drivers now available like they
got an upgrade for a Corsair keyboards
which kind of works because today
Corsair just announced a new keyboard as
well the keyboard uses pc/104 scan code
break that there's Logitech G 29 racing
wheel updates that are available so for
your service I guess I don't know some
weird stuff like that and there's like
one guy waiting is like yes I can
operate the Linux now one guy who's been
arguing on the forums for this long is
finally getting it yes finally five
stars well actually if anything I think
this is more indicative of a major
change in the industry and we're seeing
like gaming peripherals support is an
important part of the whole Linux
ecosystem now why be honest team on
Linux it's because gaming on there as a
viable platform so if anything is like
with Vulcan and everything else this is
shaping up to be hey you know what let's
call it 2016
no no 2017 it will take a little at 17
next year will be the year of Linux on
the desktop you can port around that and
then there's a few other little updates
Toshiba laptops updates have been
announced for the new 16.04 2 so yeah
good for you guys
so now there's this additional upgrade
for ZFS file containers kind of weird I
know but pretty cool for file storage so
ZFS could be used in Ubuntu for quite a
while now but you have to do it kind of
third-party so now it's fully integrated
it is supported by canonical ZFS
basically combines a volume manager like
LVM for example with a file system like
ext for both together into one file
container called ZFS so ZFS is really
handy for anybody who wants to use an
operating system on a server for example
so if you want to one run boon to on a
server or for an ass so if you're
running like freenas on an ass ZFS can
be extremely helpful in those cases
because it stores the files and then it
checks the data integrity often and very
very often via check stubs and a bunch
of other mathematical algorithm this is
actually this is super exciting if
you're going to be
like running on Cluster or virtual
machines and things of that nature ZFS
is like fantastic for that yes I know
that there are currently some bugs with
the Zen which is my preferred hypervisor
right now so just keep that in mind so
you don't jump in and then realize like
Oh defile system you know work you right
now but you know it's early days so the
other thing that they have introduced is
this thing called snaps so you probably
noticed that the Ubuntu Software Center
has gotten replaced by gnome software
actually you've already upgraded it I
would say you may not have noticed
because they kept a very similar icon
and then renamed it from gnome software
icon was upgraded like updated to a
different graphic just barely and they
changed the name to boon to software
from gnome software yeah yeah thanks hey
thanks thanks pretty cool software no
we're gonna take that now our name on it
and I ended up in unity I have my own
beef with that so but the reason that it
was replaced is because these new things
called snaps so snaps can be installed
right alongside the regular debian
applications the ones that ended de Bie
which is what you use to install like
every application on hulu - right you
actually just had to do this with
installing from right you download the
Deb and I go to installing with under
list yeah you do DP hee-jae dpkg Takei
and then the Deb in the Newbery wrapper
dependency dependency to the end select
all the dependencies and install those
and then do the tack force and the blah
blah and then finally your application
sweating so I mean I love you dad you're
great I hate dealing with dependencies
I'll be honest it drives me nuts every
single time I try to download something
you say oh you need like 50 dependencies
I'm just like really if only somebody
could make whatever yeah it's always lit
if only we could make installing
software on Linux us now if only so yeah
see what they did there surprise price
so in the case of snaps they are
self-contained packages they have their
own dependencies built in so they won't
need to change anything on your machine
to run so snaps are supposed to help
integrate for application developers
it's supposed to help them integrate the
whole suite of operating systems that
canonical is running so from Ubuntu on
PC to boot you on smartphones - bun - on
TV like IO - stuff yeah
yeah exactly so they're trying to make
it easier for application developers to
be able to develop just one program and
be able to use it across multiple
platforms and I think that's really
really cool that they're trying to step
out of just the desktop just the servers
and everything like that and try to get
into you know more mainstream which I
hope is gonna welcome more people into
the Linux environment yeah it's a really
interesting architecture I love the
whole concept of it we'll see if it
catches on it seems to be the direction
that many other things are going go for
example yeah but yeah well more on that
later yes
they don't touch anything on your
computer they don't change any of the
dependencies that you're using for
dubbings so for example if you wanted to
download something outside of the
software Center like a new desktop
environment so when you want to download
your desktop environment you could maybe
use a snap instead of a dot DB because
it'll give you less risk because you're
not changing all those things on the
back system right and so I don't have
that risk where something then updates
and then breaks an application which is
the reason why kind of getting ahead of
ourselves but I mean remember like
backtrack like what was the number one
reason why penetration testers love
backtrack it's because all these little
esoteric tools this one requires a
Python library from 2.6 and this one
requires a thing from and maybe will
update this one thing then it breaks all
these other things and it's just like so
you end up with sure outdated stuff but
at least it all works because like every
year or so there would be like a new
version or backtrack now rolling distros
cally kind of the direction that we're
going so this is just like in Bolton on
top of that that is going to make it
much nicer go forward because it's like
oh I require that esoteric thing cool
it's just built in and so when you
update that other esoteric thing it's
not going to break everything so left
breaking everything so back to that
gnome software or boon to software as
they're calling it so this works just
like the older software Center but it
has more support for that in those new
snap apps hence why they switched from
the Ubuntu Software Center over to the
gnome software so there are some new
apps on the front end for example and I
can show you on my computer now built-in
there's an
you know calendar which is pre-installed
there's also a new like webcam software
that's pre installed all the libres eat
sweets they're still included they have
a few updates and then we move on to
unity so unity it's had a pretty big
update so the unity is changing from the
old version up to 7.4 the biggest change
is that online search queries are off by
default - thank God Helly that was like
so what you're saying is that when I
type something in like banana into my
computer it's not going to start like
offering to sell me bananas on Amazon
exactly great so of course if you want
to you can still go over to your
security and privacy settings and you
can go over to search and turn that back
on but it's so nice that it's off by
default I really appreciate that privacy
advocates I'm sure they appreciate it
just as much as I do
because I didn't like it you know
searching that online search straight
from my desktop it's just kind of creepy
mmm
the launcher position can now be set to
the bottom of the unity desktop instead
of just on the side oh yeah I saw the
feature request there was like people
asking for that like apparently 4 years
6 years ago yeah story because I kind of
liked it on the side but if you want to
change the late 9th reso you know what
else so it's still kind of hidden it
still requires a terminal command if you
choose to download it that way but it is
built-in is just hidden so the way you
get it is through this decomp editor
it's D conf editor you can just google
it and download eBay if you want to but
it opens up this completely different
editor for all of these different like
customizations on the back end so you go
under com canonical choose unity and go
to launcher and you can choose left or
and it's kind of buggy and you can
choose bottom so it changes it down to
the bottom but I don't like that so I'm
gonna leave it on the left so that's a
nice little additional upgrade that they
chose to create yeah the GUI does seem a
little bit faster than the previous
version but that's just based on my own
personal judge are you gonna sky like I
am on an older I 5 processor
skylake but of course this is a newer
version of the operating system fresh
installs I do have a fresh install so
back in a few weeks your findings may
vary if you have different hardware your
you know your your hardware may change
everything on your operating system who
knows but my Software Center that's one
of the big years that I've been having
with it so yeah that's my Software
Center it's just not it's just not no it
doesn't want to you know what this
doesn't it's like it's like maybe it's
the one with the stone over today right
yeah luckily I have the terminal so I
can app get everything that I need yay
but I'm which is great I'm so glad you
can do that in new boo - yeah you know
what X jeez well you know mwn based
because cuz everybody else is crying out
about yum and RPM and everything else
you know we hear you but I'm glad that
there is a command that I can run
instead of just using the GUI or else
I'd be totally screwed but I suspect
this is just because you know it's
brand-new and there's still bugs for
them to figure out it might be because
they're super super busy and overloaded
in the software Center today since it
was the first day it was announced
otherwise I haven't noticed any
additional bugs with the application or
the operating system itself so far I'm
enjoying it yeah it seems pretty quick
and it seems like it's it's patched up a
lot of issues that people have had in
the past and I like that they included
all those back-end upgrades - for like
the new processors oh man be a big one
that's actually a lot of the upgrades
that I'm I've been waiting for I mean I
literally have this machine right here
ready to go
but the skylake support wasn't there and
indiana mess with the betas cuz you know
you can install the beta and play with
it but then when it comes to the
official release like wipe that out do a
clean install yeah cool is the point so
I'm excited to get that going and then
get my Windows VMs in Linux using the
VMware Workstation which is just like my
go-to for the desktop side right now but
you know otherwise I'm really excited
about some of the more back-end stuff
like they tell me about what you found
well DSA kicking around for a long time
not necessarily the best
part of SSH and sshd in Ubuntu is now
killing off v1 support so no more
downgrade attacks which is kind of
fantastic just making things a little
bit more secure by default those snaps
really excited about that we talked
about dependency held now gone well
hopefully if this gets adopted it really
depends on whether or not developers
yeah pick this up the framework seems
pretty simple the way that it's like if
the architecture is based on parts and
plugins and the way that you put it
together is with this pull build and
staging system that like kind of
compartmentalizes everything it seems
like if it gets adopted well I hope it
does because on the one hand you get
isolation yeah which means they like
everything yeah if everything runs in a
sandbox is not going to mess up the rest
of your system yeah and then if your
system updates some stuff it's not going
to break your other applications so that
sounds cool and it means that if that
does get adopted less and less we will
be like adding PPAs to our stuff which
is always a good thing for security
otherwise yeah so the snap packages I'm
very excited about the rollback feature
on that is kind of nice
what is the rollback well yeah just the
whole idea that if like you know you can
do more quicker iterative development
where you can just like run something
because you know that it's not gonna
break other dependencies everything else
on your system is relying on yeah so you
can like run it test it and be like nope
this bogus and then roll back to a
previous version yeah without it
altering all of the peripheral
dependencies that other applications on
your system maybe depending on I can see
how this can get clogged G quick if if
you've got tons of snaps and you have
duplication supposedly updates are done
with like differentials because since
it's going to conclude libraries or
potentially can't include libraries
within the application for all of its
dependencies I mean you're talking about
really bloating the system there if
you've got like 14 versions of Python
2.7
hopefully that's taking I haven't dug in
enough to see but it is interesting that
when they update the apps they only get
the the diffs so you don't have to
duplicate code that you've already
downloaded that's good otherwise I did
not did you do version 15 point 10
No so so 15 I'm going from 15 point oh
four so I'm like on every year I like to
format yeah and so I missed the the big
change but now it's for me and everybody
else the big change is the first time
introducing in a long term support
version is system D is now taking over
everything it's replaced up start which
replaced s been in it which replaced
probably a million other things I mean I
still find myself using D and all sorts
of stuff anyway so whatever I guess I
don't know I haven't dug in enough
really it's just gonna change like
service start whatever to assist CTL
whatever start but there's a really good
link in the show notes that I'll put
about learning how to figure out that
because you just have to wrap your
brand-new Brown how everything is done
in units and then you've got services
and journals which you're like basically
services like you're used to and then
you journals collect the logs well I
don't know it's it's just a different
way of thinking but I heard that they're
putting in a full Software Center in
system D they're gonna put in a word
processor application it's gonna be
really great we're all just gonna love
some running system D in the future by
the way if you're watching I feature
please comment below and let us know
what happened so we can see no we can't
see them until then damn it
haha YouTube comments you are sorely
lacking ah you know it isn't sorely
lacking what our awesome sponsor whoo
see what I did there we're gonna take a
quick moment to thank our awesome
sponsor domain.com and if you've been
following hack 5 for a while you know
how much we love them they make it super
simple to take your awesome idea and get
it onto the internet because the domain
registration system is phenomenal it
gets your website up and online in no

at domain.com when you use the coupon
code hak5 and in addition to that you
know what go ahead even if you're not
going to get domain today and you're
just thinking well that's rad that
they're supporting hack 5 you should
tweet them at domain.com and say hey
thanks for supporting hack 5 and when
you think domain names think domain.com
so Shannon as soon as I get this surface
book and I get it all loaded up with
Premiere and Photoshop and illustrator
because of course Adobe get on the linux
already does this now mean I should just
format this thing and go 1604 Ubuntu you
know place Windows completely given that
I've only had like eight hours with
Ubuntu 1604 and you do use Windows for a
lot of graphical editing and video
editing purposes not necessarily it
really would depend on your own you just
did your own users just jumped right in
I don't edit on this machine you should
have seen her in her office she's like
screwing just replacing windows for my
USB in my like Windows I so us be across
the room I was just like I don't need
this anyway she also has a gaming rig at
home so you know yeah I do yeah I am
looking forward to hearing the trials
and tribulations of Linux on the desktop
for the snubs eboo I'm super couple of
weeks yes yeah let us know like what
tweaks she should be doing on a fresh
install we'll get back to you on kind of
the pain points already run into a few
like minor stuff yeah SMB is fun yay yep
yeah that's a good time and of course
keep in mind we have some trips coming
up oh this is very exciting
yeah and sign up on the hack five dot
org now so sorry that's now look there
now
yay okay good well if it's not you can
go to Sonoma c-calm slash blog to find
all the information about my meetup in
Tokyo Japan on May 23rd keep that
bookmarked just in case we have to
change venues yes or just follow at
snubs that's always a good call and I
forget the date ours it's gonna be early
your first week of June in Sydney
Australia so Sebastian and I will be
there we're going out for a cert which
is a big security conference in the Gold
Coast it's gonna be a lot of fun so I'm
looking for you're going to be there
yeah and beyond the southern hemisphere
will be exciting let's go backwards down
there do I have to sit on them backward
like what how does that work you do
actually like what see this is why
people should be following us
five Darren it's Nazi okay so with that
feedback in hack five org is actually
the more appropriate place to send us
your feedback and not anything
inappropriate hack shop comm is another
fantastic place a take a shop comm if
you've been seeing act five for a
longest time we're like want to support
us directly we make awesome fun hacker
gear if you're into you know penetration
testing you will find an arsenal
awaiting you over at hae shop calm and
thank you for supporting us all these
years and allowing us to do this I'm
hungry sorry I just got a hunger pee and
only guy want some potato chips see you
need to support us otherwise we're not
gonna be able to afford the potato chips
