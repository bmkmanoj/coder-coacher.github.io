by domain.com so muaks if that is your
real name actually somebody said that
you go is rob fuller actually no I
mentioned rob fuller and they were like
huh and I'm like you know muvek so like
oh yeah I knew move looks nice that's
dude it's good to see you here you or
did you were giving a talk on on all the
fiddly bits all the fun little stuff
that you don't learn in hacker school
right right so we're essentially went
over a bunch of different little tricks
that Chris gates and I that gave the
presentation also known as carnal ownage
and the stuff that they don't teach you
in class that's not in the ethical
hacking books it's not in you know all
those little things maybe the unethical
Novak's hacking book well no it's it's
just the old school stuff that they
don't teach anymore like they think it's
old stuff so it's kind of funny actually
went to talk about old stuff that we've
been like hard on development with these
rubber ducky stuff and here i am using
copy con i haven't used the copy space
con command which is pretty much
undocumented since like dos five it's
great for web servers to it's great for
web servers all right so what kind of
fiddly bits and tricks and stuff were
you playing with so two of the things
that we released and we really said a
ton of different tools I used railgun to
access the windows api through
interpreter Oh rail gun on the familiar
with rail gun alright so railgun is an
extension or not really an extension
it's part of the standard API now of
meterpreter and it is a direct access to
the windows api so anything the windows
api can do which is pretty much anything
windows can do is is accessible now
through meterpreter so you're not
sitting there writing net commands and
trying to a good trying to find a way
through the command line to do all of
that fun stuff right so one of the
things i released and which is my baby
because i worked on it for like almost
two years is net discovery so net
discovery when you run a net command our
net view you get a list of computers and
a lot of people don't know that but its
net people have been having fun with net
since
send asterisk the hello world yeah so
but the problem is you get a list of
computers and then you got to look up
the computers right you have to find out
what they are and the API that actually
powers that is I don't remember the name
of it but it comes back with a lot more
data it comes back with the version of
the computer so stuff that isn't
actually displayed back to the user but
the day is their right it comes so
another thing it comes back with this
description and everybody knows that
that's in that view okay but one of the
final pieces is this services number
which is essentially a cumulative number
or a hex bit that gets incremented up as
more services are there so if the box
actually has microsoft sequel on it you
can find that out so net discovery you
can say hey show me all the sequel boxes
on a domain right and it'll do that the
other thing is once that discoveries
done with enumerate all that information
it will then look up the IPS for
everything so a lot of targeting when
you're running metasploit is based on IP
ranges so if you get on a box and you
hit like 192 168 1 not whatever / 24 you
might be missing like nine other offices
that that company has whereas the net
view will show you all the ranges that
they have all the computers right let's
say you're not like sitting there just
like trying all of them right and since
I'm using Rex which is the exploitation
library that's built into metasploit GM
and stuff you can copy that out into a
CSV so there's your target list right so
net discovery if you look at the very
bottom as the cumulative number of
services that's what ever is the largest
number is obviously the thing that has
the most services so I sorted oh ok so
the it doesn't actually say oh this bit
is for this service and that bit is for
you know I ass and sequel and peach grad
peachtree online said peachtree maybe
maybe i had to do that recently i had to
do that recently it was so bad anyway um
is it just says oh I have seven services
well it's it's a number but you're not
going to know exactly what it is but in
the post module you can say show me only
domain controllers or show me
unix systems or show me only novell
systems or sequel servers or whatever so
i have a list of things you can look for
specifically and there's a ton there it
doesn't say in the output which it is
how did you go about doing all of that I
mean did you just like is some Python or
what pearl or look I don't know I'm just
saying like how did you go about this
Ruby so it's all in Ruby it's just a
post module in my suite okay fair enough
it's all going to be released all the
stuff that we did is going to be
released on github because the
submission process goes through Egypt
which takes four years to get at least
one thing why does it take four years to
get the region I have no idea I mean I
understand that it's across the pond but
I think he's just lazy oh okay mmm nice
well it sounds like you guys are doing
some fantastic work over a rapid seven
and you guys are doing the the
metasploit training here it's really
good to see you rob around where can
people find the code I know you're
always blogging and everything people
already know the or elder say it with me
now room to see Susan dude calm thanks
Rob no it needs to be something more
like straight forward but USB rubber
ducky calm no it should be more hardcore
like wait tactical saltdogs car I'm
leaning towards programmable human
interface device calm is that you typing
