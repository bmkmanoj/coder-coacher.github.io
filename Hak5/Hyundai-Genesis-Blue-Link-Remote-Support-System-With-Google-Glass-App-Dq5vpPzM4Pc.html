by Toyota with hack 5 I'm Shannon Morse
from CES 2014 at digital experience and
I found Eva a fellow glassware hi Eva
how are you meet you nice to meet you
too so she is with Hyundai and you guys
have a very cool new app for glass and
I'm kind of excited because now I need
to buy one of these because this is
awesome I love this new car it's
beautiful so tell me about the app well
what we've done is we've taken the most
popular pooling features like the remote
star pew I searched and sent a car we've
actually customized that for the glass
interface so as you're probably familiar
with a glass interface is pretty it's
pretty basic it's a simple swipe left
right very flat interface so I can show
you our Genesis app here so we're going
to tap in and our remote features are
front and center so you have access to
the remote start door lock unlock horn
lights your flashing lights and you can
actually send a remote start right now
and what they will do is send you a
notification card of the results that is
so cool that these are all really useful
features especially for somebody like me
I'll lose my car in a parking lot and
I'll need to find it or it gets super
cold sometimes especially now for the
East Coast they'll want to remote start
their car right absolutely so you
brought up a good point so this whole
experience is really for outside of the
car we're really focused on a pre drive
experience for our mobile apps and you
know obviously our new class app and
we've included features like Qi search
and sends a car so you can actually
search for P oh I get it to your Genesis
before you even get there so you know if
you live on the East Coast you can
search we can search for Starbucks you
know oh there it is
now it's sending it to Google and we'll
see if we're able to access the Google
results so return me to homescreen and
once it gets the result it'll actually
give me a card of all of the PIO i
results nearby that's cool now I know
that Pio I is built into Google glass
but it's nice to have this and built
into the app as well for the car
absolutely so it actually heard me wrong
it actually search for restaurants but I
can't show you if we do want to go to a
restaurant and send it to the Genesis we
can do it right here and it just sends
it to my Genesis that is so cool now the
Genesis is this is a new line the ones
that are being introduced at I believe
it's the Detroit Convention next week is
that correct yes that's correct so it'll
be the official unveiling where we're
covering all of the cool features that
the new Genesis will have so what else
is included I have to know well we can
walk you through our Genesis intelligent
assistant app it's more of a proactive
app what to really remind you of when
you should remote start you know when
you should you know if you forgot to
lock your doors it'll it'll hit you up
and you know many more convenient
features it's just another step in our
and you know our goal to make bluelink
even more convenient for our features
for our customers the and what is blue
link for anybody that's not familiar
with it yet so blue link is our embedded
connected vehicle functionality like you
know remote start/stop all the obvious
stuff you know py search and sent a car
you know find my car if you lost it in a
parking lot which I've done several
times and when it can I actually buy a
Genesis Genesis myself um very soon
it'll be coming into spring oh yay oh I
can't wait to check it out I'm so
excited I'll have to take a test drive
with one of these new guys because
they're so pretty now I'm kind of
thinking we should hop inside that car
and check it out
sounds like a plan all right thank you
