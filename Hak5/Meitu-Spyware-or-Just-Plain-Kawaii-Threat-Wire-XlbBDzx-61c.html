spyware lavabit is back Chelsea
Manning's jail time gets commuted and
the u.s. people still need pics or it
didn't happen regarding Russia's hack of
the DNC and our MC coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire through tuesday
january twenty four twenty seventeen
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and internet freedom
patrons over at patreon.com splash
threat wire we have reached our goal for
a video RSS and the RSS is now live the
link to our RSS feed as well as the
itunes feed are below in the show notes
otherwise you can also search for threat
wire and that's threat space wire in
your favorite podcasting app to find the
show thank you again to our patrons
because you made this possible first up
may to how kawaii cute does a nap have
to be to get people to ignore all the
permissions that at once from your phone
in the case of May to a Chinese selfie
editing app pretty dang cute but weirdly
it needs a heck of a lot of permissions
at laughing mantis on Twitter points out
that it retrieves data on running apps
your location your phone status your
photo storage and that one's kind of
obvious since it is a photo editing app
phone identity information it can also
change system display settings change
audio settings and even more and then at
four off pets on Twitter points out that
it sends your imei which is your
device's special ID number two servers
in China he later discovered that the
app also sends your calendar contacts
and more to servers as well the Android
version is of more concern than the iOS
version and the app has been out for
several years and has many million
downloads security minded folks assume
that the data collection is probably to
sell to advertisers since the
application is free and selling data to
advertisers allow for more profits for
the company but it could potentially be
a sign of a much larger problem with
your privacy and security mates you
responded to this moment in the
spotlight by making a statement about
why the data is collected and that it is
transmitted via encrypted platforms so
should you download me too well I didn't
mostly because I am paranoid and I
weirdly check my permissions for us
so I know that's not a common thing to
do and it does take up a lot of time if
you are worried just don't download it
there are plenty of other kawaii selfie
apps in the Play Store to choose from
and many of them are free trust me i
know because i am all into that kind of
stuff surprise on january twentieth
inauguration day in the US lavabit rose
from the ashes to reclaim its place on
the internet if you remember back in
2013 lavabit the email platform of
choice by Edward Snowden was sent
request by the US government agencies to
install surveillance equipment on their
servers as well as hand the government
encryption keys for users so it was
instead shut down by the owner and
founder ladera Leveson because he did
not want to violate the rights of
citizens using the email platform for
their day-to-day tasks after
crowdfunding for a few years Leveson is
re-releasing lavabit with new encryption
protocols designed so that even lavabit
won't be able to read your emails it's
built on an open-source encrypted
communications platform coined as dime
which stands for dark internet mail
environment and it will use magma as
it's open source mail server old users
can reopen their accounts with lavabit
starting today however you will not have
access to your old emails but new users
will have to wait till it's all up and
running accounts will cost fifteen
dollars annually and up depending on
storage needed and when you register you
can read up on the new release as well
as the different modes of operation on
lavabit's website linked in the show
notes in a last minute decision by
President Obama before Trump took office
chelsea manning who leaked thousands of
government documents to Wikileaks way
back in 2010 will be released from her
jail time on May seventeenth and was
originally supposed to be detained until
2045 she was an army intelligence
analyst who sent documents to Wikileaks
proving higher death counts of civilians
in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as
wrongful violence against journalists by
a u.s. helicopter Manning was originally
arrested in 2010 and has been a major
component for human rights activists due
to the Army's denial of medical care
while she's been in custody if you are
unfamiliar with gender dysphoria I have
included a link to this medical
condition below so what does this mean
for other whistleblowers according to a
White House
person earlier this month Snowden's
leaked documents were quote far more
serious and far more dangerous inclining
that we basically won't be seeing any
pardons for him but while Snowden isn't
seeking a pardon from the US government
at this time he has received a new
three-year visa from Russia which will
allow him to apply for Russian
citizenship in 2018 last summer we saw
the first inkling of an ongoing debate
about whether or not Russia hack the
Democratic National Committee as well as
Quinton's email server and the DNC see
signs pointed to yes due to crowd
strikes monitoring of DNC networks which
was continuing as well as US
intelligence agencies agreeing with this
case but skeptics continue to request
further proof from the US government as
the usual technical explanation of the
hack is classified and not available to
the general public or other cyber
security professionals for analysis a
full report of the u.s. findings by the
Office of the Director of National
Intelligence was just released detailing
social media disinformation aka
alternative facts fishing campaigns
against the DNC and RNC and propaganda
the methods used to find data confirming
it was Russian state sponsored or source
information was not included and is
still classified FBI director James
Comey discussed in a hearing before the
senate select committee that the hack of
the RNC data did happen but thats stolen
data was never released leading
government officials to believe that the
hacks were purposively done to get Trump
into the White House thank you again for
