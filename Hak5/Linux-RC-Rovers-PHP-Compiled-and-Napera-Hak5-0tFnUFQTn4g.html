web enabled remote control tank Darren
kicks it off with part one of the heck
house rover project and Matt's back with
the second part of the nuh para indigo
beta and can PHP code be compiled Jodie
Franklin comes by with a sweet IP we're
mapping executable all that and some
crazy banter on this episode elves hak5
this episode of pack 5 is brought to you
by godaddy Netflix Squarespace and
viewers like you hello and welcome to
this episode of hak5 this is your weekly
dose of techno lyst my name is shin on
and on I'm Taryn kitchen I'm at less
stock he's thrown us for a loop like
every episode is changing would you just
call her before taping snuggles snuggles
Shedaisy Shedaisy shenanigans I like
symbols it sounds like a it just sounds
like an 80s like as long as it's not the
squiggle cuz I do not follow any sort of
red coat Snuggie oh yeah it's like it's
like a glowworm of snus yeah so what we
goin on excellent show for you guys as
always I'm excited about season 5 it has
lots of new prospects like I'm tearing
apart toys and playing with solder and
the whole I'm gonna start building stuff
and then season four I got roots
heartedly busy at the end of season so
we kind of pushed a bunch of stuff off
to season five including the thing that
yes me but yes really you ready ok I'm
ready you I've got enough oh it's just
what I think it is yeah oh yeah so it's
gonna go ape over there right there
right little paper the speakers and open
perfect yes I'm so excited that'll be
perfect you guys are good parties yeah
but before then i'm going to be kicking
off the first part of our hack house
Rover this is something that is
web-enabled it is based on a RC tank and
with cameras and RFID eventually off fun
stuff you'll have fun playing with a
drover if it's a tank well don't tanks
Rove oh thanks okay well I'm gonna call
it a rover we're gonna drink all right
so uh so let's see owasso we have Jodie
Franklin coming down from Chesapeake
Virginia to talk to us about about PHP
and it turns out you can compile it and
cause guiding the code yeah sweet piece
of code that allow us to do basically an
IP re numbering which we talked about
for and when I mentioned for you if
we're like a brief moment at the end of
the night ring
Oh issues I just realized why it's not
working I have to buy us off for some
how are you gonna do that for you no way
I think I've got it it's what is this
Ranma I'm rum and I ok it's got a marble
inside of it it's from Japan or
something I don't know careful with the
glass Gray has got to be like one of the
most dangerous drinks ever but it's
awesome it's so much fun whenever you're
sitting in a mall and you put it on the
ground and you just go bam and its views
everywhere it's great good fun all right
we're good all right let's get the show
started guys you guys I have fun with
your little we are talking about panera
later right no no Mara no para um I was
really shocked at the amount of response
we got for the comparison last week you
are playing with a piece of data
software of course yeah good it's I got
an email from Todd Hooper the CEO and
founder of nuh para on some
clarifications and exactly what the
product is and stuff like that so he
like look noob no actually he showed it
to the entire office and they absolutely
we're blown away about it by the oh wow
so uh we're gonna be going through a
couple things and clearing up some you
know things that weren't really
announced but kind of glide blah blah
you've got some cool Microsoft
integration that like blows me away
because while it's actually done right
yeah cuz ad integration when it comes to
other stuff feel like I use ldap I want
a shirt that says F ldap sorry yeah it
is so you have all the last behind the
con that is epic any systems
administrator that has dealt with ldap
on the level that you or I have will
know that yeah that was I'm running on
about three hours of sleep cool well
let's get started so we can get you to
bdubs good stuff so you guys have along
with your over action mmm I'm gonna go
over look at kittens have fine I do
Darren mm-hmm you have a laptop a
soldering iron an RC car and a tank over
here what the are you doing man you
know I also have sharp pointy hats great
and hot pointy things Oh God we all know
you didn't get hurt in the last season
and you have to get hurt in this one I'm
not going to yeah you will if I keep
playing with that I what are we doing we
are building a rover that you can drive
around your house and we'll eventually
have all sorts of crazy features like
webcams and and RFID readers like a
wireless webcam on it yeah yeah okay so
the idea is that you may have seen
things out there called like Rovio's and
all sorts of other autonomous things you
can log in and drive around whatever
sure they're expensive and and the other
otherwise they're boring they're they're
not they're not DIY and this is fun this
is basically doing yourself for the sake
of doing yourself this is pretty badass
i gotta say i have a bunch of boys
around i had to play with them there was
some good stuff we got over her yeah so
i wanted to put together one of these
kits oh and basically i'm just going to
take a cheap tank here that i picked up
locally for like fifteen dollars it's a
cheap tank that has a cheap controller
and that's very important because it's
got a controller based on digital
switches rather than potentiometers
right okay okay I'm going to take a
fidget USB interface and I'm going to
take some solder ciplox iron multimeter
wired various other and I'm going
to put it all together to end basically
web control it so you guys can drag
around what's a fidget so a fidget is
this nifty little web it's I'm sorry
it's a midget it's not a mission it's a
little tiny board that's got four
awesome relays and a USB interface you
can find them at fidgets calm and think
I got that pulled up here and they've
got various different kits available
this is the 0 for 4 model it only has
four outputs but you can also get ones
with you know with 16 yeah
and then digital and analog ins all
sorts of stuff this yeah I be 16 volt
will actually end up upgrading this
later when we add some other features on
to it but um but the main idea here is I
mean it like 60 bucks I can control
relays from C code in Linux nice okay
and then what realized you are basically
they'll take a circuit and it's just a
switch so yeah and that's exactly how
the controller works so i can switch it
I actually have a demo hear of another
vehicle I got this uh this was a like a
Hummer or similar like that and i wanted
to i took the board apart because i want
to show you I've already got this one
baked I want to show you what actually
goes on to make this happen when you the
joystick is normally like this and like
when you hit the joystick all it does is
connect these little circuits and you
can actually see you know we're moving
here so that's nifty I've gone ahead and
put some some jumpers on here so you can
see when i connect these jumpers okay so
make a move yes neat so I'm working and
if great so I've got him jumped and I
could just go ahead and wire them right
into my fidget but that's really not
going to look pretty I'm and I'm not
saying that that this looks pretty trust
me i know but eventually i want
something that can fit in a project box
so i need to solder this all together
okay here's the thing i don't want to
solder onto these points and onto that
board to add you know right onto this
little contact area what i want to do is
find the areas in here that these
actually that the traces connect to okay
let's find it yes so we have a
multimeter set to continuity when we
touch those they will beep so that means
if we take I'll take one here and put it
on the green on that wire there and if
you what we're trying to do here is find
where this ends up going to okay so go
to like one of the eye sees there's one
um and like any over there no okay think
that white one here is it yay yeah that
one's heavy great so we have a point
that it that it ends up you know
terminating at sometimes just on a nice
sometimes not but what we want to do is
use that point to go ahead and solder a
little wire in okay all right you know
you can solder I'll just here why don't
you um just be careful sis on yes um
I'll take a wire here that just got any
simple a wire that's gonna go to my
leads on my relays and go ahead and melt
that I'm just the white one right there
normally I'd dip this in a little bit of
force to make it easier but I think I
already got some flux on you and up
faster more intense here we go that was
it haha so we use what Jesus sing on
there it makes it a little bit easier
and I've gone ahead and done the same
thing with eight different points yes
with eight different points on here I
lied seven one of them's bridged it's
kind of weird the way that they've got
cheap on the board there the other thing
that i've done is i've replaced the 27
megahertz crappy antenna that came with
it with a pop to pigtail on there and
put a little antenna that I ripped off
of a router I'm going to putting a like
a 9dbi antenna on this I know it's made
for 27 megahertz not 2.4 gigahertz but
we're gonna need all the range we can
maybe it'll work maybe a ham operator
will email me with lots of technical
details about why I'm absolutely wrong
but that's okay so this guy works now so
this guy works now so if we were to do
he's supposed to yes so this is now the
green wire so if for instance you
touched this one to this one I think
that'll yeah oh cool we guys work
awesome that's awesome or it's better
with batteries too all right let's get
this guy out of out of the way yes so it
is time to go ahead and actually take a
look at the back end what actually makes
this work yes um the Assembly of this
guy is is not that exciting but I will
detail i already have detailed pictures
on flickr and will i want on the wiki so
you can follow along at home if you do
end up finding this particular model
otherwise like I said find the leads
solder them put them on your board and
now some C code oye SI code I'm excited
what are you excited
put the church on the cool thing about
fidgets is that they have api's and
example code for for their interface
kits as well as they make more than just
interface kids they've got like
temperature sensors and servo motors all
sorts of cool stuff so if you're
interested in starting an electronics
like I obviously I'm right now go ahead
and check them out but they do provide
lots of awesome documentation and
example code so I'm using C in lenox
right here they also have Java and
Python but let's take a look at some of
the code I actually have this is an
example file that basically just
initializes the device it's like it's
the simplest little example do you write
this note this is there's all I did was
I went in here modified the place where
where this is like their starter code to
like get you you know get your project
started one not so we've got our device
initialized and all I'm really doing is
making use of this function here see
fidget interface kit set output state
that tells our our relays what to do
I've got them wired into the normally
the normal open position on all of my
wires here which means that our switches
just isn't there next yeah yeah they're
open in no connection it's not doing
anything yes and that's what we when we
say and the the parameters that we pass
the arguments that we passed to this
function are IFK for interface kit 0 1 2
and 3 for the different realizing i want
an either a 0 or a 1 so so 0 for open 14
close exactly yet so this particular
file tells the fidgets to make a right
turn it actually spins right so what we
want to do is run that again once we've
zeroed everything out until 0 and 3 to
go closed and I know because I've
labeled here 0 tells the left track to
go forward and 3 tells the right track
to go backwards okay and since it's a
tank yeah yeah since it's a tank so it
was it left track goes forward right
track goes backwards so its assistance
yeah well um and that's the nice thing
about having the tank rather than like a
normal RC cars i can do likes get more
signs not with these guys now once i
once I've told it to do that I need it
to take a nap and just wait a minute
while those connections are closed
before we reset them again so normally
in co just use sleep but that's only
four seconds so in this particular
instance I want to use you sleep I've
said it for 500 milliseconds that means
nanoseconds so what is that 500,000
nanoseconds yeah and then we just put
everything we reset everything again
okay I've gone ahead and taken this
example code and you're gonna a lot of
you can cringe I've taken this example
file and created 12 different copies of
it one of them tells it to go forward
for a second for 42 seconds for three
seconds same for backwards and then same
for turning left and turning right for
200 milliseconds 500 milliseconds and
one second I think you need a coder I
probably need to help but you see ya but
but now that we can do that i'll show
you in in the command line i can just
you know pop over to here and as a page
okay and type dot slash back low oh and
i gotta drive it around now or I can um
spin right dash hi Vic type
what am I tighten around here LS a right
spin it's been a spin rights like some
other like hard drive program I think
right spin heart how did I do that wrong
again left spit Spanish hi you know
autocrat win in Linux thank you um so
hooray i can control from the command
line but what we really want to do is
put on the web no God of course it
wouldn't be a daren't I shoulda known
yeah when you go to Darren segment
unless I had some PHP and some Apache
and then I could like grab my cell phone
and control it from there so let me show
you the web interface and i will have
the code for this up on the web that
basically you see her i have these it's
very cute I've got these different
buttons then all they simply do is
answer form elements that refresh that
PHP page it checks for them if they're
set there's a case break something else
which there's a switch case that says if
it's this if it's visits and then tells
it to exec or system that those little
programs that I made and see or modified
incisions real quick hack together is
the right term well already the idea
behind this project is i'm going to show
you as we progress through this and
build this Rover for you guys to play
with that hack house calm all of the
additional features so when we get the
webcam and then do some fun stuff with
that when we get the RFID all that stuff
I want to share with you guys so here it
is the first step to get you started
already one of our ustream friends jay-z
man went ahead Jay Z message to jay-z
man connected sent us this updated code
and it looks much prettier I think it
might be like I don't see we got piece
of paper under it it works a little
better yeah well it's much prettier and
actually works it works by ajax so
anyway it's much prettier I will have
all of the codes all of the parts and
everything up on the website in the wiki
so we can collaborate and make this even
better and I look forward to all of your
suggestions as to what kind of crazy
stuff we can put in addition to cameras
and lasers and our very own lasers
Kirby's gonna love that oh gods just
countries
back yeah so what do we have next man
well a little later we're going to be
talking to Jerry Franklin about Jody
compiling PHP code I know yeah how I
have that hammer and everything looks
like a nail to me now I can compile PHP
it's gonna get dangerous so now uh but
first let's check in with Matt and see
what's going on in the land party that
all right guys you've only got three
days left before the zombie invasion
that's right left for dead and zombie
panic source we're gonna be playing the
games februari 28 at three p.m. that's
when the left 4 dead campaign starts so
go ahead head on over to hack 5 land
squarespace com if you want to sign up
for the left 4 dead games that we've got
going on and there you can also sign up
for attorneys and you know check out
past games that we've played recommend
your own games that you would like us to
play on the land and hak5 land
squarespace com with squarespace you can
create amazingly beautiful and complex
web sites just like you were using from
page 98 you remember that that's good
stuff but creating forms in Squarespace
is a whole lot easier than dreamweaver
front page or even know pet simply
drag-and-drop set your values and look
at that you're all good to go so head on
over to squarespace com and use coupon
code hack five for ten percent off the
life of your contract now coming up a
little later in the show I'm going to be
taking a look at the net parent in to go
beta part 2 with answering some viewer
questions and stuff like that but right
now we're going to go ahead and bring
Jody Franklin in to talk about how easy
it is to renumber a crapload of
computers and PHP is an executable
don't really know how that works but he
does so he's gonna come over here and
we're gonna take a look
alright guys so Jodi Franklin is joining
us from Chesapeake Virginia which is
about what 45 minutes away about 45
minutes away he comes over every Friday
and has great boneless wings with us at
bw3's now Jodi you are here because you
obviously watch the show and
unfortunately you happen to watch the
episode where Darren and I started you
know contemplating how difficult it
would be to renumber multiple computers
on you know an intranet kind of thing
right and you took Darren's code which
I'm surprised you're still amongst the
living and have taken that and taught
yourself PHP yeah that's actually the
the raffle bought code was the first
time I'd experience with PHP and
actually the first time I've written
anything more than two lines long about
ten years ah I see all right well you've
got me beat in terms of you know
motivation to learn a language so what
are we going to be playing with today
well two different things one the code
itself how we are handling re numbering
multiple computers using the same piece
of code okay and to looking at two
different compilers sort of to build
this into something that can be
distributed to computers that don't have
PHP installed on the visit salivate
obviously useless if the computer can't
run it right exactly all right so what's
the first we're going to take a look at
the first one it's the pretty one is
like pretty called roadsend it comes
with its own IDE okay I can build
everything in the program due to bugging
it will run the code real-time give you
break points right has a nice little
editor in it you can give it all the
different files if you want to put
everything in its own PHP script and
then compile it in later oh wow okay it
produces large code okay big I mean big
big 3x plus tiny tiny stuff okay but
it's pretty and you can do everything in
it easy to use yeah just open it up type
your code hit compiles and you didn't
get it wrong you're done in storing okay
um it is big editor little windows if
you know PHP unlike i did when i started
just do your thing when you're done go
to your project and hit build wait for
it to finish and when it's done you have
an exe okay you do have the option of
embedding an icon file so that you can
actually have something click on to you
can have a smiley face or whatever right
to recognize your you know application
Oh death okay and that is really about
it there's nothing to know you click on
items and they do what they say they do
okay the other one which I hope I'm
saying right is called Bam Bam Bam baam
baam just like the sound of that we're
no it's pretty bambolim is just a
command-line application that does the
same thing it doesn't each bhi only me X
it makes it a runtime interpreter
packages together it even does a
compressed exe okay so it makes a tiny
tiny okay as opposed to already making a
tiny so what kind of size difference are
we looking at well um roadsend you
looking about the little bitty script I
had come out of 3.7 Meg's bambolim with
no compression options came out at about
1.3 okay with the compression came out
at about 600 k well and the compressed
version doesn't seem to run any slower
than the uncompressed version once the
application launches execution speed is
to say the same these are now what is
the actual code we're going to be using
to renumber these different computers
because like we said in an
infrastructure you know fifty hundred
computers and you need to go through a
Rio that's a little bit of a pain in the
ass to get the bodies to actually go
through and manually do it so you've
created with your limited knowledge of
PHP and only Darren's you know code as a
reference point a PHP script that we can
run as an exe to do this right so let's
take a look at that okay
well the code itself centers around
using the system command to run command
line argument and uses Ned Sh another
thing that I didn't know anything about
until I started I run mac previous d
none Sh is just a global of letters to
write and after looking at all the
information on technet it is still a
jumble of letters to me that isn't in
st. command the short version of what
this does is it uses net SH to pull the
current information off the machine is
it use it using the hcp and if so why
are we running this command or if not
what is my IP do I have a statically
sign DNS what is it if I am I using wins
what is that address right you give it a
right now first three octets is what is
required later I plan on making it so
you can give it one two or three and
have it work that based on class but
right now you have to give it three okay
you have to give this subnet because I
don't assume anything and which is
always good and you have to give it the
Gateway okay you can give it dns and
wins or not it will do its best to work
out what should be done with those if
you don't ok you can specify my IP
address if let's say you already have
everything set up with a dhcp for your
IP but your dns and winds are static you
have the option to use this command to
set them to dhcp ok it will take the
current dns and or winds and grab the
last octet just like it does with the IP
address and paste in what you gave it to
build a new one right ok cool so now how
long did it actually take you from start
to finish to get a working version of
this running let's see I watched that
episode on the Thursday after it came
out for 24 mm-hmm I watched it about
10pm got the bug in my butt to do so at
about 11 it started learning PHP at 12
and by five six in the morning I had
version one
so it would change addresses and up to
four now fives and on the way she is I
wish I was that motivated to do I wish I
was too I don't know where that came
from I'd be perfectly honest with you
just well I mean you know if from from
Darren and I shooting our mouths off
about you know how to do it and you
actually going out and doing it in less
than a day I daren't I think this boy
deserves mad props mad props well thank
you um so where can we find are you
gonna be releasing the code or what are
we gonna be doing here um originally I
was going to wait till the next version
but the next version is posing some
problems and how to handle something so
I'm going to go and put this out now is
technically version zero point zero
point four okay I was going to go to 0.1
but i like i like zero so we'll stick
with it hey you know my recently started
very currently unpopulated tech blog
elder new org it's lder dash n double 0
b or awesome is where it'll be hopefully
some more detail and exactly how it
works and plus what I've got planned for
the next version and you're always
welcome you're always open to you know
people's okay this is some like that
keep in mind like I said until this
started I didn't know PHP and I've never
seen my code experience is basic see
COBOL RPG and clipper alright so keep
that in mind when you look at it ignore
how it works but if you want something
done or if you see something that I can
do better faster cheaper please let me
know so it's elder noob dot elder lube
dash it goes elder dash noob ok dot org
that's zeros not o's Touche all right
coming up I'm going to be taking a look
at part two of art an apparent indigo
beta software and right now Shannon is
going to let us know what trivia is for
this week last week's trivia was baby

little bit of a some panera no no para
for me thank you yeah I don't know my
doing this all right we're calling
Gordon okay alright guys so I am back
here to talk about stage two of the nuh
para indigo beta now when I first went
and talked about it last week I might
have gotten some things wrong and
promptly after this episode was released
I got an email from the CEO and founder
of no para Todd Hooper really great guy
to talk to you by the way now okay
there's two different parts of no para
there are their network devices and then
apparent indigo beta software which is
actually what we're testing ok now the
software nuh para indigo is meant to go
on to you know third-party manufacturers
switches and devices and things of that
nature they're kind of making it so that
it can be installed pretty much on
anything that
money you know who wants to license the
software can go ahead and do you know I
showed you some of the the higher level
overview of some of the health
monitoring aunt way when I was sleep
deprived last night repairing a vmware I
scuzzy San it occurred to me that
there's another really powerful
mechanism inside an apparent ago
software that allows you guys to lock
down your enterprise not only you know
using the health monitoring but
authentication both at the you know
wired level as well as wireless what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to you
know briefly cover those because the
feature set on them isn't complete so
what we're going to do is going to take
a look at the interface you might
remember it from last week then a para
interface is very streamlined and it's
beautiful it's pretty it's web two point
oh all that jazz we're going to do over
here is we're going to actually make
sure that port eight is has the
authentication module enabled so here we
can see that authentication is checked
and that is a good sign when I got home
today I went ahead and set up a Windows
2008 enterprise Active Directory server
amazing job that Microsoft did I'm not a
Microsoft fanboy even though you may
think I am but it's incredibly easy to
set up in Active Directory nowadays so
what I went ahead and did is come over
here to configuration and we're going to
go ahead and click on the auth tab now
what we can actually do is active
directory so there are no Paris which is
now joined to our hak5 org domain name
which is sitting inside a vm running on
my desktop machine upstairs in the
second level of this beautiful thing we
call a hack house still with me all
right let's continue so what we went
ahead and did was we joined the active
directory we created a username now I've
actually tested it and make sure that it
worked which is always a good thing and
we try to do that here in heck five so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come over here to devices i'm going to
delete the record that is cashing my
information and we're going to come up
and go to a new address
okay so now it the captive portal is
back but it looks a little different
instead of health monitoring we now have
an authentication request so I'm going
to enter my username which is mad
because it's not really a whole lot of
people and I think that's my password
sign in failed huh look at that who
would have thought okay now so I'm
signed in as Matt and that is you know
going through active directory and
authenticating my credentials but as you
can see I'm on a Macintosh and it's
asking me to you know report my
computer's health well how do we do that
well it turns out the parent actually
wrote a nap compatible application for
Mac so we're going to go ahead and do is
download that we're going to open that
with disk mounter because that's what
you do on a Mac it's going to verify as
an amount it's going to finish and blah
no para agent is going to be installed
and after we install this on max because
max are really becoming more prevalent
in the enterprise and if you don't
believe you just go take a look at all
the white papers that are online
recently so once this is is this is
installed it's similar to the enabler on
Windows we come back over here and we
refresh and now i have full network
access so now we have two factors that
we can protect against we can protect
against malware and we can protect
against unauthorized people outside of
our domain from accessing our new local
network resources now all these
different options can be set up either
guest or internet or printers and blah
blah blah blah all inside and para but
there's one other thing that I wanted to
talk to you guys about and that's Wi-Fi
security now then a pair of software
supports up to 200 different devices
that can be tagged along out onto the
switch one of those devices being Wi-Fi
okay so you throw your access point up
there that has authentication for wpa
enterprise now before when you would go
to set up you know enterprise security
and things of that nature
it's a pain in the ass you got to deal
with radius you got to deal with
certificate you got to deal with 802
dot1x and so on and so forth but with an
apparent it's exceedingly easy to go
ahead and set up WPA enterprise to
authenticate back to your Active
Directory that you've already set up
we're going to do is we're going to come
back in here to the auth tab we're gonna
select enable authentication with radius
now radius is built in tuna para there
are valid certificates inside the no
para software so all you have to do is
enable it here enter your shared secret
go over to your linksys router and able
radius point it to the static IP address
of the nuh para enter the shared secret
and boom you now have a WPA enterprise
that is authenticating looking for
credentials inside your Active Directory
so after talking with Todd and you know
going over all of the things that a pair
is actually looking to do they've got
some really really great new features
that I'm excited to tell you about but I
can so what we'll do is after i get
either some updated software here or
permission from todd will go ahead and
let you know about all the great goody
goodness that new pair is actually
cooking up and brewing at a later show
but check it out in apparent calm and i
think they might still have a couple
beta test slots open for beta testing
the switch I got to say it's a
completely different way to look at the
enterprise security at the switch level
so i highly suggest anybody with you
know that is looking for a solution like
this go check them out in a para dot com
so right now i'm going to go ahead and
wrap this crazy ass episode up and
darren is shannon are already over there
reading and that thang
range time yeah we have we don't have
