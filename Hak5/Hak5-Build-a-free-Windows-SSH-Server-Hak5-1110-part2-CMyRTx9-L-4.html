the ben heck show time to get practical
setting up an ssh server in Windows and
here to show us how Shannon what's up
what's up I'll see you that all right
I've intended like every block for like
the last three in like two seconds I
know right maybe two minutes I don't
know it took long enough for you to chug
a beer and then get back up here Eddie
let's go yeah mm-hmm okay so i am going
to be setting up a windows server using
a program called bit vice but there are
tons of other ones so i'll go over a
couple of other software recommendations
that we found online so first off it's
an ssh server using bit vice and it's
this program called win sshd so you just
go up there you download it it's free as
far as i know i mean i got it for free
in but i got the personality personal
edition not the enterprise for you get a
30 day trial the enterprise edition yeah
ads like Kerberos and ntlm
authentication if you're doing like an
active directory so understandably it's
the enterprise edition yeah but even
that 100 bucks yeah so so it's still
pretty cheap I guess well well compare
it comparatively to windows server stuff
oh yeah windows server stuff gets
expensive they rake you over the coals
serious why run linux man everything
screams we love it's all good all right
so this is definitely for like if you
have a PC at home that's just chilling
and nothing to do with it so you're like
ow create a nice little tunnel so when
I'm at school and they're blocking
revision3 or hak5 you can tunnel through
it oh yes see this would have been
perfect when I was working at the
frickin bank and they were blocking all
the hacking websites or if you were in
Egypt God oh yes no the ethernet
seriously I just imagine one large
ethernet cable for the country just one
huge why should you got one and it's
going under those shelf pork with the
big blue router any let's go okay so
once you download it you see this nice
little care I'll move it for you so you
can see so you see this nice little
window right here and it gives you your
host keys oh hey look there's your
finger for its md5 mm-hmm that nice just
as we were talking about the bubble
vample what has the bubble Babel we'll
get into that later alright and then you
can manage your host keys here we'll
come back to that and then open easy
settings so it does make it seriously
easy so listening port 22 that
the normal or that you always get on
automatically configure router requires
upnp don't do that universal plug and
play that's the one what is wrong with
universal plug and play it doesn't that
comic any router anyway sure all of
these routers have this wonderful thing
called upnp enabled by default that
allows anything without authentication
to change network settings like port
forwards and go wrong yet turn that off
yeah because in on your router right now
if you haven't just turn it off yeah I
might need to do that so open windows
firewall we have a couple of choices in
here do not change windows firewall
settings open ports to local networks
open ports to any computer as set in
advance way Nessus ok so the first one
obviously is if you're going to manage
it yourself the second one local
computer only is so that only you can
ssh in from your own machine to yourself
ok not very useful the third one is what
you're going to want to choose that
would set up the firewall for you you'll
still that way i can connect from any
computer if I ever want to on your
network and then if you port forward
port 22 from your home router a be able
to connect from the internet ok for
coalition so open ports to any computer
cool and then enable trace logging if
you want that or not that's for
development stuff yeah yeah we'll save
it go next so simplified windows
accounts this basically is where you get
to set up your local accounts and you've
already got one in there but go ahead
and delete that let's add it and show
you what it can do alright let's see how
I delete that just like there you go and
then hit huh yeah remove cool ah perfect
and we'll need to add one now go to add
and so what we'll need to know here is
your actual windows yeah how do I know
what my account name is I mean I'm
assuming I'm snobs well you log in as so
yes bold in Windows there's your account
name and then there's like the username
and then there's the name so your
account smells but then I coaches
Shannon Morse is your right name so Pope
your command prompt and this is really
easy this works on both windows and
linux and as far as I know Mac just type
who am i all one word Who am I mm-hmm
I'm snubs dash pc
my computer nubs and the backslash it
eliminates the host name and your
username so your username snubs ok so
enter that snubz login allowed of course
public keys if you click into that
alright this is where you could import
import a public key like that you
generated last week with yes okay so
there's my public key cool and then go
ahead and close that so we have one key
now that's a little easier than using
nano to authorize keys so much easier
allow file transfer yep yep allow
terminal allow port forward hey those
are the different channels we're going
on about nice okay so we have everything
set up okay virtual file system layout
now I believe this is just if you want
to set up this is so that you could
modify the file system more if you want
to have like a virtual file system so
whether you're touching the bare metal
on the hard world bare metal if you're
touching the actual hard drive or if
you're just effin with files that are
kind of virtual okay yeah so we're just
well allow full access well considering
it to your computer and you're the only
one are gonna be logging into it yeah I
have no problem with that although if
you only want to use this to port for to
do dynamic Sox proxies maybe you want to
turn off the shell completely I mean
it's your call it's on my call yes so
I'll click next and then this last one
is for your virtual account so basically
this is like if you wanted a friend to
be able to use it as well you can settle
them a virtual account so like archiver
an ephah and bump you give account set
of wine you know i would obviously like
limit some of the abilities that they
would have well you won't want to give
them a shell but then you could create
virtual accounts for them so you don't
have to create Windows logins you can
give my virtual account so they can port
for or perfectly so they can do a
dynamic socks proxy and watch some hulu
here in the United States cuz they're
over in Ireland ah or some legal things
I mean we all know how awesome that is
so after that I Save Changes and we're
ready to go cool what happens when I
click manage host keys well that's hot
this is my Mountain the a block that is
the GE yeah and so that's the that's
what would end up that's the public key
that would end up in for example in
Linux the known hosts file ha I can also
generate a new
and down here ah cool interesting go
ahead and login so over and putty what
you would want to do is go to your local
loop back so up in here it would be
snubz instead of snubz e at and you can
either type localhost or do 12 7 20 20
21 and then hit ok oh you kind of want
oh in tamuning sage and so you see over
here so yes when says it's running right
there so it's just a windows service
just like your print spooler is and just
like all of those other things running
the background that's kind of cool
because you don't need to worry about
like starting a program open and there
you go there's your password
authentication ok no I'm assuming this
would be well it's the same thing as the
same thing that i use for windows yeah
whenever I login which and there it
works Hey look at that you're in your
command prompt so if I actually wanted
to use this from other computers i would
probably want to change that password to
a private in public key yes and so
that's where it was under like managed
private public keys and it would be the
same way that you set up in putty last
night ah awesome stuff ok this is not
the only I get out of an ssh server for
Windows I know that this one well it's
awesome and I like that has that ability
to integrate with active directory and
things like that on the enterprise and
it's not that expensive is an open
source I don't know this yeah that's not
enough to be a deal breaker i mean
windows isn't nobody so if it's open
source you know that there's nothing bad
going on in the background yeah you know
then slipped a little something on to
something well something so there's also
free sshd which you can get at free sshd
com it's nice but it lacks some of those
advanced securities controls the server
start sessions with security in the
context of the service itself meaning
that since it needs to be run as an
administrator or system those are the
privileges available to the users oh
that kind of sucks yeah I'll be logging
in is now 10 min on your box yeah not so
great it's not open source so it can't
be you know vetted and improved upon by
the community and it hasn't been updated
since 09 ok it's been a little while
yeah it's kind of diff
a cult to get working on windows 7
apparently but it's well you know it is
free and it is easy to set up and i will
say that i've used it yeah back in 2005
on a second 05 back in 05 and then we
have the one that I used when sshd by
bit vice bit vice calm / win sshd it's
free for non-commercial personal use of
course licensed a hundred bucks unlocks
active directory yay easy to install
obviously an update and it has a nice
gooey which I oh oh I always loved yeah
it works fine in windows 7 yeah active
directory curvy it's got a es 128 and
256 bit encryption so that's great not
open source though of course we are any
damage focused on that a little bit but
it can be configured to use PowerShell
instead of CMD as the default that's
pretty cool that's something that it
definitely has over the others that's
kind of cool yeah yep and then it'll
also support openssh so like I've shown
in Linux how to do openssh public keys
files it will do it will support those
in addition to the putty generated ones
that you just did oh yes and you can
configure accountant root permissions or
per IP or or per T&amp;amp;S didn't have like
different IP addresses get different
permission that's cool automation of the
API there's logging for you if you need
any of that openssh for windows that's
another one that's yeah times over a ssh
windows sf.net that one's pretty cool
it's yeah free open-source
implementation of openssh turtle openssh
i've never used it myself that's what
you're using on didi ke to have five dot
org oh nice okay so this is an
implementation of that awesome piece of
open software on Windows using this
wonderful thing called cygwin or c YG
winner however you want to pronounce it
we never have gotten into cygwin but
basically it allows you to run linux
stuff in windows okay yeah but s1
actually i don't know if this would be
my first pick though because it hasn't
been updated for ya and i did visit
their website and i looked for the
download link i i i downloaded it but
apparently it says at the top you can
buy this for five dollars or fifty
dollars and allows a whole bunch of by
links below that
little text is where you find the old
free version I'm not said what else is
there cop SSH nice cop in the name don't
know about that so it's a package of
portable SSH for cygwin there's a GUI
for administration and but okay another
openssh implementation yeah it's not one
T of them it was nice nice enough and
then there's a type M ssh server you can
get it over at Cape mcom this one is
free and it's open source and it uses
windows identified enta fication for
like the windows user accounts cool
automated install and setup so i don't
know maybe you can change the settings
in there I haven't checked it out myself
there's this thing called nag screen oh
I hate macs screens remember remember
shareware from the 90s that like guys
get into mirc until you clicked on the
man's face but if you clicked on his
nose who would squeak anyway it's 30
foot yes it's 35 bucks so that's five
though for you to choose from but if you
guys have other ones that you really
like for setting up windows servers let
me know cuz I'm definitely looking for
the best one awesome feedback out hak5
org well I stay tuned because in the
next part what we're going to be doing
is setting up the client side in Linux
with a little known hosts and our
authorized keys and all of us elves so
so now we've covered by then we'll have
covered every way from Sunday to do key
pairs you're a pretty good mix sorry Mac
guys maybe we'll get Paul on the show to
show you that
