by Netflix
last week in the midst of the casemod
bill that took form inside of a Hello
Kitty backpack experiment with a whole
lot of fun new and interesting things
that I'd never played with in Linux like
having 14 wireless USB adapters on a
machine one of the more challenging
things I gotta say Shannon these guys is
this a pregnancy test
Oh so USB dongle
I knew that yeah it's gonna section my
own you know this isn't sponsored by
t-mobile or anything but I did run pick
up a t-mobile USB stick because I wanted
to be able to provide through the Wi-Fi
pineapple and all the other fun sniffing
apparatus in that case mod some 4G
internets and it was just kind of the
cheapest and quickest and easiest way to
do it it was so I thought cuz this thing
has drivers Pro back its drivers for a
Windows but not know Linux yeah go what
kind of kind of though I got it working
and it's and it's kind of a fun and
interesting hack if you will so I want
to first show LS USB that command just
shows you all of the USB things plugged
into your machine right now and then
I'll go ahead and plug this bad boy in
come on what do you go there you go all
right you see now cool another one LS
USB again and you'll see that there is
an additional device mom there it is
alright so it's the Ont a communications
SP a the interesting thing about this is
this okay shows a device ID of nineteen
to D or D 2 and then : 1523 that is a
huge problem for me right now see what
this actually shows up as if ILS /media
is it shows up as a like a USB driver or
oh yeah it shows up as a thumb drive
basically and they have the drivers on
here so they don't have to ship this
thing with an extra you know with a CD
with drivers ok yeah so you're like oh
cool
so it's both a thumb drive and a modem
problem is without the drivers which are
only for Mackin and Windows you can't
get this thing to go into USB modem mold
so I found this really cool tool it's
called USB mode switch and it's pretty
much just a matter of doing apt-get
install a USB tack mode switch I already
have it installed actually so if the
latest version but once you have that
you need this ridiculously crazy string
which will allow you to change it from a
USB thumb drive into a modem so I did a
whole bunch of research I have it over
here in one of my screens and I actually
created a s script file t-mobile de Sh
and you can see here you run USB mode
switch tack V and then the vendor ID and
then tack P and then the 1520 through
remember from the LSU is being second
ago that 1523 is what it is right now
that's it as a thumb drive and then
capital v says okay the vendor ID is not
going to change
capital P that's our target 15 25 that's
the actual once we get into that mode
it's a USB okay and then in order to do
that we have to send this this tack em
and this ridiculously long string so we
send that I know it's the the man pages
for it kind of make it sound a lot more
simple but there's a different string
for every modem and there's a whole
community of people that have gone and
done the research
Wow it's pretty neat too because what
they do is they plug it into a Windows
machine with the USB sniffer and then
that string right there is that string
comes up yeah that's like the secret
command they're like aha got the secret
command and then using USB modes which
we can emulate it let's throw it back at
it I do a sleep 5 because why not and
then there's this other program that is
so cool it's called sokka's 3G now once
this is in USB modem mode I could use
say like up here I've got I have what is
it known networking or network monitor I
mean it network manager I'm sorry oh I
have no it manager remember this from
the VPN saying yes well it could do it
just fine but we might not do it from
the command line so much more fun and
not have to deal with some crazy PPP
stuff this program I'm gonna show you
this it makes it super super simple so
it's sokka's 3G it's a script we're
actually let's let's
nan-oh this because it's so much fun or
VY will be cool
sokka's 3G right so you come down here
and you're like oh hey cool it's an
all-in-one script it does you know 3G 4G
modems you can see here all the
dependencies the USB mode switch there's
all the different devices and you keep
coming down here and then suddenly
you're in binary so what's what's neat
about this is he's actually packaged all
of the dependencies inside of the script
so you don't actually have to have all
of this crazy stuff installed I love
that and if you run it with sa sack this
3G oops there needs to be a dot there
tak I for interactive mode it takes
itself just a moment to boot up because
it has to expand all of those
dependencies we have an interactive mode
that says hey Connect for 3G and you're
like okay cool hey let's do a USB device
and then it finds it and we're like yeah
the t-mobile Rockets are prepaid I'm
like cool let's do that and well failed
to connect is we're not doing it that
way
anyway what's what's interesting about
that is as you're going through those
interactive steps it's telling you at
the bottom of the screen what those
options are and those options are these
right here other equals USB modem and
then the modem ID and then the USB
interface and you know my APN which is a
PCT mobile comm and you know the
username which is GPRS and then there's
actually no password it's actually
called t-mobile to get that I could
probably have went to Howard forms it's
nice to go but I didn't feel like
digging through that and what's nice
about this is I can just LS USB again I
see that I am now 1523 I want to be 1525
so all I have to do is run this USB
modes which that's why I failed a second
ago well I'll just rerun my t-mobile
scriptcase you see what does right there
and it says it says that it has switched
it over it sees that it's the t-mobile
rocket 3G or 4G right there and then
it's it's trying to switch it and then
it's searching for and then BOOM
Motz which 6a succeeded by and then I do
LS USB again we can see that's 1525
right it does asleep for five seconds
and then in just a moment our script
here sock is 3G with all of that fun
stuff it's gonna go ahead and boom it
says MF 591 that's this device connected
to t-mobile if config oh look at that
PPP zero and I have an IP address of 26
195 107 243 go ahead and hit that up
because it's probably change how great
is that
good job Darren I know I'm just it's one
of those things where I was at it for
like hours and hours and hours and like
and you finally got it and you were like
yes I was like gonna give up and go the
easy route and then I was like else and
then a ha moment so I hope that this
somehow makes it to somebody that's also
doing this and then can go no it's nice
