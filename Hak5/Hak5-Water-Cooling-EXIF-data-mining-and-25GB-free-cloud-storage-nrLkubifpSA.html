nothing says leanest like water cooling
your gamer rig and when I heard that
Colleen was doing just that I had to
stop by Colleen they found me over at
the department of spontaneous combustion
very welcome
so what are you doing here you recently
upgraded some stuff what's happening
yeah a couple really good friends of
mine for my birthday gave me a Coursera
700d case to move up from my antec p180
and I thought I would take a chance to
rebuild everything clean and we do the
water cooling system with a couple of
upgrades that sounds exciting I know how
much fun that is when you actually get
to take your parts out dust them off
make it all pretty again I turn on the
air compressor and start blowing
everything off excellent well I am a
complete water cooling noob but I want
to kind of get into this and I was
hoping that you can maybe spell it out
for us what are the pros and cons of
water cooling well what are cooling you
know allows you to do a couple of very
specific things one you can take the
heat and bring it into larger heat
exchanger surfaces so in the end you're
basically making metal hot so that you
can put that into the atmosphere so if
you've got a giant CPU heatsink with a
fan on it the size of the heatsink is
the amount of surface area you have to
work with to radiate the heat but if
you're taking all of that heat using
liquid from the CPU or the GPU and
moving it to a huge radiator you have a
lot more surface to work with is that
how is it different from an leaky of
course how is that different from
you know things we've seen like heat
pipes well heat pipes do the same exact
thing the whole point is to move the
heat from where it's being generated to
the surface where you're gonna radiate
it a heat pipe allows you to use a
bigger surface but that's the whole
point of water cooling it's much more
efficient to use water cooling when
you're trying to get the absolute
coldest temperatures now remember with
water cooling you can't get below
ambient temperatures you're just trying
to get as real O's to them as possible
okay so we're not going to get some
ridiculous overclocks here like you
would see none of those guys in Germany
that like throw the nitrous in heaters
how did you you know phase change
cooling or some sort of you know Peltier
cooling to actually get sub ambient
temperatures with this we're just gonna
be able to radiate as much of the heat
to the ambient air temperature as as
well as we can okay well obviously like
you said about the efficiency and well
leanest notwithstanding what about the
costs involved and and the noise and the
actual cooling properties well water
cooling these days is not as necessary
as it was for a while there when we had
really hot CPUs and the air cooling
stuff that was out there was really not
that good yeah these days you can build
a very respectable gaming rig that
overclocks quite well when they're
cooling you see air coolers now that are
like seriously this big and they're
effective and if you can fit them in
your case they work pretty well it's
much simpler to install it that way it's
cheaper and it's gonna be almost as
effective but it's nowhere near as cool
or as fun
okay what about the the noise though I
mean I love a quiet PC again you can
build a pretty quiet standard air-cooled
PC but you can get even quieter if
you're doing water cooling you're a fan
of the 747 type of computers right noise
doesn't bother me I kind of like the the
noise coming from the computer it's like
white noise in the room helps me sleep
it's like having an air conditioner on
yeah okay no I can feel that I do the
same thing what if you wanted you could
build a water cooling system that's
really quiet ah
rock on no who is this for really it's
for people who want to get the most
overclock out of their system possible
for people who want to have the coolest
looking system possible and for people
who like personalizing and building
stuff definitely I mean when you're done
with this are you even gonna put the
side of the case on here of course not
that's one of the reasons I like the
700d over the
the attorney has a window and it costs
more money I'm not gonna be using the
side of the case on it anyway I want to
show off what I've done right now
typically with an air-cooled system you
would want the case on the side of it
just because your air flow and the
pressure of the case in all of that that
goes into a factory because you want to
pull air in from the bottom make sure it
goes over all your components come out
the back
exactly but here I just have the
radiator on the top so the most
important thing is just getting the air
to go through that through the radiator
and out into the room okay the side
doesn't matter that much so maybe you
could walk me through it what are the
components that you need to get started
with what's it just my other radiators
right so that's your heat exchanger so
we're let's say we'll start with the
processor sure so this right here is
what you call a water block and it's
basically a piece of copper just like
you find on a normal heat sink that
conducts the heat from the CPU itself
into the water okay then you have some
hosing this is some half-inch tygon
tubing and that's used essentially for
the liquid to go through and that
connects up to a reservoir which is what
you can use it's actually not 100%
necessary to use a reservoir if you want
to make your life more difficult really
but a reservoir is really nice for
filling it up and for bleeding the air
bubbles out of it because remember air
doesn't conduct heat as well as water so
you want to have it completely water you
want the bubblies exactly so this does a
good job of bleeding that then you have
obviously the pump which you can use to
uh you know move the water put
electricity in here put water in there
put water in there and it goes around is
that one of the noisier components
because I did play with water cooling
once in like 99 and we're using like a
fish tank pump or something yeah let me
say in 1999 water cooling was completely
different ice I spent like a hundred
bucks on like a couple of parts and
stuff right and they came in this kit
called super that was the only word in
English on it was super and everything
else was like in Asian we'll just say
and in Asian language
you know it was 11 years ago what do I
remember but I just I I recall it very
loud it might have also didn't because I
was a noob in
bleed the system properly so some of the
pumps are loud and some of them are
quiet and some of them push more seat
you know more CFM and some push less and
or liters per minute yeah I guess would
be liters per minute see a family fans
for fans so yeah yeah but I found that
this one is not that loud and I got a
Petra's tech shop for cheap because
somebody at Corsair ordered all of the
wrong pumps and so they sold them off to
Petrus dextrus EEP nice so okay so we've
got the water pumping from a reservoir
to our our block here for our CPU and
now another thing that I also do is I
water cool my graphics cards that's I
was about to ask about because I don't
see any sync on this normally there's
like this giant plan so normally you
would have the front and back of the
graphics card with the water with the
exchanger surface right here and then
this is a large air cooler I don't like
these because the way that the the
cooling works on all these new fans is
they pull it in here and then try to
push it out the back here and the only
way to do that is is to do a very loud
yeah these are actually really loud I
mean I remember the hairdryer original
Nvidia hairdryer but they work okay and
so I've got water blocks and rolling for
my CPU but my graphics cards as well so
I'm running two graphics cards in SLI
for gaming in the system and a third one
for to side monitors and so I have two
matching water blocks right here and
some people believe in full coverage
water blocks that you can cool your ram
as well I don't usually overclock my
room because I don't really find
significant results from it other people
disagree but you know this is what I
find to be the easiest now is that is
this a standard hookup here these the
size of this is this the the same that
you're gonna find the pattern is any of
the granite type of cards okay so is
this like an Nvidia block yeah and so
these you I used to have on my 9800 GTX
card and then I got these GTX 260 s so I
had to get different adapter plates from
Swift tech but I could keep the same
blocks okay very cool so all of this
ties together this is a lot of tubing
yeah it's a lot of tubing so it's really
cool because you can put UV reactive dye
in it and have it be like you know all
rice rocket neon bling does this all go
to the radiator and come back where is
this in series so it's a hot series and
so it goes through all the components to
the radiators and back through all the
components now some people believe in
putting things in a certain order so
that the coolest thing is that the CPU
first and then the GPUs but in reality
if you've got a good pump the water goes
through it so fast it's all the same
temperature anyway so the idea is that
you know you're pumping the water
through the cpu through the graphics
cards maybe the RAM if you want to get
crazy and then even the hard drives as
we saw which necessary yeah I agree but
and then that then it goes back over to
the radiator right and then that's what
brought what you draw air through the
radiator and then that exchanges the
heat into the atmosphere excellent now
tell me a little bit about radios cuz be
honest my bike doesn't even have a
radiator it's all air-cooled so the
whole idea of a radiator is to get the
most surface area possible this is a
dual 120 millimeter fan radiator this is
a simple one and so some of the fans and
radiators that you'll get are different
thicknesses so you'll see that my dual
fan radiator is actually thinner than my
single fan radiator you could get a dual
one it's as thick as this one or thinner
these are the parts that I picked so
what's inside of this is this just a
whole bunch of little - it's just a
whole bunch of little tubes and copper
fins to give it more surface area just
like a car right here okay so and and
the copper fins work in the same exact
way that you would find a not on a
air-cooled system exactly except so with
this system I used to have a single and
or sorry a single and a double radiator
in my in tech p180 okay so just like
you've got your exhaust your typical 120
millimeter exhaust fan that everybody
has on their case this is just what sits
on the back right the gap and usually
the easiest way to do it is you screw
your hundred twenty millimeter fan to
the 120 millimeter compatible radiator
and then screw the fan of the case and
you're pretty much done and there you go
okay and the fan is it's a typical it
means that sufficient just a single 120
yeah and I mean you can use a more
powerful one or a less powerful one
depending on how loud you want it but
the more radiator you have the cooler
you're gonna be able to keep your water
the more stuff you're going to be able
to cool so this single 120 that's pretty
thick would be sufficient for a CPU all
right buttons you're doing what GPUs and
a CPU so I like to run three there's not
really a rule of thumb even this is
no a lot of cooling well you like that
over-engineer and overkill anyway so
I've got a triple compatible case now so
I figured what I would do is I'd run to
triple radiators stacked on top of each
other did I mention the over-engineering
I love this so this is a rig this part
right here this top part and it's just
as thick as your old one yeah is is
three well the triple thickness radiator
huh
okay and then you've got the Melling
triple length radiator double thickness
and then I've got the fan that in
between then sandwiched and then another
one this is the same exact unit um this
is actually kind of a a little bit
different the top unit only has the barb
holes on one side and the bottom one has
them on both sides but they're pretty
much the same okay so this is made to
stack exactly sweater tech makes these
so you could potentially keep stacking
if you want it I don't know if you
really need oh yeah you know two of the
stackable ones and one of the ends then
have a triple thickness one interesting
wow that is so and this just sits on the
top of the case is that like a standard
thing now is this like a standard sized
system um you know the easiest way like
I said is if you have like a single
hundred and twenty millimeter fan port
you can screw the fan to the case and
then one of the radiators to the fans
this case specifically has a spot for a
triple radiator so you know if you want
to buy a case that supports it great
well they're pretty rare though but the
corsair ones do support them okay
Corsair swift tech I'm hearing a lot of
vendors I'm new to this who are the some
of the people that you've used that you
trust um Corsair Swift Tech makes good
good parts in general D Tech fusion
water blocks EK makes good water blocks
dangered n makes a lot of good parts
those are pretty much your basic ones
and where would somebody go to get
started to start shopping around kind of
perusing the available parts and kind of
get an idea of what it cost them oh I'd
say a good water cooling system will
start anywhere from two hundred to three
hundred dollars Wow
if you want to water cool your GPU Zen
CPU and all that kind of stuff but you
can get away with you know Coursera
makes this really simple unit called a
and H 50 that has a water block and pump
combo you know single hundred and twenty
millimeter fan on it I just got that it
was like 80 bucks I couldn't help
and it works perfectly it's a closed
system right so you never have to bleed
that's gonna do my cpu and it doesn't
get gross over time so if you take a
look at like these old tubes that I had
in my system
mmm they kind of gel me around and nasty
okay so don't need to worry about that
the all-in-one system you have to bleed
it or take care of it or anything like
that and the properties work the same
whether you've got a you know double
triple radiator if you will and or if I
just I'll be able to radiate more heat
than you but if you're just doing your
CPU that's par but like you said we're
not gonna be able to get the water any
cooler than room temperature
exactly so would you say that we're
gonna be able to both achieve a similar
overclock cuz that's what I'm looking
forward to umm I think we would be able
to both achieve similar overclocks on
our CPUs but I'm also water cooling my
GPS okay well that's gonna hinder you
when I throw down the gauntlet and say
let's come back next week I'm gonna
install that Corsair single system and
see what I can do to overclock
and I will go to a bar date and then
we'll see who gets all the cool looks
well you're gonna show up with all sorts
of spikes and stuff and I can't compete
with that it's Colleen come on
thank you so much Colleen so let's let's
come back next week see the finished
product and see what we can come up with
you've got a like cube 6600 processor
yeah no I've got a core i7 920 that's a
two point six six Giga heard that I
overclocked about three point six four
gigahertz Wow okay well I'm gonna see
what I can get my cue 9550 up to and of
course you guys know that you can hit us
up at feedback at hack five down org if
you've got questions about this kind of
stuff and digital kitty where can they
find you twitter.com slash digital kitty
that's the one
thank you so much
are you really gonna wear that all night
Colleen really I'm just saying even if
hypothetically cooties were real I don't
have them well you look ridiculous you
know there's an easier way to protect
yourself right head over to Circle

is so good to have you guys on here hi
Jarrod how's it going
not bad how is it Missouri it's hot yeah
what about you rob in DC it's hot well
it's actually summer in San Francisco so
it's freezing but dude this is great
that we've got this new sponsor
GoToMeeting so we can basically do these
really nifty meetings where we can do
like roundtables get a couple of us on
here and and talk about what's been
going on lately and maybe do some demos
and everything you guys want to get into
it I'm ready let's do this ok so you've
probably seen lately that there's a lot
of a lot of buzz going on about
geolocation privacy and to start us off
I found this great article over this
website room 362 dot-com about iPhone
privacy as far as your photos are
concerned like I
horrible I don't know you don't mean to
listen to him at all what's wrong yeah
here's this room 362 go I don't know
it's like the only link in my RSS reader
but yeah Rob you want to tell us about
this you were blogging about this making
a big deal I thought it was awesome
so just to start off like Larry Larry
Pesci from Paul calm has been doing like
EXIF trying to get you know people to
know about exif data in like images and
stuff like that he actually did a
presentation at fire toxic shmoocon on
how there was a lady with a little bag
that they tried to redact like a nude
picture of her like just get some like
the top half over but in the EXIF data
that was actually some like a thumbnail
a high-res dumb nail that was the whole
picture yeah and she was she was she
wasn't she was in the she wasn't someone
who wanted to be floated nude I don't
know why they did it initially but
anyways so he told me about the EXIF
data so I went out and looked and none
of my twit pics seemed to have it and so
I was out like okay cool and I forgot
about it
and then a gentleman by that goes by
some the name savant sent me this and
had tons tons of my pictures and exact
locations on each one of them I'm like
whoa okay time to look at this even
further so when I went on Twitter they
have a really cool little option that
says hey where have my pictures been
taken and it said none you you have none
left location so I'm like okay you know
this guy obviously could have got it
from somewhere so I looked on it I went
to this guy Jeffrey's exit viewer site
which is awesome you can either upload
or give it just a strike URL and and
there's tons of types that he works with
but so I picked one that they had
pointed out and
it shows it an exact location of where
he took that picture which was not
something that was hat I was happy about
so even though you have you know changed
the settings so that none of your stuff
is gonna show up on the location well no
I didn't know that I didn't know that
pictures when I took them with the
normal camera pulled a geolocation on
them like I knew that I'm sorry I knew
that with the with the apps like there
were certain apps will say hey would you
like to allow location data and I'm like
no but with the sorrell normal camera it
doesn't ever ask you or it didn't so Rob
where are the settings how does somebody
using an iPhone go ahead and change the
settings so that they aren't
accidentally putting their location in
every photo that they share on the web
well you can turn it off like if you
have iPhone OS or whatever they call it
these days
that isn't Cisco related you could turn
off location services completely no but
that's not you don't want to do that
because we all want to use Google Maps I
mean yeah your TomTom app goes dead if
you turn off location services yeah but
I really don't want to jump from Google
Maps back and forth to my settings every
time I take a picture exactly so in the
new iOS they actually allow are in iOS
4.0 they allowed you to have a more
finer grain change on it so you can or
finer grain detail editing of saturn's
or whatever so you just go into general
location services and now now with this
new upgrade you can actually change each
one of the options in there including
camera so in my guy turned off for
camera I turn it on for maps and and my
TomTom oh thank god I was really worried
cuz I just ordered my iPhone 4 and I was
gonna say if I have to do this every
time I'm gonna blow a fuse yeah and
supposedly this gentleman that goes by
savant says that a bunch of phones do it
all the time and a bunch of celebrities
have it on so I remember
particular finding was it jamie
hyneman's address because somebody
linked it on twitter and mentioned that
there was exif data so i poked around in
that as well on the air and yeah found
his address here in San Francisco oh
cool
I'm totally gonna whip that up now do
you guys remember the Sammy worm a
couple years back the whole myspace
cross-site scripting yeah yeah the
myspace one well the same guy has come
out with a new tool that allows you to
basically find out somebody's location
based on the MAC address of their
wireless router dented so you know in
the new Google Maps if you just click
the my location service here we can
actually allow this and it will try to
pretty much pinpoint where I am on the
map based on the wireless SSID is around
us the MAC addresses and things like
that of course this isn't going to find
anything here because I'm on a desktop
PC no wireless adapter but I have used
this successfully even in the UK it was
actually quite handy when I was in a pub
and I'm like I don't know where I am and
I don't have a GPS on me oh and it's
useful but it's it's kind of important
to keep in mind that you can go ahead
and submit these MAC addresses of
wireless access points and find out
where they live so on Samuel PL slash
map XSS there's actually a demo here
where we've got MAC address sample MAC
address here that we would you know
typically find from our wireless router
and if we just go ahead and enter that
in we can see there we go that is our
location and I've gone ahead and tried
this just entering in some random MAC
addresses in fact if we just changed
this to an o1 there we go we've got
another valid MAC address with his
search Mac and we can find that there we
go that access point is right outside of
Santa Barbara this beautiful little
coastal town above launguage good stuff
so here's my question if you use the
allow services in the Google Maps is it
allowed permanently can you turn it off
where it is a vast every time I don't
know let's see I'll go ahead and try it
again
actually I'll open an incognito window
and say find me again and there we go it
found that it was in San Francisco
I was gonna ask you the same thing if
when you close your browser it it stays
with you and it keeps it on or if it
cuts it off out of it
this definitely kept it on because when
I hit allow and the first one and it
opened an incognito which is supposed to
be a essentially a new instance of the
browser it didn't ask me again well
actually incognito only goes one way
that it doesn't save it uses all your
settings that you have in your normal
window but doesn't pull anything back
from your your incognito session well I
guess I could try it in a different
browser and my location and I have to
say share location oh there's a setting
on this one on Firefox that said
remember for this site so ah there we go
it didn't look like chrome actually had
one a setting for that so automatically
it remembers it but if I'm interesting
about Sam EPL's code here is that his
entire proof of concept is based on the
idea of using a cross-site scripting
vulnerability in a verizon fios router
which lots of people have that basically
if they click this malicious link
they'll be taken to a page that runs a
script that finds out that clients MAC
address of their wireless router and
then sends it to the attacker so then
you can then plug it into this script
here and actually find out where they
live now I do have a way of turning off
this kind of geolocation services in
Firefox
all right let me go ahead and give you a
presenter show me the money can you see
my chin and it's all yours take it away
wow that was easy yeah so I have Firefox
open right here
and up here in the address bar if I just
put in about colon config press enter so
is this my boy your warranty yeah I
guess so I just say I'll be careful and
I will be careful and then up here I'll
just type in geo dot okay down here
where it says geo and abled I can just
right click on that click toggle and
that way it's user set so it's off yeah
so we've essentially just turned off all
of those geolocation services in her
browser completely yeah so it won't even
ask you now we are off the grid yeah
cool and then if you want to turn it
back on you right click and then hit
toggle again and it goes back to default
but isn't telling everybody where you
are every moment of the day everything
what we're just doing these days like
Foursquare and stuff like that yeah
totally yeah and there's a lot more
Foursquare goodness that we could talk
about in a future GoToMeeting roundtable
here on hack 5 but let's go ahead and
save that for the next week and let
everybody know that if they have
questions or comments about any of these
roundtables they've got topics that they
would like us to discuss experts that
they want to get us to get on go ahead
and email feedback at hak5 org and be
sure to put GTM in the subject line we
really appreciate it so move it where
can we find more of the stuff that
you're doing right now same site we
looked at first room 362 comm excellent
Shannon of course every week here on

hak5 that's how they knew we sent you
we all know that I'm huge on backups
especially online storage which is
pretty obvious when a couple of weeks
ago for a snugs report I talked about
wallow which is an online storage
service in heck five uses Dropbox to
share all of our videos with the cast
and crew so I decided to check out
Windows Live SkyDrive which you can try
out over at windows live.com slash
online slash SkyDrive now this tool has
tons and tons of features some good some
bad
so I don't know if I like it quite yet
that's why I wanted to check it out
today first of all you can get up to 25
gigs of storage that's a lot of storage
for an online service like this for free
completely free and you can access it
from any OS as long as you have a
web-enabled computer or a device you can
get up to 30 folders use on this Windows
SkyDrive and they can be protected
shared or they can be public which means
the protected ones have very very
limited sharing capabilities shared ones
can be shared with your contacts and
your friends on Windows Live and then
public can be with pretty much anybody
these are password protected so nobody
can get into your information and nobody
can see files that you have protected
specifically for yourself and you can
drag it and drop to upload files which
is very nice and very easy it's very
very user friendly which is great you
can share any type of file type and the
files come with a nice little link so
that you can stick it in your address
bar and link it to your friends or you
can email it to whoever you want but the
problem I have with this tool is that
you have to have a Windows Live account
to use it which for me I don't know if
it's gonna work all right so if you
already have msn or if you have a
hotmail Windows Live login it's really
easy to access SkyDrive you don't have
to download anything because
the entire thing is purely web-based
which is great so I'm gonna go to
skydrive.com and login with my Windows
Live login and you can automatically
access your files and folders there's no
need to download anything it's awesome
each folder has a permission level
either you only can see it some of your
friends you can set their permission
specifically so it's just a couple of
your friends can see it or a couple
can't all your friends on your list your
friends and their contacts or everybody
on the internet if you want to share it
with your friends though they have to
have that Windows Live account or they
have to be on your Windows Live account
contacts list so they can have like a
gmail address and be on your contacts
list and that works so I'm able to put
in some dubsy at gmail.com and that one
works just fine to share stuff with but
if it's not on my contacts list it's not
gonna work okay to add a file you go
into a folder and you choose add file
very simple from there you can drag and
drop your files into SkyDrive they
upload automatically and then they can
be seen by whoever you have chosen when
you click on a file you can view the
information about it that's like the
camera that took the photo the date and
time and it also creates this really
nifty link for the - - photo for easy
linking and emailing to all your friends
and family so I think my verdict here is
that I don't like Windows SkyDrive as
much as I like some of the other tools
that I have used on the internet for
online storage the 25 gigs is really
really awesome but you can only share
this stuff with your Windows Live
buddies in your contacts unless you want
to email in the link to every single
different file I don't know if that's
gonna work for businesses and for
friends around the world but that might
be perfect for Nana and Papa who have
been using hotmail for pretty much all
of its existence right email me what you
think over at feedback at hack 5 org I'm
especially interested if anybody out
