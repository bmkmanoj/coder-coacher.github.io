MD k3 and nonviolent protesting with an
Occupy napple plus what's the deal with
the MK 802 I'll be reviewing this little
Android PC all that and more this time
on hack 5 this segment of hack 5 is
brought to you by goto assist hello
welcome to hack 5 my name is Darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of tech knowledge
I am so excited why are you excited
because we have all these really cool
gadgets and I've been playing with all
sorts of different things like the Nexus
7 last week and Evan K 802 this week so
I'm just like all about you know hacking
things right now it's really fun hmm
I'm totally enjoying it and I'm so glad
I've been able to play with it you
should you should how about this you
hack all the things and I'll drink I
know there goes all the non alcohol well
I was actually I need to tweet this at
dual core because I had a problem the
other the other night when I was trying
to I was listen to the new album all the
things as you all should and I was like
yes drink all the booze pack all the
things so he did step one and then when
I got to step two I was all like how do
I pseudo what now no yeah I kind of okay
I want to throw this out there just to
see if anybody creative has like an idea
of how to do this with like a shell
script or something I would love if
there was like a daemon that would watch
your keyboard and know how many times or
what the percentage of the backspace key
is that you're using so when you're in
the terminal and like 50 percent of the
things you're typing is backspace I want
it to limit sudo I want it so they if
you're like sudo DD I F equals this
volume Oh F equals oops my you know
master volume it to see like dude
nananana no like you've hit backspace
way too many times
no more sudo for you yeah why isn't
there something like that I mean there's
an app for that on my iPhone so there's
there should be something for Linux so
you did an app for that what for like
yeah it's like saying if you can't do
math it won't let you call somebody
there's a Google Labs feature for that
for emailing yes I love the same thing
anyway that would be fun but emails
feedback about that org if you have any
ideas on that I'd love to do a thing of
emails we actually got a really funny
one from this guy named Nate yes he said
so I was googling SSID names and he came
across this really funny article called
funny Wi-Fi names yeah it's actually at
The Huffington Post Tim you check this
out they've got some of the funnier SSID
is this one you know Caitlyn stop using
our internet internet cost money there's
a whole bunch of really stupid ones in
here you know we can hear you having sex
your dog on my yard things of that
nature and it's like I kind of love the
idea of SSID is being used for that kind
of social commentary yeah in fact some
little messages what was interesting
about that first one was it actually
lists one pineapple under the you know
as one of the societies in the area now
the pineapple by default ships with a
with an SSID of pineapple and then the
last two octet so the MAC address so
they're uniquely identified we did that
because we were going to DEFCON and
we're like you know I really should
update the firmware so that they don't
all say pineapple or else there's gonna
be a whole it'll be like a slew of
pineapples well they wouldn't though
it'd just be the same ID and they would
all right each other okay yeah because
when we'll talk about this there's a
difference between the bssid and what i
like to call the ESS ID or aka the SSID
so we should probably get into that oh
and I should also mention if you ever
come to a hacker conference you know
Derby can't work on music on Def Con
wherever we're like bringing the hack
shop and have a lot of fun with
pineapples the first thing you want to
do is change the default password of
your pineapple yeah or else your
pineapple will get on walnut yeah that
happened that was really sad when
somebody comes to the booth and they're
like hey my pineapple got on your root
passwords people anyway it affects
hackers too i love it so i the bssid
well where did all these come from you
guys know that I love the with ease
BSS you may have heard it stands for the
basic service set and what that
basically is is that's the access point
and all of the stations aka The
Associated clients connected on
different computers laptops whatever and
we talked about bssid a lot when we're
doing like deaaath attacks where we need
to know that sometimes we call it the
MAC address of the wireless network and
that's basically what it is most of the
time a be SSID stands for basic service
set identifier and that's something that
uniquely identifies the BSS and in a
typical ap and station scenario the
bssid is just the MAC address of the
access point so where do we get ESS from
that's the extended service set
identifier and that encompasses all of
the access points and clients not and so
you may have a network with multiple
access points and multiple clients maybe
you're using WDS or Batman or different
routing protocols to make like a big
mesh network in a campus and so that
would be your extended service set okay
so that's what leads us to the extended
service set identifier or sometimes just
called the SSID the service set
identifier which is like a call sign for
your network and that's what we all know
and love is the thing that we named our
thing or change it from the default
links is their Netgear to something
funny right
and that's what we're talking about
today okay it's 32 characters by default
as well as the max for the specification
but using a tool like MDK 3 we can
actually spoof beacon frames these are
the looking for the bacon print has
bacon frames although I want some bacon
frames now sorry the beacon frames the
frames that get you know broadcasted
from your typical access point to say
hey I'm a I'm an access point this is my
name and just kind of broadcasts to like
say hey let's all have fun or you know
your phone sends out a per request to
the bssid of 1 1 1 1 1 11 oh no v1 to
say hey are there any so and so's around
that's your broadcast the SSID it's like
a MAC address and it will you know and
if there's a nearby one it'll respond of
course with the probe request saying hey
we all know how pineapple works and all
that fun well I've been having fun with
the the new
latest version of the pineapple 2.7 just
came out we'll be talking a lot more
about it later saw the release on the
forum yeah it introduces a whole lot of
new awesome stuff including a you know a
new opkg source and pine numbers which
we're getting to later and some you know
various bug fixes and fun stuff like
that what I wanted to bring up was how
using bartender which is an application
for the Wi-Fi pineapple if you go to and
again you don't need a pineapple to do
this you could do basically the same
thing with any laptop but you know it's
always fun to do it and then hide it
somewhere and then come back and your
battery pack and yeah in a park
somewhere there you go
or magnetically connected under one of
the seats in front of you on a Bay Area
Rapid Transit but you know if you are
legally required to do such things
right not if you're not so bartender is
actually one of the apps if I go here
under pineapple bar and that's where you
get bartender from so it's pineapple bar
is basically a place where you can you
know download a bunch of different
modules infusions for your pineapple
cocktail it's awesome we have a lot of
fun with it and so bartender is a
application written from Sebastian that
makes it easy to write modules for the
pineapple and so I've got Darren's first
module here and this is what I like to
call the occupy napple it's currently
disabled and basically what this is is a
front end for MDK three we've talked
about this app before stands for
murder/death/kill 3 and what this allows
us to do among other cool fun Wi-Fi
hijinx like d authentication attacks it
allows us to do spam to spam those
beacon frames those beacon frames
basically say hey I'm an access point
here's my SSID name here's my B SSID MAC
address here's the channel that I'm on
here are the modes that is support to
the 11 B G and whatever yeah and this
tool allows us to spoof those ok so by
default it comes with this this
configuration here where it it uses the
bssid you'll see that's the first bit
there c0
fe c 0 fe c 0 fe so is what you were
showing off at Derby con it's one of the
things yeah okay and so this is the
bssid aka the MAC address of the
pineapple in this case I'm not actually
using its real MAC address I'm just
using this one coffee coffee coffee
cuz I'm wanting some caffeine
understandable space and then what the
SSID would be okay and all of these are
under 32 characters so they're going to
show up fine on any device the frame
actually has a limit of 255 characters
so you could you could actually make a
be a SSID like a really long one the
only problem is it's at least in my
experience it won't show up in Android
or iPhone and all urges at all yeah it
doesn't even drunk at it which is kind
of weird you'd think that maybe you
could actually use it to hide your SSID
but then again that's never security
anyway and then your clients won't be
able to connect so what's the fun in
that
so I've got just the default ones here
we demand you know coconut and all this
is fun things but we actually we can
generate a default SSID list and
basically what I've done is in this case
we're actually not using coffee coffee
coffee were this is the actual MAC
address of the pineapple and then I just
threw in some Gandhi quotes for good
measure well what's nice about this is
you know I can actually choose the speed
how fast I want to do those on what
channel I want to broadcast these you
know I'm already using mon0 which is the
monitor mode interface and the pineapple
and all you have to do is enable it
what's fun about this is now here we go
pull up my phone and so anybody nearby
there we go
first they ignore you so anybody that
has a device nearby they're going to see
then they laugh at you or actually then
they fight you then they laugh at you
then you win and so as you can imagine
this kind of enables you to do well not
only some fun non violent protesting but
if you you're familiar with the way the
pineapple worst of the probe requests
and responses you'd actually use this to
make it a lot more of an active attack
by putting in like say the top 100 most
common SSID names
yaks free AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi ATT Wi-Fi gogo
in-flight H honors ya Linksys Netgear
TRENDnet dealer yeah yeah yeah yeah I
thought that was kind of a funny it's
easy to use too and and I love that it's
like it's you know if you give it the
MAC address coffee coffee coffee nobody
will be able to actually connect because
they're like looking for it and it's
like oh well it's not there
right but if you actually use the the
actual bssid of a pineapple like i have
in this case where that's actually the
MAC address right there anybody looking
for any of these everybody sees these
once to actually connect will associate
with the pineapple of karmas turned on
and in that case you could actually use
it to put up a splash screen with your
message whatever it may be like you know
we demand mangos whatever you know and I
just thought hey and I couldn't to be
honest I can't pass up a good
opportunity for a pun and so that's the
occupy napple so did you create this
yourself no I mean well MDK 3 was not
created by me and this is basically just
a beautiful front-end for MDK 3 you can
do the same thing on your computer here
I'll show you the the script if I
increase the size here and cat MDK 3 SH
you'll see what it's doing is issuing
MDK 3 on Monsey rob4 broadcast and then
tack v for verbose and then just says
hey here's my SSID list tak G tells it
to be a native 2.11 G network attack s
20 it says 20 times per second and taxi
11 says on channel 11 so if you do MDK 3
you're gonna get all of the options here
for MDK 3 and you'll see beacon plod is
one of the first ones so MDK 3 tactic
help the same thing you're doing on your
Mary you're just not so easy GUI
basically ok yeah I don't know I just I
want to know what other people think
about that like as far as kind of
getting your message out there we were
it was funny last night at dinner we
were talking about changing our SS IDs
to like communicate through them just
like just really bizarre
and totally inefficient networks yeah
how you could do them with those totally
inefficient but they're fun yes cool
well next up I have some amazingly fun
stuff to do with this mku MDK three 8mk
1802 +35 okay great we'll be back here
