wirelessly Apple begins a bug bounty
program finally point-of-sale terminals
are hacked once again an qualcomm had a
few Android chipset security flaws all
that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for August 9th 2016 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom if you
haven't checked out our patreon just yet
please do so we have lots that we want
to do for this show but we can't do it
without your support patreon.com slash
threat wire is the place to support
threat wire and the link is in the show
notes so it turns out a large percentage
of Bluetooth Low Energy smart locks can
be wirelessly unlocked by an
unauthorized person according to
researchers Anthony Rose and Ben Ramsey
discussed during the DEFCON hacker
conference which was super fun by the
way you guys should go it was held this
past weekend in Las Vegas they showed
that 12 out of 16 tested Bluetooth smart
locks had problems allowing them to
wirelessly unlock them the vendors with
vulnerable devices include quick lock I
blue lock plant rocco co mate elect
cycle
viens okie-dokie and mesh motion august
smart locks were not found vulnerable
but in another talk at Def Con these
locks were shown to have some problems
as well Bluetooth Low Energy does not
necessarily have to be insecure in fact
a lot of the vulnerabilities found were
in their implementation for example
plaintext passwords being sent over
Bluetooth there were problems with
encryption or with the smartphone
application that they used all 12 of the
vendors were contacted but none of them
had a fix planned for their customers
now in another talk researcher Damien
Kok well demonstrated ble hacking by
intercepting Bluetooth connections and
starting a man-in-the-middle attack to
inject new commands into the data be
sent to a Bluetooth device for example
he hacked a Bluetooth robot his findings
and his code are shared on github and in
the cases like these the researchers
always recommend turning off Bluetooth
use on unpatched devices better late
than never
I guess it's come on guys it's 2016 on
Thursday at blackhat an annual InfoSec
con that happened
right before Def Con in Vegas Apple head
of security engineering and architecture
Ivan Christic announced that Apple will
begin a security bounty program by
invite-only awarding various amounts of
hard cold cash for found vulnerabilities
in their products
these include access to user data from a
sandbox process for twenty five thousand
dollars all the way up to secure boot
firmware components for two hundred
thousand dollars bug bounties the
program only has 24 spots open for
security researchers to start but others
will be considered in the future now due
to the controversy and some of the
negative feedback regarding their
previous court case against the FBI in
regards to the San Bernardino iPhone
Apple is moving towards incentivizing
security researchers to bring these
vulnerabilities to Apple instead of a
third-party Christic said to the
blackhat audience quote we've had great
help from researchers like you in
improving iOS security all along
feedback that we've heard pretty
consistently both from my team at Apple
and also from researchers directly is
that it's getting increasingly more
difficult to find some of those most
critical types of security
vulnerabilities so the Apple security
bounty program is going to reward
researchers who actually share critical
vulnerabilities with Apple this
announcement comes three years three
years after Microsoft began their own
bug bounty program and several years
after other large companies as well I
don't know if you know this about me but
I used to work at a payment processor so
installing point-of-sale systems and
credit card terminals was a part of my
job it was really fun and I got to see
why vulnerabilities happen firsthand
well it turns out another point-of-sale
vendor Oracle owned micros has had a
security breach malicious code was found
in over 700 legacy systems and micros
has asked customers to change their
online support passwords the micro
servers were strangely communicated with
servers that are suspected of being
connected to a Russian cybercrime gang
and code embedded on the micro systems
allowed the attackers to steal usernames
and passwords now this isn't the first
point-of-sale system to be hacked in
recent years and probably won't be the
last
attacking point-of-sale systems gives a
thief and very easy way to steal credit
card data to sell on the Deep Web and
then that data
is then used to create fake credit cards
for fraudulent transactions throughout
this year for security flaws have been
found in Qualcomm chipsets running on
many popular Android devices possibly
totaling over 900 million devices in
total now these problems allow an
attacker to gain escalated privileges on
a user smartphone by getting them to
install for example a malware infected
application it wouldn't require any
additional special permission so it
wouldn't look suspicious in any way the
chipset affected is used in smartphones
from blackberry huawei HTC LG Motorola
Samsung Sony and oneplus and all of
these are the most up-to-date
smartphones as well so not the older
branded ones now patches have already
been distributed to users with Android
phones but others have to make their way
through carriers before being released
and those specific Android phones are
the Nexus line now Qualcomm has already
patched all four back in April through
July so this is a great example of how
long the user may have to wait to
receive a security fix through a carrier
with an Android phone the flaw hasn't
been used in the while so far as far as
checkpoint knows
according to checkpoint security and
checkpoints quadrotor scanner app can be
used to scan your phone for any of the
vulnerabilities quadrotor is the name of
the qualcomm chipset vulnerabilities now
thanks again to all of the fine people
who contribute to patreon.com slash
threat wire I apologize my voice is a
little bit shot but I was definitely
going to make sure to record an episode
of threat wire for you this week you
guys keep bringing the show back to life
and you are the reason that we keep
bringing you news every single week any
little bit helps to help us grow the
show and in return we will build an RSS
for you and when we reach our next goal
