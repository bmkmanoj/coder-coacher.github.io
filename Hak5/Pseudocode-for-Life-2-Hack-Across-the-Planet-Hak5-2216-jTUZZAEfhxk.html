why are they going backwards is driving
me crazy that some of them are going
backward
back across the planet continues the
diplomatic mission to Alderaan is now
taking me to South Africa where I'm
about to board this here Boeing triple7
the 300 gr so like a little longer and
go further so an Emirates they've got
like the biggest cleat of these guys I
love that plane I mean don't even
rolling the dream left dream dream dream
liner I wish I were dreaming I wish I
were back in bed it's like too early in
the morning for me anyway I'm the next
20-something hours ahead of me is just
connecting through Dubai to Johannesburg
and we'll see what Africa is all about
we'll see on the other side
thank you and just like that for the
first time ever I'm a South Africa if
you have a great idea bring it to the
web the way Shannon I do and head over
to domain.com with an awesome domain
discovery service and a quick immediate
checkout process you'll have the perfect
site up and running in no time my guys
over at domain.com are soon tack five
bands which is why hak5 will save you
initial 20% at domain.com or just send
my tweet and say thanks it's 14 hack
five all three years so when you think
domain names think domain.com I'm doing
well
no selfies with a commission from this
employment
from who and then some pentominoes name
okay so justin photos okay okay all
right thank you I'm not allowed to take
videos here but you know whatever I'll
just see if I get arrested and if that
happens that happens because it's better
to regret something that you have done
and something you haven't and I'm not
going to regret not doing this episode
that's actually what I wanted to talk
about that's kind of one of my mantras
and I feel like I figured this would be
a good opportunity to just share with
you some of my own personal regrets and
not very brats of my life it's going to
give you guys some perspective and maybe
you have some of your own that we could
share in the comments and such so I'll
just start by saying that I don't regret
whatsoever starting an underground
newsletter in my middle school and
getting myself in a dozen others
suspended and then ultimately learning
the hard way that freedom of speech
doesn't apply when you're juvenile on
state property who knew right
I don't regret breaking into a Bell
Atlantic remote terminal and getting
investigated by the Virginia State
Police for telephone fraud and you know
getting grounded for life as my little
thumb freak youth because come on you
know that's that's made me a better
person I feel like and as weird as it
sounds I actually don't regret I don't
want to say dropping out but I took a
semester off to start a podcast and that
seems to have worked out fairly well and
really to be honest I I could have
taught most those IT classes anyway so
you know one of the scariest ones though
is quitting my day job as assistant min
for a TLA in the DC Beltway and then
practically foreclosing on a house that
I bought right before the recession and
just throwing caution to the wind right
and just getting on a motorcycle and
going one way west zigzagging across the
country to get to Silicon Valley with a
dollar in my pocket and the good graces
of this community and I absolutely don't
regret that though it was like the
scariest thing ever to do getting into
it
what I'm grateful for is you know every
guest bed in every couch and every
warehouse floor and every friend along
the way at the hacker space is that that
put me up and it's those stories that
make me who I am today and I'm just so
grateful you know this year I'm doing
another thing I'm taking a plunge and
I'm big zagging across the planet west
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan and
now it's brought me here to South Africa
so now no regrets well okay okay I have
a few I've fallen a few episodes behind
and I've let Discovery Network and
Shannon down a little bit so for that I
do regret what's up yes here's what else
let's see I've lost contact with my team
in many ways back in California my
family there and that I actually truly
regret because I miss you guys
I can't wait to get back to the bay but
along this way I found actually some
really cool new direction for the show
I've gained a perspective that I
wouldn't have otherwise had you know
just like 30,000 foot view of this
company that I run that happened out of
all of these regrets and none regrets
these stories that are life and you know
what I really regret is just not keeping
up my daily vlog from 2010 that I
started on that first hack across
America right I regret censoring myself
in so many ways because of well the way
that this industry is the way that the
hacker world is and and I regret not
being able to make the time every day to
just hang out on IRC so I don't know I
just wanted to remind you guys that the
only time is now right those regrets
they don't matter those are the things I
didn't do and they're in the past and
the past is gone and the only time that
I have is right now right here in the
present and presently I'm building
something awesome something epic here in
Africa right so I hope that wherever you
are you're living your day to the
fullest and if you can't wholeheartedly
say absolutely yes do that then go ahead
and just alt f4
or command queue right now and step on
to Terra Firma and enjoy everything that
this planet has to offer that's it just
that's this episode I love you guys I
wish you were here I wish that I could
see you all next month at DEFCON which I
could have a beer or a coffee or uh or a
duel in Galaga right if you're in London
next week I hope to see you there
otherwise hey check it out
that's Nelson Mandela pretty cool all
right pull with that i'm darren kitchen
across planet comm trust you Tecna left
