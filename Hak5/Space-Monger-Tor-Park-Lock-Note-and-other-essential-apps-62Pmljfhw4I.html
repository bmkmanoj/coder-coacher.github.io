Munich's otherwise known as rob some of
you might be very familiar with them
easier on the show and he's come to show
us a nice little special collection of
programs that you can carry on your USB
thumb drive very very useful very
portable so nice to have you on the show
banks good pleasure let's get to it what
what are these programs like what's so
special about these programs okay well I
got a lot of them and will probably be
including them in the show notes okay
but there's four good ones that I want
to point out and I like more than the
others all right um those are the first
one is HFS web server HFS web service
stands for HTTP file server web server
file server web server kg and you can
use not unix backwards but uh so this
little cool little program what it does
is single executable lightweight and all
you have to do is double-click it and
you got a web server and what this web
server does is you drop drag and drop
files onto it and it serves it out to
whoever on that website has a site nice
little web interface for whoever goes to
it okay so like you to whomever has
access to this particular file server
that you've given right it'sit's ftp
access for them you can write well it's
faster than ftp because you can actually
use w get or other other tools on it and
open up like 10 connections to it and
really yeah yeah you can open many
connections as a web server it would and
use like w get or like apt-get or
something right if you're running a
linux tysons download manager that's
awesome it's really cool and once in
this fact that it's a standalone
executable will allow even like limited
users access to the program you know
like they can run the program themselves
without having administrative privileges
right so if i'm a sysadmin then i go out
to a remote site mm-hmm I don't have to
know that that is C is that met sysadmin
administrator password to get whatever
file I need off the this local guys hard
drive okay and I just send it back and
circle okay so next on the list next on
list is space marker I've actually been
using this for a long
long time initially came out on pc world
little CD okay long sigh get like a
shareware freeway type deal right and
what it does is visually graphically
shows you your hard drive or whatever
drive you decide to pull up on it ok and
a little colors pastels but you have a
six gig file somewhere that you'd have
no idea where it is but or whatever size
file is taking up your c drive and you
partition it normally so yeah but it's
taken up all that space right mm-hm so
you don't know where it is you fire up
space mugger it searches the whole hard
drive real quick and tells you
graphically how much this file is that
size that file is this size and you can
delete it from it you're not directly so
you actually have file like write
privileges well like as far as the
leader right whatever front with in
falmouth wrecked our space monkey space
monkey so next we got lock note lock
lock notes you've all heard no pad right
of course you're not Rachel right my
HTML everybody has no pet yeah well lock
notes say you have things you want to
store like your keys for your Wi-Fi you
know their 128 bits for a WEP that you
use not supposed to and you know these
keys and you don't want to remember this
whole thing and so you put it in notepad
you save it you drop it in the lock note
put a password on it encrypts it ok so
it's portable encryption right and you
just store you don't have to store any
program with it it goes into lock note
as an exe and you double-click it put
your passwords and you got all your
stuff Oh neat so you don't have to carry
lock note itself with you you just have
to have your pass word from Locke note
like whatever password you set for that
file right and that file and that's it
and it's a pretty pretty secure
encryption to oh yeah hello we and next
now many of you might know about tor
Park tour park is portable in a portable
Firefox I'm sorry ok portal Firefox is a
tool that was used on a lot of USB
drives when Firefox started out and
what this designer did I'm not sure of
the name but put tour which is the onion
router will be talked about later and
and smacked it into their park okay yeah
a part and came out with tour park okay
just all you do is a slapped or park on
your USB Drive double click it and
you're instantly on The Onion Router
please you just you got Firefox do young
around and that's it so you're surfing
in Firefox and it's instant anonymity
right there you go awesome awesome that
is so cool and you said you're going to
have an extended listing of a very
intended sweet everything on a one gig
hard drive or USB stick that I have
thank you so much Rob that's really
wrong cool and like we said anywhere you
know at any time once you get done
watching this or whatever yeah excuse me
listing of all of all of these programs
and a lot of other ones for your USB
thumb drive in the show notes thanks a
lot enjoy the rest of the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
