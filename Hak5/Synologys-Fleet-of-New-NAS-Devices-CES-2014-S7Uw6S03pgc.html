by Toyota hello my name is Shannon
Morris I'm from hack 5 coming to you
from CES 2014 you can tell it's the end
of the day because I'm starting to act a
little bit wacky and I've had way too
much chocolate today I'm here with Thad
he's from Synology which is one of my
favorite personal favorite
network-attached storage is hi Thad how
are you I'm very well Shannon so glad to
hear you're hyped up on chocolate out of
this world so tell me a little bit about
your your NASA's the ones that you have
available right now
oh sure so we have a very extensive
product line and in fact people have
been to our site well probably notice we
have probably too many products but we
start out at a unit that runs at $160
and then we cap out at $7000 yeah so we
have a very dynamic range and it's the
thing I guess the thing that I could say
is unique about that is all of our
products run the same operating system
so whether you're entering in at the
$160 level or you know up to their
top-of-the-line $7000 model it's the
same operating system across the board
there's no learning curve that's awesome
I love hearing that because it's always
well well let's go ahead and back it up
a bit what is network attached storage
for anybody that doesn't know certainly
so network attached storage is a class
of storage that is accessible wherever
you have a data connection so unlike
direct attached storage which lives
wherever your computer does or is
ostensibly accessible from a local area
network art storage our network attached
storage in general it live it lives with
your router and then from there you know
you can be sitting in a Starbucks and
accessing or updating your your photo
library sharing it tagging it cataloging
it yeah downloading our your entire
music library or streaming video content
caching video content for later watching
I mean it's it's a very dynamic class of
storage and in a sense you know all of
our products are fundamentally server
so network-attached storage is is a nice
soft way of saying server without
intimidating many many people because
it's not it's not the same thing as
using a server for sure it's like having
your own personal cloud at your home
which you purchase and then you don't
have all those extra fees on top of it
which is wonderful exactly yes I have to
know a little bit about the security
side of Synology well that's a good
question
we do offer 256 bit AES encryption and
we also offer a full range of user
access privileges that you can control
them manually
we also have a number of software
packages that handle a software firewall
in addition to the you know Hardware
firewalls that we have but as we are
continually learning sadly every week
the NSA has access to any information
that's being transmitted outside of your
home out of your local area network so
nothing is really secure anymore even if
it's 256 bit encryption so I feel I feel
wonky saying that our product is fully
secure because we now know that nothing
is nothing is secure on the internet and
yes yes you're right we do try so as a
home user as somebody who has you know
tons of photos and online video podcasts
what would you suggest that I would buy
from Synology well I would suggest one
of our expandable units I like to sort
of break our products down into two
categories we have fixed Bay units where
the volume of storage is limited to the
number of Bay's that you have in the
device you can plug-in like external USB
and eSATA devices that don't show up as
part of that volume but our network
accessible once you plugged in but you
are limited in that sense then we have
expandable units like the units behind
us that are either 2 bay units
expandable up to 7 5 billion is
expandable out to 15
eight out to 18 and on and on so those
units especially if you're a media
junkie like myself I'd never never
wanted to have to touch a DVD again I
want to rip all of my content and you
know just be able to stream it whenever
I want it because Netflix loses things
yeah I would personally personally want
to start with either the 1512 plus or
the 1513 plus if money were no object I
would want the D s 1813 plus because
even though I have no need for fornix I
it's there and it's there and you just
have to get it because it's there I
techno lust it's real it's so true tell
me tell me a little bit about the
software before we get too geeky for
people the software is going our
software is very robust and very
extensible already we're about to roll
out the public beta of our next
DiskStation manager operating system
this is that operating system that's
unified across our entire product
platform dsm-5 I mean is in a real sense
and I get raised hairs is going to be a
totally ground groundbreaking launch for
us it's well okay so network at that
storage is in so many ways it has a
level of friction because it is an
advanced class of storage so there's a
level of user accessibility that that
goes beyond the average user that's why
we we start our marketing towards
enthusiasts and prosumers because it is
more hands-on now in dsm-5 we've had a
we've had a background function called a
Quick Connect that had made it possible
to access certain files like audio and
photographs remotely without any port
configuration in dsm-5 that Quick
Connect feature is now in it's now the
entire operating system is incorporated
into it so when you install dsm-5
you're invited to either create or
import an existing Quick Connect ID
create a password and then by the time
you have a volume created all of your
content is available remotely without
any port for configuration without any
route config router configuration at all
so I mean from where I stand that's
about as close to plug-and-play as
NASA's ever going to get I mean it
stands across our mobile applications it
extends across all levels of the the
distinction manager operation operating
system including surveillance station I
mean it's it's is going to open up the
the range of users tremendously for us
that's so exciting anything that makes
it easier for a consumer especially when
it comes to things like safe storage
it's great that's very exciting yeah it
definitely gives people a place to start
I mean and one thing I would say so in
the next couple of weeks when we do roll
out the public beta they live the live
demo of our operating system that lives
on Synology comm will switch over to
dsm-5 so users will be able to play with
the interface without having to buy
anything give them a sense of how usable
it is they can go into the package
Center and see how they can build their
decision out to be a web host to be a
wordpress blog to be an iTunes server a
media server a voiceover IP server
however they want to make their distaste
in their own that's so cool and so
excited to check it out myself yeah
these things are awesome I definitely
recommend them myself just because you
know there's they're simple and they're
strong and they're hardcore so sad where
can people find more information
certainly well you can find more at
Synology com that's sy n Oh l OG y we're
also on Twitter at Synology and also
Facebook at slash Synology yeah and yeah
we'll have a lot more to show as the
weeks roll out so keep your eyes out for
the dsm-5 beta we'd love people to beta
test it the three most active testers
will win new destinations of their own
so please we want to make this a
kick-ass launch
that's great I like the idea of this I'm
gonna be one of those three watchout
watchout world that thank you so much it
was a pleasure to speak with you and I'm
sure I'll see you at the next convention
I hope so it's been a pleasure right if
you want to find more information about
Synology and CES you can go to revision
three.com slash CES 2014 thanks once
again to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
