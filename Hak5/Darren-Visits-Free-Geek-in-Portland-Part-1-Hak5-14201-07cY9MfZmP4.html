this segment of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com so free geek has been
around for ages here in Portland is it
only in Portland free geeks not in
Portland we started here but we the
whole concept and free geek all started
here but then other organizations have
said hey we really like what we're doing
what you're doing can we do it as well
and there are currently seven or eight
other organizations that use the name
free geek and our logo or a version of
our logo and and then there are a lot of
other organizations that are using a lot
of the same principles but don't
necessarily have our name so is it a
501c3 we are a 501c3
we all of the different free geeks are
completely independent of each other we
basically have allowed people to use our
name and logo and ask them to adhere to
certain principles but we don't have any
oversight over what they do once we've
given them permission to operate with
that name hi everybody welcome to free
geek my name is misty I work here at the
front desk and you'll see me all over
the building run around so I'm just
gonna give you a little show and tell
about what we do and all the different
programs
so basically we're a 501 C 3 nonprofit
organization our mission is first to
reuse and recycle computers and
technology we offer job skills training
education and actual computers to the
community in exchange for their
community service so what kind of is
like a hackerspace and like there's
guidelines and everybody kind of is
moving the same direction ish right
everybody makes it their own but you
have to exactly you've got to make it
work for you in your community and so
one prescription isn't going to fit
everybody well tell me about the
programs here at free geek sure we've
got a bunch of great programs that cover
a wide range so we have two main
day-to-day volunteering tracks where
people can
either learned how to build computers or
they can deconstruct computers for
ethical and environmental recycling
through both of those programs our
volunteers aren't able to receive free
computers if they desire them a lot of
people don't have the need for the
computer and they don't take it or they
do take it and give it on to somebody
else who they know who has a need so we
have two major programs adoption is
basically the 24 hour fast track to
getting your free computer that's 24
hours total of helping us out with
sorting different incoming Goods and
recycling then we have the build program
which is more time into learning
intensive it can be anywhere from 55 to
90 hours of your time but you're
learning how to refurbish computers and
build them with us so you'll build six
total computers and keep the sixth one
for yourself look at that the Sun came
out all right
so those are the major programs we also
have some more advanced post build
volunteer opportunities like laptop and
Mac build internships in just about
every area that we operate in and
classes that are free and open to the
community so lots of learning
possibilities going on here we also have
a ton of different internships available
in all the different areas where we
operate everything from helping with the
books to our tech support to working in
the thrift store and so we provide a
real wide range of job opportunities or
job building job skill building
opportunities for our volunteers and our
interns we also offer an education
program here that's free and open to the
public and our students are able to take
classes in a wide range of topics from
internet and activity and being
comfortable online being safe online -
how to use your linux computer for the
first time
we even offer some basic programming
classes as well and digital content
creation classes like yeah and Inkscape
classes so you're talking about a lot of
open source software here is free geek
mainly open source we are predominantly
open source we are huge proselytizers
for the open source movement we believe
a lot in they want free and open source
software has to offer and it really
makes it much better for us to do what
we do we love we love putting Linux on
our computers for several reasons it
really helps us helps us with computers
that might be outdated if you're using a
more bloated operating system we're able
to use perdón operating systems that can
still take advantage of a lot of the
hardware it's available in fact we have
some mcintoshes that we rebuild with
Linux that are currently out of OS
support and you're not even able to get
a modern operating system for them so
what you're saying that you refurbish
Macs we refurbish but you don't put Mac
OS oh no we don't put Mac OS a put-on
we do put a living a flavor of Linux no
we're putting currently as Ubuntu Linux
on there that we modified just slightly
for a free geek package so so you guys
also do what kernel modifications for
hardware I mean do do like you can make
code upstream to the Linux humidity we
do have staff here who are very involved
with the open source community and do
contribute to kernel development we
generally are building these packages
for ourselves that we are that we are
maintaining that we are able to support
so yes we do try to contribute back to
the open source communities in ways that
we can I think that there's always more
room for an organ
my cards to do more with that though as
well
I would I it would be great for us to to
be even more a bigger part of that
open-source community but we do try to
contribute back to that and we do
support that and so what about the the
desktops and the laptops
what would your go to distribution so
we're working we do standardize
currently and so pretty much all of the
desktops and laptops that we're putting
out right now and including the
Macintosh systems are all using Xubuntu
twelve point oh four we were previously
using Ubuntu 1004 and one of the reasons
we moved to the Xubuntu was it had all
of the benefits of abloom to but a more
pared-down
interface that we thought would be more
approachable for people that were using
Linux for the first time what's the
window matter
and so it's xfce as is what they're
using with that and that was to us it
seemed like an easier transition for our
volunteers who have been using our
computers for a long time instead of
introducing them to unity at this point
everything like they'd be ready for that
necessarily
so going from going from 1004 long-term
support to 1204 you switched over from
instead of jumping into the unity just
go with the Xubuntu for the XFC and all
that yeah that was part of that decision
and we had a distro committee that got
together it was comprised of volunteer
staff that really tried to look at a
bunch of district different
distributions that were out there and
make a decision about what would be best
for considering the hardware that we see
are in the needs of the people who we
distribute the hardware to if it's 80
gigabytes or under she's gonna get a
hole drilled through it and
you know information destroyed and
recycled responsibly if it's over a
begin because it will get hooked up to a
machine and the triple wipes and then
reset to factory settings which is all
in line with the Department of Defense
standards so what are kind of the ranges
of hardware specs that you then donate
to the community like this is my 386
gonna get into the stream right now it's
probably gonna get recycled um currently
were generally for the lowest and
desktop systems that were putting out
right now I believe we're looking at a
low end of the spectrum around Pentium 4
and capabilities and everything all of
our volunteers we receive what we call
freak boxes and those currently are in a
specification range of dual core
processors have a 80 to 160 gigabyte
hard drive CD DVD optical drive you'll
get a flat screen monitor keyboard mouse
speakers set all the cables and cords
needed to hook those up so it's a nice
package these are good machines you know
as technology kind of gets faster and
better we get faster and better stuff
and turn it around to you we do also
build out high-end machines video gaming
machines that we sell in our thrift
store and we do the one set of systems
that don't adhere to the Xubuntu or
don't tow the party line with Xubuntu
our XBMC systems that we also make
available through our thrift store one
of the programs that I and so I've
talked about giving computers to our
volunteers but another way that we also
give out computers is through our
Hardware Grants Program and we make all
sorts of electronics available to
prophets schools churches community
change organizations even community
change organizations without that 501 C
3 designation and we it's really
important to us to help support the
people that are trying to make a change
and there are in their communities and
we do that through our Grants Program if
you're working at the table or the bench
you'll get a toolbox and some
instructions on how to safely
deconstruct different items here at the
sorting tables there are so different
boxes around the table this is a great
area to become more familiar with cables
and cords and gadgets and gizmos and all
the computer related stuff that comes in
you're gonna be sorting them into
different boxes and you'll get familiar
with kind of what we may do with them
what gets tested what gets recycled
basically volunteers are pulling from
our stacks of systems and servers that
have already gone through our system
evaluation process and have been deemed
too old or broken to be refurbished so
we're breaking them down to their
simplest components here at the bench
this is definitely an interesting way to
learn a little bit more about how
computers work by taking them apart so
what's the biggest challenge getting the
computers into recycle getting the
manpower to recycle them or to find the
places to give
it all depends on what week you're here
are when I kid I've been it forget for
about a year and a half and when I came
on it seemed like we did have some
trouble giving the computers away we had
a lot sitting on our shelves that were
moving I've tried to work hard and we've
tried to work hard to get them into a
lot more places and so through a
successful partnership with another
nonprofit we've been able to get over
400 systems into the Portland Public
School System this year which has been
really nice accomplishment but it also
it's a lot of systems that would have
been available to other organizations as
well and so right now one of the
challenges we're facing today is a
little bit more getting the hardware in
the donations from households and
businesses are slowing down some in
regards to desktops because if you think
about laptop adoption rates you know and
and when people are changing over their
equipment we are seeing fewer of those
desktops come in which is fine because
we'd like to be able to provide more
laptops but we also need to see those
come in as well and and though it's
harder for those to come in and workable
condition or refurbish a little
condition that we can work with it so
what has it been like with the trend of
you know the migration of desktop the
laptop as people become more mobile you
know you're getting the hand-me-downs so
you're a few years behind whatever the
the cycle is but what kind of laptops
are you taking in what kind of you know
what's the challenges and refurbishing
those it's been a we haven't moved as
quickly into laptops as we've wanted to
and so that's been a little bit
difficult we would really we do get a
lot of demand from people who come in
and volunteer a lot of requests from
people coming to volunteer and
organizations that request things
through our Hardware Grants program for
laptops and we've we're not able to give
them to our volunteers
apparently because we can't do that for
all volunteers equally and we try to
provide equal access for everyone who
comes in so that's been very difficult
another issue that's been difficult for
us is finding volunteers who are able to
handle the miniaturized nature of
laptops and then also the fact that so
many components of laptops tend to be
proprietary as opposed to desktops where
you really were able to swap out so many
different parts of it it was a big open
space to work in and so that's been a
challenge for us because for us to give
out a laptop we almost have to have an
extra laptop in reserve in the back in
case anything goes wrong with that we
really like to stand behind the work
that we do here and so if you purchase a
system through our thrift store it comes
with a six month warranty people who
receive computers through our
volunteering here through our Hardware
Grants program get a one-year warranty
and so we'll replace something that
we're not able to fix what's nice is
that also means that they come with free
tech support for a period of time as
well and we have the tech support
program that is run by staff but mainly
staffed by volunteers and it's a really
wonderful opportunity for those
volunteers to learn about real-world
tech support issues and some of the
skills necessary for them to get
employment in other places he's here we
also have a full Gaylord of CRT monitors
we're not having volunteers break those
down in-house for very good reason CRT
stands our cathode raped to be very
dangerous to living things
there's also mercury
Hecky of economy of all kinds of
dangerous chemicals and the CRTs so
we're actually sending those off to our
vendor total reclaim of each of the
recycling vendors that we participate
with have been highly researched we know
they all comply with the Environmental
Protection Agency holes and regulations
for more hazardous materials like the
CRTs we have even us a higher like r2
certification for those vendors and
we've chosen kind of the most local and
carbon footprints leaving vendors as
possible to work with we know their
Chain of Custody community we know how
things get broken down and where they go
so that's kind of the overview basically
you can rest assured that you'll be
contributing to ethical responsibilities
I claim when you're working here preview
and to give you a little bit of insight
in the numbers and kind of how much we
end up recycling all this orange bin
so your volunteers that come in how
would you categorize them are they
mainly geeks are they hackers are they
computer illiterate the best thing about
this place is we get B range from people
who don't understand the difference
between left click and right click and
really haven't used a computer before
two people that were responsible for
building some of the first computers
that ya that you could build in a home
on your own or even industrial a it's
really wonderful so we've got a wide
range of experience and expertise here
and we really try to make many volunteer
opportunities available to anybody
regardless of their physical or
cognitive abilities and so we like to
tell people that for R and you may have
heard this on the tour even but we like
to tell them if you can bake a cake you
can build a computer and we can show you
how to do it if you can follow a cake
recipe we also have for the volunteers
who are taking apart systems a lot of
people come here because they either
want to help their community or because
they do want to receive a free computer
and for many people we offer
opportunities to take apart computers or
to help us sort different items that
come in to free geek and so for those it
requires absolutely no level of
technical proficiency and even for our
build program are the very first thing
you ask people to do is take the
hardware ID workshop where they are
going to learn all of the core
components components of computers and
so we don't ask them to have any
advanced technical expertise
you've heard me say and I'll say it
again when you've got a great idea it
all starts with a great domain and let
me tell you every domain in the world
has one thing in common
it ends with a TLD not necessarily TLD
but top-level domain and as far as
top-level domains are concerned dotnet
is one of the most awesome that you
could check out because if you already
have a dot-com a dotnet is a great thing
to accompany it or if the dot-com you
want is taken you don't want to register
something 140 characters long a dotnet
is totally suitable it is highly
recognizable it adds instant credibility
to whatever your project may be and
that's what Shannon and I have been
registering over at domain.com for years
now I've got Darren kitchenette hack
across America net is truly awesome
working with these guys they've been
supporting hack 5 for years and you guys
should check it out at domain.com
because they have a special hookup just
for us all you have to do is use the
coupon code hak5 at checkout and you'll
get 15% off they're already affordable
hosting and then domain names I mean
dotnet start at $8.99 so hey get 15% off
that already all you have to do is go to
domain comm use coupon code
AAA 5 you've got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain it's time for
the trivia
now last week's trivia question was what
radio station did Kevin Poulsen take
over to win a Porsche 944 and the answer
was KISS FM that's ki is tak fm now this
week's question is what is the actual
name for prism the NSA run surveillance
program you can answer that over at hack
5 org slash trivia for your chance to
win some awesome hack 5 goodies
