you by FreshBooks
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I'm introducing
a new tool for like mines called n map
and map is short for network mapper it's
a free and open source utility for net
security audits and network discovery
it's been around since around 1997 or so
but it hasn't changed too much but it's
still kept up to date by its user
community now n map is available for a
variety of platforms and the most
popular of course being Linux over the
course of my nmap series I'll introduce
concepts such as using it for host
discovery which is basically identifying
hoes on a network port scanning version
detection OS detection and scriptable
interactions with a target now that's
the funnest part and map can also give
you info on DNS names device types MAC
addresses and even more it's usually
used for auditing the security of a
device or identifying open ports or
network inventory and you can also use
it to identify new servers as well of
course and map just like any other tool
out there can be used for black or white
hat hacking and is widely used strictly
for systems administration so let's take
a look at how to download and install
and map as well as your first scan but
first let's take a quick break

accounting solution built for small
business owners just like you and me who

and digging through invoices and going
through every single record one by one
that's the absolute worst now fresh
books is the simple cloud accounting
solution that makes tax time a breeze my
taxes they're already done you know why
I was able to keep track of each and
every receipt for the entire year
through their expense page I can group
and I can sort depending on the type of
expense so when I'm filling out my tax
forms it's really easy to find specific
receipts to be honest it kind of helped

books calm and enter hack five and how
did you hear about a section when
signing up thanks again for supporting
the show we're back and now we are ready
to download nmap so the first thing you
want to do the very first thing you want
to do is on your terminal on Linux type
in nmap - - or tak tak version and this
should show you a version of an nmap if
it's already installed if it is not it
will also tell you that so if you do not
have n map installed it'll let you know
it'll just say you need to install this
with sudo apt-get install and map very
easy to use now there is also a
graphical user interface version called
Zen map that can also be used but we are
going to just focus on the command line
version for the hack tips both Windows
and Mac also have download options as
well and directions for both of those
downloads can be found through the nmap
org link and I'll have the link in the
show notes for you guys now if you also
have Kali Linux it's already installed
so you're ready to go I love Kali Linux
it's so wonderful now to start using
nmap to scan a single target just one
computer one server you can type in this
syntax it goes nmap and your target so
for my example i'm going to scan my
Synology mass so that my command would
look like this it's going to type in I'm
going to type an nmap and then whatever
the IP address is of the Synology 73 31
dot Sinise
so when I hit scan it's going to start
the actual scan the scan is going to
show you the status of different ports
detected so you're going to see three
different columns whenever you check
this out first off is port this first
column the second one is called state
and that says open and the service is
the last column over here and we see
things like FTP HTTP NetBIOS SSN and
that's very popular that one so in this
first column we have the list of ports
and this is going to show you the port
number that certain services are running
on and what protocol they are using so
we see that port 21 has a protocol
called TCP running on it now the state
is the status of the service and then
the service is the software that is
running on that server and it's server
services sometimes services or servers
it gets a little confusing but bear with
me so on here we see that the different
kind of software that we are using on
this server include FTP HTTP there's a
printer on it something that's unknown
Postgres SQL HM that can be interesting
so the state also I should mention this
can be open closed filtered unfiltered
open and filtered or closed and filtered
now paying attention to what processors
are running on your servers are often if
they can be really crucial to keeping
your network very secure more on that
later as we discuss finding a printer
and then discovering that telnet is open
on it oh that's fun so what would you
like to see next on nmap there's a lot
of very interesting things you can do
with it I can also use it with netcat to
do a series of different commands it's
very interesting and I'm very excited to
check it out myself send me a comment
below as usual or you can email us at
tips at hack 5 org and be sure to check
out our sister show hack 5 for more
great stuff just like this and some fun
with SDR radios I'll be there reminding
you to trust your techno West
