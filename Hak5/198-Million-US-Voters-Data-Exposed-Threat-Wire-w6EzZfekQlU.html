really great way to contribute to lots
of your favorite podcasts and other
artists and now onto the news over 198
million u.s. citizens had their data
exposed due to a marketing firm called
deep root analytics which was contracted
by the Republican National Committee to
analyze audiences for potential
political advertisements left a slew of
information on publicly facing Amazon s3
storage server dra for short confirmed
the data that was theirs on Monday
morning this is over 60% of the u.s.
population including home addresses
birth dates phone numbers religious
affiliations ethnicities and possible
stances on really hot political topics
the URL was not password protected so
anybody who found the URL could view
over a terabyte of data on citizens and
it was discovered by a cyber risk
analyst at up guard the kind of data is
not surprising for a marketing firm to
be honest but the amount is most of the
data was funneled through Republican
super PACs and other aggregate data
firms to form a huge whopping database
of people other data included in this
breach our files on presidential
candidates from 2016 files on several
different organizations and lobbyists
political advertisements and more
similarly the Obama administration used
this kind of data collection technique
in a smaller format during their own
campaign many years ago but that data
was never exposed to the Internet
according to deep root analytics founder
Alex lund Rhee the company had updated
the security settings for access to
store data on June 1st and the
a was accessed after that time by the
security researcher on accident it was
publicly available for 12 whole days on
the open web before being fixed
but obviously the damage could have
already been done
deeper analytics does not believe they
were hacked and the only person to gain
access to the data supposedly was the
security researcher dr a day later
admitted fault by claiming full
responsibility for the exposed data of
almost every single voter in the united
states we've heard the name lazarus
group or keepers of the peace before but
now they are known under a new name
called hidden Cobra according to
statements by the DHS and the FBI in the
United States this group of
state-sponsored attackers has been
compromising media financial aerospace
and critical infrastructure targets
since 2009 with DDoS botnets keyloggers
rats and malware some attacks included
exfiltration of data while other ones
were just disruptive their plan of
attack usually includes targeting users
with Adobe Flash vulnerabilities which
why are people still using Adobe Flash
in older Windows operating systems yes I
know those reasons that was rhetorical
by the way the two agencies determined
Hidden Cobra to be the culprits due to
IP addresses used for the group's botnet
called Delta charlie the report included
technical analysis of data in a report
called the no vetas operation
blockbuster destructive malware report
which is all linked below their
announcement is directed at
administrators at these kind of
infrastructure companies that were
targeted to warn them about the IPS that
should be on a watch list in case of
malicious activity they also recommended
updating to the most recent patched
operating systems and applications and
to take precautions with admin
privileges now if lazarus sounded
familiar that is because we previously
reported on their ties to the swift
banking hack which was last year and
most recently they have also been tied
to want to cry which a global targets
just a few weeks ago according to the UK
National Crime Agency a 25 year old
hacker named Sean Caffrey has admitted
to stealing user accounts from the US
military communication systems to
include user names and email addresses
of at least 800 users of satellite
communications investigators also
found a text in photos posted on peace
been around the time of the attack
including full names phone numbers email
addresses and user names of different
servicemen this happened way back in
June of 2014 and he was originally
arrested in 2015 after data showed the
hack originated from his connection and
forensics also found the stolen data on
his own hard drive damages are said to
be over six hundred thousand USD
according to the u.s. DoD his sentencing
will take place August 14th after he
admitted guilty under the computer
misuse act of Britain and our ongoing
story regarding WikiLeaks vault seven
releases of CIA documents new files
codenamed cherry blossom detail how the
CIA has been targeting wireless routers
and access points to monitor Internet
activity and deploy software exploits
the project was implemented with help
from the Stanford Research Institute
international VAP is compromised by the
CIA when cherry blossom is used as a
man-in-the-middle attack to upgrade the
firmware to exploit able malware instead
once compromised the router ap will send
out beacons to a CIA own server which
will then collect logs about the network
this can include just router information
or more information such as email
addresses chat usernames voice numbers
MAC addresses and so on and so forth a
web interface then allows the attacker
to make administrative changes to the
router as they please the attacker would
not need physical access to a device to
pull off the attack and the firmware
would work with hundreds of different
Wi-Fi router models including ones from
Belkin Linksys Apple Asus and more thank
