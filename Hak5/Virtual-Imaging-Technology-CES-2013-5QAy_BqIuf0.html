go further for hak5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 and I'm joined by Dan
funk Dennis how are you man good how are
you not bad this is some really wicked
technology walk me through it what is
condition one condition one is a tech
startup we're combining advanced 3d
graphics with high resolution video to
create powerful immersive experience and
we've just launched the conditional one
app for iphone and ipad and what it is
is a very high resolution video that
takes a 3d dome imagine a sphere cut in
half and we texture map video onto that
3d dome and tie it to the gyroscopes and
accelerometers of the device to create a
virtual window into the experience so
what would I need to record something
like this you can use any high
resolution camera the higher res the
better we use red cameras you can use
any video-enabled DSLR or even a GoPro
and so you say you project this I mean
virtually speaking to like a curved mesh
in 3d space as you could imagine first
of all how do we know what that
curvature needs to be based on the
camera and what kind of field of view
works best with it right so we want to
use lenses that capture 180 degrees of
video and so we use a very wide angle
circular fisheye lens on very high
resolution cameras and then we play it
back in a quad 720p video player it's
actually for 720p videos playing
simultaneously and then you can actually
manipulate the video by actually
touching the screen and looking around
the video as it's playing or even moving
the device around and you can look
inside the video from multiple different
angles by just simply moving it
something you really have to try so what
is this me mean to me as a consumer like
can I go ahead and start shooting my
video blog adventures on a motorcycle
with a GoPro now and then somehow
convert them into this app so that I can
spin them around or
how does that work right now we're
licensing our software to media
companies brands agencies anyone that's
creating compelling content for their
mobile and web audiences and so right
now we are supporting GoPros and coming
soon will be an application that allow
any consumer to create their own
immersive video so there's a bunch of
different cameras out there with
different field of view how does this
adapt to those because if it is
projecting it onto a like a curved 3d
mesh that's going to like really feel
weird if it's on the wrong kind of if
it's not calibrated to the fov so we
create custom meshes for every sensor
and lens combination so we recommend a
certain number of different types of
cameras and we create that mesh for
every type of camera so for the GoPro we
create a certain type of 3d model and we
remove all the distortion from a GoPro
video and then allow you to interact
with it and so if I'm shooting this and
I start spinning this where this is this
seriously looks like some of the awesome
roads that I used to ride in Virginia
but I get to the edge here and I just
see black are there any plans to add
multiplexing for not multiplexing about
stitching like live video switching
stitching for multiple camera sources to
create a full 360 yeah so we were very
interesting 360 but we want to make sure
that this is very easy for the content
creator so we've kept this to a single
sensor single lens solution and while we
could just do two cameras back to back
to create 360 we want to keep the
workflow completely seamless so we think
180 degrees and focusing all the
resolution in front of the viewer is the
most effective way to create an
immersive experience and so how could a
viewer go out right now and kind of see
a demo of this you can just download the
condition one app in the App Store and
it's available for iPad and for iphone
all right thank you so much for
continued coverage of all things CES
2013 be sure to head over to revision
3.com
did you know that stink comes with an
optional voice-activated navigation
system it does and I'll be honest with
you I use this thing every single day
because I still don't know the bay area
very well it gets me to and from my best
friend's house I can even set favorites
such as home and it tells me everything
I need to know over the audio system
speakers navigation please say a command
destination home destination home thanks
again to Ford for powering this hak5 CES
