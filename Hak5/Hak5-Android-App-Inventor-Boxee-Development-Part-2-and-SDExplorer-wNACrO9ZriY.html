accelerometers in the Android app
inventor basic boxy programming and
mounting the cloud as a network drive
it's the internet in my computer this
episode of act 5 is brought to you by
the United States Air Force dice.com the
career hub for tech and domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com hello and welcome back
five my name is Darren kitchen and this
is of course your weekly dose of technol
us and I am freaking excited about this
show because we have such a good one for
you guys rounding out the doubleheader
this week with a little bit of follow-up
on the App Inventor stuff from google as
well as Jason Applebaum back talking
about more boxing stuff that's just
going to blow your mind Shannon's with
us with a snubs report and I think we've
even got muaks coming on next week so
awesome awesome stuff can't wait and I
figured let's just go ahead and dive in
because I am here in the most wonderful
operating system oh I'm actually in
Windows 7 okay I have to explain last
week I was like dude I am totally taking
the plunge I mean as I have in previous
seasons tried to do most everything I
can in Linux and I'm making a really
good effort this time but the problem is
when things keep breaking and I need to
record the show and it's working in
windows there's absolutely no reason to
you know beat a dead horse I will try to
get this working in on my ubuntu machine
but i mean whatever it's it's a web app
so it's going to work the same
regardless if here in Windows Mac Linux
whatever so I have my droid set up here
and i figured i would show you some of
the cooler stuff about the App Inventor
how the UI stuff works in tandem with
the phone and even start dabbling a
little and building a something custom
and i gotta say i love this because it
really reminds me of like my das three
point three days just like banging down
and qbasic so you know while i'm a
horrible programmer this right here is
just further proof that an app like this
I
inventor little WYSIWYG drag-and-drop
happiness can let anybody actually play
and have fun and that's that's the whole
point of programming right if you love
this if you start playing around with
this drag and drop stuff maybe you'll
find that you really have a passion for
it and dude if you can sit like in front
of code for 40 hours a week I have the
utmost respect I pull my hair out but
this this right here is fun so let's
just head right over to app inventor
google labs com and i've linked up in
the show notes where you can grab
yourself a beta invite and i really hope
you all get in but let's go ahead and
i've got a couple of projects started
here so start a let me show you one of
the ones that comes well doesn't come
with but one of the example tutorials
just to give you guys an idea of what
this is capable this is like some of the
first chapter stuff too this is one
called no text while driving and
basically what it does is you run this
program and then if you receive a text
message it replies back to the sender
saying hey sorry I'm driving I can't
text you right now we'll talk later and
it's pretty simple when you look at this
will really what we've got is just a
label a text box and then a button but
what's really give D is if we open the
blocks editor here on the back end we'll
pop that open let Java load here we get
a fantastic view of what a more complex
app would look like so in fact in the
top right we can see that depending on
how app how big your app gets you
actually have a little navigation thing
here Allah Photoshop and we can take a
look at what's going on here basically
if you look at these blocks they all
start to make sense like when this one
says when the text messages receive well
it's defined what the number is and what
the sending messages and then we all we
have to do is set what the phone number
is and that's set to this number here
right the number of the person sending
us the message and then the text message
that we're going to reply and then we
just call this little thing here text
once n message we come back over here
and scroll down we actually see we have
texting that right there is one of the
modules that's built right in like I
said before we've got you know your
basic and animations and media and stuff
but it really gets fun when you start
playing around with the sensors and the
social media stuff like texting and
Twitter so
what's really neat about this app this
example really goes to show you what is
possible with the tiny database in fact
I think it's based on SQL Lite but i'm
not positive but right here when we when
we open this up we can actually change
what the value is of our text message so
we'll see if i pop this open and se
conecta phone and this is where it was
totally crashing in Linux but it's been
pretty stable in windows 7 here takes a
little while once you do this but it's
going to push that right over to my
phone here and I can see right away I've
got my label of government Xbox I can
modify the response and that's what's
really cool here is that when we hit
that that modify response it's storing
it in the database the next time we load
the app when the screen one is
initialized the first page of the app
it's going to go ahead and check here
into the tiny database and get the value
for the response and do a little test
here and if the response is greater than
zero actually meaning that there is
something there and it's going to go
ahead and set the text box to that
response so we can see that while this
one says I'm driving right now will
contact you shortly i could go ahead
click in here and change this to come on
of course i open the keyboard and it
freaks out get just a moment i'll click
over here to restart the phone app
oh the fun of live demos Who am I
kidding snubz owns the bluebird block
there we go we can see if I go ahead and
change this to say something more polite
like STFU noob I'm driving and I hit
modify response there we go next time I
launch this app it's going to say just
that so let's go ahead and build
something custom play around with it
because I figure you know that's half
the fun of it i mean we gather all the
tutorials leave that as an exercise to
the viewer but i've been having a lot of
fun with some of the sensors so let's go
ahead and create new project i'm going
to call it 10-5 because i'm not original
and i'm going to go ahead and begin by
opening our blocks editor and let that
Java load up well that's loading up I
should probably mention that if you're
going to test the whole texting while
driving thing don't test it out by
sending yourself a text message because
then it's going to reply and say STFU
noob and then it's going to see that as
a text message and then reply and say
STFU noob and 20 go to 10 yeah i did
that so I've got my project open I've
got my blocks editor connected to my
phone let's go ahead and start
populating the screen so with the blank
canvas here let's are not throwing a
label and so I'm going to make this
label huge font size like 60 or
something and let's just go ahead and
rename it call it something like accel x
okay and we're going to set that to just
X for right now in fact I like to go
ahead down here and width and say fill
the parent and center that and I got to
click out of that feeling them back in
here and find the center's well we look
right over here and boom there it is I
love how tangible that is as soon as you
start making these you start seeing the
results right over there on your phone
there's something about it not just
doing it in an emulator where you really
see what it actually looks like
on your device so with that let's go
ahead and create a button and I think
you're going to start seeing what I'm
doing here so drag it in a button i'm
going to call this we named it to
calibrate then for the text calibrate as
well i'm gonna make that maybe i don't
know 35 nice big button there alright
and then maybe let's do a label so we
actually see what our calibration is so
drag that label in there we'll make this
huge as well i don't know 30 and we'll
call this calibration and then let's
rename it this is very important here
because what we're doing is when we're
renaming this we're setting the name of
the variable so I've got my calibrate
button we've got calibration as variable
we've got accel x as a variable and it
really doesn't matter what these are
saying on the screen right now but I can
see over here on my phone there they are
let's go ahead and have fun with them
with one of my favorite sensors down
here the accelerometer sensor and drag
that into here you can see it doesn't
show up in the screen it actually shows
up down here under non visible
components because there's really
nothing to show that's why I have my
label right here at my calibration
button and then you know this is all for
debug because I'll be honest with you
guys what I'm really having fun doing is
I'm I'm toying around with this because
I'm coming up with a program that will
hopefully allow me to record the amount
of lean that I get on my motorcycle when
I as you guys know I have like a little
bit of what does this develop road here
on the back of my phone and then it just
kind of attach that to my tachometer I
got my google maps going and i would
love to run something in the background
that tells me what I'm getting into
those twistys on my bike how much I'm
actually leaning from side to side and I
don't know maybe even tie that in with
some of the location data and then be
able to track on some of the turns like
you know it would be perfect for a track
day so with those set i guess i'll go
ahead and
add a debug button and then one more
debug thing because I'm not quite done
with this program but I think it will
explain the principles of it regardless
so I'm going to grab another label here
and actually here let's do the button
first so button I'm gonna call this
button debug nothing sexy there and then
another label and then this level right
here i'm going to make like freaking
huge and we'll call it lean and we'll
make it centered which means i come down
here and fill the parent if i really
wanted to make it sexier i could go into
screen arrangement here and then i can
actually change the way that it is you
know it's kind of like kind of like CSS
in fact I think Jason actually showed us
how you can create these interfaces with
XML but man do I love seeing it cuz
there it is right there on my phone hmm
has not centered that's right it's like
it's a little buggy okay now it is all
right so with all that dumb books pop
over to our blocks editor and we already
see under my blocks I've got all of
these definitions for you know what I'd
like to see so first off want to check
out the accelerometer sensor drag this
puppy in here and say when the
accelerometer sensor has changed and we
can see it's pre-populated with the
values for x y&amp;amp;z all I'm caring about
right now is X I don't really care about
lean this way or whatever I'm I just
want to know the lean of the bike on the
x-axis so what I'm going to do is set
this right here my accel x i'm going to
set the text to one of my definitions
here and that would be under my
definitions the value for x excel
alright so what's cool about this is i
just drag that on there and if a look at
my phone already it's telling me Oh
point three what what Oh check that out
I had just drag that over there and now
I can move this back and forth I say
negative seven if I lean to the right
and then you know positive
seven if I lean to the left so what I
want to know though is when I put this
on my bike you know depending on how I
set the velcro and everything it's not
going to be perfect so I need to
calibrate this right so let's go ahead
and set the calibration button so I've
got my calibration button and I think
what we're going to do is do a when so
I'm going to do a little bit of logic
here or I'm sorry control no I'm not I'm
going to do sorry had the wrong one
calibrate and calibration it should have
thought about something better exact
let's change this right now let's change
this from calibrate to calibrate button
hey now I know what it is alright so
with the calibrate button the way that
it is now in boom instantly changed I
love that pop into here and say when
it's clicked what do I want it to do
well I wanted to change the calibration
so not set the height not set the color
I want to set the text and setting the
text is really defining a variable and
I've noticed that it doesn't matter of
it an int or car or whatever it really
they take all of that away from it so
you don't have to start thinking about
that right away it's kind of cool so
what we're going to do is set it to the
value of x el text so accel x there's
the text for that because we're getting
we're defining this up here with our x
access from the accelerometer so we've
already find it as this text value so
when I click this button it's going to
set the text for this to that and boom
since I've dragged it in there it's
already already done so now if I come
back over here alright let's get it on
something nice like to point or okay 1.9
hit the calibrate button boom there we
go we can see 1.87 so if I were to
calibrate on my bike like this it sets
that and that's not going to change I've
gone ahead and done that once and what I
want to do now is using my debug button
just go ahead and find out what
direction I'm leaning and in the future
I'm going to go ahead and do a lot more
fun stuff with a loop where I you know
check it on I pull it so however often
and and find out what it is so if i
calibrated at negative 2.6 three and
then i leaned too i don't know a
negative five then
it would be negative 5 plus 2.63 and
there we go i would actually have how
far to the right i am not necessarily
based on you know zero on the film think
that makes sense so just to make it
simple let's just do everything with our
debug button and say when our debug
button is clicked hold this down here so
we can see a little bit better when our
debug button is clicked and we're going
to have to do a little bit of control
here we're going to do an if test and
this is really just a simple if then
we're going to say if and then pull up
math and say greater than or equal to
well what's greater than or equal to
well if our calibration text which would
be under my blocks calibration and the
calibration text so the value of our
calibration if that is greater than or
equal to the value of accel x which is
actually the accelerometer then what
we'll do is set our other label what did
we set that one as I don't think we
change the name of it lean X now we've
named it label1 what was I thinking
we'll call that lean label okay I have
absolutely no consistency in my
variables here so it will set our lean
label text oops no don't want that drag
it to the trash we will set our lean
level text to and then just click
anywhere on the screen and you get this
where we can do definitions text lists
all sorts of math what I want is just
basic text and drag that in here it says
text let's remove that and say left all
right I will do one more I probably
could have done this with a else but
I'll just grab one more if and I'm
basically going to do the same thing
here except less than or equal to and
again calibration text and the
accelerometer value there and then we're
just going to set what are lean label is
two and then give it some text that says
right
and this is the most beautiful part
about this is there's no compiling there
is no debugging there's no warnings it
either works or a dozen and we see it
instantly on our phone so I've gone over
here and let's calibrate it to something
let's say all right we'll set it to like
almost one alright so we've calibrated
to a one-point oh okay so anything
greater then like a one-way hit the bug
it says right oh you know what hang up I
am a noob right left I know my left from
my right I'm serious I really do we're
gonna go with that so I come back over
here let's calibrate it again alright so
Oh point nine five so if it's greater
than 0 point 95 I hit debug knows we're
on the left if I were to do like 0 point
6 and hit debug it knows that we're on
the right so I can do something crazy
like boom for all right and then I
really have to get over there to get a
left otherwise even just standing up
straight thinks it's right okay very
very basic very simple obviously I have
a lot to do with this but just having a
little bit of fun with the
accelerometers and getting into just
basic control stuff like you know Wiles
and if else's and stuff like that you
can see that it's kind of powerful and
really addictive fun to be in here and
just dragging and dropping stuff and
seeing instantly on your phone how it's
working out so if you guys have a ideas
of ways to make this program better or
programs you'd like to do in the future
stuff like that hit me up feedback at
hak5 org and then coming up next week
we've got all sorts of other good fun
linux stuff but anyway with the rest of
the show with Jason and Shannon coming
up I'm just going to go ahead and do it
up proper and let's just toss it over to

chips and tech talk if it's not tech
it's not on dice last week we covered
you know the basics of building a boxee
box what kind of hardware to look for
what's your software options and you
know this week I'm really gonna get deep
into basic boxy app development and you
know there's a couple different options
you can go like I said you know the
basic that we're going to cover and then
there's a couple more advanced api's
believe there's a python api and some
other scripting language api's but for
this is this week you're going to need a
basic text editor so you know notepad
plus plus is a really good you know
basic text editor as well as an RSS feed
RSS feed that you want to interpret into
a boxy app all box yaps are based around
you know RSS feeds you know they've got
the descriptor and then the content
that's really what we're looking for
here and the last thing you're going to
need is a video and it excuse me a photo
editor so you know Photoshop GIMP
whatever you'd like and you know let's
let's get into it let's look at the code
the first thing in designing a boxy app
is to go ahead and take a look at you
know exactly what you want to look like
so we go ahead and i open photoshop you
can open any other photo edit until we
like and i just went ahead and I drop
the hak5 logo in through a nice
background back there you know nice
light grey and then I used this box here
for the list of episodes and I was
figuring this box could be for the
description of those APIs
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
XML for description describing the boxee
app what you're looking at here is
straight XML it's the boxy descriptor
dot XML it basically lays out exactly
what this application is the name of it
who made it its description the current
version number and things like that the
important thing you need to note here
are the ID which is hak5 for this case
that's actually the folder that contains
all the information for this boxy app
and test app test app is true allows you
to locate you know if your hard drive as
opposed to a repository once you have
your descriptor layout you have the next
important thing which is your folder
structure as you can see here the ID is
hak5 so the folders hak5 under the bak
bak see user data apps you have the hak5
folder the next thing you need to create
is a skins folder then boxy skin ng and
then the 720p folder and the media
folder the media folder is for the media
or the images that are going to later on
be used in the boxee app and the 720p
folder is for the main screw language or
the scripting of your boxee app let's go
ahead and take a look at the finished
application and then we can get dive
into the code of the applications let's
go ahead and open up boxing head over to
apps and because the app test app is
turned on and set to true you can go
ahead and start the hak5 app it's going
to go ahead and pull the RSS feed and
you can see here we have the latest hak5
RSS feeds with your option to play so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
code the code for a boxy app is fairly
straightforward you've got up to the top
you get your default controls which
we'll get into it a little bit later
which is set to a default value of 100
right now which is just the list control
so it's the just the default way to list
out your items but let's go ahead and
take a look at the background background
set up pretty simply under control the
type so you can group your controls
together so it's of type group control
type image is just as tells of oxy that
this control is an image starting x and
y which is 0 0 which is the top
left-hand corner
of your screen and then the texture to
use which is going to be back round up
PNG which is stored right here in the
medias folder then next we have the next
control we have is the list view the
actual view or the damage you want to go
behind your list of for the RSS feeds
which I just named list dot PNG again
with your x and y and then I did the
same for the description let's go ahead
and a Cal issed of the RSS feeds that
are going to be displayed inside the box
the app that you saw on the right so I
set the ID here for this control to 100
the default control so it automatically
gives the default that focus is set
right here at 100 again I went ahead and
set the same point X point and why point
as the actual list itself just so you
just so overlay directly on top of that
image I went ahead and set the height
with correspond with the image the image
information of the actual size of for
the background the orientation there are
two ways to do this orientation vertical
or horizontal that's just the way they
scroll then you got to get in here to
the item layout this will defines the
actual size of one item in particular
the height and width here is set here
the controls just define exactly for
that item so the text is an align left
right center and then you have the
ability to shove the text so I push the
text center of that field this here is
kind of important for every every time
boxing loads a nap it goes ahead and
parses the RSS feed into the list item
the list item has its several different
properties labels the actual name of the
individual item in the RSS feed anyway
going down we have the focused layout in
the focus layout it describes what
happens when the item is focused all
this code is available in the show notes
for you to look over and if you have any
questions email me Jason and hak5 org
but back to the actual important part
here of may xml in here you have the
content this here specifies what RSS
feed you
use you have another control group here
that is controlled of the that is in
control the description there's three
controls in this individual control I
did a label to label the episode on top
the thumbnail and the description itself
again all pulling from the list item
which has gotten from the contain from
the container of the selected item set
of here again the ID 100 so there you
have it your first hello world boxy app
done pretty simply with just some XML
and some photo editing you know next
week we're gonna get a little bit more
in depth with some Python scripting boxy
apps to give your boxee apps a little
bit mirror mmm so if you have any
questions email me Jason at hak5 or
following me on twitter at jason aflam
or if you have any questions about
anything else you saw today show hit up
feedback at hak5 org domain on what
sorry Kagan are you registering domain
names in the shell again of course great
ideas
we get only great ideas machines
multi-tasking you just about anything in
the shower don't forget the weaksauce
domains get da poet sugar i miss the
shizzle dude great idea and great domain
what oh please this is long i love you
right that's right doc Oh domains are
now live the biggest domain sense calm
and you can get them now over at
domain.com and while you're there check
out their virtual private servers they
provide unrestricted root access on
Windows or Linux they're easy to manage
with cpanel in plesk and they're capable
of hosting just about any size website
you may have even heard our very own
hak5 org is pimped out on a domain com
VPS no matter where you are you're next
idea remember domain com is the place to
save fifteen percent off at checkout
with coupon code hak5 got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
com a few weeks ago I have reviewed
Windows Live SkyDrive and I didn't
really like it because it was had a
complicated user interface and it took a
while to actually get online to all of
your online storage but later noir one
of our viewers send in this really
simple solution called SD explorer SD
explorer makes life a little bit more
efficient it's great if you're tired of
Microsoft's online interface for
SkyDrive and if you want to access your
files really quickly the base version is
free and then there's also a pro version
which is about 13 bucks for a lifetime
license the ability to quickly edit
files is great it's easy you don't need
to learn any kind of online interface
you don't even can't have to know how to
use the online sky dress it's
cross-platform you can use it with all
sorts of different windows OSS and is
secure because it uses https protocol to
download go to the free download page
scroll down to your desired version i'm
just going to go with the basic one for
now
let the exe download and then click it
when it's time click Next acept next and
make sure to choose automatically update
and then finish there's a readme that's
going to pop up it's going to tell you
of us epic use as well as some
instructions and what you can do with
your version of SV explorer just close
that and your Start menu SD explorer can
be found in their applications or under
my computer double-click on the excess
the Explorer icon when you create a new
folder as the Explorers going to prompt
you to log in with your windows live
account credentials once logged in
you're going to have access to any files
on the Windows Live SkyDrive that you
already own as well as being able to
create new folders if you try to double
click on a file it's not going to open
its going to ask you to upgrade hey not
cool you can get past this by copying
files to your desktop and then viewing
them with the base version you can also
rename files and delete them so I'm
going to go ahead and down with the pro
version and start with the I think it's
like a three day trial I can now change
the security of each folder by
right-clicking on it as well as be able
to choose to map the network drive if i
decide to map the drive SD explorer will
prompt me to choose a drive letter so
I'm going to choose X i click OK and
then wait for the process to finish and
it takes a little bit for that to finish
because when you map a drive it's going
to take a little bit longer anyway I can
also now open files directly from stripe
SkyDrive like so yay I can also put
images in my SkyDrive that are larger
than 50 megs and I can browse other
public accounts that my friends have
created by clicking change the browsing
mode and choosing to either add a new
SkyDrive account and type in the link or
I can select one that I've already
browse before once you're all done you
can sign out so SD Explorer yes makes
life a lot easier although the free
version has its limits like you can't go
over 50 megs of files it still gives you
25 gigabytes of free storage and that's
not bad for my huge collection of
digital files although for 13 bucks I'd
say
go ahead and go with the pro version
because it does give you a lot more
options to choose from what are you what
are your ideas do you like this program
or do you something else email me at
