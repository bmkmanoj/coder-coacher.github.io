break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I am controlling
processes now last week we discussed
processes what they are how to view on
all that good stuff
now let's control those first off let's
open the program called G edit which I'm
sure you're familiar with G edit and
this will open up a nice big window for
me and I'm gonna go ahead and minimize
this just a little bit so we can go back
over here alright now you'll notice when
you do this it's a little text editing
program nothing special about it you'll
notice in your shell prompt that the
actual prompt the Shannon at Shannon
Ubuntu PC it doesn't reappear and it's
not going to unless the program is
closed to do so you can just press
control C to interrupt the program aka
terminate it so I hit control C and it
terminates it very cool now this works
with most command line programs but not
every single one now let's run G edit
again with an ampersand at the end this
says that we started a job so I'll put G
edit ampersand so it gives me the job
number one and it also gives me the Pitt
ID of four nine one three now keep this
in mind running PS is also going to show
you the process as well you'll also
notice that the shell prompt came Eric
so PS four nine one three and there is G
edit right there very cool now after you
run PS if you want to type jobs this is
always also going to show you the number
that GS G edit is running so for example
jobs
it shows me that this is job number one
it's currently running and the command
was actually called G edit and for Sam
there you go now to return the process
to the foreground from the terminal you
can type jobs to find the number and
then you can type FG percentage one
so for example FG percentage 1 and it
brings G edit back and to terminate this
again you can also hit ctrl C and you'll
see the prompt comes back now you can
also type ctrl Z to completely stop a
process so if G edit is running well
time G edit again you can hit ctrl Z
back in your prompt to completely stop G
edit from running and you can also pause
it with the same command you can restore
the program with FG or you can move it
into the background with BG now for
example this would be BG and then you
put your percentage one and you can see
G edit ampersand appears right there
very nice now the number is of course
optional if you only have one job
running at the time opening a graphical
program may be essential if you're
working in the GUI and your program
doesn't work it doesn't open or it's not
listed in the windows managers menu now
you do you want to completely kill the
process and I'll clear the screen again
first off type your example G edit
ampersand and this gives you a new pit
of four nine three five and to kill it
you want to type kill four nine three
five it kills it and it brings you back
to your regular prompt now this is going
to completely terminate the process kill
sends a signal to the process to
terminate it when the terminal sees
these keystrokes it can send a signal to
the process to do something kill can
have specified signals attached to it
such as hub or a cheapy for hang-up
which is kind of old-school for
computers that were online back in the
days like the 90s with phone lines int
for interrupt which is same as control c
turn t erm for terminate stop for
stopping the process without terminating
cont for continuing after stopping just
to name a few of the ones that you can
do you can also do things such as typing
kill tack one
and then your number the pid' or nine
three five and this is going to do the
same thing as hanging up
you can type in kill tech int and then
the pin to interrupt it or kill tech l
for a complete listing of all the
signals that you can send so I want to
see what that is Tech L so we have a lot
of signals just to name a few just just
a few you know 62 or so yeah not that
many to memorize so last but not least
you can also send a signal to multiple
processes you can type G edit ampersand
just a couple of times so I'll type
ampersand and click up alright let's
make sure we have a couple of these
running you'll see each one has a
different process on it so we have a
whole bunch of different pigs on here
and a bunch of different jobs as well
now if you want to kill them all at the
same time after you type in G edit
ampersand a couple of times for several
instances of the program then you type
kill all G edit to kill all of the G
edit instances so I'll type in kill all
o
with no space G edit and this completely
kills all of the processes very easy to
use
you must have user privileges to send
signals to processes that don't belong
to you so make sure to keep that in mind
now to give you an idea some of the
other common processes that you may use
as a network admin or such take a look
at these commands first off is PS tree
and this gives you a nice little
parent-child relationship grid of all
the different processes so it's
basically a tree vmstat is another one
and this shows you a really nice little
lay down of your system resource usage
that's currently going on X load which
is a system load graphed so if I type
that you get this little thing right
here that starts turning into a graph as
you use your machine and you can also do
T load
oops I guess I should control see that X
load ampersand there we go and T load
and this shows you basically the same
kind of system load graph but inside the
terminal now what do you think
make sure to email me over at tips at
hack 5 org with your thoughts about
these different processes and how you
use them or you can comment below with
what you think and be sure to check out
our sister show hack 5 for more great
stuff just like this don't forget to
check out our new show throughout wire
for Internet privacy and security news
at youtube.com slash tech feed I'll be
there reminding you to trust your tech
no lest are you even paying attention no
yours hanging out making sure it sounds
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
