keyboards can spy on you a government
agency finally gets two-factor
authentication and Android security
notifications are now a thing all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire for August 2nd 2016 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom if you haven't checked
out our patreon yet please do so we have
a lot that we want to do for the show
but we can't do it without your support
patreon.com slash threat wire is the
place to support threat wire and the
link is in the show notes so is it time
to leave LastPass that is what many
people are considering after last week's
announcement of a zero-day vulnerability
failed in the last pass app used on
Firefox browsers Google project zero
security researcher Tavis or Maundy
found the flaw in last passes app that
would allow a complete remote compromise
to a user's account the hacker would
need to get a user to visit a malicious
web site that hosts an exploit for it to
work once the user goes to the site the
exploit would run executed commands
through last passes app that the user
would not see and they would get all of
the things so both or mandy's and
another vulnerability that was fixed
over a year ago required phishing
attacks to work and for somebody to go
to an exploited web site the exploit has
been patched in version 4.1.10 T 1 a of
the app and it only affects Firefox
users LastPass awarded or Maundy a cash
prize for his findings and the
disclosure to the company now if you are
curious if your Firefox browser in the
app have been updated with the patch you
can open Firefox type about : add-ons
into the address bar hit enter and then
click on extensions from there find
LastPass choose more and then look at
the title for the version number if it
says LastPass 3 dot something you're
probably fine if you aren't affected if
it says LastPass version 4 points
something you can click on the Settings
gear icon and then choose check for
updates and this will download any
updates for the app if available now the
biggest concern for a lot of LastPass
users though is the fact that log means
in pending merger is going to happen
with citric
see LogMeIn purchased LastPass earlier
this year and while pricing and the
service mostly stayed the same it is a
little bit questionable what will happen
when citrix actually acquires them what
are your thoughts let me know in the
comments below
earlier this year best steal a security
firm investigating wireless keyboards
and mice discovered that they could
inject keystrokes into keyboards several
hundred yards away now last week well
they kind of announced that they could
read keystrokes to Wired's Andy
Greenberg had a great write-up called
quote radio hack steals keystrokes from
millions of wireless keyboards that
discusses how a twelve dollar gadget can
intercept the connection between any of
eight wireless keyboards and a computer
250 feet away and yes this is different
from Samy Kamkar device now the device
manufacturers used generic alternatives
to Bluetooth like transceiver chips that
save a whole lot of money but they
haven't gone through the rigorous
testing that bluetooth has for security
procedures they are literally sending
keystrokes over-the-air in plain text
assuming that nobody's gonna notice
because it's some random radio device
and nobody's gonna be the wiser yeah it
turns out everybody is wise to this
because they found this flaw so the
brands that are vulnerable to the key
sniffer tool include HP Toshiba
RadioShack Kensington insignia General
Electric anchor and Eagle tech three of
which have released statements regarding
the vulnerability for their users now
you might notice that Logitech's
unifying wireless keyboards are not on
that list
they are encrypted between the keyboard
and the unifying receiver with 128-bit
AES encryption now while I hate using
their proprietary connectors because I
lose them all the time to make wireless
anything work I do have to say props to
Logitech for making it encrypted even if
it is just 128-bit I would love to see
them increase that to 512 or 256 as a
response to an executive order for
federal agencies to better secure their
users the US Social Security
Administration is now using cell phone
SMS messages as two-factor
authentication for users that log into
ssa.gov this requirement will be
necessary along with a username and a
password but it does not make
any harder for a new user to create an
account the security protocols to
validate your identity when creating an
account are still the exact same now
since it's pretty cheap for a hacker to
buy your data it's like three or four
dollars and use it to sign up on ssa.gov
it is still very recommended to freeze
your credit report block your SSN from
being accessible online or to just sign
up on the site so that nobody else can
beat you to it because you can only have
one SSN on her account on that website
no more than one account can use the
same exact estimate SSN but what this
announcement also comes a message from
the US National Institute of Standards
and Technology or NIST for short they
quote due to the risk that SMS messages
may be intercepted or redirected
implementers of new systems should
carefully consider alternative
authenticators yes so NIST is basically
recommending not using SMS because yes
it can be hacked and they want you to
use something else instead
like biometrics to authenticate with
two-factor authentication Google just
announced a new Android feature allowing
you to receive a security update
directly to your phone as a notification
instead of just receiving an email the
app is dismissible just like any others
so if you expect to be notified that you
added a new device to your account you
can just remove the notification swipe
left or right Google found that a user
is four times likelier to check a
security notification via a pop-up on
their phone as opposed to an email
that's huge
so now you will know automatically and
very quickly on your smartphone if
somebody else is trying to log into your
account on a different device that's
pretty cool Google thank you
