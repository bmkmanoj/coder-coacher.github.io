5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus in IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I'm checking out
crypt cat so what exactly is crypt cat
other than really adorable it is another
command-line tool that is built on top
of net cat and it works almost exactly
the same way we have discussed the fact
that net cat usage is basically
transmitted in plaintext meaning that
there is no encryption and anyone can
see what you are doing across computers
yay fun so don't send passwords via net
cat so krippcat gives you a version of
that cat using two-fish encryption I was
able to download it on my Linux Mint
machine by simply typing into the
terminal sudo apt-get install crypt cat
yay so now you can type in krippcat tak
eh just like you would do with net cat
and seat a cage and you can see all the
different commands that you can use with
this all the different options basically
it all uses the same commands so here's
an example for you that me and Darren
put together earlier so on my computer
I'm going to type this in let me scroll
down to the bottom crypt cat tak okay
and then my password hey Darren we're
gonna make our password bunnies okay all
right don't tell the Internet I won't
tell the internet it's bunnies and then
we're going to type in Darren's IP
address 10.7 331 1 2 4 and then 1 3 3 7
and that is of course the port so first
off krippcat opens krippcat tak Kade
does enable the password for or the
symmetric key which means that both of
us are going to need to know that key
for this to actually work and then the
next word is my password which in this
case Darren it's bunnies don't tell here
and then the IP address of the other
computer which is Darren's computer the
last bit of course is my port so on
Darren's computer Darren this is what
you're going to type in your
type encrypt cat tack k-space bunnies
don't tell the internet space tack el
space tack P space 1 337 got it all
right now crypt cat again opens krippcat
Tech a dozen Abel the password again and
then again
Darren puts our share puts in our shared
password the well I'm not going to tell
you what it is and then Tech L Tech p133
7 means we're listening on port 1 3 3 7
so now we can chat supposedly so let's
go ahead and try this out so I'm going
to send him a message I'm just going to
say yo what up G and then he can send me
a message back whatever he chooses it
might be and I should receive it down at
the bottom of my terminal here my
password is kitten Sparkle rainbow pants
that's the cutest password ever cool so
it seems like it works but how do you
know that it's encrypted well after the
break I will show you a quick way to
determine if krippcat really is
encrypting all of those messages and
Darren's passwords the hex shop is hack
5s premier store for all of your pen
testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive but it quacks
like a duck or a keyboard it can type
scripts into a computer ridiculously
fast like this week's pick from loud G
in the forums it'll change the desktop
wallpaper on your buddy's Mac to
basically anything you want so haha
finally I have something that I can
prank Paul with yes perfect I love it
and of course we couldn't do this show
without your support so we'd like to
thank you with something special use the
coupon code snubz with any order for
your very own hack tip sticker thanks
again for supporting the show
and now we're back with the fun part
so crip Chet says that it is encrypted
crypt cat I'm going to open Wireshark
with GK pseudo Wireshark and person to
make sure so I'm going to choose eth0
since I'm using Ethernet here for my
land and then type in and this it looks
pretty easy so this is Wireshark so up
at the top I'm going to type in tcp
period port space equal equal space one
three three seven and then when I hit
apply I start getting all sorts of
packets and of course if you haven't
used Wireshark before feel free to check
out my earlier hack tip on Wireshark 101
from like two years ago it's really good
and very informative
so I have a whole bunch of packets going
on down here you'll notice a bunch of
packets getting transmitted between
Darin and me but all of them are
supposedly encrypted so I can see myself
right here it's ten dot 73 31 107 and
Darin 1070 331 124 now down here is the
actual packet so if this was clear text
I could see exactly what he was typing
out to me so let's check our terminal
and see what he is writing are they
encrypted packets all right cool oh my
god oh my god alright so let's see if
any of those show up we see that a whole
bunch just came through
so if I click down each and every one of
these is still encrypted I can't see
exactly what he's typing out to me huh
okay so it seems to be encrypted now
let's try doing the same thing with
netcat so in this chan perchance I'll be
the listener this time and I will open
this up with a very simple terminal
command this time it's going to be NC
Tech L Tech p133 seven
so that means I'm opening netcat
listening on port 1 3 3 7 on Darren's
machine he's going to type in NC space
my IP address 1070 331 107 space one 337
so the same port so we both hit enter at
the same time
and let's go ahead and start chatting a
little bit so he'll send me some chats
I'll send him some who dared yo what up
G this is my password spurkel fiche oh
ok I won't tell anyone all right
cool so now we have a whole bunch new
packets to go through and look at that
we can already see them so this time
using netcat we're able to see exactly
what the packets are bringing in you'll
notice that all these chats are not
encrypted you can see everything that
he's saying hey Darin yo what up G my
password is kitten Sparkle rainbow pants
don't tell anyone my password is
sparkle-face Shh it's a secret plaintext
sucks I agree this is so cool I was
really interested to find kripp chat and
check it out a little bit it's a very
very easy to program to use once you
know how to use that cat so I want to
know do you use crypt cat send me a
comment below or you can email us at
tips at hack 5 org and make sure that
I'm not saying crypt chat the entire
episode so be sure to check out our
sister show as well hack 5 for more
great stuff just like this and I will be
there reminding you to trust your techno
