fog all this nasty
hey everybody welcome this episode of
hak5 I'm Matt less doc I'm Darren
kitchen for those of you who haven't
seen the show before basically we are

wonder you want to go channel 4 because
this is an awesome wallpaper here we got
hak5 spread the virus trust your techno
list now i'm not sure what the yeah i'm
not sure hak5 is a virus but it's kind
of cool cos very topical we're actually
talking about viruses today with Chris
Chris curling from Virginia Beach yeah
we're gonna have a vm that's all loaded
up with some viruses and stuff we're
gonna kind of show you what that looks
like when you look at it with you know
your process explores and stuff like
that you have a zoo of viruses i do what
did i hope it was good come on Tasha
symposium org success pool it was a
cesspool that viruses before we get on
we want to thank advan spirit for the
wallpaper if you guys want to send them
wallpaper submitted at the feedback at
hak5 org hit the forums or the wiki and
now on to Shannon who's going to show us
some great photo utility yeah i'll be
talking about Photosynth i put together
about 190 photos for you guys put them
all together on photosynthetic sweet yes
so forth episode in to the first first
fourth new season finally got lighting
right to that's beautiful we hope we're
working out all the kinks here i mean
we're going we're trying to go HD
hopeful
it's going to happen by the time you see
this not too much longer if we're
actually taping this before even the
first episode is aired so if you're like
you know I've been boosting the forms
you haven't mentioned anything about
this thing I said well sorry we haven't
seen it yet we're in last we're catching
future we're catching up after the two
episodes that we did in a single week
you said Syme traveling its tongue yeah
we you know portal action but we also so
Darren said we wanted to go HD we could
really use your help head on over to
hack five dot org slash stickers order
some stickers and we've also got some
great schwag that we're working on for
you guys we got cons a new stickers that
by now we should have some details about
the ultimate wag bag elman but we don't
know cuz that's in the future and we're
like three weeks behind at this point
right we don't know we'll catch up soon
exactly all right well I'm gonna go
catch up with Chris and see what's going
on with viruses I ride all right well
you know she's gonna mosey over here hi
dazzling camera number three welcome to
the set sorry we're gonna have to get a
bigger set Sansa yeah we're gonna for
right now I'd say we just demo the wall
take down the living room yes we shoot
this in our house yeah yeah actually we
should put Paul right up there with a
booty with a lighted yeah well he's away
oh the guy with no preview monitors
right now he's trying to do the show and
have no idea what's going on it's got a
program he doesn't have a preview for
you have that fixed very soon yeah yeah
totally ordered part uh so you you did
the thing that you're not supposed to do
yeah you're not supposed to double click
on ya know when we said that yeah if you
want to send us a wallpaper just email
to feedback a hack five dot org we're
gonna be testing those in a sandbox we
don't just open every jpg happy you went
to all the fun jpg sides it well
actually I you clicked on the
executables to get the sort of in a way
what I did was I found this site called
Merrill malware database net which is a
paired with offensive computing dotnet I
think that's will have it in the lower
thirds over here and they have a
humongous insight it's like almost
500,000 submitted pieces of malware
whether I mean everything from my doomed
is Oh Tom you know everything would be
okay but I think that's in there to NIM
de so I went through and I selected a
bunch of them and I downloaded the
mountain
vm and of course right now i'm running
windows 98 first edition no it's
actually XP without any patches service
pack what to but without any patches I
didn't feel like you know yeah that's
fine so and I have the guest isolation
off and everything you know it's not
connected internet right now obviously
if I had something that could escape a
vm I'd be coming yeah you probably
didn't need to go through all this
trouble now go to the virus the
malicious website you could have just
put up a windows 98 box up on the
internet and let things do its natural
course that would've been fun alright so
you've got it all by ride up what I
actually go right now please i restored
this vm to a state because i'm actually
gonna do it you know watch what happens
ok so here's your your brain yep here's
what windows looks like in a process
explorer before you do anything to it
this is a straight up you can see I'm in
vmware because I've got the user train
everything but so this is what windows
kind of looks like before you start
infect me and you can actually zoom in
ya this is just you got your regular you
know ssv see not a whole lot of
processes no and that's that's a trim
you know fresh install it always feel
good at pulling so yeah cool yep so and
then there's a process monitor which
I've slimmed-down actually may get rid
of zoom it cuz we don't need that we
were just using it yeah anyway well
that's doing that we're I have the Event
Viewer up as well so we can check that
out so that gives us so this is the
Windows Event Viewer who right click on
my computer manage their discs exactly
and these two tools are from
sysinternals process explorer and
process monitor sysinternals was then
merged into microsoft effort yeah yeah
I'm Steve rough it's mark yes mortgage
yes sir thank you and he now works for
Microsoft in those eggs or so what i'm
doing here is i'm excluding all these
processes that are part of Windows that
I don't really want to see right now
because once we actually I'm gonna
double-click them right in a second here
we're gonna uh yeah yeah okay so how
many so what processes do we have going
at this point we're right right now like
nothing right yeah right now I excluded
all these those are what norm you know
we have on right now I'm gonna go in and
I have uh let's see let's start with my
doom alright my doom is a fun one we're
gonna right click and buy that look so
kind of this sorry I can you can we zoom
in here on the second like this it
doesn't look like a way it looks like a
notepad dog it does it does look like a
little dot exe there
or I could hide there but yeah my work
where's the fun you could always make it
my doom dot txt exe exactly and it would
tide that part so anyway so this machine
this is what you're not supposed to do
alright so go ahead and open that sure
why not oh look what look all this stuff
is happening all right I'm gonna oh yeah
let it let it let it unblock it yeah
wait this is on this on our network it's
not our completely disabled you know you
let a guest into the studio next thing
you know everybody's got my doom so no
no I wouldn't do that to you guys so
we've it's just starting to do its thing
we can actually look and say okay
properties on one of these so with
process monitor the sysinternals tool
yet we can going and see exactly where
that's happening in real time we have a
date stamp we have a time stamp and we
can see the different processes that are
happening the path to those and and the
result of what's actually going on and
these are all the modules I can't make
this any pair i can zoom in right here
yeah so these are some of the processes
and dll's that it use in order to you
know hook itself into the temporary
internet files indexed at user in fact
back so that's just any other machine I
just know yet is called me but it just
called the calm CTL 32 dll ms winsock
wonder what its gonna do with wins I
know you're trying to get internets
probably and then you can look at the
whole stack and you can see everything
that it used and about i'm actually a
better example if i scroll up a little
bit go into when it was first launching
we actually can expand this out and
it'll go into here's one right here this
is actually a registry oh come on we can
see the registry myself when the
software in explorer and i wanted to
feature control it did something with
feature control not really sure quite
yet i mean you can look at the stack i
say so now okay so you took a snapshot
in your vm before we infected it you've
got had you've infected it oh i canna
sell even more to do it i've got all
kinds know we got so Tom to hear it
gives me this error but to trust me it
worked ok here we'll go all the way down
the bottom here and so now is there a
way to compare these to compare the
before it was owned and after ozone and
see what the
she settings that were done that that
changed and this program will download
install what what's going on it's uh
it's it pretends to be an antivirus
software for vista yeah i love though i
just heard about that one I think it's
fairly new and we have a see we had a
little bit of that fishing stuff you're
like I a download there's another one
holy clean up your uh your net
connection make it ten times faster that
one double click and it just kind of you
know did disappeared its own things so
so we've got about a bunch of viruses
and things running right now we could
seize Oh Tom no pair which is you know
behind that so it's it's so is are you
starting at somebody am i doing is
trying to make itself look like notepad
exactly okay so if you were like just a
an owned user little clue but list
newbie and you didn't know like like my
machines running slow and you hope you
pull up your standard control panel to
see what processes you've got girls on
your ok forget it we can we can what we
can try I know what it looks like I
again now it's wow it's filling task
manager well if you could pull up task
manager there we go oh it's gone that's
funny so this is this is just some of
the stuff that you can see right but if
you pulled that up you would probably
think you know if you could get you your
your task managers targets with the
fellas that was my manager up Oh Batman
if you could get your process manager
your task manager up there and go to
your processes tab like what's it hosing
my system if you know good day city and
you could see no pata and you're like oh
of course without drawing that maybe
that no pets not running but using the
system terminal tools process explorer
Mo's the other one process monitor
process monitor you can actually see
what's happening in real time and with
process explorer can you can you kill
these I mean can you inject yourself
with this stuff I so i can right click
on this and I can kill kill process tree
okay which will kill everything
associated with that so top and I can
also do it to my doom f kill everything
no these aren't really gone I mean
they're in your system they might you
might kill them for now in fact I can
pry bring up the task manager oops that
control shift escape control shift
escape there we go great so now it's up
and a sting and it's staying up it's not
disappearing immediately can look
through here we can see okay but the
system still host if you reboot it it's
all coming back now of course there are
like some
some antivirus companies like I know
semantics in particular releases single
executables for removing things when you
know when things are really crazy yep
like around the time of NIMH de and code
red stuff like that they'll just release
a removal tool exactly no X a single
executable room oh great yeah just run
another executable why not I don't run
every executable so yeah so that's
basically that's basically it I can
restore this back to my snapshot yeah
before the infection and and we don'twe
don't advise testing this out on your
production machine a vm the best way to
do it kool Kris as always really
interesting seeing the the virus zoo
there sounds like it's a process
explorer and what was the other one
again press this monitor processes
journals there's a lot of other ones you
can use those are you know i love i love
their tools i love process monitor
because you just get to see what's like
what's it what's actually happening
because the built-in tools just don't
actually tell you what's really going on
yep very cool so yeah you can find this
i'm going to have a write-up in my chris
growing calm and we're probably talked
about this on secure bit too so tune in
yeah and check out what you guys have to
think about all the crazy virus is going
on okay so speaking of viruses i don't
think he has anything to do with it
we're gonna head over to Shannon who's
gonna tell us all about the trivia this
month to do with viruses alright this
week's trivia is the first finger
pressure multi-touch display was
developed but in 1982 by what university
and here's a little hint for you you
know a pure ownage think about pure
ownage universities hmm if you're the
first one to answer this correctly in
our forum thread will send you a PM with
for your address and your name and will
send you some nice little hak5 schwag
maybe some brand new stickers we shall
see our sponsor for trivia is godaddy
make an impact on line with godaddy with
comms as low as a dollar 99 with
world-class hosting fast and easy
website builders and much much more plus
if you enter code hack 530 that's hak5
30 you can save five dollars on any
order of 30
some restrictions applies to see the
website for details and get your piece
of the internet at godaddy.com and I
hear that darren has something about
multi-touch he wants to talk about but
first we're gonna head to a break oh
yeah i forgot that again
scratch-and-sniff packet stickers for
packet sniffers take a whiff it's just
like crack available in batch or packs
of your favorite protocol stacks so
stick them on your Mac scratch and sniff
packets stickers info some restrictions
apply ICMP not available in California
source ratted orders need not apply
so dare is here to show us some
multi-touch goodness dude multi-touch
it's all the rage you've seen on the
iPhone the nexts the the wall is it the
microsoft thing surface the surface the
biggest table the future's here in this
big s table and you can build your own
do cept arses miniature well okay you
can build you a miniature big-ass table
and then maybe if you want to take it a
step further you can throw a projector
into the ceiling and really take this
thing and run but we're going to show
you how with a cardboard box and some
paper a webcam maybe a photo frame you
can build your own multi-touch mini I
got to say that this segment was
submitted by a good friend over from the
IRC Falcon so awesome pic Falcon thanks
for sending that to us this was
originally found on a blog post over a s
Sandler that WordPress and we're gonna
have links to show notes all this stuff
but basically this blog is all about
this thing called the multi-touch mini
which is making a touch multi-finger
touch screen just like you like a
minority report all that stuff out of
simple stuff you can just plan around
the house like webcam inbox and I guess
if you can check out what we got going
here this is the configuration utility
and you can see what it soon if I go
through each individual layer of this is
this is what the camera sees this is
just a webcam inside a box pointed up at
a white piece of paper on a photo frame
I got it all taped up enclosed here so
that you can that it doesn't let light
in and and it looks really I mean okay
it's ghetto fabulous but whatever right
we're going to hook this up and make it
a Windows mouse and we're going to do
some other fun demos with it so the
first step is is just go over to that
blog and have links in the show notes
just download the multi-touch mini
package check the first thing you want
to do is configure it so the committing
like all these batch files these single
executable is really simple run the
configuration batch and you'll get all
these windows and what you need to
basically do is calibrate this guy to
the lighting in your room of course the
lighting in here is a little weird so it
was a little difficult to get it fully
calibrated here but you can see in the
different steps here what it does first
is is it captures just this is the raw
image coming off the camera and then
each subsequent
one is inverts the image and then you
can see next it does a little monochrome
filter on things and it blurs things a
little and it gets it to a point where
what we end up it with is this right
here and that's actually Matt's finger
moving around there and you can see what
it was before you can see a little bit
of shadow there and we cleaned it up
into the point where there's a software
that can see those and add extra fingers
in there and goes oh my gosh i can see
multiple points and then i can track
those so it's really cool once you you
just run the configuration set all of
those and then just hit escape saves
your configuration and now we can do
some fun demos with it let's do it
alright so first demo I want to show you
guys real simple you set up there's
these two batch files first one is
server you run that I'm going to run
this my webcam at 64 to 480 let that run
all right and we get my touch listener
I'm going to go ahead and minimize these
that's the server okay we also need a
gateway and this is a java application
that is going to allow our other demo
applications to listen to it runs a
local server on port 3000 and 3333 go
ahead and start that and minimize it and
now they can communicate with our demos
so in the demos folder that comes with
the the multi-touch mini package is a
couple of cool flash demos and some c++
demos so the flash demo my favorite one
well they're all my favorite really
everybody's seen the photo thing I mean
we can just take and it's going to take
a minute to load up because I'm running
this on the acer aspire one it's an atom
processor 1.6 gigahertz so it likes
flash a little it's just it's the photos
at king with it but just like any other
you know multi-touch demo of course
you've got to do the scrapbook moving
stuff around zooming things and it works
as intuitively as you would expect you
put your fingers in the center of a
photo you stretch them out to make it
bigger you rotate them to rotate the
photo so that's kind of boring let's
let's take it a step further there's
another demoing here that really rocks
the physics demos kind of
so check this out we've got all these
little guys oh my god you're killing
your machine yeah my machine is dying
here and basically when your machine's
not dying what you should be able to do
here is put your fingers over it okay
that's reasonable guys no I think I'm
gonna think my atom machine i think but
little should've gone back to the EP
well no the epc would have really died
so maybe that's not the demo on a show
this one's kind of neat wall pong full
screen that here and what we've got
going go on your side of the screen is
if you put two fingers here you can pull
up you make little paddles with your
finger and then actually play some pong
and it's kind of intuitive this is
really something that should be running
on a core two machine not until Adam it
was destroying your core two yeah it was
destroying my core two if you look my
processor who are it's just spanked in
it but I think I can show you guys the
piano without problems this is called
multi key this is probably the neatest
one because it's actually an instrument
and if you just go ahead and you can see
what we're doing here I mean I'm not
going to win any awards for music making
here but you can you can drag the the
pianos around you can rotate them to
what looks best for you and then when
you've got everything all situated like
you want you can start making some
beautiful music like like this ah okay
well anyway did the hitch get the idea
igers awesome you want to run this on a
desktop we've already said that before
yeah but also there are mouse drivers
and a whole bunch of other phone
applications and and basically all these
are fun demos at this point but one of
the cool ones is there's a mouse driver
for windows so you can use this to
actually control your desktop so of
course the next thing that comes to mind
is great well then I just stick a
projector on the ceiling point it down
at a gigantic version of this and with a
high quality camera I can actually get
some some some finger tracking and then
it makes sense so because right now it's
kind of like a Wacom touchpad next to a
computer running Photoshop where you're
not drawing on the screen but you've got
a little pad neck so the same kind of
principle and I think we should build
the giant you know the big ass table
we've got a bunch of mods that we're
actually going to do which are going to
require a lot of ingenuity and a lot of
time to do so we've got those that were
working on one of them being the
multi-touch and another one that we've
got a surprise for you coming up but
we'll tell you about that a little later
the one has to do with Godzilla uh yes
okay sweet all right so now that dare
now is awesome I can't wait to start
building our own so we can have it here
and show it off whenever we want but
right now we're gonna go ahead and kick
it's Shannon she's gonna tell us about
this week's LAN party okay Godzilla
really yeah whatever anyway I know after
we're done filming I'm going to go over
there and play some pong and probably
own up Darren and Matt yeah not until we
get a core two over here that's for sure
definitely not happen okay I'll believe
you guys alright our land party is
coming up really soon it's on Saturday
October fourth and we are playing some
tf2 some team fortress 2 for you guys I
don't know about you but my favorite
character is the scout gonna run around
and beat some bitches baseball bat
anyway it's a game hak5 org and if
you're not really into the whole gaming
thing you just want to sit back and
relax with some popcorn and watch us
film you can go to hack 5 org and we'll
have the set cam set up all day and last
but not least I have to tell you about
Crysis warhead I don't know much about
it myself so I'm going to shoot this
over to Matt yeah they're sponsoring
this land party totally stoked about it
because I played through the first part
of crisis when I built my new rig yep
and it runs beautifully now and you were
telling me that this would probably run
beautifully on my old rig regardless
yeah Crysis warhead comes out actually
has come out the game is faster bigger
stronger runs along a parallel timeline
of the original crisis you're the other
badass on the island no longer is a game
about survival it's a game about
complete domination Darren played
through it I played through it I already
have as of shooting right now I will
have had my copy and played it but I
highly encourage you guys to go check
out Crysis warhead it's a great great
game and if you like the original crisis
you'll definitely love this one so right
now we're going to go ahead on over
Christine where she's going to talk to
us about different browsers all right
thanks Matt I'm sure you guys are all
very familiar with google chrome at this
point considering that we're in the
future now and it's been out for a
couple weeks but one feature that I want
to familiarize you with is the google
about memory now here to demonstrate I
have a couple browsers open i have
firefox here with hak5 website up
facebook revision3 and purple com which
is definitely one of my favorites I have
the same websites open up in internet
explorer and opera as well as Google
Chrome now see I have the websites up
and open up a new tab and type abouts
colon memory and here you can see all
the browsers that I have pulled up
chrome IE firefox and opera it shows all
the memory that's allocated to those and
down here it also shows the memory
that's allocated to each individual tab
that I have pulled up in my google
chrome so this just kind of gives you
your own task manager if you will about
where memories being located allocated
so i'm gonna head it back to Shannon hey
Shannon hey Matt what's up not much so
what do we got today I have Microsoft
Live labs photosynth it's a brand new
creation they just put out actually
it'll be a couple of weeks old by the
time we put this out okay but it's it
basically just stitches all your photos
together of a certain room or a statue
that you might want to show off to your
friends online okay and it turns it into
a 3d walkthrough and I'll start playing
this for you guys in the background
while we talk about it okay so what do
we actually need to get this working all
you need to do is download the
installation it's just called Photosynth
you can get it at photo sent dotnet it's
completely free you let that run and
then you take your camera and take a
whole lot of pictures and trust me when
I say a whole lot i took about 190 for
my Photosynth and it's not even that
cynthy so so what what there's a special
way to actually do it and do they give
you some sort
instruction on how to do yeah they do
they actually have a video on their
website that you can watch and it gives
you an example of how to do different
things a room a statue it shows you
everything that you want to know okay so
you want to take different angles and go
all the way around the room and get all
sorts of different kind of merging
photos you want to get tons and tons of
them overlapping yes many overlapping
photos it is kind of slow though the
first time that you want to upload your
photo sent it takes a long time you're
sitting there waiting for the task bar
going oh come on man yeah I think on my
machine which we actually ran it off my
machine it took about a good 45 to 50
minutes gone through 190 photos and of
course the more photos you have the
longer it's going to take you to get all
of that sin thing up also you can't do
any kind of weird angle so you don't
want to do a very low angle and then do
another one very high or else photosynth
is gonna get really weirded out and have
no clue where to go from there's a
couple in here that it's just kind of
