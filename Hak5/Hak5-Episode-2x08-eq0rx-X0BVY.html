down to show us truecrypt burn for OSX
and turn that PC line around into an
awesome new firewall using smooth wall
but up first let's take a look at DD wrt
Oh
we're going to take this episode of hak5
off right jumping straight into the
content and that content right now is DD
wrt and it's the Paul that's talking
about it Paul what the hell'd you do to
my pipes my tubes did it was only for
like five minutes while it updated the
firmware to dd-wrt and what did you
update the firmware on ah this nice
linksys wrt54g because they use open
source code for their normal linksys
firmware they had to by law up release
that so that less little you know hacker
kids it's a little poke around with it
actually improve it way more than what
they were willing to put the effort into
yeah so all under the what came out was
these cool kids came out with dd-wrt
okay dd-wrt and now you said it's a
firmware update for this yep we don't
have to do anything super special nope
it's just like upgrading the firmware
your normal linksys it works essentially
the same so every you so like you said
you just kind of update it like normal
firmware you just go to that part of the
mm-hmm what GUI yeah it update and it
just as a little side note always update
firmware on a network device yeah the
physical connection yeah don't go
wireless terrible that's that's that's
negative okay so since somebody has gone
out of their way to write new firmware
for the wrt54g IE dd-wrt yeah there's
going to be the features that were there
going to be better and there's going to
be more yeah law of averages so what did
you pick out what I found really
interesting about this is the virtual
land of stuff so that way you can kind
of like separate your devices whatever
it be like a media center box and that
kind of stuff so that way it's not like
kind of
or your test development area yeah so
whatever it is you can just completely
separate in the virtual land under the
okay so so that the new firmware is
actually giving you really really good
Network sexy action items options
enterprise kind of level Wow separation
wow that actually speaks a lot with you
talking about enterprise level yeah so I
mean so now we've got the virtual land
the VLAN is off the chain what else do
we have going on for like the kind of
like hacker community development kind
of thing what's cool is they have a WDS
built in mm-hmm that it's a wireless
distribution network right which means
like you can like say you're an
apartment building yeah like few hacker
buddies up and like the upper levels and
lower levels and you can create this
kind of wireless network that uses
multiple aps yeah multiple APA is all
one network it can be like wide open
like everybody in the building can do it
so everybody doesn't need to pay like
the ridiculous rates for whatever
internet they need now I I saw earlier
when you we were poking around in this
before it has overclocking overclocking
yeah it's it's a little a little
gimmicky little hokey yeah I mean you
don't really want to mess with it too
much simply because you run the risk of
like prying the thing right like you're
blown yeah like a like a taking a liquor
into liquid nitrogen seeing right on top
of it okay so but you you can do it yeah
you can do and since we're geeks we do
things because we can yeah okay so what
else is going on like the wrt54g does
have a bit of a firewall built in-house
and it's didi it all right it has a
security tab like usual and you can like
enable the firewall you can put all it
has like additional filters for your
like your ads and your cookies java and
so it's like running a windows network
act
bex ok so it is slightly more developed
but it's nothing like leaps and bounds
yeah it's kind of generic but not so
generic that you can get it on normal
farmer right all right and now the next
coolest thing about it was the port
forwarding under applications in gaming
where it was before yeah and just like
30 firmware right now you're like
perform that's already there but the
problem is we only have like that 10 or
whether yeah I don't think is even 10
things like eight like a top you like
place yeah we could pour more my way up
like that yeah we we blew them all out
yeah and what this you can just like add
as many as you need and just whatever
like wow holes you need to poke into
your father just like I need this going
here i need this going there and like
it's not a problem so yeah so you know
you got that kind of stuff and it's
improved obviously now some extra
features that this really improves upon
i thought was the open VPN client the
openvpn client yep so say like you're in
your apartment building whatever right
and like your buddy crosstown he has
like some sweet like stuff on his
network right there and you're like
normally you'd be over there but like
back at your place he like you know he
has something on there but he has like
you know he has a bpn server up on them
this has a built in VPN clients really
so then you can just VPN your network to
his network yep through the router yep
so that way when you go to his network
you can just pull down all those
machines browse all the shares it's like
a in there just being like especially if
it's like kind of a work situation like
get that late night phone call I'd be
like oh don't get on that Network and
yeah it's just always that right never
left just my boxers yep
so now there's also one more cool thing
that you were telling me about before
and that's our flow they are is this
this thing right here it's a little
German but if you get past the ins it
has like all the same kind of acronyms
so you can kind of work your way through
it but essentially it will give you like
read-a-thon who's using all the
bandwidth or so I know who to yell at
when ya like my normal browsing isn't
going right yeah so you know you can
look at it and be like me goodness me
but so you'll know when to yell at me
because it'll give you like all these
graphs and crazy stuff it's perfect and
it's just built in right into the router
it will forward it to your client and
you'll be like Paul damn you again so
that is freaking awesome now as far as
like the regular wrt54g firmware versus
the dd-wrt it is it really going to be
worth your while to upgrade to the
dd-wrt absolutely simple because the
normal form where lacks these like
little special features that you need
like simply the port forwarding is what
we really wanted it and selects the
powerfulness of like a more advanced a
more advanced kind of router shoshana
solution right as far as being just like
yourself and a few other friends kind of
thing it's perfect right so we're going
to leave it like this yes so the wrt54g
like if it was almost good enough for
your network to upgrade to the dd-wrt it
would meet all your needs perfectly
sweet so as far as more information goes
you know so people can go get
wdw RT and find a little more
information on it where they had well
they can head to our wiki he'll be in
our show notes more the episode or you
can go to DD w d D dash dash wrt wrt com
ok nor but com alright so thank you so
much Paul yep but if you screw with my
pipes again my only five minutes do all
right let's go ok so now it's time for
trivia we know we haven't done it in a
really long time I e two x 0 4 with all
our live shows and everything yeah but
we do have Ali back with us hi say hi to
everybody and you are my girl mm-hmm so
anyway so the 2 x f4 trivia question was
the largest game of tetris played out on
a two hundred and eighty eight foot tall
building in the netherlands was built by
what association in 1995 cyber eats
cyber eagle answered correctly and the
answer was the electrical engineering
student association i want to play 288
feet worth of tetris i'd like to beat
your butt in tetris on a 288 football
keep dreaming keep dreaming so anyway
ladies what's this month's trivia
question this month took you a question
as you're all anxiously waiting to hear
is what is the full name of section ones
resident computer hacker where can they
send their answers to you can send your
answers to trivia and hak5 org there you
have it folks alright so there it is
either pause and answer or continue
watching I prefer the latter anyway so
up next is a segment on truecrypt from
our favorite hackling that love to come
out and do things muaks today we're
joined by a very special guest that I'm
sure all of you are probably familiar
with by now he's a regular in hak5 IRC
the forums
are happy to have you expect from room
362 dot-com thanks for having me yeah
thanks for coming down you're here to
show us some goodies you came down from
Northern Virginia with a bag of tricks
and so let's just dive in the first
thing you might show up is true crap
truecrypt yes it's a on the fly
encryption cool and it's portable so you
know me and portable oh yeah Lee got to
have it so the cool thing about
truecrypt and is that it's an encryption
tool that you can take with you wherever
you go I get on the portability but it
works on both windows and linux so and
it's open source is open source can't go
wrong with open sores ever in its free
hey I love free and it's secure very
secure because this uses like some
industry standard encryption algorithms
right doubled up on each other you
there's Biffy actually one that has
three different encryption tools for the
whole thing so if if you've got some if
you're somebody like us it might have
some secrets you know even if they're
just like tax information and you just
want to keep it secure from those evil
hackers on the interwebs these days this
would be a perfect tool to to start
storing your data and from what I
understand it's really easy to use so do
you want to just dive into the windows
one with the GUI and sure create a a
what is called a partition a volume
let's start by double-clicking truecrypt
real hard huh alright you come up with
this menu now this is where you can set
drive lighters actually mount drives and
everything but so when you create a
truecrypt like you're going to take a
folder or a set of files and say I want
these encrypted so then it will turn
those into a volume or like if you're
familiar with virtual machines how you
have like a folder I'm sorry file that's
actually a virtual hard drive so it's
the same sort of deal it mounts it as as
a file as a drive on your computer kind
of like a networking or something so
we'll go create volume and we can hit
standard or hidden and we'll talk about
hidden later so we're going to go
standard volume right now
and we're just going to make a file
instead of reformatting the device sure
what you can do you can make a USB
device so hey I do so if I didn't want
to make a my virtual hard drive my
encrypted file / drive on my desk like
on my computer somewhere I could
actually like take a USB key right and
format the entire thing so that it's now
its own TrueCrypt volume right again
formatting gonna lose everything that's
on there already so I understood okay so
let's just go ahead and save the file
then alright so we're going to select
file we're going to go to the desktop
and secret stuff and we're going to name
it PST you can have it any any extension
you want and so why PST the reason i
picked PST is because it looks like a
outlook PST folder so less people trying
to open it right and who would have
hidden their secret documents in their
outlook mail file exactly cool and its
own tries to it's a little obscure right
so it's not seriously security but yeah
but this is the security so it is
another onion layer okay so let's go
ahead and save that right and this is
where we get to pick our encryption
algorithm now there's a host of
different options and you really want to
find the best one to suit what you're
going to be doing so yeah we're going to
take a big performance hit on any of
these some and it depends on how many
encryptions are going through it so like
a ES 250 letter slower than just a yes
or Blowfish and how do you find this out
by benchmarking so we hit benchmark it's
right button right when you're creating
the volume and hit benchmark it's going
to benchmark the data transfer between
the where you store the file and into
ram okay so on this computer which is
kind of longish is the fastest yeah so
we've got an average of 46 megabytes a
second of throughput with that
encryption algorithm whereas triple des
we've got 10
10 megabits megabytes a second so that
makes that brings me to a question where
would this really be an ideal solution
for if there was an application you
wanted to encrypt would you be able to
run an application or say a video file
would you be able to actually play that
video file and VLC and play or whatever
it is encrypted yes you would I actually
have multiple applications i run from a
truecrypt drive and will again get that
later so it is so if you've got a sales
machine a modern machine it wouldn't
have any trouble with that correct even
from USB Drive I guess unless we're
talking about HD video it might probably
choke on that but i think my machine
goes on right anyway okay so so let's go
ahead what's your favorite to choose
from mine actually I go with the Triple
Threat serpent to fish an Aes Wow okay
it's a little way of these encryption
algorithms to to hide your files and
exactly awesome it's more secure the
better I don't care about how much
performance it I get okay so just pull
this from the drop-down and they're
going to go with AES to our super
serpent to fish a yes I'm sorry and
here's the hash algorithm now we can
select from shock and that's what I like
going yeah okay so here's where we get
to select the size it picks you have to
pick a specific size however I don't see
the option for dynamic I think we might
have the wrong version but there is an
option where you can make a dynamic
drive that you can expose as you put
files on it that's really neat okay so
let's just make like I don't know a 84
yeah hi Meg ten MiG's all of 10 mix on
1400 yeah I need to clear a space so
we're going to get next and here's where
we put our password okay so in this case
we're probably going to need a uber
secure password not just any secure
password will do likewise you can hear
even display it if you want to hold not
a very good password shouldn't have
shown you my password I'll bet for
everything I keep telling you not to use
password as your password come on short
passwords are easy to crack it warns you
oh that's really nifty are you sure you
want to use the short password it's my
password so they're everything reckon
and multiple words and 20 characters are
more like passphrases right awesome okay
I use it for my hak5 account music set
hak5 org well so this is where it's
creating the Shah or not the Charlie in
the encryption now are the encryption
seed seed for it and what it does is use
it the only way you can get truly random
numbers use this keyboard and mouse
input so the faster you move around or
more keys you type during which it makes
the key okay so we just format it fat
but we had the option for ntfs as well
and I guess the only time that would
really make a difference is if we needed
to save files that are bigger than two
gigabytes because I'm running right that
limitation okay so let's go ahead and
see it in action let's go ahead knock
this puppy and put some miles on it
alright so get back to this and you can
select any Drive letter you want and I
go with 0 because it's normally not used
select file and it's our super-secret
PST file knife comes up with the little
logo we selected it never save history
again with it not saving your history of
what you're going with you can unclick
it if you want to but okay I don't like
to sew down here with our horrible
resolution we got mount auto melt and
dismount we're going to mount the drive
where you're going to type in our super
secret password and if you catch the
password in memory is that going to stay
for the entire window session it only
stays while you're logged in okay and
you can set options to like timeout
after certain times or stuff like that
right ok close out
we hit okay and it's mounted so we go to
my computer and look wait ow get Oh
drive drive now so let's put our secret
data in here okay this is where on the
fly that part of the description of
torture crip is it's actually encrypting
everything between RAM and the drive so
as soon as I'm slapping the secret stuff
in there it's encrypted okay so so if my
computer goes down it's already it's
encrypted oh wow that's really neat I
think what's also really nifty about the
way that it makes us a drive our volume
is that it makes it really transparent
to the operating system so if I'm
running a program and I want and that
program stores data in a specific place
that I can you know specify then and I
want that data encrypted it's real easy
way to know that it is because as far as
Windows is concerned it's just another
drive right okay so we got that done so
what are what are hidden volumes talked
about that a little bit when we were
creating this you're saying something
earlier about plausible deniability what
does that mean well it's a way for you
to say someone has a gun to your head
and saying give me your password for
this true crypt or you're in court or
wherever and they tell you and force you
to give you your password and all they'd
have to do is threaten me with a set and
I'd probably give in some way so okay
I'm going to give them my password and
now they've got all my stuff so great
they got all my evil server documents
and and that's the end of it unless you
use hidden full written volumes okay so
let's go ahead and create a hidden
volume can we create one inside of this
original one that we've already put our
secret stuff in we can all right so
we're gonna dismount it real quick okay
we're going to create a volume go to
hidden TrueCrypt volume instead of
standard next and this is where you can
choose to make a new volume and a hidden
volume or slap a hidden volume inside of
existing one okay so let's just go ahead
and create the volume inside of our
repairs current secret one select the
file device and it's on the desktop I'm
your secret stuff never save your
history next are super uber chic so this
would be a different password right
inner and outer volumes is your standard
and hidden volumes okay so your outer
password is the one that you can give up
okay so that's where I would put i don't
know like tax information so the guys
putting the gun to my head and I'm like
no you can't have my encryption key I
put up a little fight and then you know
he breaks out the set and I give in and
give them my password which is password
exact sadly and then he can get you know
like my stuff from H&amp;amp;R block or whatever
all right okay we hit next now what this
doing is it its mounting the drive and
applying new settings to the to the
volume so that we can add a hidden
volume so here we go it next now we get
to choose our encryption which can be
different from the outer one okay let's
go with the AES okay normally yes we got
it our hash it over and saw one next a
volume size now it has to be quite a bit
less than our standard volume and that's
just so that it can be hidden that's
where so our standard volume we made was
ten megabytes right and it's telling us
that the maximum possible size for this
hidden volume is actually almost six
Meg's right so now my question is if we
make a five megabyte volume we now have
a 10 meg you know TrueCrypt volume right
with a five megan in there if i put
eight megs of stuff in the regular
encrypted volume and not the hidden
encrypted volume well that then
overwrite my other stuff no actually a
makes the 10 meg encrypted vault or the
standard volume that much smaller so
when you when you try to put more
information in its going to say disk
okay so they're both tug right okay so
we're going to go we have five mega and
bring it next it warns you about adding
more data files than in the outer right
because it's making smaller now right
night now if I have too many files in
the outer volume it's going to not be
able to correctly do this okay well I
don't think this this file size should
be an issue in fact I'm probably just
going to use it for you know txt files
and throw it up on an ftp somewhere
because i don't care if somebody gets
his file they're not going to be able to
do anything with exactly so we hit next
now this is our hidden okay so go ahead
and enter in the super secret password
which shouldn't be password in fact we
recommend using multiple words spaces
are great like you know a phrase of a
book or something you like like that and
then toss in some numbers over 20
characters right so we get a next short
password warning a game wait yes now
here's the drop down where we can
measure into this file that's fine or
fat now it's also gets quit your seed
create my seat and we hit form it made
the format 516 okay and okay I can exit
this that amount that drive and remount
the same drug testing for a password
okay well this time let's enter in the
hidden volume password so i can put our
top secret stuff in okay let's
a try again I think water hot for
thought that each acre yet hak5 suuucks
got it right which of course wouldn't be
the password for an incorrect password I
obviously can't spell hack or just
playing with a see okay we hit we did
the correct one it's like fun flickr
with a see now it shows the type hidden'
nice so remember eyes that go to my
computer there's the O drive now there's
nothing you're dead great so they're
like we put our top secret stuff drag
and drop and we can even hear the
details if you just click right there
that right there that it's a 4.6 you
know it's a 4.9 for megabyte volume so
so let's what let's dismount this mm-hmm
and mount arg1 that if we have a gun to
our head our standard sure same file see
all the distant we're going to mount it
again and put in what was that password
again password password got it alright
hit okay normal great so we on a
standard drive it'll still say normal so
people don't know if you have a hidden
volume in there or not mix it up and
that's it it'll stay there prodrive yep
that's great and there's our secret
stuff from our system volume and and
look at that it shows it as a 9.9
megared or a 10 meg volume depending on
how much data we put in him right that's
great well Rob thanks so much for
showing us truecrypt that's really an
excellent tool and I suggest that
anybody that's got secret information
that they want to keep from their little
brothers or sisters or even those evil
tires on the interwebs yes that was two
then definitely give truecrypt to try
because it does look really easy and
really seamless where can people find it
truecrypt calm uh I thought it was work
it goes to 0 well grace redirect and
where can they find more information
about you rob room 362 that room 362 Rob
thanks so much for coming on the show
again
I look forward to having you back again
because you've always got the greatest
bag of tricks all right and we're back
with Ellie but it's time for the polls
so what was the last poll we did laughs
I did was who's your top Hollywood uber
hacker now three choices were David
Lightman for more games Dade Murphy from
hackers and Martin Bishop from sneakers
which is something I've never seen and
you're missing out it's such a good
movie so I've heard sorry it's all right
will school you up on it so you want me
so much of a noob yeah now out of 66
votes a disappointing number by the way
36 went dade murphy of hackers
fifty-four percent thing no I can kind
of see it because everybody knows heck I
told you it's the greatest hacker comedy
ever made didn't I tell you my dad has
that poster I bought it for him so this
month's poll what's your favorite audio
format mp3 AAC WMA OGG or MIDI and Nikki
where can they chime in on the pole in
chimein I'd hak5 dot org slash poles she
knows all about the pole all right we're
gonna take a quick commercial break and
then we'll be right back
doggy doggy doggy Dougie Doug what have
you seen Oh easy godaddy.com is huh yeah
i just bought you for a buck 99 did not
yeah I did dog nabbit whoops just did
your dog mr. Winky my wife loves mr.
Winky oh now I'm gonna do your life
mother you know I'm gonna do your mother
now too late I already did my mother
pervert enter code hack that's H AK when
you check out for an additional ten
percent off any order
welcome back to hack 5 Paul Tobias is
joining us to show us a little mac
application for all of your optical
imaging and burning needs so what are we
taking a look at now essentially this
program takes all the little burning
applications from the other programs and
puts it into one simple application for
all your burning needs all right so
let's jump in take a look all right here
we have burn yep and the data tab it
simply all your data files your whatever
it is it's making like a backup and
stuff like that and pretty simple and
we've got Juliet and all the different
formats you would need yeah then we have
audio burn your mp3 discs or your
old-school audio CDs or whatever and
then we have video burn your vcds or
divx or your new upscaling DVD player or
whatever if you've got a mac super duper
drive you can burn a DVD throw in some
mpegs and boom yep and copy copy I find
this one the most useful as for burnin
like your image is your pink use your
ISOs or whatever all of those image
files you download legally of course
over the interweb and actually let me
get out of this really quick and go down
to the smooth wall I so I have and
actually open up with the burn
application and you'll find that it just
goes straight to the copy fills in the
field for you and just let you burn
right from there sounds good sounds like
a really tightly integrated application
that's exactly you know if I were on the
Mac this is what I would be using I use
it all done awesome and you know it's
still leaps and bounds better than any
of the integrated stuff that windows XP
comes forward with and it's definitely
better than going out and paying for
something like toast or near Oh Roxy all
that stuff so where can people find out
more information about this application
you can actually get this at a burn
stash OS X dot sourceforge.net awesome
and of course you know where to find all
the rest of the show notes and links
from this show that would be hak5 org
slash wiki if we sound a little bit
under enthusiastic that's because we've
done this about 10 times dealing with
audio problems but I think we finally
got it one more time just for you guys
Paul thanks for coming on for the 10th
time yeah and let's just head back over
and see what's up next
thanks a lot Paul now it's time to talk
about the land party yes folks it's back
land party sponsored by evo Lance calm
if you want a game server go to evil and
good quality product what's the land
party all about well Matt from evil and
just up with a really great server and
as some of you may have noticed the game
is fear don't be a worried this free Kia
this freaky chick is not in multiplayer
mode but you can come and play with all
of us on March 16th at eight pm eastern
daylight time I'm gonna say that again
March 16 Friday 8 p.m. eastern daylight
time so those of you in Australia we
don't to hear from you saying where are
you set your clocks you can find all
your information at ww join fear com
March 16 friday 8pm be there game hak5
org Nikki it's been a pleasure thank you
so much for being on helping the owls
out thank you so we're gonna take one
more quick commercial break and then
we'll be back for another segment and
wrap everything up
so we're gonna have some what am I get
it look a lot no clue I just
okay so now I've joined my co-host again
for a segment on smooth wall yes smooth
wall is awesome when it came down to us
moving into the new place and looking
for some solutions for our routing
problems and our need for a better
firewall a we looked at DD wrt and we
saw that in previous segments and it's
real nice right except our network is
basically like we have a knock in this
house maybe between the nass and all the
yeah dd-wrt just does not have the
robust horsepower mmm to you know
shuffle packets like we need it to right
i mean nothing against dd-wrt or the 54
g i mean it's only 200 something megger
process that's fine right but we need
something beefier and that's why we
turned to smooth wall and let's just go
ahead and dive right into the
installation because this is an uber
easy to use uber powerful basically
enter / enterprise-level firewall the
same thing you would find if you bought
a cisco pix or if you were to get like a
what are they the nautical watch guards
of the sonic walls this is a free
alternative to that it's based on the
gnu/linux it's formerly known as smooth
wall GPL then they renamed it to smooth
wall Express two point oh okay and so
I've got the installation here in my
virtual pc and this is actually the
installation for smooth wall expressed
three-point alpha collect its if ya
codename koala it's pretty much the same
as the smooth ball 2 point 0
installation process and we'll look at
this again soon but right now it's
pretty simple let's just go ahead and
boot through this
you can see it's pretty easy to go
through its menu-driven we've got the CD
in the drive right go ahead and mount
that go ahead and partition the disc so
what's happening here is we've taken our
spare machine in our case it was an old
dell celeron 400 I was lying around it's
got three network cards in it it's the
perfect candidate to make a new router
out of right it does need a lot of
horsepower to route packets not a whole
lot this is perfect for those spare
boxes and the great thing is is
dedicated solution but keep in mind that
you are going to partition and format
that entire disk so you are losing
whatever you oh yeah you're still
installing Linux which is an operating
system or this isn't what you know I'm
not going to go into that whole debate
but like yeah this isn't just flashing
the firmware we're actually installing
an operating system something that's
going to be doing something on this
machine this is something you throw in
the closet with the network cables and
you leave it on all the time and this
isn't something you're going to dual
boot with windows and game on because
well if you're on Windows and your
router's not booted item anyway
something doesn't work there so as you
can see right now it's installing the
files and now all we have to do is set
up a few configurations first of all
we'll choose our keyboard layout give it
a name there netbios name right and
we'll configure our network type and
this is where it gets a little advanced
and for our purposes what we're going to
use is a green and red Network what that
means is a red interface is our cable
modem or DSL modem is it LAN yeah this
even supports ISDN or or even dial up if
you out you so desired and the green
network is local our look yeah and if we
wanted to we could do orange which would
be like a dmz or even crazier purple and
orange and red and multicolored
tetrahedrons and we're just going to go
with green to red right now yeah that's
all we need so then we will set up our
cards and this is pretty easy to do all
we have to do is it will it will probe
the computer and find all the network
cards and we assign you know that would
network cards this one
let me to sign the other network card if
it finds one well it's in a vm we'll see
ya and we'll just pretend it found one
and then the next thing to do would be
to set up our dress so we could set up
our dress for the green network and we
can tell it is our subnet yeah so this
would be 192 168 1 to 1 or 10 dot
whatever you want right and then we
would set up our red Network so this
would be the LAN and for our case on a
cable modem it's just dhcp so it's
Tuesday HTTP it would get an address
from the cable modem pretty easy and
that's pretty much it okay so cancel dun
dun you know we can set up the DNS in
the Gateway so this would be the dns
settings provided by our isp right so
we'd still technically need a network
connection at this point so we can say
this is your dns right this is something
that you would set up like after the
fact right you know once you know your
stuff mm-hmm so as soon as that's all
done and of course it's going to fail
out here because no red oh yeah we're in
a virtual machine so it doesn't actually
have to network connections that's as it
is as it is to install you know it'll
finish up the installation you'll eject
the CD ROM you'll reboot and it'll go
with the PC speaker do do do it and
you're at a bash prompt you know you'll
set up you set up your user your admin
user your root user right now you can
actually access what you'll normally see
and that's the web interface yeah what
we're so used to seeing when working
with firewalls and routers and
everything else and the trick is with
the web interface by default it doesn't
use port 80 is port 81 or I forget the
other port but it's like 443 but maybe a
few higher for SSL so if you wanted to
use an HTTPS but right here's the web
interface and this is where you do most
of your ministration and this is where
we can see the awesome features that
this provides that's so many steps above
any of the linksys to fall from one hour
or even dd-wrt or even some of the open
WTF wrt stuff like it is we're actually
talking about a very like enterprise
high level this is going to do what you
want to do right and one of the things
that we want it to do right here is the
web proxy this is actually using a
squint server
a proxy so what sites going to do is
cash stuff and here we can give it our
cash amount it's set to five thousand
eggs so it's going to use five gigabytes
almost yeah almost I'm not doing the
1024 map right but five gigabytes of
hard drive map to store you know
information so like if you were to
download a service pack and then I were
to download the same service pack I
would get it off the local network and
since we're on all gigabit here you'd
get it you get it at a gigabit as
opposed to our whatever it RSP gives us
exactly it would be super fast and
that's the same way that our ISPs even
work when you download a windows update
you're not getting it from red Ben
you're getting it from your isp if
you've got a big enough ISP they run
right anything just like this in fact
probably squid next up we've got DHCP
this is where we can set up our dhcp
server so that it's actually Audi acting
is more than just a pyro wall but a
router as well right now we only have
one interface on our green and that's
just the network card yeah but then you
just plug that into a switch and we
plugged it into a 16 port gigabit switch
and that makes you know the DHCP work
mmhmm yeah it's just like a router
except for the ports are actually built
into the machine yeah you plug into it
exactly I mean you could use this for
one machine but come on who only has one
machine on their network these days yeah
really like there's always multiple
machines gonna have a poll about that
people have tons that our viewers
dynamic dns we've talked a lot about
dine dns in the past and that's you know
you could explain it better than I could
well it's just it's just a matter of
associating some kind of domain name to
your IP address and what makes it
dynamic is the fact that since most
isp's run in a DHCP environment where
you aren't guaranteed to have the same
IP address every time you reset your
cable modem unless you pay extra lets
you pay extra to have your own IP
address then what will happen is dying
DNS will actually go ahead and redirect
the domain that you have for your IP to
the new one right and this is where you
would choose what you know hosting
service you're using dine DNS org we'd
enter in you know or username or
password what domain we have and this
would make sure that that's updated
right yeah so we wouldn't have to
manually would have to go actually out
to dine D&amp;amp;S or anything like it'll send
all that information to it so like say
like new deck 5 org had exactly pointed
to our personal network anymore not
anymore this all this information we
would have given it that and then it
would automatically update dime DNS
every time our dhcp had given us yeah a
new external IP and that's a set and
forget feature that I love Oh intrusion
detection system it's got snort this is
something that is a little bit more
advanced than what I can get into in
this segment but we will be talking
about smooth wall in a future segment
where we get a little bit more like that
part too right so we're going to get
back to that remote access this is where
you can set up SSH and we've talked
about ssh in the past especially when it
comes to setting up a like we talked
about using SSH tunnels to secure VNC
traffic right and this will allow you to
SSH into your home network from the
outside and that way you're practically
on your land and your secure yeah you're
behind all of all your your intrusion
detection and all of your like security
whatever it's like a VPN connection to
us is that right so it's got SSH
built-in on Windows potty or whatever
you want to use I heart putty yeah gosh
okay greatest sysadmin tool ever and
it's a single executable yes little
putty um when it comes to the networking
side and this is kind of the stuff that
you would normally see on your linksys
their Netgear whatever routers it's got
the basic port forwarding but it takes
it a step further and what I really love
about the port forwarding here is that
you can port forward source port and
destination port and what I mean that I
that is with our previous router what we
would have to do if Wes had a VNC server
right I've got a VNC server Paul's got
to be in C server it'd be 5454 0139
jacket 5959 01 5902 so we had to go into
the registry and change all of that
stuff ourselves but not fun so now what
you're telling me is that on the inside
our servers will stay on 5900 so mine
will say 59 receiving on 59 hundred
years is receiving a 1500 Paul's
receiving on 59
but then on the outside then we just
tell our client to connect to double 0 0
1 yeah to so 5901 would go to West 5902
would go to me and it's like being able
to rear out the EPS conduits in real
time no matter what the port is nice
yeah that's awesome um so that there's
such a nice feature because that's
actually that eats up so many of our
port forwarding things anyway right I
know it's great also when it comes to
VPNs this has a VPN passthrough so what
that means is you're able to say like
you've got an open an openvpn server
running on your land not on this machine
but another one machine on your land
this will take care of all of the
boarding not just port 14 but the GRE 47
all of the okay stuff that's necessary
to make that VPN connection work you
know it's it's so valuable to have this
feature yeah now many people on the
forms have come up with mods to install
additional software on the smoothie as
it's called like a samba server or VPN
server but that's not really recommended
because the idea yeah the idea behind
that is this is your router this is your
firewall you don't want anything else
running on this machine because at that
point all you're going to do is add more
ways for somebody to try and hack your
box exactly and I mean especially if
you're running it on like a 400 like we
are that's its job that's what it's
there to do if you want to run a samba
server run it somewhere else on the land
exactly yeah yeah i mean that's that's
what it's all about and you know that's
way you're not trying to make sure they
all for all but not for Moore's but all
the updates are on each diff you know
it's just better to do with that yeah
like this this will stay updated to
itself because this because we're
actually running smooth wall express to
point 0 service pack 1 yeah so like
Microsoft but only in a good way they
stay on top of their you know and it
stays secure now let's introduce some
new books I love the way that you set
that up thank you that's great and under
tools you also have IP information so
you can do some kind of name and stuff
from the right
I'm not getting packets while one of the
router is getting packets you can either
ssh in with putty and run ping or you
can do you know your whois lookup from
here and you've got other IP tools like
ping and the neatest thing is you've
even got a Java shell so don't have yeah
if you don't have putty installed you
can use this right through the web
interface and probably choke on the Java
right here but to to get into you know
the command line the batch prompt of
your router and you can see it just
comes up with this user name password
I'll just go ahead and give it rude the
password there and log oh my god i
logged in as root yeah yeah it'll be all
right everything I'm not gonna do
anything but oh that's now hold up so
there we go and yeah color you know what
I can peeing oh yeah it's just a full
shell fully functional shell and this
it's in Java this is a fully functional
router and we have only scratched the
surface there is so much more power and
capability in the smooth wall Express
distribution I highly recommend if you
have a spare machine lying around and
you're not satisfied with your linksys
or your netgear or something like that
or even if you're afraid of Linux or not
even afraid but you just haven't dabbled
this is a great way to get started
that's awesome like my when I got in
started getting into my hole open source
thing mine was just like I'm gonna jump
ahead first let's install bsd yeah yeah
you really jumped into the deep end I
mean hey st is great but man you you
yeah you did it the right way I think oh
yeah because it is no sense like I don't
get me wrong you've on tues really nice
ones whose great but it doesn't teach
you a lot of the things that you would
really find useful later and open source
if you're looking to get your feet wet
this is a great way because you'll start
off like the package by default does
everything that you're used to beautiful
web interface but then you get into
little tweaks and mods which we'll talk
about in part to write next thing you
know you've got you know Samba shares
and you've got VPN servers and you've
got real time traffic analysis that's
taking care of antivirus on the network
I mean possible yet or limitless with
this stuff that is and the community is
great so you can check it out at smooth
wall dot org I highly recommend getting
into this I know we're probably going to
get some emails people saying well why
don't you
about mono wall some of the other day
they have a lennox or something yeah uh
and i think this is a good first step
and we'll probably you know migrate to
those as well right but head over to
smooth what org grab a copy get into the
forms and community they've got some
really great people over there alright
so and of course general shots always
always show notes hak5 dot org slash
wiki all right let's move right along
okay so that's just about going to wrap
up this episode of hak5 but as always we
have a few things that we need to cover
before we go it'll housekeeping just a
little bit first and foremost we'd like
to thank everybody that was on the show
this episode Nikki lovely and talented
thank you so much for being here and
hanging out with us moob ixora nother be
a segment you were always welcome him
Carl her her will be here again to her
chilly here again with the same shirt
every time that's right and then Aaron
for coming over and pushing some buttons
and filling in for Paul while he was
doing stuff and I was gone yes and she
pushed all the right buttons we also
would like to announce that we will be
at shmoocon this March 23rd to the 25th
so if you're around you'll probably see
us around and you come by say hey we'll
probably have some stickers whoo and
maybe we'll throw a shoe ball at you yes
sweet all right up next also we would
like to remind you about the land party
game data hak5 dot org March 16-day p.m.
eastern daylight time because that's
where we live and we are going to get
fragged because we are huge noobs when
it comes to a game there's because it's
gonna be nothing but pure I'm gonna be
running this poor FPS and then the game
server is part of the whole entire hak5
community which is also included with
the IRC server and the forums yeah if
you're only watching the show you're
getting about half the experience set I
mean if that the forums are a great
place to go and find information if you
can't find the answer to your question
there ask the question somebody will
have the answer or they'll point you in
the right direction at the very least
and as always the IRC o wine is lead
definitely 01 we need to give big shout
out and thanks to him and everyone else
involved with the new IRC network
where we've built our IRC from the
ground up and now it's a community based
network with leaf nodes all over the
place so if you had low pings or high
pings in Australia we got leaf nodes all
over the globe and its ever-expanding
and it's a great place to hang thank you
for the contributors and thank you too
Oh wine for orchestrating being the
ringmaster for everything and finally
there's always the wiki yes that's where
you can find the show notes and all
sorts of other fun goodies including
fabulous wallpapers and from test mad
and various others moonlit trivia about
the show all sorts of fun stuff so and
the untruth yes the untruth that's a fun
place always awesome so uber thanks to
Ashley wit for being the wiki man same
guy that did the Denton ten internet is
because our theme song that man is a
multi talented person oh he's got
ringtones sorry but yeah yeah that's
right yeah yeah every time Ashley wit
did a beautiful you can get him an mp3
wav midi the midi actually sounds really
good for a midi it is not so many in
fact some people have even like found
each other from it yeah oh yeah he's
really well like somebody's like walking
through the moss on there like a x5 yeah
you got the ringtone going on all the
sudden like the hack the technologists
there yes yes so picking which with all
of that said if you are a brand new
viewer or somebody that's been here
since the beginning we here cordially
invite you to trust your technol us
hey don't leave me hanging boom oh
alright
I want to go high but that's who I am
you want to be like welcome back to add
five oh my god you're still watching
because I'm not all right so we're gonna
kick this episode of Fat Boy boy fly boy
whooping New Jersey and what we're doing
some happen and then we throw the bodies
in the placing this time on hack point
five this isn't take 10 because we had
audio problems oh ok open source audio
I'm good we're good I'm going to my
shoes wanna Ramdeen over there so we
basically I transferred all my years new
new new zoo that I was serious oh yeah

have died II go there we go I think I
talking about John and soph left in the
protocol the protocol we've got a little
mac snack for you guys with all my asst
