around the Chesapeake Bay and the
Eastern Shore and it's about 700 miles
and there's a lot of new roads and
bridges and tunnels and ferries and you
know stuff I've never seen so I'm
excited I've got this route that takes
me down I started here and camp cross
over and then I will do this before lead
ooze down so I'm excited about the
upgrade that have made for this trip
I've installed kind of a temporary
12-volt DC outlet on my bike that'll
allow me to charge my cell phone and my
HD video camera and my GPS and then I
just got a GPS RAM mount for my bike so
I don't have to keep pulling out of my
tank bag it's gonna be super important
this will actually be my first so little
motorcycle adventure multi-day thing a
few weeks ago I did a trip through
Skyline Drive and up around news I think
about 600 miles and and yeah it was
awesome because Brian came down from
upstate New York and camped with me and
totally made the experience awesome so
I'm looking forward to doing it again
and I learned a whole bunch of stuff
about you know you know testing the
camping gear and what to bring and what
not to bring like this my m.a.c tube or
beanie if you will pick this up in
Canada place called Mountain Equipment
co-op it's super warm you have to be a
member to buy from there it's a co-op so
I think that means that I have like a
share or something at this Canadian
company
know what that means for my American
taxes and of course before I go I've got
a duel that you know standard bike
maintenance thing make sure it's in
tip-top shape so I've been you know
waxing and cleaning the chain checking
tire pressure oil all that good stuff
you know it's got to be a lot of roads
and bridges and tunnels and stuff I have
never seen before across four states so
I'm probably going to have trouble
sleeping like a kid the day before it
goes to Disneyland or something
we'll see day one began in my own
backyard and I figured that since this
trip was so much about these bridges in
these periods and so much of the
waterway of Chesapeake Bay might as well
just take the James River ferry
Jamestown Scotland Ferry well here it is
the very first leg of the trip and I
just missed the ferry I got here at 9:02
I'll just wait for the next one this
reminds me the last act live set we had
one of those on our wall I didn't blink
just be thinking about like is that just
a regular party ball morning
delicious
breakfast on a boat
whenever into Smithfield where they do
all like you know the Smithfield ham and
how didn't aroma but it wasn't quite
bacon or ham but it was definitely meat
I drove by the sign and I was just kind
of shocked it was route 666 and then the
very next sign was for the meatpacking
plant so I had to go and check it out
mmm
delicious delicious myth filled ham
hey guys that swine flu here right
sadly the Smithfield ham plant does not
smell like bacon
it has a smell but it's not bacon and
then back across the James River over
the James River Bridge so the one thing
that's kind of disconcerting about these
bridges here with like the drawbridge
sections so they usually have this field
red deck it's just kind of just
concerning to ride over because all
there goes oh that's the stuff oh boy
so your front wheel just tends to slip
around on those and it just wants to do
what it wants to do and then I took the
Hampton Roads bridge tunnel which sure
it's on the interstate but it was pretty
much the only feasible way to get where
I needed to go as I approached the
Chesapeake Bay bridge-tunnel it really
started to feel like an adventure so far
I had mostly been on roads that I knew
or knew of and this was the first big
new experience testing favorite stone
the bridge awesome suction this could be
so much fun
can't wait to see all the water the
landing at the chest of EZ Pass
wait
that our company
poor father perhaps $12 what the
this cost money
are there did I get a discount for
riding a motorcycle to get a discount
for being awesome
thank you have a nice day okay well you
know $12 for like 24 miles that's only
like 50 cents a mile for fun you know
goodbye speech hello look it's the bags
for bikes it's the ocean
so here we are just that and I made it
down to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge I'm at
the first stop here and I had no idea
what a project it was just learned that
it's like a 500 million dollar set of
bridges and tunnels and I'm just here at
the first point getting a feel for
things and it's huge
and it's exciting and the roads are in
great condition and that guy's not going
to run over my bike I'm gonna see if I
can find a not a gift for snubs because
there's like gift shops and fishing
piers and restaurants and all sorts of
stuff this is ridiculous I know what
you're thinking should I get her the
jewelry box or the shot glass or the
fireworks so many choices
Oh illegal to use fireworks on
bridge-tunnel property I guess we'll go
with a shock last time and then the rest
of the Bay Bridge was pretty easygoing
and at the end of it there was this
really cool wildlife preserve so I
decided to pull over and give monkey a
little geography lesson so based on my
extensive research I've learned that the
Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in
North America and its watershed covers
64,000 miles and it's home to like 17
million people and like 32,000 species
I just don't pay any attention punky
are you are you listening okay the rest
of the Eastern Shore was pretty much
just farms it was very nice going roads
that miles just flew by and I really
enjoyed it then I was just totally at
ease and as I crossed into the Maryland
border I realized that this is actually
the first time Josette and I had like
ridden out of state I mean eight
thousand miles a summer and I pretty
much haven't left Virginia I mean sure I
picked her up in North Carolina but she
was on the back of a truck like a Harley
go into a rally so throughout Maryland I
kept on seeing these arrows marked on
the pavement and I got me really excited
because I just started you know thinking
back to my f20 days and my youth and I
kept on riding over them hoping to get
like a little energy boost and then I
stopped in Ocean City Maryland Ocean
City Maryland what's fair to say it's
aptly named
I just continued up the coast and then
that you know whenever a bridge next
thing you knew I was in Delaware I'd I
don't even noticed I would have stopped
and take a picture it was just oh
there's a Delaware a cop I guess I'm in
Delaware and next thing you know I'm at
the campsite which was great because
it's starting to get a little dust and
after only two hundred and fifty some
odd miles here we are
henlopen state park the campground for
the night he's mean crazy funky tower
Deeley hello people I kid
my bikes faster you want to race ahead
pick
so this is the end of day 1 and yeah
just going to do this in the morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
