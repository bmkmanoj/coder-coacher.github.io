around the Chesapeake Bay and the
Eastern Shore and it's about 700 miles
and there's a lot of new roads and
bridges and tunnels and fairies and you
know stuff I've never seen so I'm
excited I've got this route that takes
me down we started here and now we're
here and now we're going to go up to
here and camp crossover and then we'll
do this poorly dues and down so I'm
excited about the upgrade that have made
for this trip I've installed kind of a
temporary 12-volt DC outlet on my bike
that'll allow me to charge my cell phone
and my HD video camera and my gps and
then i just got a gps ram mount my bike
so i don't have to keep pulling out at
my tank bag it's gonna be super
important this will actually be my first
so little motorcycle adventure multi-day
thing a few weeks ago I did a trip
through Skyline Drive and up around us I
think about 600 miles and and yeah it
was awesome because Brian came down from
upstate New York and camped with me and
totally made the experience awesome so
I'm looking forward to doing it again
and I learned a whole bunch of stuff
about you know you know testing the
camping gear and what to bring and what
not to bring like this my MA see tube or
beanie if you will pick this up in
Canada place called Mountain Equipment
co-op it's super warm so you have to be
a member to buy from there it's a co-op
so i think that means that i have like a
share or something at this canadian
company
know what that means for my American
taxes and of course before I go I've got
a dual that standard bike maintenance
thing make sure it's in tip-top shape so
I've been you know waxing cleaning the
chain checking tire pressure oil all
that good stuff you know it's going to
be a lot of roads and bridges and
tunnels and stuff I have never seen
before across four states so I'm
probably going to have trouble sleeping
like a kid the day before it goes to
Disneyland or something we'll see day
one began in my own backyard and I
figured that since this trip was so much
about these bridges in these periods and
so much of the waterway of Chesapeake
Bay might as well just take the james
river ferry and jamestown Scotland ferry
well here it is the very first leg of
the trip and I just missed the ferry I
got here in 902 I'll just wait for the
next one this reminds me the last act
live set we had one of those on our wall
didn't blink I'll just be thinking about
like is that just a regular party bulb
hmm morning
delicious
breakfast on a boat
whenever into Smithfield where they do
all like you know the Smithfield ham and
had an aroma but it wasn't quite bacon
or ham but it was definitely meet I
drove by the sign and I was just kind of
shocked it was route 666 and then the
very next sign was for the meatpacking
plant so I had to go and check it out
hmm delicious delicious myth field am
hey guys that's why I flew here right
sadly the Smithfield ham plant does not
smell like bacon
it has a smell but it's not bacon and
then back across the James River over
the James River Bridge so the one thing
that's kind of disconcerting about these
Bridget ear would like the drawbridge
sections so they usually have the steel
grid deck that's just kind of
disconcerting to ride over cuz oh there
goes oh that's the stuff oh boy so your
front wheel just tends to slip around
all those and it just want to do what it
wants to do and then I took the Hampton
Roads bridge tunnel which sure it's on
the interstate but it was pretty much
the only feasible way to get where I
needed to go as I approached the
Chesapeake Bay bridge-tunnel it really
started to feel like an adventure so far
I had mostly been on roads that I knew
or knew of and this was the first big
new experience oh here comes in so
excited chesapeake bay bridge toll
whoo-hoo 24 miles of bridge awesome
action this could be so much fun can we
see all the water the lantic at the
chest of ez pass boom
wait
don't have full father perhaps $12 put
this book this costs money hey
there so I get a discount for riding a
motorcycle we get a discount for being
awesome
thank you have a nice day okay well you
know twelve dollars for like 24 miles
that's only like 50 cents a mile for fun
you know
goodbye speech hello look it's the bags
the bike the ocean
so here we are just that and I made it
down to the chesapeake bay bridge i'm at
the first stop here and i had no idea
what a project it was just learned that
it's like a 500 million dollar set of
bridges and tunnels and i'm just here at
the first point getting a feel for
things and it's huge and it's exciting
and the roads are in great condition and
that guy's not going to run over my bike
and i'm going to see if i can find a
kind of gift for snubz because there's
like gift shops and fishing piers and
restaurants and all sorts of stuff this
is ridiculous I know what you're
thinking today get out of the jewelry
box or the shot glass or the fireworks
so many choices
Oh illegal to use fireworks on bridge
tunneled property and I guess we'll go
with a shock last time and then the rest
of the bay bridge was pretty easy going
and at the end of it there was this
really cool wildlife preserve so I
decided to pull over and give monkey a
little geography lesson so based on my
extensive research I've learned that the
Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in
North America and its watershed covers
64,000 miles and its home to like 17
million people and like 32 thousand
species I just don't pay any attention
punky are you are you listen okay fine
I'll over here monkey the rest of the
Eastern Shore was pretty much just farms
it was very nice going roads but miles
just flew by and I really enjoyed it
then I was just totally at ease and as I
crossed into the Maryland border I
realized that this is actually the first
time Josette and I had like ridden out
of state I mean 8,000 miles this summer
and I pretty much haven't left Virginia
I mean sure I picked her up in North
Carolina but she was on the back of a
truck like a Harley going to a rally so
throughout Maryland I kept on seeing
these arrows marked on the pavement and
I got me really excited because I just
started you know thinking back to my f0
days and my youth and I kept on riding
over them hoping to get like a little
energy boost and then I stopped in Ocean
City Maryland ocean city maryland what's
there to say it's aptly named
I just continued up the coast and then
that you know whenever a bridge next
thing you knew I was in Delaware I'd I
don't even noticed I would have stopped
and take a picture it was just oh
there's a Delaware a cop I guess i'm in
delaware and next thing you know I'm at
the campsite which was great because
it's starting to get a little dust and
after only 250 samad miles here we are
henlopen state park the campground for
the night crazy Punk eat our diely hello
people I kids my bikes faster you want
to race a heaven picks up
so this is the end of day one and yeah
just going to do this in the morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
