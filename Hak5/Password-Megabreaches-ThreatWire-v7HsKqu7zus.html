include dropbox mitsubishi outlander
Wi-Fi hack teamviewer adding security
checks in zuk was using bad passwords
all that more coming up now on threat
wire greetings I'm Patrick Norton this
is threat wire 4 jun 7 2016 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom thanks to all our
patrons at patreon calm / threat wire
you right there you you make the show
possible 500 million that is a pretty
big number that's how many passwords and
usernames were filled from LinkedIn
myspace and tumblr in the past few weeks
or at least made publicly dropbox.com
however did not have a breach but says
Krebs on security quote lifelock and
several other identity theft protection
firms erroneously alerted their
customers to a breach at cloud storage
giant Dropbox an incident that
reportedly exposed some 73 million
usernames and passwords Wow the 73
million usernames and passwords actually
that data came from tumblr side note go
make sure your tumblr your LinkedIn and
or myspace password doesn't match any of
your current passwords for any service
you use online hit pause the video will
be here when you get back if you're not
sure how to use that or if you're not
sure how to figure that out you really
should be running a password manager
than just a security audit because it'll
help you figure out that you don't have
any matching passwords which is a big
deal you'll pick up on that this week in
any case Krebs did some sweet reporting
for us tracking down CSID that's the
identity protection firm that was
pointing the finger at Dropbox and then
asking them how they knew which
basically accounts for them listening to
a guy named worm on Twitter apparently
he's been accurate in the past and warm
said it was Dropbox and link to a file
that actually CSID couldn't verify the
original aimed was the passwords from
the drop box now Krebs points out they
could have simply attempted to sign up
for an account using an email addresses
from the data or you know several
different email addresses tempting
several different account sign ups he
goes into the whole process explicitly
in how to tell data leaks from publicity
stunts because most online services do
not use or do not allow two different
user accounts to have the same email
address so attempting to sign up for an
account using an email address in a
claimed leak dump is an effective way to
test leak claims
this is good right so any case the
article Dropbox smeared and week of mega
breaches includes some great insight
from flashpoints director of security
research that's Allison Nixon she was
the inspiration for that article about
data leaks and velicity stunts she talks
about automating threat Intel and the
need for human skepticism which is hard
to code into AI it's a good read the
link is in the show notes right down
there okay I am sure some cars with
Wi-Fi built-in are secure but the folks
at Penn test partners found out that the
security of mitsubishi outlander PA TV
hybrid which uses a mobile app to log
into the car directly over Wi-Fi instead
of connecting to a gsm module in the car
via the web service or the cloud well
the mitsubishi not so secure they
cracked the pre-shared Wi-Fi key in a
few days use wiggle net to track and
locate at landor ph EBS by their SSID is
all over Great Britain quote then we
started a man-in-the-middle and sniffed
the Wi-Fi connection this is where it
got interesting now interesting includes
things like turning on features like AC
to drain the battery turn the lights on
and off and hey disabling the cars alarm
system read the whole story including
Mitsubishi's decision to respond to the
security info only after pentest
partners went to the BBC a link is in
the show notes register UK says quote
two new security checks and teamviewer
will warn users when a new device or
location attempts to log into their
TeamViewer account remotely manage any
computers connected to it and will raise
an alert of suspicious activity is
detective what well this is ugly people
a rash of teamviewer users have
complained their desktops have been
breached banking sites accessed money
stolen internet orders placed teamviewer
not so hot apparently on the the
customer service on this one there
basically said problems not our servers
but the victims of the attacks had
reused their teamviewer login passwords
and other websites that have been
breached such as LinkedIn and tumblr did
I mention passwords being a theme this
week that said some victims claimed they
not only were not using recycled
passwords but we're using two-factor
authentication side note Mark Zuckerberg
Twitter and Pinterest passwords while
his accounts were hacked into because
his passwords da da
as in da da da rights the registers john
leyden were the same as the ones he used
for linkedin or they were found the
linkedin password collection mr.
zuckerberg facebook account was not
breached presumably it had a
considerably better password and i
mentioned it before passwords go change
in people check them out right now
before we go the intercept pretty much
sums it up in the title quote FBI kept
demanding email records despite DOJ
saying it needed a warrant by the way
the DOJ said that back in 2008 director
comfies working very hard on the hill to
make warrantless requests for electronic
communication transaction records while
warrantless that's of course the same
kind of info they have been demanding
for years and apparently keep demanding
despite the DOJ ruling and saying ah no
props to yahoo for making this public
which they didn't legally after being
released from their gag order last week
normally this is the part of the video
where I tell you that we are grateful
for everyone that supports threat wire
by a patreon calm / threat wire and
while I am grateful Shannon and Darren
are too because you keep the show going
