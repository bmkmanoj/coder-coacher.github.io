on hack five hello welcome to hack five
my name is darren kitchen my name is
Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of techno last and
we are doing more drone work oh yes very
exciting because guess what are we
flying today yeah finally gosh I've been
so freaking excited about that
so today we are learning to fly
finally super exciting of course if you
guys have been following along in this
series we have been building a drone or
a quadcopter and Motz I talked to
multi-rotor yes specifically we have
been building a quadcopter to be less
than 250 grams eight point eight ounces
which makes it completely exempt from
FAA regulations or at least here in the
United States and it's also being built
as a platform to learn all of the ins
and outs of the different components and
kind of the basics of multi-rotor
avionics and it's all come together very
exciting and today we are going to learn
how to fly it so of course if you have
not been following along with building
your own as well that's totally okay
these learning to fly tips apply to
pretty much any craft so you can either
build it or you can buy and we
absolutely recommend starting out with
like a really cheap toy you can get one
of those Hudson's on Amazon for like you
know thirty bucks or whatever it might
be right now or a cyma very very
inexpensive oh yeah totally
you guys should definitely get a toy
first because you won't be on the side
of the at the park too slick trying with
like broken carbon fiber and in fact
anywhere anyway so with that what we're
gonna do is offer our top tips for
first-time pilots and to start you're
going to need a few things now firstly I
want to say you need a safe space
preferably an empty Park on a day
without too much wind or in our case
we're using warehouse which takes the
whole wind issue out entirely and if
you'll be learning outside just make
sure that you're at least five miles
away from any airports and that is the
way the crow flies of course and then
next you're going to need plenty of
charge batteries all the batteries and
all the worlds so for each of these
exercises we are going to want to burn a
battery on it until we are confident
with the movements so that means flying
the entire pack until our low voltage
alarm starts but buzzing and tip I also
want to say this if you can bring your
battery charger to the park hook it up
to your car's battery or through an
inverter so that you can recharge as you
fly so you don't have to go back home
when your batteries yes there and you
know what I say burning batteries don't
light fire two lithium polymer batteries
that I just main like run them dead and
just keep them going because when you're
first learning to fly you just plow
through batteries so finally we are
going to need a very good way to
visually identify our craft knowing
which way is forward and back is so
super important as we're going to be
learning what we call line of sight or
ello s flying and that's really
important to learn that first this won't
matter as much when we start flying fpv
or first-person view with wireless
cameras and video goggles but for right
now we want to ensure that we have
confidence piloting the craft with just
our eyes se in the event that an fpv
system fails and we need to be able to
like look up and see it now Shannon as
you can tell with our craft it's it's
pretty much a black hex of carbon fiber
there's nothing discerning on this and
we've got black there's a propellers on
here so you know what I like to do is
just quite simply use some electric tape
a little bit of this will go a long way
and what you'll want to do is go ahead
and put some colored electric tape on
the back of it since that's the side
that we're going to be focusing on most
some people also do like different
colored propellers like green propellers
and other colors there you go those will
stand out outside now before each flight
we'll want to do this preflight check
are we five miles away from the nearest
airport yes are there people or dogs
around that will get in our flight path
because that would be really sad no and
are there any wires from the batteries
getting snagged by the propellers we
should probably check just make sure
now these sound a little bit obvious but
you would be surprised how many seasoned
professionals crashed shortly after
takeoff
of a loose cable just gets caught in the
mower motors I mean that's just not very
fun at all so just take your time look
every over everything and look over
everywhere before arming the craft I've
done that one
I don't think we'll do it so much with
this one because it's so tight the
tolerances on all of our tables but you
know something like this like we haven't
secured really our receiver and our
receiver could easily I mean it probably
won't
this wire isn't going to stop her
propeller from spinning we also don't
want to chop it off that's kind of
important so it's just something to keep
in mind all right so we are now ready to
fly and the first thing is to turn on
our transmitter and make sure that we
have the correct model selected then on
a very level surface we can go ahead and
plug the battery into our craft now
we're securing our battery to our
quadcopter using a velcro strap you
could just as well use a rubber band but
really comes down to personal preference
either way make sure it's on tight and
that it's not going anywhere on the end
yeah I mean like really you don't want
like your battery coming off in play so
that is like another important one to
secure because I've seen that happen -
it's no fun your center of gravity
becomes all wonky it's like hanging
blowing oh man bad stuff all right so
once you've got the quadcopter booted up
though you'll want to go ahead and make
a quick test and just what you want to
do is basically ensure that your
transmitter is speaking effectively to
your quadcopter right as you'll note
about one of our switches on our
transmitter it's auxilary channel to the
buzzer so one of the things I like to do
is just quickly flip that switch and
make sure it's beeping easy check yes it
is also speaking of auxilary channels we
set the other auxiliary channel to our
flight modes and in this case we're
switching between angle and rate mode
this may be controversial Shannon but
I'm gonna go ahead and say it
I recommend that when you begin flying
the very first stages of planning
playing learning line-of-sight you want
to go ahead and do that in angle mode
then once you've gotten into it once you
understand the craft once you understand
the avionics and how it's going to react
to things when you get into fpv that is
a great time to switch over to rate mode
it will feel so much more natural when
you're in those video goggles again
that's just my opinion so feel free to
let me know in the comments below of I'm
a terrible person for saying such
blasphemy but also you're not going to
have that mode if you're trying on a toy
cyma or hubs and anyway true we should
also mention with speaking of modes we
did touch on that before but let's go
ahead and take a moment quickly to go
over what the three basic modes are in
clean flight or flight controller
software what they actually mean so
first off is angle mode it's the most
basic and the easiest to fly it's a self
leveling mode meaning that when you let
off the sticks of the quadcopter it will
try to walk right itself so that it's
level makes sense now when you push the
pitch lever all the way forward you are
telling the quadcopter what angle of
attack to have specifically alright so
so the idea is you view this and you're
not saying go forward you're actually
saying this is that angle and this is
that angle right so that's angle mode is
you see how that kind of works is like
you're saying okay go there and then
it's gonna stop because that's the angle
you've told it to do or I'm sorry it's
backwards but that's me I believe told
it to do like that and then you have
rate mode which is sometimes called
manual mode or acro mode since it is
perfect for acrobatics yes it is oh it
sounds super fun and this one is not
self leveling so the easiest way to
think about it is that instead of
telling the quadcopter what angle of
attack to have when you push the lever
the pitch lever forward you are telling
it at what rate to change its angular
velocity of rotation so that means if
you pitch it all the way forward it'll
eventually do a front flip and you're
probably not going to end up pulling
that off an angle no no you're not
so here's why so in angle mode like this
is all the way forward of an angle that
we're going to allow it to have and
depending on the way we've got it
configured we could say maybe this is as
high of an angle of attack that we'll
ever want to do when we push it this far
forward whereas rape mode if you subtly
push it forward so in angle mode you
subtly push it forward and it's like
okay go make this angle
yeah what you're saying in rape mode is
okay pitch forward at this rate now this
is a slow rate if we just subtly push it
forward it's going to slowly start going
forward but it'll keep going keep going
forward slowly until it's like this and
then no fun is being had now if you Jack
it forward really quick what you're
telling it to do is is set the velocity
that you want it to pitch forward and so
what'll happen is if you're an
accomplished pilot you can do little
things like that where you push it
forward really fast and it'll spin over
and then you've got a you know jacket
back just a bit to catch it but you'll
be able to do acrobatics and that's one
of the fun things about rape mode there
last one is this thing called horizon
mode and it's kind of a hybrid of those
two so basically it's a sort of
combination when the sticks are really
close to the center then you'll be in
that gentle mode so if I just push it
just a little forward I'm still in what
you could consider angle mode where it's
self leveling but when I push it far out
to the extents what I've done is once I
cross that threshold it's going to go
into a sort of rate mode I think it's
best really to have one of your switches
basically bounded to between rate and
angle I mean if you've got a three-way
switch you might as well have it do all
three but I feel like staying angle mode
until you've got the basic concepts of
quadcopter aviation and then once you've
donned your fpv video goggles rate modes
gonna come naturally then he loves the
video goggles oh yeah like so serious so
okay our transmitter is on we've got the
quadcopter that's powered up we're in
angle mode we've got them connected to
each other so let's go ahead and get
flying so first step start your engines
and each flight controller software will
be a little bit different but typically
there is a start-up or arming sequence
with the controller sticks so for us
using clean flight its throttle all the
way down and rudder all the way to the
right so push that left stick down there
you go and then the right one there you
go to the right so rudder to the right
and then you'll hear a few beeps once it
signifies that it's connected right you
may notice that unlike other quad
copters the propellers aren't going to
start spinning a
and that's because we've set that in our
configuration but keep that in mind
though because it's armed but that's not
spinning up if our quadcopter doesn't
get any input from us in a few seconds
after arming it's gonna go ahead and
automatically disarm itself so right
after you're armed what you'll want to
do is gently start increasing the
throttle just enough to cause the motors
to spin up but don't lift off the ground
at this point we really just want to get
those motors spinning right because the
first tip and learning fly is getting a
really good feel for the pitch the roll
and yaw while still mostly it just on
the ground now there is this really
awesome principle in flight called the
ground effect so this is really cool
Darren taught me about this it's where
the craft will sort of float on a pocket
of its own propwash really close to the
ground so typically the altitude is
about half the length of its prop so if
we give it just enough throttle we'll
sort of hover around two inches off of
the ground which is kind of awesome
because we have five inch props about
half of that what'll happen is you'll
start to see it'll kind of like do this
and it's like there's a little pillow of
air underneath it and personally this is
my technique but I find this to be a
great way to learn and I feel like this
is really important because what we want
to do is next when we learn to hover
we're gonna meet need to make like all
of these little minut micro adjustments
for pinch Tori role or in our yaw just
to keep our craft centered and so with
enough practice what's gonna happen is
that all of these little movements are
just going to become natural to us just
like how you make a million little minut
movement to keep your balance when you
know with your ankles and your toes and
your hips and everything when you climb
stairs and you know basically the idea
here is to get feeling really
comfortable with those controls while
coasting it's kind of like learning to
crawl before you learn to walk of course
you would not want to do that vice versa
so you'd probably fall so the best way
to get a feel for this is to simply do
this box pattern yes so while keep in
the back of the craft facing you go
ahead and Coast it forward and then you
stop and then you strafe to the right
and then you stop and then you bring it
back and you stop before you strafe left
and then hopefully you return to where
you began so this might not seem like a
lot but it's
actually pretty tough to do your first
time around but getting a feel for it
like like this is so so important so
keep doing that box pattern and play
with different angles of attack just
don't go so far in one direction that
your props end up touching the ground
because you're sitting on that pillow so
you don't want to raise it up too high
stay around that natural place on the
ground but do get a feel for how the
craft reacts and then make sure that you
always keep the back of the craft facing
you and of course if you need a little
rudder to spin it left or right
just gently apply just a little bit now
you don't want to turn like turn it
around so that it's facing you because
suddenly then left becomes right and
right becomes left so make sure that its
butt is facing you the whole time yeah
and that's really we emphasize that with
all of these and that's like a good
practice on the very first go yeah
because you want to get comfortable with
all of those different maneuvers without
having to break your mind you know
thinking relative until instead of
absolute so I mean some brains take to
it faster than others this is my
personal tip is this coasting box step I
mean as you might imagine it is like the
very basics it is one two three one two
three one two I mean well I'm just
saying if you can waltz you can back
step and vice versa but once you have
burned a few batteries on just doing
this box step it is time to bring it to
the hover and an important safety note
here if things go wrong just cut the
throttle right trying to save a craft
when it's going off and doing its own
thing
you're oftentimes going to make the
situation worse so this is why we say
learn in a place free from people and
pets but I just want to say that if
things go wrong just cut the throttle
yeah you don't want Fido to eat your
drone you don't want to eat Fido cuz
that's an engine you don't want to get
into and a common mistake is to jack to
throttle up way too fast boom I
definitely did the first time I met
those people the first time they ever
bury one copy they go when they go oh no
and like there's no like second step so
it's gonna like chess you got to think
the next moves like Carly all right I'm
gonna bring the throttle up B not
thinking about the throttle up be
thinking about what you're gonna
laughter so you really really really
want to make really small movements with
the sticks so some people feel that
pinching them gives them better
precision other people use their thumbs
but either way just be gentle BJ's I
stood Rohn i I'm a I'm a pincher not a
yeah I'm a summer yeah we like to call
those dumb summers but you know whatever
alright so for the hover what you want
to do is go ahead and keep the back of
it towards you and you'll want to slowly
raise the craft infra in front of you
until it's hovering at about chest level
if you go a little higher that's okay
just slowly ease off that throttle until
you can keep it about chest level and
here's the thing the craft it is going
to want to bank to one side or the other
it is going to want to pitch either
forward or back and this is normal
perfect no it's not only in the most
advanced quad copters with things like
GPS hold are you even going to be able
to eliminate drift and I'm just gonna
tell you it's those kind of crafts like
the DJI phantom is the classic example
it is not the best craft to learn on
because you're not telling it pitch
forward or throttle up you're saying go
up go forward and it's doing all of the
actual flying yeah and so like it gives
you a false sense of security as a pilot
when you learn on something like that
because when you throttle up and it just
stays there like frozen in space you're
not getting a you know you're not lunar
ain't learning those little micro of
movements that you need to be able to
walk and keep the craft centered so
anyway those are not the sort of things
to learn on which is why we're doing
this and just you use what you've
learned from that box pattern because
what you'll end up doing is you're
you're gonna make these little nudges
just to keep the quadcopter back in its
place yeah that's a good point
and then of course you can try imagining
an invisible beach ball so this is a
really cool idea of to think about it
which is basically thinking of a beach
ball and then you keep the craft inside
are you doing the invisible beach ball
because my gypsy ball watch me race
she's a feste girl here so you'll find
that
you'll find that the more subtle the
correction movements that you make the
easier it is to control so if for
example you push too far left and you'll
immediately need to push right which
kind of stinks right and then you're in
what's called pilot induced oscillation
so you can think of it as lightly
nudging a rubber ducky floating in the
bathtub well Shannon that is a fantastic
way to think about invisible beach balls
and River decades it's time hak5 but
yeah you definitely don't because you
really you're like oh no it's drifting
to the right aren't left
oh no it's way too far right then you're
just like yeah you're all over the place
like don't do that on black ice it's
funny too you see little kids pantomime
driving a car and they're doing this
right but you know when you drive a car
you're like I'm Nick I like you barely
like I'm making a laugh right unless
you're in the school bus right and then
okay here's the thing as with the other
example what we're going to want to do
is keep the back of the craft facing us
at all times and if you find that you
constantly need to apply say your roller
pitch in one direction all the time to
keep it level well it may be at that
time a good idea to start adding a
little bit of trim we talked about these
little buttons here that you push
forward or back to just say like oh the
center point if you're constantly
pitching forward you can press a little
bit of forward trim and it'll go ahead
and say oh this is the new center point
and it'll stop drifting a little bit do
you just deal with it yeah that's the
thing honestly if it's not too bad I say
deal with it in your thumbs get a feel
for it it's like having different dance
partners or something you're going to if
every craft is going to be different
you're gonna have to get a feel for them
and you could spend forever trying to
get a perfect trim it doesn't exist so
it's always going to drift in one place
or another and that's okay just keep
practicing the invisible beach ball and
burn as many batteries as it takes to
just feel absolutely confident with that
move okay so I'm feeling confident I'm
ready
you know I'm hovering in place so it's
time to take it a step further so the
next exercise is to fly away from
yourself and then back towards yourself
so it's sort of like how we did with the
Box pattern but this time while hovering
at about chest level instead of weight
on the ground so the idea here is to get
a feel for the speed of the craft it's
stopping characteristics in how it
handles in forward flight and again with
all of these you want to keep the back
of the craft towards you so that it left
it right and right is left and as long
as you do that you'll be fine if again
you lose orientation cut the throttle
gravity will take care of the rest
and once you've spent a few battery
packs flying away from yourself and back
the next thing is to do left and right
just what you know
bank to left bank to the right in front
of yourself do this with the craft a
good distance away from you but in front
of you and again keep the back of it
towards you and then just try this with
varying different amounts of roll to
kinda get a feel for how the craft
handles when you stop so you know try
like slowly banking left and right try
fast and then you know you try your air
brakes when you're going like this and
then you have to stop and then come back
and do it the other way and then once
you've gotten the hang of these it is
time to get a little bit more advanced
super excited start using a rudder some
more so one way is to circle your craft
so you want to get it in a hover mode
just like before with the back of the
quadcopter facing you obviously and then
slowly at a safe distance make sure you
have a safe distance walk a circle
around the craft while giving it just a
little bit of rudder movement to y'all
the crafts around with you so the idea
is to keep the back of the craft facing
you while hovering even while you are
circling it yes another fun one of
course circle strafing for the wind WASD
right I think is take this and then swap
places now you know grab a partyer dosey
doe you are now the quadcopter standing
in the middle and have it spin around
view this is a really fun one basically
once you've gotten the hang of that go
ahead and take your craft and have it
fly the circle around you so you kind of
do this and you're spinning but you're
keeping the back of it always facing
towards you and go ahead and just do
that for as many batteries as it takes
to become confident don't go too fast
you get a little dizzy I just became but
yes that's a fun one and then finally we
have built up to the very last step step
in our basic beginners flying exercises
and that is called walking the dog
Darien keeps on recommending in these
episodes but he hasn't showed me until
now so this is a really fun one this is
really cool so basically you're building
on all of those previous steps that
you'll want to hover the quadcopter at
about chest level several feet from the
group from you right in front of you and
then you want to go for a stroll so you
can walk a figure eight around trees you
can walk a figure eight around other
obstacles all the while keeping the
craft at about chest level with its back
facing you but facing you and then this
will have you making those minut
throttle and those role adjustments to
keep it hovering while applying you on
pitch to keep it going forward and then
turning so you're applying everything
else yeah
and I must say when I first started
flying I spent days just walking the dog
and becoming proficient in it and you
know I would say maybe keep a logbook of
your flight times that's a good way to
track your learning progress it is like
I literally wanted to have a hundred
hours before I did FPV because I wanted
to know that I mean there's no like it's
not like flight school it's not like
getting a real pilot's license there's
thankfully I guess you could say we
don't live in that kind of a world yet
but dude just don't jump right into the
deep end you know spend some time with
this this is the number one most single
helpful exercise that I used when I
learned to fly and it lends itself to so
many fun variations too because you'll
get a little bored try psych some low
flying with that some high flying but
you'll notice that if you ever have in
an emergency where you need to bring a
quadcopter back down to you to safety
you're gonna find it these movements
very instinctive so just be sure that
you do enough practice so that it is
just like second nature like walking the
dog so I think that's it for our
absolute beginner basics and we have
plenty of homework until next week when
we actually take it to the next level
because we're gonna get even more
advanced so I just want to emphasize how
important practice is so just be sure to
get a bunch of batteries go at your own
pace take it take your time because
these are the fundamentals that the rest
of your piloting career will be built on
so there's no need to fly through them
haha I see what you did there
all right well anyway also keep in mind
say
again things get all wrong just drop the
throttle gravity will always have you
landing and and let me tell you I I
don't crash I just land real hard right
you know if you start flying in an empty
field and then suddenly a half hour
later dog walkers show up keep a
respectful distance you know find
another field the last thing you want to
do is endanger someone or have your
quadcopter chased and eaten by fluffy
right and remember again you don't need
to build a quadcopter like ours to learn
to fly even though it's really fun and I
recommend it because it's super awesome
and you can totally customize things but
typically it's recommended that you find
a toy like the cyma or the hubsan or
other other wax is another good one yeah
there's a bunch out there I'll put some
links in the show notes the controls on
most of them are identical to the big
ones that you will be building
eventually I hope so the muscle memory
will translate completely and you should
be fine going from one to another yeah
no I mean I learned on Hobson and you
know throttles on the left and you know
pitch and roll are on the right it makes
sense and so you know the only thing
changes at the crafts kit and the
current transmitters get bigger but
otherwise yeah I should probably also
throw it that people also like to learn
with simulators I haven't personally had
that experience although I will see you
used to play flight Sims like crazy okay
yeah more or less learning ATC calls
with the flight Sims but that's neither
here nor there but it's a Rosasco also
if you are ever on that sim I was
November Oscar whiskey Bravo fury 3
November echo whiskey Bravo yeah sorry
I'm a noob point was the point was that
this is this is just a lot of fun and I
want you guys just take your own pace
and and have fun with it
that it really keeps mentioning I have
one of these I can't find it in the
warehouse right now but the turnigy 9x
is another fantastic flight
transmitter and it's USB will hook up to
a computer and you can do awesome
there's some open-source simulators out
there so I want to throw that out there
if you want to just go ahead and eat
it's a great way to practice on a rainy
day if you don't have the warehouse to
fly through or if you want to fly
