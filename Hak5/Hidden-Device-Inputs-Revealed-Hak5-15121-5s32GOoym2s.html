by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen I am Shannon
waters this is your weekly dose of
Technol s yes and should should we say
goodbye we should say goodbye once and
for all to the gym to the joke and we
loved you jib you were huge I hit my
head on you several times we should have
a b-roll shout right now so you
understand again it's just in the way I
remember when you first got this thing
and I was just like how are we gonna fit
that in this room roars it's like a Wang
so
um actually no it goes back to season
one we were like dude we should get a
ship yes
yeah so we did now we're saying goodbye
to the jib and we will introduce you
guys to the new hak5 stripper pole as
soon as that is installed but we are
very excited to be going vertical cheers
to tear it cheers to the jib yes we
loved you too thank you for your hard
work
also to Sarah for her hard work moving
the gym that's a camera crane and uh
bt-dubs to the ones that care love and
Christine is a delicacy here in the bay
uh steagle by steagle radler yeah well
the render is a type of steagle steel
company okay so it's a steagle Radler
it's a German because of you sub here's
cheers to you yes miss you um yeah we've
dude I'm so excited we got a great
episode yeah what's going on this
episode well had a fantastic time torque
on sands a snub zboob other than that so
sad I was just running away with the
ducky so yeah I better sing weird yeah
it's funny too cuz they were there are
only ducks at Derby con and they're only
pineapples at torque on so there you go
yeah I should probably stop stealing
those things from you guys these connect
what's hid your job so um we had an
awesome pleasure to meet up with Kyle
Osbourne as well as Mike Osman who I
like to call yeah lovingly
Cosmin they are a dynamic duo I wish
that you could have been there to see if
if torque on releases the videos that's
the one to watch because it was
fantastic seeing them play
for each other and I hope that some of
that comes through in this interview
that I'm about to throw to where they
basically took causes research from last
time where you know with that awesome
cable and doing nasty things from one
Android to it phone to another
absolutely abused a side channel attack
that I didn't even know is in the spec
and who did it's amazing so I'm just
going to throw that Wow let's check it
out
hey guys I'm still here at Oregon 2013
The Hangover wore off and look who I
found
it's kind of worn in like Osman The
Hangover is just beginning
you guys like just threw down some
really ridiculously awesome stuff walk
us through why we should care about
multiplexing instead of just attacking a
USB stack well every partner hello every
modern smartphone and tablet these days
has some practical flex wire interface
whether it's USB cord or at home Jack
there's something connected there's
something you can connect that will
behave in with you might not it's
mentally pipe we were showing yesterday
doing something other than USB over USB
port and it's it's like there's an
attack service there that people
recognize you know you recognize that
there's an attack this tech service
broke like a USB stack when you connect
to the youth network but there is less
awareness I think that there's even a
greater tech surface than after their
branches you can take other than just
public function so give some examples of
them sorry I'm gonna move over here to
but give you some examples of how some
ports might be duplicated with different
functionality that maybe we take for
granted and have that like aha like oh
right
a headphone jack is more than for just
stereo audio yeah so I think that the
main ones are interfaces for programming
devices are debugging places so there
will be a debug port usually a serial
interface that that you can use to like
get a deep part in your interactive
debugger or a shell or some kind of
interface that allows you to like load
new software onto the device those kinds
of things and you know we and we've seen
those on both headphone jacks man
it was features you guys are talking
about like the IP old iPhone shuffle or
iPhone zombie yeah they have you have
fun1
oh yeah iPod shuffle where you know you
can load the music over that special
it's like USB on one end and headphone
on the other this is it was this
building on top of the stuff that we
were talking about last year at tour
camp that you were doing cause uh yeah
actually a little bit of it came from I
wanted to know how much for you you
could get without a TV and we happen to
stumble across our needs into the
ability to enable or get shell on device
in some cases without which you know
made it from a better because now we
don't have to worry about whether or not
ATP is in April right because if ABB is
enabled on my phone and you've got your
toolkit running you've got some awesome
cable of some sort that allows you to
hear coming in my phone
what does that enable you to do yeah so
if you do have a TV enabled then you can
do all sorts of fun stuff there with
some stipulation now actually Google has
caught on I figured out that lady be
enabled is kind of an issue and you do
need some sort of okay from the user but
in the past when a TV was enabled use to
actually be able to do all sorts of fun
things such as we're walking the screen
doing all the user context skewing all
me okay pretty much any of the data on
the phone itself right so it was
incredibly powerful and so now that you
know ABB is locked down if you only
there was a way to re-enable it how do
you start going about looking at say
these connectors and realizing that
there are other modes that they can get
into rather than just about its USB port
doesn't go right to the USB stack well
if there's a there's a separate multi
question I see on these devices between
the connector and whatever you'd expect
it to be plugging between USB connector
and USB device or with with the
multiplexer it actually kind of becomes
akin to like a network socket right you
have 480 480 this unnecessarily always
need to be HTTP same as you know 4 1 2 3
4 be anything you want you may get HTTP
you can make it a selfie book or or you
can make it my sequel or whatever you
want all right so it's kind of a kin to
that yeah so I think that's those are
examples of like you know virtual or
software multiplex functions in this
case we have a hardware multiplex
function with an actual chip that's
trying to detect what device is plugged
in and you know I'm switching the court
physically to a different function so
how would you switch the port physically
like talking about USB how do i plug
something in there and it recognized oh
this isn't necessarily a typical USB
client device does it say talk to it
over the USB protocol and then switch
into a different mode later or how's
that work no it isn't really talking
over the USB protocol in all the cases
that we've seen it's using the ID
most recent addition to the pan out of
USB connectors and originally the ID pin
was added kind of Orion multiplex
function where where for on-the-go USB
only go so you could apply by depending
on how you what you plug into that pin
you could either pause the device to
operate as a device or cause it to
operate as a host but now they've
started with these multiplexer I've
seized the they've started detecting
more than just two states on an ID pen
and they detect a particular resistance
between the ID and ground so all we have
to do to try to invoke one of these
different modes is they take a fixed
resistor and a value of our choice and
plug it in and two we get and so what
are those values and what do they get
you well in our talk we show
multiplexer I see this I see that adds
this big table of all these different
resistances that it can detect and kind
of some idea of what function that might
be although what exact what that it
really gets us depends a lot on you know
which multiplexer I see is installed how
what's connected to on the circuit board
in the Terek target device and also on
the configuration of the software like
the operating system right the the
kernel ever talked about to it so like
what we do is we just do something like
like this what is this look at here so
this is just a homemade device and an
adapter that's just made out of a couple
of development boards or just breakout
boards and it's just a USB micro
connector that we plug into our target
and and then it has this little resistor
here so we just saw her in or just
leveraging the IP to drown and then it's
connected to this serial interface
the ppl you are so basically it's just a
run-of-the-mill serial adapter that we
can plug into our laptop and control the
only thing unusual about it is that it
uses a USB connector instead of a
difficult serial connector and it passes
one resistor at it on and then that's a
hard-coded resistant that's not
potentiometer or anything just switch
between modes because you found the mode
that deals with you art so you are
obviously serial serial TTL cause that
brings me to you tell me about your love
affair with serial haha so as I review
as everybody will be astounded in my
talk I've never actually had to make
with serial on I never dialed off $20
but sadly I haven't actually a 56k modem
maybe but uh nothing like that so I
spent a lot of a lot of time want me to
figure out the best ways of like a
transferring data across these serial
connections in a consensus consistent
way and since I've never had any you
know actual experience with that I
should wasted a lot of times on stantly
trying to push over these you know even
just for junk kilobytes of data and I I
don't even I can't I don't know I don't
I tell you how do you work
it's just super inconsistent maybe maybe
it's the the board that we have was born
the chipset on the phone itself or
something but I just have a very hard
time with it okay so I'm picking with
the scenario here you said the phones
within you are we've got the phone so um
you plug in through the USB are you
getting like a direct shell on the
device are you getting a bootloader with
what do you end up with yeah so you
actually get done you've got a lot of
interesting things if you reboot the
phone while you're plugged in you
actually simulate Euler sequence and
there are some potential capabilities in
there I believe
pause the sequence or two restarted once
you're past that part you actually get
dropped into like a monitor mode in
kernel space and you get a curl message
of output and a few other interesting
things from there is depending on the
phone if you interfere times you
actually get a debug interface it
actually responds with you but with a
debug prompt type hell but it shows you
a few different things you can do the
best things that you can do there is few
kernel messages you either the kernel ID
and see some I guess you maybe you could
use some of the registers to potentially
put something together some theoretical
attacks but really interesting part is
the console command which and some cases
actually drops you directly into a shell
account on the phone so you end up being
like what root that Android or what do
you get so you get a lower level shell
user account and unfortunately for us it
doesn't give you the same permissions
you would get if you were through a name
yet this is because when you go through
a TV your user inherits some of the
groups that adb has so it allows you to
ask to see s code card allows you to
access when a user gave a few other
interesting things and you're a very
limited interface this is your hope at
this point to be able to like push over
an apk and execute it or what are you
trying to achieve at that point
