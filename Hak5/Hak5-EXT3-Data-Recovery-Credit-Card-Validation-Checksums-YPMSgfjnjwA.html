by Jackthreads
janan before we check port 110 I just
wanted to mention it was watching your
segment there and I noticed that over on
distrowatch Oh what's this ubuntu is
actually dropped 2098 HPD points and
mint is now in the lead yeah right above
boo to fedora dead man's shoes I mean
it's there's good point there you know
like you can't fight progress obviously
things are going to improve and it may
not be what you want it to be but
there's alternatives and that's the
beautiful thing about Phoenix is you
don't have to run gnome or unity there's
fluxbox there's Katie either's roll your
own yeah okay maybe that one's not it's
easier than an option I'm actually
thinking about moving arch I'm getting a
little tired of arch arch linux seems
like it might be the one for me because
I'm getting a little tired of a new
manager than what seriously the more
that I use is more like I don't want a
window manager oh it just puts it
fluxbox and stay on debian apt-get
install fun all right what do you want
me to go to the emails yes the first one
is from triple-a he or she writes what
hypervisor do you use when you run back
track in a virtual machine i'm trying to
use vmware server on a Windows 7 host
and not liking how the USB alpha Wi-Fi
card is virtualized it's sometimes flaky
hmm yeah so USB virtualization in either
virtual box or VMware is kind of just a
pain in the ass and honestly I don't see
a reason why like with all the major
gestures now having really easy ways to
boot off of USB there's no reason why
you shouldn't just run it on the bare
metal because you're going to get so
much better performance especially with
backtrack 5 the latest version you're
going to see it's just going to be way
better of an experience if you're
running it on the bare metal because the
kinds of things that you're wanting to
do with a hacker OS are the things where
the hacker OS needs your hardware so
while yes there's a vmdk of backtrack 5
they can just download from backtrack
linux org and you can you can do the
pass-through I agree it is flaky
sometimes with you know I mean even that
being my favorite USB Wi-Fi adapter we
have it in the store it's great except
you
no your mileage may vary and there's no
reasonable you can't just dual boot off
of it or just boot off a USB or micro SD
card yeah cool all right this next one
is kind of a roundup not so much a
question so interrupt me if you have any
comment well because we pose the
question to the audience last week yes
we did let me log back in here I need to
stop at her Shh all right this next
roundup is starts off with Chris from
data rescue labs com he wrote in about
our recent question of recovering data
and EXT partitions he suggests test
discs it should recover most common
partitions if that fails carving tools
such as scalpel could work or a windows
tool file sig called simple Carver but
it's not free access data ftk could do
this as well or even X way forensics
tool Chris owns a small data recovery
company and is cce certified so I'd say
there are good places to start as well
the next one is Paul Alexander asz
league tell it five ed in a ton others
also highly recommended the test is
suite of tools from cg security org its
license licensed under the lgpl as well
what source is fun yay and finally the
last one is PVR 2002 he likes the boon
to wiki for a list of free recover tools
will have all the mention links in our
show notes at hak5 org nice we also get
another very interesting email from
Patrick remember we're talking about how
you wanted to remove your credit card
number from xbox live well Patrick
writes in catching up on some older
shows and listening to Stubb's talking
about her credit card gone from the xbl
or the xbox live market whatever it is
and X being able to put it all zeros
well he says this depends on whether
they're actually doing initial about a
verification on your credit card but if
the if they're just checking that it's a
valid number and he says that you should
read up on this interesting thing called
mod 10 it's actually the Luhn algorithm
or sometimes known as module 10 it's
basically a very simple checksum
algorithm that's used to check whether
credit card
it's used by like Social Security
numbers and the US and canada it's used
for imei numbers it's basically a very
simple and quick sanity check to see
whether a number conforms to a
specification and he points out that the
number 4 11 was as yeah the visa I'm
gonna give you a visa credit card number
ready for 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 10
glasses can I get passes the mod 10
check and you know he says that massacre
it is five I believe you exactly this is
we just point out that that if I and the
thing about amex is at seven but it's
like one digit less yes and the rest of
them yeah and who is six is a MasterCard
anyway discover discover see you know
this cuz you used to work yeah yeah
that's how I always knew if they were
Banking with us because the first like
six digits where for our specific yeah
the first digit is is it a visa as a
mastercard whatever and then as you go
down the digits it goes like I want to
say region and then bank at once yeah
it's something like it yeah ours was
like for 20 000 or something like that
and it was for 495 yeah 9004 954 495
9000 cuz i still have credit cards with
them i'm not gonna give you the rest of
the digits but anyway um anyway he says
that unless they're using like the
method of actually pre authorizing it by
like taking a dollar a dollar and all
the back end yeah then in most cases you
should be able to get away with just
filling it in with all of that data and
yet he goes on to talk about mastercard
being a five discover being a 6am at
being a 79 being reserved for like gas
cards and five cards and things of that
nature but i thought that was pretty
interesting I as i was reading it
occurred to me that oh wait a second you
could just go and get one of those
prepaid Visa cards that you find at
least here in the states i mentioned
that's what yeah and just use one of
them about it use the numbers off that i
have a friend that also told me that i
could try a prepaid card so yeah i have
options yeah also my card is expiring
january well then
problem might just be so problem solved
yeah Honda Jason's question all right
jason said in Episode nine ten Shannon
recommended fast some for calculating
md5 checksums and windows however I'd
like to recommend hash tab a free
program for windows also available for
Mac once its installed when you
right-click a file and then select
properties there will now be a file
hashes tab included which calculates
numerous types of checksums and hashes
it can even compare files easily from
within the same tab it is available at
the following address and we'll put that
in the show notes and yeah that's
awesome that's nice yeah or you can also
just google hashtag yay we like a cool
