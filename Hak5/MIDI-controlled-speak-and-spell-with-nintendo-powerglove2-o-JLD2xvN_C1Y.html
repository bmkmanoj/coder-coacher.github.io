front of us is the power glove but it's
not so much the glove itself that you
worked on as it is this little plastic
box do anything in here basically what
this box is is it's an interface that
you plug the power glove into the
old-school Nintendo Power glove and the
port right there yep and it converts
position information from the glove to
MIDI and sends it on to other
instruments and in our case also the
Speak and Spell nice now okay you've got
like a thousand different ports on here
so I was just wondering like obviously
this is Nintendo this is obviously MIDI
out now we've got this little thing here
and this here and that there what are
they well this box is like a pretty
hacked up on it used to be a hawk in
jail it used to be an actual like turbo
add-on box for the old NES that I had
when I was a kid anyway um the actual
processor inside here is a pic
microcontroller which is pretty common
you guys might have used it in other
projects aha so there's a addition to
the MIDI and the Nintendo there's a
programming port that lets me update the
code she's a show you running in the yet
it's running the microcontroller there's
a power port and there's a in my case
actually also have a serial port on here
that I used when I was debugging and
making sure that I was getting my power
glove message is okay all right this
wasn't originally you said designed for
no no this circuit is pretty hacked up
to this is actually a completely
different pic circuit that I'd used for
a different project and I just sort of I
put the whole circuit board from the
other project inside this box and wired
everything to it so it looks like it
looks like a real mess but I will uh
I'll get a schematic for you guys for
your website so to make a
more sense to be clearer for everybody
okay that's cool because you got like
the serial port tuned oh well no we're
ready yeah it's just kind of hanging out
ok so this translates data now what
what's generating the data from the
power glove how does that work the power
glove actually generates the data on the
power glove is in two parts there's the
glove itself and there's a sensor array
and the way the glove works is it
measures the position of the glove
itself relative to the sensor array
which is ultrasonic so it just does
these distance measurements there's
basically a computer in the glove
triangulates where it is from the
distance measurements and puts together
this packet called a high-res mode
packet the glove can output a lot of
different kinds of data but we're
interested in the high res 3d position
data so basically what the interface
does is it finds the x y&amp;amp;z position of
the glove in that high res packet and
converts that in the case of our demo
today just into MIDI notes but it can
convert it into any kind of data that
can be sent across the MIDI cable so we
can control synthesizers we could
control performance parameters we can
control lighting with it we could do any
performance art installations nice so
anything that you could ever do on a
MIDI network you can do with love you
can have it well in our case we can
program the the microcontroller in the
interface to do whatever we want with
the information ok so you've shown us
how the power glove works and how we get
midi from that and how we get midi from
the Speak &amp;amp; Spell but at this point
guard can you show us how everything
works when it go comes together and
makes a big happy MIDI circle sure we'll
take a look at that out thanks
okay so now we've got everything hooked
together and right now what you're
looking at in his lap if you're looking
at his love is a MIDI instrument this is
actually a mini musical instrument right
here and this has been plugged into the
Speak and Spell and ran through the
sound system in here so if we were to
hit a key say that one we are now
hearing the Speak and Spell like bits
and pieces from the wrong playing
through stereo so like this is basically
the first half of ARA glove to speak and
spell crossover project this is the
first half of it here this is getting
the Speak &amp;amp; Spell to actually make some
noise from some MIDI data to actually
interface with the median for that whole
that side of the plane to come together
not love it when a plan comes together I
mean like this is really exciting that
we've been sitting playing with it it's
so much fun you know my internal
four-year-old is pretty ecstatic with
this whole project it's like a giant toy
it is a big giant babies like throwback
toy which has been melded together with
modern-day equipment but that's just so
much fun so should we take a look at the
glove part yeah well we go ahead and do
that and so since we've got a musical
device making funky sams now we're going
to take an alcohol device and actually
playback musical notes yep all right
let's go hook that thing up and then
any plan come together and it will be so
nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
