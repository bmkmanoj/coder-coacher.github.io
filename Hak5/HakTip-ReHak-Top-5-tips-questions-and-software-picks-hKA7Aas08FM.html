welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Shannon Morse and today I'm going
over your top five tips questions and
software picks so let's go ahead and get
started first of all is Gabriel Gabriel
writes hey folks I am loving these hack
tips they are far more digestible and
make me feel like less of a newb than
actual hack 5 I do love hack 5 - but
these tips make it awesome to do in my
spare time anyway I was a little
confused as to how Shannon got
VirtualBox to run from a USB I've run
VirtualBox on both Mac and Windows 7 and
can't get either to boot from a USB
Drive even with the guest additions am I
missing something dumb please don't
judge me keep up the awesome work that's
a very good question
booting from a USB in VirtualBox is kind
of the hack direct booting from a USB
device isn't ordinarily possible as
VirtualBox doesn't support USB in the
BIOS that said using the Box managed
command you can convert a physical disk
on your machine say like a USB Drive
into a VMDK which VirtualBox can boot
off of as a hard drive that's all there
is to it as far as the VM is concerned
it's a hard drive now the command for
Windows is the box managed space
internal commands create raw disk create
raw VMDK tack file name which is the
file that you want to save the USB Drive
as dot VMDK tack raw disk and the
physical drive ID which you can find
under disk management so in theory you
could use this to boot as a mirror image
off of your hard drive but I haven't
gotten that crazy with it yet thank you
for writing in Brit writes just wanted
to say how much I love the show I was
wondering if you have any ideas about
running a virtual honeypot on a virtual
machine is there any reason that it
should work different when running it on
its own machine what about security risk
since it's running through your machine
well we haven't actually covered honey
pots on hack
yet but we totally should right there I
know Darren has been meaning to he's a
fan of the tool honey D which comes
pre-installed in backtrack 5 under
exploitation tools social engineering
tools and honey pops when using it on a
virtual machine for the most part it
wouldn't be different than running it on
its own machine the only thing you have
to watch out for is this hypervisor
exploit which is to say an exploit that
lets malicious code break out of the
virtual machine and attack the host
which is never a good thing these are
pretty rare but they are pretty scary
when they happen if you're really
paranoid you might just want to put your
honey pot on a DMZ outside your normal
LAN or on another network completely
when we have their crack the code
challenges on hack 5 we use a dedicated
cable modem line for this exact reason
it's not that we don't trust you guys
with our office Lin but you know I'm
just saying so thank you Brett for
writing in now in just a bit I'll be
right back with a couple more quick
emails including your software pitches
but first let's take a quick break most
guys hate shopping for clothes but

a few software recommendations first off
Nick writes I love the show Thank You
Nick
just watched your system booster episode
and I just wanted to recommend saluto to
speed up startup time it's a brilliant
program next up Josh wrote in to
recommend desk space 3d in my opinion
it's better than the Expo which I had
tried for a little while it gives you
six virtual desktops much like you get
on a Linux OS and it also has an
awesomely fast and surprisingly not at
all buggy 3d cube effect I got to try
that out it's very similar to what comp
is Desktop effects for Linux has to
offer that sounds pretty cool
and finally dudes rights I recently came
across an awesome hard drive free disk
based reporting software which in
addition to being super sexy hmm okay
is even easier to use than the other
free alternatives out there this one is
called space sniffer
so thank you to Nick Josh and it's I'll
link up salute Odessa face 3d and space
sniffer in our show notes now for you
guys what programs or scripts are rockin
your world hit me up at tips at hack 5
org and be sure to check out our sister
show hack 5 for more great stuff just
like this I'll be there reminding you to
trust your techno list
