metasploit cause tossed cross-site
scripting smartphone apps Brad from 11-1
sends a balloon across the pond and
Darren pipes a thing into a thing and
make something happen all that and more
at this time on hak5 this segment of
hak5 is brought to you by dice hello and
welcome to hack five my name is darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse I'm not
feeling so well so I noticed just to
know I'm feeling great I'm in debug mode
I had some sweet tarts and some candy
beforehand you know there was somebody
at Derby Khan who had a huge jar of
those little lollipops I swear to God I
must be eaten like half of them oh I see
so you got you got candy you get like a
sugar high from Derby con and I got a
cold from Derby con I had a fantastic
time at Derby Connie did you know as
well it was so much fun I got to work
the table in the vending area again kind
of like DEFCON but it was a lot it was
more laid back well it was totally
southern you knows i am date yes yeah oh
my god we went out to dinner and I had
sweet tea and grits shrimp and grits
okay well I had a fantastic time I know
that we're going to be coming back to
this conference um definitely thankfully
like it's just been conference
back-to-back we actually have a segment
from HD more at the United Security
Summit in just a bit that was here in
San Francisco and then we were der beek
on and then I thankfully or actually
unfortunately we won't be able to make
it to torque on this weekend so that'll
actually free up some of the cons stuff
but then we will so we'll have to hit up
torque on next year for sure I guess the
next one's going to be shmoocon so you
know look forward to that on the East
Coast in DC it's late afternoon shmoocon
oh yes yes as well oh just when I
thought it was anyway oh you need to go
bed yeah go take a nap yeah you know
some really exciting stuff has been
happening with the USB rubber ducky
project since we just launched it a week
already like I think okay so actually a
whole lotta tap into if you haven't been
on the forms seeing all the good stuff
there to all at USB rubber
k Commons where you can find links to
everything but a sorbic wrote I just had
to show this off because this is so cool
he wrote this this rubber ducky I ve and
I can like be like Ram Darren is cool
and then like string hello world and
then enter and then like alt f4 and then
because I don't want to save the file
there we are and then I just click quack
and oh hey look at this it downloaded
and inject that Ben it's also fantastic
no I didn't even have to use job it's
okay in fact well he's even done is
added like additional commands into the
i guess like unofficial ducky script
stuff but uh repeat 10 which is like
when Pete and repeat are sitting on a
log and then Pete falls off and then all
that's left is repeat right and Pete
sitting on it we've got good stuff this
episode uh casa was us to talk about
cross-site scripting oh yeah the gift is
whoa whoa well read the rest of stuff on
yeah yeah all right well we got this in
the mail I'll let you open up oh hey
it'll box it's Andros rig hey so this
comes from Craig in Wisconsin he says
Darren and shanna and I thought you two
would get a kick out of this I have
enclosed for you guys the original
before Microsoft took this over yeah AKA
killed it it is xandros sorry about the
condition of the box i would love to see
if you guys can work some linux magic or
hack or revive this as well as to see if
you guys can update the operating system
well help to all who you think that this
is a dead linux operating system unless
it's truly do a so can it be updated can
you guys add a new kernel install the
latest que te or gnome stuff like that
it would be great to see on your show I
am NOT the the first thing that has the
time resources do that but I am
fascinated by this I never really played
was Andres but it leverages a
performance reliability of Linux to
create a secure desktop environment that
breaks down the barriers between
Microsoft Windows and Linux cool it's
got a sweet Fox a constellation
I don't know I don't think this is that
old though I'm not look I you know what
there's some fun good linux stuff coming
out by the time this airs actually two
or even not soon oh yeah it's from after
ten eleven point tons coming out you
should try that out you know what I
agree I could do like a review of it see
what the change is word yeah okay yeah
cool well without further ado I want to
throw that over to our interview with HD
more find out what is going on with
metasploit over at the United Security
Summit and then we'll be on the other
side with more from der beek on and I'll
be debugging hacker headlines and then
it'll be hacker headlines okay it's that
easy word here United security summit
2011 the first one and I'm here with the
founder of medical HD more how are you
I'm doing great Darien how are you how
did it feel good to see you it's so good
to be here see you guys doing a security
conference in San Francisco our own
backyard what brings you out here well
first of all it's a great location we
love the you know one the weather
because Texas is on fire and hundred
five degrees right now but mostly it's
the community and the community in this
area was really one of our target focus
groups for our focus attendees for this
particular conference we're frontage is
a little bit different from most
conferences often you see things like
you know RSA that's very kind of you
know CEO see so cio level you see things
like Def Con that are you know Kwazii
you know less professional more I'm sure
lots professionals go to it's not
necessarily the business topics we're
trying to find something kind of in
between here what's not quite just
business not quite just tactical but it
could mix it both and including people
from both the security vendor side the
business side academia as well as the
researchers and open source developers
so it's a good chance to really bring
together you know the entire all the
various stakeholders and security have
them kind of talk about problems you
know dish it out watched our academics
fight with the business folks and so on
but and generally you know focus on
collaboration focus on you know what are
we doing wrong what we do to make things
better and actually host some
collaborative projects nice what was at
the party last night and the feeling of
that was getting with that everyone was
saying that it was nice and small and
intimate and I hope that you guys can
carry that forward no matter where you
bring this con so tell me metasploit the
big thing with rapid7 we just talked
about next pose but i'm really stoked
about medicine because it's what our
audience loves the weather the community
edition or
oh you guys had a big release and we
hadn't had the chance to talk about it
at Def Con what is the latest with 40
specify for is the first major release
in five years like we spent years trying
to figure out where minutes what I
supposed to go what the direction was
what we saw is that how people were
doing pen test with the product had
changed drastically the last five years
instead of just kind of like dot slash
exploits to get a shell and something is
more about okay I've got a shout on that
one okay I've got five shells not 100
shelves now what and so it's building
out all those automation tools and
covering all those other areas of pen
testing that metasploit previously by
itself didn't do so we have discovery
scanners we've got things like brute
force login tools we've all sorts of
stuff for passive analysis for men in
the middle for you know italian to aps
as well as all the exploits so giving
folks ability to run things you know all
their other you know auxiliary and you
know post models things like that as
part of their pen test in one place and
really striving to consolidate that data
into a single location so previously if
you want to set up metasploit with a
database it was kind of an afterthought
you really had to say or if you going
you get the latest backtrack and you're
like is broken then you got svn and then
you're like oh wait what dependencies
yeah that's like its problems users you
know new users could forget the
appendices experienced users had no use
for the features that require the
dependencies in the first place so we're
trying to find something in the Middle's
what we decided to do is just ship the
Postgres database with the product ship
you know java all the Rays dependencies
all Ruby all the Ruby build scripts
configuration files and Metis boy it's
an operating system it is it is so this
point is its self maintaining it some
point become self-aware and walk off
your machine oh no HD Moore invented
Emacs now so so aside from taking a
taking over your machine this is hot off
the heels of the book the book was huge
I got the book I love the book and then
37 came out like the week after the book
now for o's out what does that mean to
anybody that's you know going through
that guy well the upside is that all the
authors of the book David all those guys
did a lot of spent a lot of time working
with our develop scene to make sure that
the book was actually accurate the only
small change is difference between the
release of the book and the release of
metasploit for is all the database
commands and longer have the DV
underscore prefix so host is now DB host
you know DB loot is now just loot and so
on there you go metasploit four-point-oh
it saves you three characters DB
underscore I mean that's that's worth a
version of itself so although I gotta
say I hear rumors
that there might be a an ASCII cow
missing from this version is that the
case fortunately Rob Fuller was
pervasive enough to insert sad missing a
sea cow back into the product before he
shipped so we had a for release in the
very last minute we got one little cadet
from Robinson you know commit that sir
I'll kill you and it was basically the
missing ascii cow so that's cow is back
where it should be it may have some
additional body appendages but its back
go rob fuller our friend muaks yes
alright so so what else is new with in
the product we're really focusing on
data correlation and basically be able
to consolidate in one place so if you
use the the default installed Metis play
now it automatically configures a
database every single thing you do is
track the side of a work space inside
the project you can outdo automation you
can do things like find every host that
has a certain port open then set the
Argos variable with that that host list
automatically and then to be able to run
your exploits so you want to say like
scan entire network find everything in
port 23 are the 11 exploit it's
literally three commands now that's it
now what about like teams of users is
there any additional functionality of
you know you and your three other pen
testers are all working on the same host
there is but it slipped you the open
source the commercial side I tried to
you know do too much product pitching
but meh despite pro is awesome for teams
it has you know a limited user County
can have them collaborating the multiple
pendous at the same time it's just it's
amazing product for for team well I mean
but that does make sense like that makes
a lot of sense for the differentiation
between the open source community
edition and the pro product to be like
dude if you've got like multiple pen
testers on a single job then obviously
you're getting paid here and you know
shell out for some good product right
this couple ways do it so on the open
source I'd Armitage has a pretty good
mostly user capabilities which is great
we think that's awesome on the pro side
really folks not just multi-user but
also the fancy reporting the automation
the workflow although you know
accountability all the audit logs all
the cya Stephanie for pen testing so
it's a little bit of both if you want
just collaboration kind of a team mode
of the IRC client mode Armitage is
awesome for that with no sweat for I
love that it's IRC collaboration as well
because that's the hacker way to do it
it's literally an IRC client baked and
armitage that's a great way to do it on
the mediswipe pro sites a little bit
more formal more corporate more official
but it scales much higher and it does a
lot more things that you know nothing
else really does at this point and i
guess the difference is you're getting
paid so dude thank you so much it's
