down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm Shannon
Morse and today I'm discovering
processes now like any operating system
Linux can multitask and it does so with
processes an organizational tool used to
decide what programs can use the CPU at
what time if a program isn't responding
right or if you want to switch CPU power
to another program you can do so with
the terminal now to get an idea of how
this works let's start with boot up you
boot up your machine in the kernel
starts and processes labeled as init
scripts I NIT these start other services
that are called daemon programs these
programs hang out in the background just
doing their thing with no interaction
from you and parent processes can in
turn watch other programs called child
processes keep that in mind as well now
all processes are organized with a
process ID a pin in it is always hid one
of course and processes also have owner
files owners just like files do now to
view processes all you have to type is
PS PS bt-dubs
all it shows is the processes associated
with your current terminal the bash in
PS now the pit is the process ID the TTY
which is the second column right here is
the teletype or controlling terminal of
the process time over here is how much
time is consumed by the CPU for that
process and then CMD of course is the
current command fashioned PS now type PS
X and that is a really long command
this tells PS to show all processes not
just what's in the terminal the question
mark and I'll scroll up here so you can
see it very long list
okay so we have pit TTY stat time and
command this question mark right here
that shows that there is no terminal
associated with that process this new
column over here called
stat stands for state it is the status
of the process it can be are for running
s for sleeping t for stopped and for low
priority a lowercase L means
multi-threaded and so on
so you'll see a lot under here with SL
that means it's sleeping and it's
multi-threaded you can also type PS ox
to see even more information so I'll go
back down to the bottom and type PS ox
and this gives you plenty more
information on each of these now if I go
back to the top where you can see the
list of the columns using this you get
to see the user ID at the beginning
route the CPU usage the PID of course
the memory usage this V S Z is actually
the virtual memory size RSS is the
physical memory used
it's called resident set size and then
start which means when the process was
started so it actually gives you the
date right there now you can use the man
page to see all the other options that
you can use with PS and there are plenty
so definitely take some time to go look
at those now do you want to see actual
dynamic views of your machines processes
you probably do so you can use a command
called top and this gives you a nice
column nice layout of everything that is
going on on your machine it continuously
updates the processes activity to
remember it like do like I do and just
think top displays the top processes
there you go now by default the top
sections section shows you an overview
and the columns are sorted by the CPU
activity so you'll see the heaviest ones
up here at the top now let's look at the
top section first of course the name of
it is top that's the program the numbers
of tar the time and the day so 17 47 40
that's what time of day it is up 22 43
that means my computer's uptime is 22
hours and 43 minutes that is way too
long I should probably restart my
machine users of course the number of
users that are currently using the
machine and then load average the
process is waiting to run this is listed
first by average for one min
then five then 15 and if this number
these numbers are under 1.0 that means
the machine isn't loaded so you're
probably running your CPU just fine at
the moment so you can see mine all mine
are under one I'm doing just fine the
second row down here under tasks all
this right here that shows me what's
running what's sleeping what's stopped
what's in Zombie mode so I'm just doing
just fine right there have quite a few
sleeping CPU percentages of course now
that information is a little bit
different the percentage of CPU used for
the user process is first us as user the
next one you have is for the system the
percentage after that is nice
aka low priority processes and then you
have idle and processes waiting for
input and output underneath this we have
the memory
it shows the memory usage and swap which
shows the swap space you can hit H for
help for the help screen for more
information or you can press Q to quit
and I'll clear that screen there we go
alright now what do you guys use to
track your processes there are whole
lots of options out there and I'm going
to delve a lot more into detail about
how you can actually edit the processes
and close them in the next hack tip
coming up now make sure to email me tips
at hack 5 org with your thoughts or you
can comment below about what you think
and what you guys use and be sure to
check out our sister show hack 5 for
more great stuff just like this I'll be
there and check out our new show
throughout wire for internet privacy and
security news at youtube.com slash tech
feed I'll be over there too
