support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show will we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are going
over operating system detection in nmap
now this is really really cool and map
has the power to tell you what operating
system and services a remote target is
running by decoding the deep data that a
system responds with after nmap sends
out of some kind of probe this process
is called tcp/ip fingerprinting now
let's go ahead and start with the
simplest of these which is TAC o for
this example I would type in there we go
after I log in to my computer I would
type in sudo because this is a root
command tech capital o after nmap and
then whatever my target is so for this
example I'm going to use 10 dot 73 dot
31.6 oops I spelled that wrong and nap
there we go all right when the target is
scanned and map is going to tell you
what operating system it's running now
if you want to you can also attack V
which is for verbose to this command to
show you more information that nmap
requires so in this example if I go down
to the bottom it gives me the MAC
address of my target device type and
what operating system and service it is
running so I can see that it's running
Linux 2.4 dot X that's pretty cool now
sometimes nmap isn't able to determine
what operating system the target is
using so for my usual example where I
use dot 1 for 5 and I run the same
command there we go
you'll see up at the top it says no
exact operating system match for host if
you know what operating system is
running on it go to nmap org slash
submit so there's a few minor details
for this so you can sum
the output to the nmap fingerprint and
correction page on their website and
there's a link for that down below if
this happens and you just happen to know
what operating system is actually
running this will actually help
nmap become better and better over time
as soon as they bring out you know new
versions of nmap as thousands and
thousands of operating systems exist and
not each and every one is found in the
end map guide now if you want to use and
map to just guess what a target is
running you can also do that as well if
you want to you know just play around
with it
so for the usual example that I use the
ten dot 73 31 one four five I would type
in nmap tap capital o and then tack tack
or - - OS scan - guess and whatever my
target is so if I use the same one
whoops got to add sudo to it it's going
to run this command so when you run this
command it's going to show you its
guesses up at the top so up here it'll
say aggressive operating system guesses
most likely it's running linux 2.6 dot
17 95% and it'll go down with
percentages as it shows you all the
different guesses that it has and of
course if you do know that example you
can always upload that to the nmap
website - now for some reason you can
also use this one that's - - fuzzy
instead of the - - OS scan - guess if
you want why they choose fuzzy I have no
clue but you can use that option if you
want to now I have a couple more
operating system detection options to
check out but let's go ahead and take a
quick break for our sponsor the hack
shop is hack 5s premier store for all of
your pen testing needs including one of
my favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and it types
like a keyboard it can type scripts into
a computer
crazy crazy fast like this week's
favorite of mine from 36.9 9n in the
forums again who has an awesome payload
that you can check out so this one is
called the porn prank yeah I just said
porn it'll create a folder on the user's
desktop called
porn and it will fill it with troll
faces because why not go ahead and break
all your co-workers and put porn folders
on their desktop I'm totally going to do
that - Darren don't tell him now we
couldn't do the show without your
support so we'd like to thank you with
something special use the coupon code
snubz with any order for your very own
signed hacked tip sticker thank you so
much for supporting the show again we
couldn't do it without you
we're back and it's time for more
operating system detection options let's
go ahead and start out with this first
one for service versions for this
example I'd type in nmap tak s capital V
and then my target and it'll go ahead
and run that command so this one runs a
little bit slow but it's going to tell
you what service version the target is
running if you find that you aren't
getting the output that you thought you
would you can always make this verbose
so for this example I would use kind of
the same thing but after SB I would type
in tak tak and then version trace Ram
and then hit enter now this one is
definitely a lot longer but it's going
to give you all sorts of extra
information to show you what kind of
versions that you are running now if I
scroll back to the top right there we
see over here after service it says I'm
running version Samba SMB d3x workgroup
titled workgroup very very cool
so it definitely works now lastly my
very last community is called the RPC
scan or remote procedure call which uses
the tack s capital art option this
displays information about services
called our pcs which are commonly used
in Linux systems for the network file
system service often times this RPC
service is going to be used to make a
client and a server function and
communicate correctly to each other so
all the data gets transmitted properly
so for this example I would type in
something like n map and then tack s are
10
at 73 and then well target and then
press enter.now here in the hak5 studio
we don't really have anything running
our PCs so we can't show you the exact
output but if you were running anything
with our PCs running on their services
you would see it right underneath the
name of the port state and service and
it will give you a little bit of
information about what number our PC it
is running now that's about it for port
scanning what would you like to see next
about nmap I've been having a lot of fun
with it so let me know send me a comment
below or email us at tips at hack 5 org
and be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 over at hak5 org for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
