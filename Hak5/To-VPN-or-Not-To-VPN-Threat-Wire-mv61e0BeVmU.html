again and the cia's marble framework was
used to hide their hacks all that coming
up now on threat wire greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for April 4th 2017 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom first off with special
thanks to our patrons for supporting the
show each and every month if you want
access to extras make sure you hit up
patreon.com slash threat wire for more
information by now you have probably
heard that both the Senate and the House
of Representatives in the United States
voted to abolish FCC privacy rules that
were going to go into effect earlier
this month I reported on this till I
basically couldn't speak anymore and by
earlier this month I mean March and if
you are still curious check out our
previous episodes all about this topic
today I would like to discuss VPNs in
obfuscation much of the online media
industry is touting to secure yourself
with a VPN but they don't necessarily go
into the depth of how they work or why
and all of a sudden they're backtracking
on their recommendations and saying it
might not be worth it if you would like
to learn more about how and why to use a
VPN check out my episodes over on hack 5
where we have built our own servers for
secure browsing so should you use a VPN
I have continually told folks yes
absolutely
VPNs are a great way to secure your
traffic while you are traveling while
you're on a public network and as a
surefire way to keep your ISP from
knowing what you're doing on the net so
why are folks now saying maybe you
shouldn't well the first problem that we
run into is speed issues since you are
passing all of your packets through a
tunnel to a different server sometimes
overseas that can cause slowdowns this
is normal and pretty obvious and it is a
known issue but not necessarily a major
issue if you are just browsing the web
it can be an issue though if you are
gaming or doing video replay second is
trust with any VPN you are putting some
trust into that company to securely
tunnel your data from your device to
their exit do they log browsing data do
they log time stance or your IP do they
take Bitcoin instead of credit
cards so they don't actually know who
you are in it's anonymous if you are
just now interested in VPNs because of
the recent news make sure you read up on
the Terms of Service and do some
research but even so you've still got to
put some inherent trust in them to not
lie to you check out that one privacy
sites VPN comparison chart which I have
been praising for a long time now for
the great rundown on hundreds of VPNs
the other discussion point is
obfuscation some brilliant minds on the
Internet said upon a goal of creating a
web crawler that will create a fake
trash data on your network so an ISP
would have to go through tons and tons
of bad search data in order to find your
true cliques and your true searches well
this is funny on the surface it may also
create some issues first many users are
on set data allowances each month and if
they go over they will be charged for it
so you need to make sure that if you are
using obfuscation as an add-on that it
cuts off when you are about to hit your
data limit second trackers are very
smart and they may be able to determine
what information is real and what is
fake and lastly your real personal
searches and website visits they are
still there they're just harder to find
if surrounded by a whole bunch of muck I
don't use these kinds of noise
generators because I do use a VPN so I
don't feel like I necessarily need it
but I still find it kind of funny to
troll your ISPs now I won't go into all
of our recommendations here for browsing
privately as we have discussed them tons
of times or if we're on hak5 as well as
my other show called technique but know
that this is not a new debate it's just
resurfaced again with this new and very
recent vote ATM skimmers they are still
prevalent today in many parts of the
world I have not found one myself even
though I always pull on ATMs every
single time I use them but new research
from Kaspersky has been shared
explaining how hackers can use a power
drill a little bit of code in some cheap
computer parts to override the machines
cash dispenser and make it withdrawal
thousands of dollars at a time at ATMs
located in Russia and other parts of
Europe using a power drill to create a
golf ball sized hole right next to the
PIN pad a thief could gain access to a
serial port
plug in this homemade device into the
port to access the internal computer
interface of the machine none of it was
encrypted very well so practically any
part of the ATM could send any other
part commands without it throwing up any
kind of red flags eventually the ATM
would reboot but not before spewing out
tons of money to the attacker then they
could just do the attack again and again
and just wait for it to reboot the ATMs
will need to get physical hardware
upgrades as they aren't upgradeable
remotely and Kaspersky recommends
upgrades such as surveillance cameras or
better authentication on the ATMs
themselves on March 31st WikiLeaks
published new documents in the vault 7
database titled marble with 676 source
code files included for the marble
framework according to these documents
the CIA used marble to obfuscate their
code and make it harder for
investigators to attribute hacks built
by the CIA to the CIA by hiding
fragments of text that could lead
digital forensics experts to the CIA the
lead investigators in the wrong
direction with this marble could also
change the language to Chinese Russian
Korean Arabic and farsi and then attempt
to office beat those two so if an
investigator cracked the hidden code
they would be led to believe it was
written by someone that was not a native
English speaker this is the first real
code that WikiLeaks has exposed in the
vol 7 documents that shows exactly how
CIA processes work and it was reportedly
being used as late as 2016 but that was
reportedly it has not been fully
revealed now while no past allegations
about state-sponsored hacks have been
updated we could expect to see some
react tribution x' to the CIA in the
coming months before I go I want to give
a huge thank you to everyone who has
supported the show so far over on
patreon if you find value from this and
you can spare a few cents an episode
please consider becoming a patron over
at patreon.com slash threat wire and you
may even get your adorable fur babies
featured on a future episode plus you
will get access to behind-the-scenes
videos i asked to do an audio-only RSS
feed just for patrons i do photos i do
early access and extra content i
you will continue to help the show keep
on being completely independent and
