hacked experience t-mobile server is
breached
Android stage-fright 2.0 is a thing in a
Linux denial of service attack all
coming up now on threat wires hello
world I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for October 2nd 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom our
apologies for not having an episode to
you earlier this week I've got a hold of
the rain so let's go ahead and jump
right into the news first off with
patreon a crowdfunding platform for
artists podcasters projects and more
which by the way we use for threat wire
and tech thing is they've just recently
posted and emailed an announcement to
their contributors and creators on
Wednesday saying that the site had been
the target of a security breach data
stolen includes names email addresses
shipping addresses some billing
addresses private messages and history
of patronage --is which you may have
contributed to also included was the
source code for the site the CEO of
patreon also commented on the passwords
Social Security numbers and tax forms of
creators in which he said they are
encrypted with a 2048-bit RSA key with
passwords using the hashing scheme
scheme called be crypt and randomly
salted the breach was discovered on
September 28th and quote the team is
making every effort to prevent something
like this from happening in the future
the post also urges users to change
their passwords which I very much agree
with now later on a little bit more
information came to light patreon had
been using a web application tool called
and I'll probably mess up this name but
it's work zhuge utility library to run
production servers and this library
shouldn't be publicly available because
it enables a person to run a remote code
execution on the server which basically
means that the server gets owned the
security firm called detective I
announced that they had reported the
issue to patreon on September 23rd and
patreon didn't actually mitigate the
issue until the 28th as with all
breaches of security especially this one
for our own patrons we advise everyone
wins
hang up for a site to use your best
judgment and not put your trust fully in
the hands of any company any website can
be breached and we need to continue to
educate each and every one of ourselves
that this can happen to anyone at any
time
moving on to an even worse breach on
Thursday of this week t-mobile shared
the news that experienced network had
been hacked you may wonder why t-mobile
would report this Experian is used by
the company to run credit checks on
potential customers to run those checks
t-mobile had to send incredibly private
information over to Experian the hack
included names addresses birth dates
encrypted Social Security numbers and
driver's license ID numbers and passport
ID numbers for fifteen million potential
or current customers that went to
t-mobile and applied for financing any
time during about the past two years and
a post from Experian North America they
said the company took action to secure
the server as soon as the breach was
discovered they also advise to never
give out any personal information over
the phone regarding this hack in the
invent that in the event that someone
may try to social engineer customers
Experian and t-mobile are offering two
years of free credit monitoring due to
the hack and if you thought the stage
fright bug was patched well there's a
new one in town or actually to the new
stage fright 2.0 bugs allow the
processing of mp3 or mp4 files on to be
exploited on any device from Android 1.0
all the way up to devices running 5.0
yeah they're all vulnerable so this
means that an attacker could send a
malicious audio or video file to a
target to exploit them even on updated
devices google has an update scheduled
to release next week and will patch the
two vulnerabilities lastly for today
Akamai Technologies discovered a network
of denial of service infected Linux
computers called the Zord DDoS botnet
which are flooding sites with a hundred
and fifty gigabits of data per second in
turn making some targets go offline
targets are mostly found in Asia and
include gaming and education sites Zoar
DDoS uses weak command shell passwords
on Linux computers to gain root access
which then allows an attacker to
download an executable Isha's file and
gives them control over the compromised
of
ice the full description on how this
DDoS works can be found on the state of
the Internet dot-com site as well as how
to mitigate the issues on your own Linux
machine
alright patreon.com slash threat wire
yes that is where you go to support us
and thank you to everyone who
continually contributes to the show we
know that you are probably just as
concerned about the breach we mentioned
earlier as we are and I want to thank
you for coming to us to hear about all
the updates on security and privacy no
matter what company that they involve we
will report on it again we are ad free
we are independent and we really like
your pet photos we're also very close to
getting an RSS feed too so share this
with all your family and friends share
it around subscribe it really does help
we'll continue with our one Episode per
week rotational format until we reach
our very next goal at which time we'll
be able to do two episodes per week with
daring kitchen Patrick Norton and myself
throughout wired net to find all the
shows and with that I'm Shannon Morse
and I will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
