go further
I'm here at the Ford booth at CES 2013
with Ed how you doing a Terran ASEAN and
we're checking out the TDK what is it
TDK I'm just doing SDK was ready to DK
tbk is a technology development kit that
developers can get for you know
applicant abling their apps instead of
you know buying a vehicle or if they
already have when they can use an
existing one so this is a TDK you
basically have all the same interfaces
as you would a normal vehicle you got
the screen you got a center stack with
all the different buttons pretty seibon
sport bag as well as some car simulation
toggles so you can turn the car off open
doors set it to go forward and reverse
have it parked or not part so what kind
of partners have you guys teamed up with
to enable apps to come to port right so
I mean everybody knows you know a lot of
the music streaming apps like pandora I
our radio slacker NPR we also did some
navigation base f scout from TeleNav we
have our own sink destinations and i'll
be at bad i'm a whole slew of more
coming out you know every every few
months awesome working our hackers find
a developer network to start coding up
some awesome stuff is pretty easy just
like everything else developer for calm
there we go all right and with all of
that i want to thank once again for Drew
powering our CES coverage
