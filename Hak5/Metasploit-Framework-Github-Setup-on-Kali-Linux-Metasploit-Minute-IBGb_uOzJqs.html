framework from github this time on
Metasploit minute this Metasploit minute
is brought to you by hack five and
viewers like you
support us directly at h a case on calm
welcome to municipal u minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me Rubik's
in this minute we're going to be setting
up the latest version of Metasploit
directly from github repository so let
me show you on the screen first thing we
got to do is we have to get all of the
packages that we're gonna need for this
so if you go over to dark operator comm
slash installing Metasploit in bun 2 it
cuts off the you but it bun - he has a
great way to install on Ubuntu 12.04
we're going to steal a bunch of that for
installing on Kali because it's
basically a bun - so we just steal the
apt-get install we throw it in there
hit go and everything's already at its
newest revision because I just did this
before we started recording so we are
virtually good to go here and next we
just got to get clone we got to pull the
repository down but where do you pull it
down from so on github.com slash rapid7
slash Metasploit - framework this is the
latest and greatest good stuff this is
as soon as they start developing
anything new they figure it out they get
all the bugs out of it they commit it
into this code repository and you get
all the greatest new features instantly
you don't have to wait for anything into
the community Express or Pro editions
since I happen to know this URL by heart
I can just type it in get clone so we
clone the repository or pull down a copy
of it HTTP github.com for SS rapid7
por sus Metasploit framework graeme work
framework dot get if I was going to hit
enter right now it's start pulling stuff
down but we act
they started that ahead of time so we
don't have to wait as long all right now
that this is all done we just CD into
our new Metasploit directory now before
we're actually able to start anything we
have to do something called bundle
install this is a ruby thing what it is
is is installing all of the Ruby modules
or what are packages or gems I guess is
the correct term that you need for
Metasploit to run correctly all right so
one of the things I didn't have on this
Kali install was bundle so all you have
to do is gem install bundle and it
should work out correctly and now bundle
install should work bundle install we'll
just wait until this is finished this is
going to take a second that's installing
all of the gems that are needed for
Metasploit alright now that that's done
we can actually start up Metasploit so
we do dot forward slash and let's look
at the directory before so there's a lot
of elf binaries and different scripts in
here
MSF console is the one that we start
Metasploit with the framework so we're
going to do a dot slash so that we're
running the one inside of this directory
not the previously installed version and
we hit enter now what this is actually
doing is it's it's starting up and
pulling all of the Metasploit modules
and libraries into memory so this could
take a second and that's one of the
great things about the database then
there's a lot of things good about the
database but if you didn't set up the
database beforehand this is going to
take a while and it's going to take a
while for every single time you do it so
that's why we're going to set up the
database so the first thing that we do
have to do is we have to have a database
to connect to so inside of Kali there's
already the database for Metasploit and
it's already running so let's just stop
the other Metasploit instance so we can
save some ram but what we're not
stopping is the Postgres database that
is already there so let's just use a
dark operators awesome
tutorial again and real quick before I
do that I forgot to mention if you
haven't if you have any problems with
the gem install or the bundle install on
this particularly the JSON gem that's
because in in kali linux you need this
other repository be - dev and that's one
of the only changes that I made to
Carlos's script so going back to the
database stuff we have to setup our
database so what we're going to first do
is we already know that the database is
there so we sue into the Postgres user
then we create a user called MSF get or
whatever you want and I'm just going to
copy and paste the rest of this in paste
hit enter our new users password is MSF
NSF now we're going to create a database
we're going to assign the role to MSF
get so that created our new database
with the user that has privileges to it
with MSF get and we exit now that
database is completely created so how do
you connect to the database there's a
ton of ways and we'll go a lot more into
how to connect this thing of the
database the best way to do this is to
go into your new dot MSF three direct
our MSF 4 directory and create a new
file called database dot yml nano
database and yes you can hate me for not
using them or Vie or Emacs or whatever
dot yml we're going to copy and paste
this in
and we're going to make one slight
change what I did was made it MSF Direct
MSF database with MSF get as the user so
we save that out and now when we go back
into our MSF directory and start out MSF
console when Metasploit starts when the
git repository version of Metasploit
starts it should automatically see that
database yml and connect to the database
so now it's creating all those cache
tables and keys and stuff and the
initial module cache will be built this
will take a while depending on the VM
and the amount of RAM and other other
things it will take a while to startup
so we're not going to wait for this to
start up I just want you to let me know
what you think about these segments and
wow it's already done so what do you
think hit me up at MSF at hack 5 org and
stay tuned and Metasploit minute comm
for more shows like these until then I
move Excel beyond to the cows come home
yay
demo awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
