first pineapple livestream is exciting
yeah so this is one of those things with
kind of the experimental nature of
hangouts on air and all of the crazy
technology that puts this together that
we should just give it a minute to start
before we really dive in because there's
always the chance that the heads gonna
get cut off
nobody likes a decapitated stream off
with their heads
and there we go
it looks good yeah now we're like our
life and it's actually not that I'm
checking my phone and putting my pockets
it's it's going to be but this is
fantastic because what we have here is a
full hangout on air with our friends
from the Wi-Fi pineapple community we're
here in the hak5 studio we've got IRC so
at some point Paul will get our lower
third action to display IRC dot hack 5.0
and the channel is pound hak5 so if you
have pineapple questions we're going to
be doing QA so if you're not able to
make it into the actual hangout and
you're watching this on the YouTube
livestream feel free to join the IRC we
will be monitoring that you know you can
also tweet us but but mainly we'd love
everybody to be able to join us on IRC
that's where it's going to be the
easiest and hey you'll be part of the
show look at that yeah yeah yeah so sub
you should probably introduce you so
these guys know what I'm the Joker from
hack 5 but I except some of you know me
some don't I joined the project about
two years ago one a half two years some
around around the 3.0 or not 3 the mark
3 mark 3 yes so I basically what
happened is I want to support what was
back then the mark 1 and mark 2 to a
different device and because it wasn't
available at the time and actually some
guy in here it's approachable he kind of
edged me on there and kept me going but
so I just started to make things try to
make things better try to make things
easier and set that to Darren and then I
kind of dropped off the project for a
while
but at some point I saw that the mark
three came out and that kind of spurred
me back on and Jeff since then I I'm
back that happens it's kind of a fun
story too because you know you were
trying to port it to the OM one P during
the era of the mark two to mark three it
was really kind of a thing where
hardware was getting scarce I mean the
whole thing was built on an air 2315
which is of life yeah and I mean we had
originally built it on a veneer
later another act on router but
basically the same system on a chip and
that was the evolution that brought us
to the mark 3 and it was through your
development porting it to the OM 1p
which was also an AR 2315 sock too many
letters numbers but basically I picked
up on your beta work built the mark 3
did the new interface not the new
interface we're talking about today but
the old new interface and debuted at the
Baltic next door to the pack by studio
and that was a really fun episode and in
it I gave props to you know of course
Robin wood and move makes and all the
other people that helped with the
project as well as Sammy yeah and so I
kind of I was watching an episode and I
I heard Sebastian I thought well that's
weird who is that's like you know that I
didn't know anyone else without name on
the project so I looked at I noticed I
hey that's my work yeah and I just kind
of that gave me that stop to start off
we hadn't to really you know I'll start
developing again and um yeah here we are
it's been a wild ride maybe we should go
ahead and take a very brief look back
Paul you want to pick it up on my screen
over here we've got plenty of computers
to do some demos and stuff of course do
you guys know the original idea it was
just imported to the faun the faun being
the cute little router that we all know
and love port karma karma is is the
thing that made this guy so cute and fun
and happy to begin with and of course we
had to do it inside of a pineapple as
why not but really at the core at that
time it was just hey can we get karma
working on this it was a there's a
project that Dino had basically done
we're probe request comes out and this
is its modified access point that he's a
probe request and then replies back with
a little white lie that just says yes
that's
and you know Association authentication
Bob's your uncle and you've got a client
and so the through you know Robin would
helping you know port this over via at
that time mad wife ing that was the
birth of the mark 1 &amp;amp; 2 and then since
then you know the three amigos we've all
come together and it's been our little
baby and we're super proud of it but you
know really the basic concept is to own
the network oh yeah and so you know
there's there's a lot of different
concepts when it comes to this you could
you know you could penetration to you
could actually break into say the
network that you're auditing jure you
know on your pen test or you can get the
clients to come to you and that's the
thing that I've always loved is you know
what the tools to do man-in-the-middle
attacks in a very small inexpensive
device make it simple with a web
interface that anyone can use and then
allow the community to extend the
functionality yeah exactly yeah so if we
what's next on the list do we have well
we can we can open up to a Q&amp;amp;A now does
anyone have any questions that you want
to talk about something specific before
we kind of yeah because we could we
talked about earlier anyone as we look
below the table because that's for the
speakers yeah no we have anything from
IRC we should we should be in the
Hangout
all right yeah no we can't read so no
it's the IRC is behind us so mister
protocol or if somebody else wants to
kind of moderate for us let us know as
cool as questions come in they should be
alpha 121 you still the best hard worker
the 121 you oh yeah yeah the AAP 121 you
is what the mark 4 is based on so this
is a this is a really cool sock so
basically this is built on Anna Faris 93
31 and it was really exciting when we
brought the mark 3 out I worked directly
with alpha and and I was so excited to
be you know redoing the interface and
you know finding some a Arnaud 2315
because they were very scarce at the
time and I remember you know getting
some units bringing him to market in the
hack shop which has been cool because
that's really you know
bloated hak5 for all these years and I
remember like an enormous response from
that episode at the Baltic where we
launched that and then immediately we
sold out and so I'm like okay you know I
call up alpha an I'm like hey guys can I
get some more cartons of those and like
what do you mean that was it I'm like
what do you mean that - that can't be it
they're like we'll check in the back and
so they're like yeah yeah we found a few
more boxes you want them and I'm like
yes please and so that was a horrible
experience and I learned from that and
that's when the mark for development
began and I was like look guys I want to
work with you guys because everybody
knows alpha they make the best radios we
all love you know the AWS 0 3 6 h and
the NH a and all of those other fun
little 1 watt radios and whatnot
so they said well hey we're actually
starting development on a new platform
because I had looked at their other
stuff and I was like I'll you're our 36
is nice it's got you know USB I like
that but it's based on like a rolling
chip and we were fans of atheros they've
got open-source you know from where the
Moore family of course yeah so so I
started talking to them about like how
can you know we work together on you
know putting something really spiffy
together and they said well you know
here's some they sent out beta units of
what later became the AP 121 you and
through you know our input with them we
kind of co-developed this platform
sometimes known as the Hornet you be
yeah but but otherwise it was really
exciting to be working directly with the
big manufacturer us a little small act 5
and and it's so cool because you know
we're like how can we get in black with
blue LEDs and USB ports and I get
gigabit and they were like yeah sure
whatever you want you know and through
several iterations you know I've got
like a little pineapple museum in the
other room of like all of the prototype
boards throughout years and and so yeah
the ap1 21 you was a really fun project
to work and be the first implementer of
it here in the United States for a while
- yeah it didn't really hit off until
I don't know four or five ones later hmm
took a while for it to really hit the
market and well I mean because we were
we were the introduction yeah company
yeah so that was just kind of a wild
ride because I'd never would have
thought years ago when the pineapple
project started which is you know a
community project it's it's all been
about the the community and okay and
kind of like I don't know just open
source and fun and to be working with
the manufacturer like that so I love
that you can just go out today get an AP
121 you put our firmware on it and and
you're off to the races I mean as you
know these guys know it's you know it's
no secret this is the platform that we
chose because it's a beginning of life
chipset it's got a lot of legs and we
love you on it yeah and we've done a lot
with it and you know of course it's
important and the development you you
were introducing yourself the big deal
now is not just three that not just the
3.0 firmware that we're gonna be talking
about with in fact that finally after
years you know we have a full-time
developer of working on the pineapple
interface in the backend and the cloud
the infusions and all of the
infrastructure that makes it so cool
exactly so that's why I get to do now
full-time is it's great I get to you
know it's sort off as an open source
project I just wanted to make you know
more fun better and as you do but yeah
then Darren got me on board and set me
some devices and just when I pill from
them yep questionnaires but they can see
that pineapple museum if it's possible
maybe if you want to grab some SAP
there's there's some interesting devices
up there there's there's the elusive
white mark for that nobody has ever seen
there's the mark 3.5 they're all the
ones in the frames at the top shelf top
shelf on your right oh I don't see
you're looking right at it oh yes oh my
god it's it's a mess it sits there with
the hak5 museum you know all the books
people have signed throughout years all
you things yeah so let's start with the
og type those yeah I mean this is this
is not
this is the original this is where it
all began the fawn and I remember quite
fondly the fawn CEO coming to the hak5
forums and saying packer device is we
don't condone any of that and basically
shunning our our community project and
at the time you know actually when this
first began we weren't even doing this
commercial it was totally open source
and just saying like hey look you know
break out your soldering iron and get
this firmware follow these this 30 step
guide I made a cartoon about how to go
ahead and flash all of those things it
was a lot of fun and and then eventually
people kept on asking hey we make these
for us we make these for us and I kept
on saying nein nein nein and then I was
like wait but yosik is all about saying
yeah yeah so so then you know I'd buy
like one or two of these and flash him
you know custom for everyone Johnny long
really kind of like took this project to
the next level and he asked for one for
hackers for charity and we brought that
to shmoocon and it raised a lot of money
for that charity and we're like holy
crap you know
yeah why not so then I guess the next
one in line is the the ohm 1p basically
camera and that's kind of how I got
involved is because I saw the old
hardware and then this is actually this
is the mark 2 so it's not just the ohm 1
P but the it's a little bit better ap
well it's still it's still an AR 23 15
stock but I believe it if I remember
correctly slightly faster it doesn't
have heat issues yeah yeah and you know
overall just a better package I mean
essentially what we're talking about is
like all of these things are using our
customized versions of a reference
platform so the way that it typically
works is you know an affair OSA Broadcom
raw link will come out with a new chip
family you know in our case the ones
that we love are the AR 2315 AR for a
theros or a r93 31 and those are it's
just a system on a chip it's literally a
chip that's got the ethernet the
everything right and then it's really up
to the vendors on how they implement
those whether they're going to put one
or two Ethernet on it whether they're
dock they're going to put USB what
buttons with GPIO what other kind of fun
stuff they do with it
and and most vendors will do what's
called a reference platform or their
like to get you started here is a
schematic for what one could look like
and it's actually it's usually kind of
ugly but it's basically the fawn and the
ohm 1p are literally just the most basic
simple implementations of that reference
platform sue but these guys package did
a lot better and dealt with the thermal
issues yeah so that's kind of how we got
started and that's what got me involved
and it was my first device that I really
worked well that's not true I did work
on the phone in the beginning but this
is where I got properly involved with
community the next one down the line
that's the mark that's the more three
yeah yeah so this is the mark three it's
again just another implementation
they're all in white which doesn't add
plus 50 hacker points or stamina you
know it might add charisma I'm not
really sure I haven't rolled the dice on
that but you know it's just I like this
package best and you know when you put
them all side by side and ask you know
which one of these is a sexiest router
are you gonna choose the out for these
guys
you know this is you know they're the
the awesome dudes in Taiwan so I was
just to be able to find any AR 2315 s at
the time because you know my map kind of
was floating hak5 and we needed to keep
that project going and man this was a
game changer because the mark 3 was the
new interface it was you know a big
change in the kernel and it was a big
change in the philosophy of the project
too and that's when you came on and then
since then you know infusions and
bartender and everything has been
different and so great yeah so I guess
that's that's the next point what do we
do with the community infusions right
yeah in fact Paul if you want to take a
look here this is these are some stats
from the community we have nearly 13,000
posts on the mark for forums
you know 8,000 nearly on the mark one
two and three
these are some of the yeah I can't
really sorry but in the bottom right you
can see the you know some of the most
popular infusions or modules that have
been down low
like SSL strip like 8,000 times things
of that nature these are the 2x build
yes the trix builds yes get to 3x in a
second yeah but that's the idea and so
with the mark 4 I guess that was kind of
the game-changer because it added USB
and not just USB but it had more memory
my speed yeah the second Ethernet but
but USB really allowed us to do cool
things like this photo right here is a
good a good example of the usage
you know you plug it into an Android
phone and it gets online like instantly
USB zero interface comes up it's got 3G
access to the network 4G whatever we
have you know power with a pineapple
juice and little DC plug and you don't
point it towards your target network or
your you know your target for your pen
test and you're off to the races and
before it was you know kind of like a
little bit of a hodge podge where you
know oh what will you just have two ICS
it to your laptop yeah yeah too bad we
can't really show off the old UI to like
kind of show the changes but oh no we're
not going back to the old you know I was
thinking we could make it pink and yeah
yeah he loves that stuff no really we we
were developing we had to unpack a few
of the old old pineapples that had the
lower firm or what we've been working
for months or yeah actually months on
the new firmware and the new user
interface and we were both you know the
moment it came up we had a cringe we we
physically cringed for a second because
it was it was so different and so not
not what we wanted not what we liked um
so shall we should we kind of show
something yeah yeah right so I'm
collecting questions from from Twitter
so you can tweet at us hak5 darren yeah
is there anything on the wall yet
someone else cuz entire seriously what
future plans are any new plans for yeah
we've got that in here so let's get to
that in a bit but let's let's take a
quick look at 300 that we can answer
questions about 3.0 and then we
and talk about the evolution or the
future of the project some of the
difficulties that we've run into the
things we've overcome and yeah yeah so
alright step you want to take walk us
through on your machine yeah sure
absolutely so what you can see right now
is the news 3.0 UI with nothing
installed but the things we have when it
ships basically um you'll notice the
first thing I'm sorry guys yes we call
them tiles they're not Metro tiles but
they are tiles okay because Windows
seven tiles are 890 tiles are really
like these are green on black that's not
there's no rounded corners and and
they've got pretext I'm sorry I know
it's not pre but it's a bit slippery
want you know low no space yeah it just
says it I mean it's hello inspiration
right so um so so yeah basically you'll
you'll notice that pretty much
everything is changed about it there's
no there's no real now for at the top
anymore you've got everything laid out
as a tile you've got kind of a small
view inside the system so for example
take karma instead of having one stayed
style you've actually got the
possibility to turn karma on and off
from here to turn the auto start off the
way to you know get more of this UI is
you just click on the title of the UI
and there you go so you've got your your
karma log like you're used to it you can
configure karma like you're used to it's
just not under configuration anymore but
it's under karma configuration so it's a
bit separated which we like because
you'd like to put things in categories
that actually fit the the tasks to kind
of kind of play around maybe we'll turn
trunk karma on and off I've already got
karma on on mine so I'm gonna yeah maybe
yeah okay sure so um so we've got Carmen
abled we can do all sorts of fun stuff
with this you are really because it's
it's all of a modular design so that
means we wanted to focus as much as
possible on the community and community
created infusion of community created
additions to our UI and we want to be
able to thanks and we want to be able to
work the same way so how have things
changed well I mean it's more modular
and also I think the biggest deal is you
know we're talking about these little
embedded devices here they've got power
for the kind of stuff that we're doing
they don't have a ton of power but our
machines and when I say our machines I'm
talking about our smart phones our
tablets our laptops that we're using to
connect to and manage these devices do
have a lot of power in the browser yes
so that's something that's fundamentally
changed in this version whereas before
the interface that I wrote for you know
the whole 2x series that you saw with
the ugliness I based it off of what if a
bulletin board system hacker BBS got
together with a Linksys router and
that's what that was the ugly marriage
that was I guess okay at the time but
when 2.1 assured in infusions and all of
that that's when things slower and you
couldn't run everything at the same boy
it was a mess yes it was difficult to
use it was difficult to - it was
difficult to you know manage different
things at the same time and switch
between different things at the same
time so we wanted to write change and so
that's the reason for the tile
philosophy but also the reason for the
fundamental change on the on the back
end where it's now all html5 so you have
to use a modern browser if you use IE we
don't let do not submit support you
don't submit a bug report that it
doesn't work in IE because you're
holding it wrong yes
yeah so that's then the offloading
basically offloading a process car like
there and already mentioned we do a lot
of things in JavaScript right now we we
like doing that because even your your
slowest Android phone or iPhone is able
to to cope with this UI without a
problem so so that's a very very kind of
important thing to us that the UI is
easy to use and smooth to use really we
might be able to show this off actually
yeah yeah here let me pull it up on my
target but I want I want to first
connect to so you can see is what's
really sexy now is you're going to talk
about the reports because yes generate a
report on the previous build so you guys
remember hopefully you remember if
you've owned a pineapple before that the
Karma log looked kind of bad if I go
back to my screen now maybe you'll see
that this is how the Karma log used to
look you've got your normal log down
here which you have to sift through and
you have to look at different MAC
addresses and you know different Wi-Fi
share your you know probing for you've
got your you know
HDB log and and our Europe file but
basically now we have something called
intelligence report and this report is
actually generated the the information
sent to your browser the browser is
generating this report which offloads a
huge amount of power off of the
pineapple onto your browser which is
great so you can see Archie that
darkness here go ahead and click click
it again that tab because I've added a
second site you can see what happens
when we've got multiple clients ok you
could take a few seconds that's cool if
you go into the karma log you'll see it
but it will show us in in here
so so basically the point is that we are
now sifting through all this information
for you we were able to generate these
reports they used to be called a
generate detailed report basically but
we've changed that you've now got the
intelligence report that actually show
you everything in a nice list and we're
expanding on these features the way we
expand on these features is that we're
gonna be able to to allow users and
module developers will get to that
second though to click on for example
the MAC address and that will then list
all the information that other infusions
are the modules are the parts of the
operating system or the the user
interface gather about that kind so
we're we're creating a one system where
everything is stored
I think that's wait that's a good way to
put it yeah here we go
so I've pulled it up on my tablet now
and you can see we have a much nicer
interface I can actually you know do
something with that and what's really
cool is depending on the device that
you're on these columns are going to you
know a change to meet your screen width
so it's going to be different on say my
phone than my tablet and my laptop right
now our laptops are at 1024 by 768 just
so we can get these on the live stream
but when you go high-res it really you
know it just it looks beautiful on
whatever you throw it at which is a
stark contrast from the bad interface
that I wrote with the HTML 4.0 and the
tables and the at least any news iframes
so we've got a Civ offloading to the
browser changes the battery life of the
device and absolutely before whenever
you generate it for example a detailed
report they CPU spiked up to sixty
eighty percent which is a lot now we get
the highest spike we get with it
spamming ten times a second is uh I
think 14 percent so it's the CPU does
obviously get powered much less and
therefore we save battery life right in
fact we've even just been recently doing
stress tests on do you have a pineapple
juice over there yeah right yeah so this
is just the basic pineapple juice it's a
you know a really simple five volt
battery what you would use to you know
charge a cell phone or an iPad or
anything like that and even at something
as small as 3200 milliamp hours we've
gotten about three and a half hours
because most likely even more hadn't
charged it before doing the test but
this was a stress test I did with a
second and alpha an alpha aw us zero
three six NHA the atheros based alpha
radio that we like to plug into the
pineapple to give it a second interface
did a stress test with that guy all
night long it lasted for three and a
half hours and this was on the new
interface yes so I guess I could go back
and do the same test again without but
we'd get much but yeah we'd get much
less so you know for what it's worth
we're getting a little bit more battery
life so yeah absolutely yes so yeah
that's that's when I talk about
the the live tiles - yeah that's huge
absolutely so another thing that we want
to introduce is kind of we wanted to
have some that self-updating that's that
keeps keeps running so what you see here
for example a great example is this logs
tile right here it says to follow a
custom log open the large tile so we'll
just open the large tile and click on
the custom tab right here and just for
demonstration sakes let's follow the car
my log okay so it's a bit big right now
but if we just let this run for a few
seconds you'll see there we go the tile
updates live and we've got a little scar
on my log now it doesn't look great but
as you can see the Karma log there is
something in there it is tracking it
live you can actually see it move you
can see stuff happening you'll be able
to see this again here so it's really
just a resembles a build track
any file you want and that means that we
could say write an infusion that could
easily alert the pen tester to say some
issues for example if you're running
like an graph or strings or some other
stuff where you're looking for specific
data and through your man-in-the-middle
tool you you have the ability not just
through the live tiles to like display
those but even with the API you could
say light that tile opera absolutely
yeah so we've got something called
notifications which you built into the
API of the UI any program using
JavaScript can call the notification
function and the modification function
allows you to change this this the top
bar the navigation bar at the top which
is the first step of you know kind of
alerting the user and kind of hooking
user creative things into system if the
infusions that we created the next step
up from that is that you're able to
actually make your tile the tiles that
you saw or that you can make those glow
and by doing that you can basically pull
attention to to the UI we don't actually
have an infusion that does that we leave
that as a feature for infusion
developers to use but it's it's just
some it's usability that we wanted to
focus on kind of improve on which brings
me I think to the next point of how easy
it is to maybe create infusions or
download them first of all yeah yeah
let's break it down to the debuts
because the thing is going back to the
old interface to the 2x build of the
Wi-Fi pineapple not only was you know
that the mark 3 a big innovation in that
it brought the new interface but the
mark 4 with the additional hardware
brought a lot of people saying hey I've
got some ideas but I'm not there under
sab and that's where 2.1 really shined
and totally changed the landscape of the
project because the idea of you know
whether you call it extensions or
plugins or modules where we like to say
is their infusions because we're
infusing our pineapple with goodness yes
so you go over to the bar and and you
grab yourself some yeah
and 2.1 brought that and we have seen
nothing but amazing response from that
it would throw you know our the
community of developers and through the
API
now in 3.0 it just makes it so much
easier for anyone to take their favorite
tool and turn it into a module or say
that you're in an organization that does
a certain kind of report or a certain
kind of pen test you could create you
know take your you know automate your
stuff and then put it into your very own
module which happens you know is really
cool yeah so modules work the same way
as in the system so so let's not call
modules I mean let's call them infusions
so we'll stick with one name
so these infusions basically what you
see on my screen right now is they're
all they're all system intelligence
sorry about that sorry so they're all
system integers these are all infusions
created by us to get a new infusion you
visit your pineapple bar as you used to
and you can see we have none installed
right now so let's click on available
ones and give it a second there we go
so you'll see that we've got already so
this firm has been out for less than a
week already we have lots of the module
developers up in 14 things such as
computer Chris whistle master newbie we
thank you guys for doing this for you
know bearing with us and then getting
your your porting everything over so
quickly but let's let's install for
example the nmap for example so you get
greeted with this is another thing
another change of the UI basis usability
that we're focusing on
so these pop-ups these are all of those
elements they're all part of the the new
user interface in the new UI so any
module developers able to call on these
as you're speaking of maybe I'm going to
take a different one that has no install
on let's take Network tools but all
right Chris so in fact I have never
installed over here on my pineapple if
you want to see its oh no I don't
nevermind I only have the I have all of
the stock plus Wi-Fi manager ok yeah so
so basically what you just saw happening
is we we just installed infusion you saw
how snappy it went and how easy when we
have to actually have it right here now
you can still see that this log is
refreshing at the top you'll see that
the top bar is also refresher so this
stuff is all live let's check out
network tools so network tools is quite
simple but it allows you to you know
convert or do do binary conversions of
IP addresses and so on subnet mask
that's a really useful
just do a sanity check hey am i online
right absolutely that's beautiful
because computer chris is taking
advantage of the small tile you know
there's only a couple of files it really
takes like what three files to make an
infusion yeah and he's using the small
file to give us the ability to do those
pings and trace routes right from within
there absolutely and we'll get into to
the big Tom the small tal and functions
we'll get into that in a second and
butcher hunger does when we build one
because we're actually to show you live
how to build one and it's really really
simple it's just a couple button presses
so just to show you my screen again
maybe you'll I hope you guys will be
able to read and that you guys are able
to see this top whoops this top bar at
the top but this there's narrow tools
basically if a ping succeeds you'll see
the notification actually happening what
we just talked about the notification
I'm just happening in real time so if I
just click this if the ping goes through
you'll see at the top you see that the
bar change to pong for just a couple of
seconds so what what happens is it gets
added to the notification stack and the
notification stack is monitored
constantly so notifications are
basically played back to the users in
that top bar now this specifically does
not use any any colors or doesn't change
its its appearance this a small thought
doesn't start blinking or or what do you
call it um get this clear the
highlighting the highlight it doesn't
get highlighted that's the word so we
can try try traceroute too and that
takes a little longer but here you go
this is another example this is how a
pop-up works basically so here you've
got your trace route showing and these
are all tile functions that are in the
UI we call them tile functions they
included anyone that has a that puts
function into the smaller Lorch how they
become available so that's really
important because it allows basically we
add functionality that people can reuse
and to make it easier to that can
streamline the the development of
infusions so maybe you really should
show how to create one do you want to
let's let's go ahead yeah if you want to
pull it up on mine I was just talking to
the chatroom over on YouTube and just
reminding you if you're watching the
YouTube live stream IRC dot hak5 org
pound hack five is the channel or at
hack five Darren and thank you to our
moderators and mr. protocol for
gathering those questions I've got a
bunch for you here
let's go ahead and dive into creating a
hello world yes
so pull on my pineapple over here I'm
going to go to the pineapple bar and yes
if I if I pull that up again you can
very quickly see that entropy bunny he's
still there and if I go to you know you
can see what I have installed right now
it's just Wi-Fi manager I can go to the
available infusions this is actually
going to make a connection to Wi-Fi
pineapple calm and see what's available
oh look hey I've got an update to the
bar this is brilliant because you were
talking about how there's no that like
all everything is an infusion now
whether it's a system infusion like a
bartender or a karma or if it's a user
infusion like a Wi-Fi manager or tools
all of them can be updated which means
less firmware flashing less sis
upgrading less crossing your fingers and
hoping for the best and mind you we've
ever actually a really good success with
that yes zoiy zoiy added any five checks
to make it in the beginning we had
separates and you had to manually ICP
them up to the to the pineapple and then
we included the upgrading to the user
interface which meant you press a button
and your panels become one become
unresponsive and you have to manually
refresh the page from there we kept
going and we created something which was
the basing non-blocking so used Ajax to
keep checking if the pineapple was back
online once it was we went back and
refresh the user interface for you now
that was really enough back then but
what kept going after that is we did
some code over the airplane so let you
all you have to do is you press a button
it downloads the firmware for you it
verifies the firmware for you and
flashes the firmware for you and then
notifies you that you're done with that
so that's all great and that's good for
changes that we want to push colonel
changes file system change anything I
thought we still have a system like that
in place or we will push it back to the
users and speak and push it back we
don't need to do that anymore to do
handle any of that why yeah you can kind
of think of it as a difference between
Android Dona and Android Froyo absolute
where it used to be that say Google Maps
or your Gmail were tied to the operating
system and because the carriers were
slow to push updates for example sorry
can hear you did
we can we can't really hear you sorry
yes so you know the difference between
you know the since the carriers were so
slow to adopt the you know now firmwares
then you know all of the core
applications broke out and then you
could update them through the Play Store
it's very kind of similar and this is a
brilliant example of which because now
we don't have to push a system upgrade
we don't have to do a firmware flash
which means you don't have to back up
all the very stuff and restore all of
your stuff exactly time you get a new
core so if we look at this right here I
see the pineapple bar and there's an
update to version 1.1 and all I have to
do is click update - you see you're
updating I'm missing myself I mean you
just saw you know there's a there's a
that was it yeah that was all there
that's all there was to it now I click
into here go to available and it doesn't
show that there are any updates and I
can take a look at you know all of the
other things that I'd like to install
and I love that because it's it's all
over the air but let's go ahead and
create an infusion you'll see we have
two additional tabs here now we've got
create new infusions and manage your
infusions I'm going to go into create
new infusion and I want to give it a
name I'm gonna call this hello world I'm
gonna you know all one word it's gonna
concatenate to one regardless now give
it the title this is the title of your
tile so I'm gonna make that hello world
with an exclamation point I've it's
version 1.0 of my infusion updatable
true or false and only that true that
means that my tile will be able to live
update which is really cool and then I
just create new infusion that's it it
was successfully created all I have to
do now is manage it so under the
management tab you see my new hello
world and fusion I can remove it or I
can edit and check this out this right
here is my infusion ready to go I can
actually edit and build an infusion
right from within the Wi-Fi pineapple
interface let me see if I can get this
this is not as you can see it's it's
responding to I'm doing ctrl + + ctrl -
and final resolution already on the on
the on the hangar yeah we're doing this
at 1024 by 768 so that you guys can see
this but but I hope you can see you know
like I can I can actually do some code
in here I can do PHP and then you know
echo
was a dollar date no no it would be
dollar under for color
I'd have to create a den functions just
just do date date
Oh Marcus echo date yes
there we go and that would do exactly as
I expect so if I come down here and save
my infusion I go back to a regular
resolution and up at the top here Save
Changes and that was in as you noticed
my small tile code so I'm gonna go ahead
and close the pineapple bar and as soon
as I do this and refresh my page I now
have an additional tile down here hello
world and it's telling me that I don't
know how to code which is wonderful or
for live demos
go back into the pineapple bar and fix
my code because I am totally rusty in
PHP right now
you
Oh echo hello world
you
just reading some of the stuff on my
receipt EB yes thank you it's YouTube
all right so I'll refresh that and
there we go I get my hello world this
could be the same thing if you know for
example I wanted to tail a log file or
really do anything on the system and
that's what the whole power is is we're
taking you know all of the underlying
things on you know our branch of open
wrt the power of linux and bringing it
to this web interface absolutely yeah
yeah so so that's that's one of the
things we've done we've also done a lot
on the back end for example beforehand
you are one example is you take your
Android phone and you connect up to your
to your pineapple and while that does
give the pineapple internet immediately
it doesn't give the clients attorney
immediately so you have to go through
either an infusion or you have to you
know manage it yourself and type in IP
terrible scripts and so on that was kind
of a hassle so we've changed that we've
basically now told the pineapple at the
moment it sees an Android phone it sadly
not iPhones is a bit of a hassle with
iPhones but with Android phones the
moment you click on USB tethering and
you can actually the pineapple over USB
everyone has mentioned on the panel
there's no there's no setup
configuration whatsoever it's just
online we really like that that's the
kind of philosophy change here not only
in the interface making it easier to use
and then trying to you know make it more
robust with html5 and JavaScript and
stuff but making it so that it just
works it's kind of make it as a more
polished
you know project and not necessarily you
know a hack which is really cool because
you know if you look at some of the
stuff from the the previous build you
know I I kind of am NOT the best
programmer I think you thankfully
stabbed it is and and it's gotten a lot
better in that you know things like 3G
modems you know before I had just so I
look at a problem like oh so how do we
support all these 3G modems well I know
let's do an LS USB and see what the
vendor and product ID are every USB
device has those and if they're on the
supported list we'll just do a switch
case and make all the settings and
there's so much bad code that was reused
over and over and it was a long file and
we supported in the end like a dozen
motives out of the box yeah add your own
money so now we support just over three
hundred you know we got your out of the
box yeah so so you still have to
configure a PNG tells you stuff there
and figure what are you doing I'm just
gonna grab the motor you you you
still you saw after you know configure
AP nd tells your dial details and so on
and so forth but you don't have to edit
any file you just go through the network
time I can show that really quickly on
my screen we're gonna show the full
modem configuration a second but on my
screen really quickly if you go to your
your network tab so under the network
tab and then you go to mobile
configuration you see this is the
information you have to fill out that's
that's really it and we're gonna put a
list of all known configurations after
this we'll put those up on the Wi-Fi
pineapple column slash bottoms exactly
and Rita will read all the system and so
on so it's gotten it's gotten a lot
easier to imagine if we um yeah and so
for example I actually have you know a a
bucket of modems here as you must to in
order to to do this kind of development
in fact these these are my favorite I
love any of the unlocked ones GSM of
course the the CDMA ones are a little
bit more fun but but I love you know I
guess I'll give a shout-out to t-mobile
did they're not a sponsor or anything
and maybe they wouldn't like me saying
this but I do love the fact that at
least here in the United States you can
walk into a t-mobile store ask for a SIM
card plop down 50 bucks in cash and
they'll say what's your name and you'll
say Rumpelstiltskin and they'll write it
down on a post-it note so you know
that's kind of fun but yeah under
Network manager here I've just gone
ahead and plugged my modem in and I can
go to network and mobile configuration
and really all I have to do is fill in
these details and you know for example
the interface name would be PPP zero and
the protocol would be 3G and service
would be UMTS and the device would be
slash dev slash u.s. tty USB zero
this is CDMA so there's no APN the
username is internet password is
internet default route would be one PPP
redial would be one pure DNS would be
zero
DNS I'll pick a server like 888 keep
alive yes we'll do one and no PP PD
options these you know we'll eventually
as this infusion evolves get easier and
easier as we're able to you know detect
things that we you know know to be good
configurations but honestly all you have
to do now is know your you're dialing
details you know and in this case really
the only thing that's unique to this is
internet internet really you know we'll
have a list of like known generic
defaults it changes when you use GSM
modems you need to know the APN but this
becomes so much easier and when you know
when you save this as soon as you plug
the modem in okay I think we should dumb
I'm not a hundred percent on these
settings but I'm I'm close I'm pretty
certain okay so that's been updated I'll
go ahead and do a redial and see that my
modem here is blinking okay my modem
just once solid if I go into Network
info see it still CBR land give that a
moment to dial and actually this is a
good example of showing off the syslog
so I'll scroll up and go there obviously
yep and you can see that oops
nerdy message
slug slug yeah top
you
well you can see where it became a you
know the USB device became generic
cereal scroll up here check syslog again
and I don't remember all of the dial
settings so I'll have to double check
that on my other laptop we'll get that
going but right here what is this oh
yeah yeah
well you can see the wind to connect so
let's see go over to network again see
and I don't quite have it yet I'll have
to check with you no this is why we're
putting all of them known configurations
up on the web but but basically even
though this is not the web but the hats
when you try to show something off of
course sometimes doesn't work but yeah
so if you remember the DJ's if you know
the details then it does work out of the
box and doesn't you know caused you any
trouble there is a bug right now we're
gonna say this because you know we did
something silly we the the script that
does the read on the strip that makes
sure that the system keeps alive that
the internet catcher never breaks up
because that's what you want right you
don't want this device to reboot and not
dial back in or a drop get you kicked
off the network or get a bad reception
then you know news connection you do
want to read our constant here you do
want to be online constantly on a 3G
modem now the thing is we have a debug
flag in our script and we left that to
on or yes or one true and in our log now
we get a nice spam which which just
keeps saying that we're redialing and we
read darling weary darling or who
redialing which people aren't too happy
about because it fills up their logs in
a filter so it's really easy to fix so
you just go into the file and send the
debug flag off that's the nice thing
because we can fix that by pushing an
update to the to the absolutely also so
that's what it was
the service is 3G not UMTS UMTS spgs not
a video of course yes so so not not only
okay we got that will show in a second
but this is exactly as Darren just said
it's an example of how useful the new
user interface is because we don't need
to assist upgrade to fix this issue what
we do is we just push a tile
and this tile on the first you know the
first time you reload the UI the the
first time you you reload that infusion
we can make these system changes for you
and fix things basically hotfix with our
hops on fixing using system programs
yeah so should we check back with you
yeah just give me a minute I'm gonna
plug that in we dial have a do its thing
I saw a few questions you wanna do you
wanna list some
it's a protocol you still with us
okay well I have some from here your arm
oh hey how are you mr. protocol I was
wondering if you've got some questions
for us from the IRC oh sure
one question is what specific language
if any pineapple modules cogito right so
I think I can answer that one at the
moment so so the main the base of the
system is in PHP PHP for mind you
JavaScript jQuery obviously and well
your API the great thing about it is
though you cannot anyone that knows how
to do pay how to do PHP or how to to
communicate using Ajax with any type of
web service will know that you could
just put a Python back-end and you could
put a Perl Ruby back in whatever you
want whatever runs on the pineapple as
long as you can make communicate with
the web or as a reach over Ajax calls be
able to include it in the UI so you
could write your entire back-end in
height and just call it over a web web
script really yeah does that answer you
guys this question sounds like it okay
all right a couple here from mr.
protocol let's see Foxtrot saying can
you ask about no driver loading equals
one in 3G right there's a there's a new
3G option that Miss sorry I was protocol
that we follow requires and he hunts add
that at the moment separately okay
because we are missing second option to
be able to able to push to double Timmy
options EPP D yeah you know we have the
buffers options yeah
so that part okay here's a question for
sub is he coming to the hack five euro
made up that's being organized and
another lens while he's on the live
stream hey you can't be in the
Netherlands while you're on the live
stream but when you're no yes I'm right
here right now I'm in the US but am i
coming to the beach well when is it
where is it if you sell me some details
I'll see if I can make it yeah the
Netherlands aren't that far no it's a
joy I can do that that's pretty cool
let's see who else we have a question
here from Garrett see any plans on
able to dodge HTTP GET attack router to
kill it and then you can fake the first
router and it forces users to connect to
you right so I think I think it's it
sounds like a
okay because I read get as a get attack
as a well as an HTTP attack I I guess I
guess I wouldn't go that route what I
would do is with with the cell with an
alpha or somehow that D or the access
point you know the hell out of it and
people will like clients will drop off
of that I think a running denial of
service attack on that router is
probably not your best choice and more
difficult to do absolutely yeah I mean
you can make the the piece of equipment
fall over but if you did you know that
would require you of course being
connected network and so I mean it
really depends on what you've been
authorized to do in your pen test I
would say that it's kind of going around
like if you can already use the power of
management frames use them you can be
more specific because by doing add
analysis attack against the entire
router you may be kicking off every one
if your objective is you know only to
Spearfish one particular person in the
organization well then all you need is
there be SSID or MAC address and you can
be very specific with whitelists and
blacklists about what client you're
trying to encourage to connect your men
in the middle device so that's just the
the route that I would take there
yeah of course you know anything's
possible with infusions you're more than
welcome to it if you want if you want to
write one that'll DDoS a network yeah
you're welcome to uh-huh but but we
think there's there's probably easier
methods would we also have a question
here will there be an option to resize
the tiles on the pineapple yes
absolutely what we what's coming next to
the UI is first of all that if you
wanted all if you want to quickly show
my screen again basically what you see
right now the resolution is kind of bad
what ultimately is gonna happen on this
type of resolution you'd have two tiles
sharing the space instead of three so it
would be two two by three tiles on this
UI same with the phone on the phone
you'd only get one tile shown and you
scroll down and you you know it comes to
I user-friendly that resizing isn't
where we want it to be just yet it will
be very soon so we've got we're working
on on bug fixes for a 3.0 and then we
have something which is 3.1 which is
coming soon which has a lot of new fixed
stability improvements speed
improvements which are really needed but
but that's something we're doing another
thing we're doing is we're gonna let you
disable the the viewing of more of
infusions and of tiles so even system
ones so you go to your pineapple bar and
you uncheck the box that says visible
and that makes the tile invisible so it
means it's not loaded into your your
browser so if you do have problems if it
is slow and you never use your info bar
or never use the logs or never use your
I don't know any infusions you download
take network manager or tell you sorry
Wi-Fi manager that is our side survey so
ID survey on the on the small talk love
to show that off you want download yeah
I can oh and actually if you want to pop
over to mind real quick here Paul I'll
show you here I'm gonna increase the
font size so you can see this in the log
I actually filled out the details it
turned out it I just had I put the wrong
thing in the place but this right here
is the chat script talking to the modem
the modem is happy the modem is blinking
and I actually see it it connecting and
dropping and the reason being because I
don't actually have service right here
so if I were to take my pineapple
outside we'd get around to host
everybody I'm happy but I can see it
dialing and and the error that I'm
getting is no carrier so no carrier
mains it just yeah so I can try with
another modem
but but for the pointer for the point
being it's if it's dialing is Eiling
yeah so you said Wi-Fi managed yes right
here well well darn Belen's whoa you
don't even need to download it's got a
real hero super you want to show the
small tile maybe okay sure I can
emphasize my point so I'm with the smile
it's multi-sensory sorry
Oh site survey ok Lemongrab site survey
right the reason why I say say that is
because site survey is something that
keeps pulling on the small tile it's it
it doesn't refresh all the time but it
does gather information from the system
and every time you hit refresh you
you
okay start broadcast
it's our broadcast we're back guys can
you hear us oh yeah sorry the stream
just went down we have the server issues
Paul you're not on Wi-Fi are you you
would not believe the crazy high jinks
here in the hack five studio when it
comes to Wi-Fi I can't tell you how many
times we've owned ourselves oh man
there's there's a solar pineapple on the
roof here
that's been running for about a year and
which is impressive so it just doesn't
die okay so everything's good Paul okay
sorry about that guys all right so I
actually have site survey installed here
so Paul if you want to bring up my
screen you'll see I've installed that in
fusion it just shows up right down here
at the bottom and and you're right this
right here is live information on signal
strength yeah and all sorts of stuff so
that's that kind of slows down bugs down
the UI and as you can see you still have
to scroll right now it's not been
optimized yeah it's still you know we
are still we are on our end we're still
changing things and the the module
developers are still changing things
because we're not you know they didn't
have too much time to report their
infusions over we didn't have I would
say this is actually a success story
given the fact that they had a week to
port their whole things over to a
completely new platform and while they
may still in some ways look a little
like they used to the fact that on the
back end it was all rewritten for the
new framework it's just a you know goes
to show the kind of the power of that
API now so you know that's why we need
to have more of these chats like we
should you know do a like a chat of
building you know a infusion from the
ground up yeah so so we kind of we want
to do this more often we kind of woman I
want to get your input and kind of you
know properly talk so we'll get people
in the Hangout or more you know we will
talk will will show the devs on yeah
exactly
we'll do some diving together on live
and we'll we'll put them up on a blog
and then you know people will be able to
follow them and create things and do
what we do and have some fun with them
really yeah but what I wanted to say
earlier with these with these live tiles
is so to come back to the original
question is are we able to resize the
store will we be able to resize it yes
you'll be able to resize the tiles
you'll be able to basically not just not
show
some of the tiles they won't get loaded
so say you don't want Carla because for
some reason you don't like karma you
could disable karma for the well-being
and you can enable it right away again
too
so that option your obviously like they
will give you options on how to to how
to layout the dis hearts too so you're
gonna be able to reorder the tiles and
save that order because right now at the
moment I'll just adjust the top the
pineapple bar is the second one but it's
it's depending on how fast your browser
load certain tiles so really you'll be
able to rearrange let's say if I
rearrange yeah okay another question any
plans for a dedicated app Android so
that it can offload greater than four
megabytes to the device not completely
understanding the question I think the
browser doesn't allow you to do more
than four Meg's of like often app to the
phone to like takes maybe some more
storage space free up the pineapple
right so you mean offloading offloading
logs and that kind of stuff hmm well I
guess you could technically through the
browser because you can push it over
html5 right yeah you'd be able to do it
but but we don't have any plans right
now to to watch on Android app allow you
to do that we have some cool plans but
well but the idea of you know I'm sorry
just brainstorming out loud sure but
considering you know things gonna put me
in a box and he'll make me write no no
no I'm just I'm brainstorming okay this
is not a feature request or anything
however you know as we do just kind of
dreaming out loud with the community
here if what you're talking about is
using html5 s ability to store onto the
browser cache you know just like I was
doing an interview with somebody at Def
Con here recently talking about you know
a distributed html5 browser cache and a
botnet distributed file system using
that kind of stuff the the API is there
within html5 to store information so you
could technically write an infusion that
would offload some stuff now whether or
not that's gonna be useful for like
things like binaries I'm not so sure
however for logs I could see you I know
that being an infusion or people would
really want to do
something with that absolutely and
they're able to doubt the new UI what
else do you have big things that are to
do with the new AI um something that I
think should be mentioned is USB and so
with USB sticks now you're able to like
before but in a more clean where you're
able to install infusions to the USB
stick when there's an update and the USB
stick plugged in and there's an update
available for seven fusion you will
it'll you won't have to decide okay
where do I want to install this it'll
basically decide this for you to always
find the best location it'll install to
the right place you'd let you just click
update and does the updating so it's all
out of the box you want you as much out
of the box as possible if you don't have
USB stick plugged in and you load the UI
you will just not see the modules it
won't there is it just gonna be gone the
moment you plug the USB stick back on
like magic you just have to pop back up
and that's something you want it again
ease-of-use usability something we want
to really you know bring out yeah I mean
the idea is you know the philosophy is
just make it just work or you don't have
to think about it just just do the thing
you know and that's kind of the
evolution you look back at the the
original 3g dial script the comment at
the top was does the thing and no six or
nine modems that were on the list yeah
yeah
so yeah there's the bartender there's
you know the ability to develop
infusions right from within the
pineapple there's the API do you want to
show off some of the highlights of keys
you can bring up the JavaScript console
oh I think we can do that another time
okay so you how about we'll have a
dedicated yeah hang out for an infusion
development yeah because then we can
develop something more structure maybe
have some devs on should be good yeah
yeah what else
updates over-the-air you know less for
more flashing you were talking with some
of the difficulties we've had um yeah
let's start with with one of them
thoughts about I just saw something
about the anti pineapple yeah I just see
I just got a tweet here actually from
this and he links to here let me see it
so basically there was a there was a
blog article on how how the the
pineapple is is exploitable so if you
know the root password you're able to go
in and inject into a few forms and you
know basically do a nick success attack
over
societies and so on now while that was
true and while we fix these issues we
still have something called the advanced
execute command so I don't know if Paul
you could jump to my screen quickly so
under uh under the configuration we also
have this advanced this allows you to
execute any commands if I do LS temp for
example you'll see ya actually execute
the Klan and it puts it there if we do
an RM minus RF we won't do that you
could also do an MTD arrays to some
methods so this form is is not protected
while I should take full responsibility
for this because this is a legacy
feature we power more it adopts the mark
3 and the reason that I put it in there
was because you know as I did dev
sometimes I would just be too lazy to
pop into an SSH shell yeah to you know
get mildly command-line lebanon and
sometimes you just need to execute
something real quick to push a thing
into a place and having the ability to
really quickly do that i mean has
actually been you know i feel like it's
been a useful feature but yeah it may
not necessarily be like this isn't
something you would see on a commercial
router you're not gonna find execute
commands on your Linksys at home no so
we we are actually have have a few
changes that we're pushing to this we're
we're gonna disable this option by
default and you have that section to
re-enable it it's a command you'll be
able to run that's the first step the
other step were actually we're pushing
very soon is we've been talking to talk
to a few of the user is about is a is
basically a ssh client that runs in your
browser so that's written with PHP Ajax
or jQuery and html5 elements so so with
those you're able to actually log in to
your pineapple so you still need the
password now really quick I just want to
say this because I mean who here is used
back we've all used backtrack before
right oh my god I've been using it on
hack 5 since backtrack through it so and
I'm sure you've changed your password
rights oh no my password is tor right so
I is not an issue so the the article
that we were quoting with some of the
difficulties we've had the the thing
with it was that you need to know the
root password to the to the UI and
obviously if you know the word password
you can just go to that advanced form
and say hey erase everything you don't
to do any exercise you don't need to do
any you know form sanitization or
basically getting into forms that words
that because we don't sanitize the
command was if you know this is the
command line and if you've got if you've
got root access anyway you I mean you
you can just SSH into the device and do
the same thing so really all that said
is change your root password
yeah just change it I will give you know
a tip of the hat dude the guy that came
to our booth last year that said hey
check this and he changed his SSID to a
JavaScript alert box and it's like dude
and all thought of a cross-site
scripting attack using and so we are in
the log it pops up and we had the
JavaScript alert just like that it was
great because that way we could you know
we we saw that that okay our device does
certain things but we want it you know
we we have locked it down since then
yeah were there any other questions from
the the Hangout before we go back to IRC
I think all right so I see Fran from
Twitter let's see does it go with vodka
oh yes it does it does st. actually when
you ask can you ssh into it yes i can go
ahead anyone's and then increase your
font size I'll be done in a second poll
okay there we go there we go you want a
full screen on that pole and so when you
very first log into the pineapple you
get the open wrt with our little
pineapple pork there and what do we have
Oh an attitude adjustment it is quarter
ounce of vodka gin amaretto triple sec
peach schnapps and sour mix with a
splash of cranberry juice not now owns
lovely Oh pal go wide I don't have any
of that but we do have vodka so Prost
Cheers Boston I think we still need to
have a recipe it had pineapple and put
it in there I mean talk about a while
ago at the I don't know if you guys got
a chance to see like Shannon poses and
photos on Twitter of the the hak5 booth
at Def Con we went all Tiki themed and
we had so much fun and I was talking to
the guys and I really wanted to at our
booth have a pineapple vodka infused
pineapple punished right turns out in
Las Vegas you need this thing called a
liquor license so ya couldn't even serve
normal pineapple juice like just the
punch because yeah
again no because you know I'd be here
with a flask oh well let's see anything
else from Twitter saying nothing really
quickly we did have this this this small
thing going on which was a one-way you
did like a call for banners really on
the forum so if anyone has a cool banner
has a cool ask yard and the cool recipe
do submit it to to the forums do come in
the forms and submit them where we want
to launch a contest for this at some
point but we never really got around to
it so maybe that's something we should
we should do it yeah sure I mean you
know send your submissions in will send
you Shannon you just take her off her
hands yeah exactly yeah where are we
going where are we going we're going to
help we don't change your ways my nap oh
well I kind of mentioned a few of the
things that we're changing on the on the
pineapple interface where we try to
we're gonna try to keep making things
easier for us making things easier for
the
users improving the DUI we want to make
it be easier to build infusions for
example so right now you actually have
to write the PHP code well every program
right here is gonna say yeah well I can
do that that's easy I'm not gonna use
this I'm gonna use my you know my normal
IDE and so on but are there text search
or whatever you want to use but there
are some out there that just wanna do
certain tasks really quickly and that
don't know the the API at that well the
module developers now know quite well
but even they've had difficulties in the
beginning so what we're gonna do is we
know that you like drag in building
blocks so through the industry use all
right now you'll have certain building
blocks such as a HTML form building
block so you start drying it entering
the the form elements and it sets all
those things up for you so really
focusing on ease-of-use trying to make
it as comfortable as possible to create
the fusions directly from your pineapple
yeah and then I also love the the ideas
of allowing infusions to be able to
share information from them kind of
similar to what you have on say Android
where if you've got a photo you could
share it to all of these different you
know whether it's your Instagram or your
Google+ or Twitter or whatever have you
there are certain pieces of information
that are quite useful for various
infusions that we through the karma
interface also give you an example of
the Karma infusion we we mentioned
before that you'll be able to click on
the the MAC address off of the client
and hook into all the all the
information there well through the new
API you're able to call on functions
that you get you exposed through PHP so
it's a specific type of link and we'll
show that off in another episode or
another hangout or now on forums and
blogs everywhere but it allows you to
hook into our services it allows you to
pool your data into into our our
database basically so that then at some
point when you click on that MAC address
and you've where cell strip running or
you've got URLs start running not only
do you see the you know just the the
pump of logs what you see but you see
everything in a clean-cut UI you see you
know what URLs have they gone to what
you know what passwords have there you
have to use and so on anything that
that's that's like yeah cool yeah and oh
gosh what else oh you know just some
obvious stuff like hey you know on the
splash
change your password yeah so there's
actually a new splash screen so if you
haven't installed 3.0 I'll let you find
that for yourself but yes everyone that
has installed a Porno they've seen the
splash screen and what we what were you
gonna do in the next version we're gonna
have a force change your password field
just to kind of emphasize that a little
more that you really should change your
password but yeah this is all in the
spirit of you know one making it an
easier to use you know thank and to you
know as we launched this this 300
firmware mind you to eight one still the
what we believe stable but we need to do
these we need to do these hangouts we
need to have these continued discussions
as we are on the forums and so that's
you know as we encourage everybody to
you know file those bug reports let us
know those features you'd like to see
get involved with the community so that
we can continue this fun project yeah
absolutely
yeah I've been up to some ridiculous fun
as well that we've only showed at Def
Con yeah is that we have not shared
publicly there's been a poster right
behind yous we're not behind you it's in
your camera sub but behind shannon on
the last couple of episodes of hack 5
yeah that's where can your prom so
people have been asking like what's up
with the screaming pineapples said you
want to grab the other one
the oh yeah and so we figured you know
what would be more fun than a pineapple
on your desk that would be a pineapple
in the sky and so that's right we're
doing some ridiculous stupid stuff and
putting putting pineapples on our sea
drones with HD camera live feeds and
assistive auto pilots so that we can say
get our packet sniffing goodness on in
places where otherwise there might be
you know yeah yeah that's is go over
yeah yeah no no no keep it keep it safe
keep it saying but this is just us
having fun to be honest and so check out
the hack shop in about an hour if you
want to get your your pineapple flying
on but this is this is one of those
projects that spawns out of out of
Darren and Jason having cocktails and
dreaming up stupid stuff and now now
we're flying pineapples so why not
that's you have to keep it fun that's
the whole point of this project right
yeah I think for me anyway it's been a
really fun project that's how I got
involved it's because it was so fun and
without it's it's always being something
new and something something fun to do
yeah it would have been very different
in the part with it
one of the things that we talk about is
one of the challenges with the project
has been you know there's a there's a
lot of people in various skills sets
within the community and you know I'll
be the first to admit when I very first
started developing on open wrt I wasn't
running full time Linux I at that time
in my life I was still you know
full-time windows because it was
assisted men in the windows world and I
dabbled with Slackware and all of those
other things now I'm full time Linux but
I didn't get there you know overnight it
was because I was developing on open wrt
and then I'd go back to Windows I'm like
where is where is diff you know where
it's at a knock I could have done this a
minute you know and so it's it's really
a great platform to learn you know I've
learned I probably know more ash than I
know bash a sh they shell the default
shell for the pineapple yeah yeah it's a
it's a great tool for everybody to learn
more about networking and more about
Linux more about now web development
with html5 and all that so what we're
going to do is ask you guys to submit
your feedback on the pineapple forms so
go to Wi-Fi pineapple comm sign up get
yourself an account there so you can
file bug reports so that you can get in
on beta firmware as that stuff comes out
and let us know on the forums what you
guys think of this hangout what you
would like to see in the future because
it's our dream to continue bringing
these to you and maybe you know more
focus this one is kind of like a yeah we
were all over the place so we what we're
gonna do is we're probably gonna I'll
click some things and make a list
beforehand and publicize that list and
then go to it and and I'll be like some
tutorial ones and like walking it
through here's how to use Wi-Fi manager
with an alpha or yeah you know here's
how to use SSL stripper here's how to
use all of these different infusions
and these different kind of you know
techniques and tactics for using the
pineapple and so get some focus on that
but I just wanted to you know use this
hangout as an opportunity to kind of
reboot the pineapple you know you go to
a configuration advanced
now and and introduce sad than the 300
firmware and the community and kind of
where we're going with this so that's
too much fun cool well that has been fun
we will see the rest of you guys on IRC
and for the live stream i'm darren
kitchen i'm sebastian and we'll see you
on yeah yeah here I'm gonna make this do
this thing because it's fun to do the
thing at the crane thing its crane</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
