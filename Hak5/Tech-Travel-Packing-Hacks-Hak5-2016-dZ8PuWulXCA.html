tech tips this time on hack 5 hello
welcome hack 5 my name is darren kitchen
my name is shannon moory it's your
weekly dose of technology and we're
finally back in the studio
it's lucky to be here yeah it's a while
but hike across the planet was awesome a
whole month so just finally stop
adventure yeah yes thank you to
everybody who came out to Tokyo and met
up with me and thank you to everyone who
came out and visited Darren in Australia
so it was really cool to meet so many
people from other countries it was
amazing it's nice that we can like just
do this and connect with people and I've
been doing this for the last ten years
between hack across America and hacker
cough syrup and now we're just kind of
expanding it to like look we love
connecting with our audience yeah and as
such for the last 10 years we have done
a lot of travel we have learned a lot
about ways to travel as geeks as hackers
as tech enthusiasts because we love our
gear yeah and we've been meaning to do
this show for quite some time so it's
perfect opportunity now having come back
from these trips to do a little post op
like hey what do we bring him over
they're gonna do a show and tell what
worked yeah right all the tech that
worked and all the crap that we should
have left behind obviously this has been
a long time coming between all of these
tours that we've been doing and I'd say
that after 10 years we've gotten I
wouldn't say good but much better yeah
travel yeah I have to agree with let's
do a techno last gear review give you
guys our impressions on some of these
things that we brought add what worked
what didn't ok so we should say profess
preface this by saying that we're going
to go through everything pretty quickly
but we'll have Amazon links to
everything so if you see something that
you like you can purchase it and we I
use an Amazon affiliates link so any of
that will contribute directly to my my
blogging and blogging the snowb spending
this which by the way have you not seen
the snubs channel go to hack 5 go to
youtube.com/scishow crimes scroll to the
bottom you wanna see videos from Japan
yeah - really pretty cool stuff alright
I would say the majority of my tech is
camera gear oh of course
right off the bat finger documentary
work you're going to do something really
cool you want to save the experience you
want to
to the moment and like but we've had a
closer with cool 360 and VR and that's
where we're gonna go ahead and start off
we've been talking about 360 photography
for some weeks back and I wanted to
point out that yes I am still rocking
the rake of theta this is about 350
bucks
it takes 360 degree photos and video it
fits in your pocket which means it goes
everywhere unlike some of the larger
rigs which take more beautiful photos
but they don't fit in your pants and if
it's not in your pants then it's not
with you when you see that epic thing
like deer that you can pet at a local
deer park look there you go apparently
that's a thing nice I could I was
petting deer oh it was amazing oh yeah I
can't oh come on they call them
kookaburras come on - right at the
Pokemon Center
okay these are actual Birds the cuckoo
bears okay moving on it well the thing
about this camera is you know while it's
very portable it requires some
accessories if you want to get a
photographic doesn't include your thumb
yeah because of the placement of this
button and the way that you have to hold
it and like it takes weird photos so
what you want to do is put it on a
tripod and then walk away but you can't
just put it on a tripod because we've
got the tripod legs so you need to put
on a monopod but monopod that can stand
up and if you've got monopod then you
can turn it into a giant selfie stick in
them
throw it over the waterfall and you can
get really cool photographs okay so what
was your answer
alright so my answer to this is the Mon
photo I love the men freddo gear yeah
this is their compact extreme two-in-one
monopod and pole which basically just
means that you've got your
quarter-twenty both on the top which is
your thread for your tripod as well as
on the bottom ou means that you can put
the camera on either end and so what I
do is I flip it upside down and put the
camera on this end I extend the poles
out to whatever they need to end up
being and then on the bottom I use a
combination of gear first of all this is
the novoflex this right here is it as an
amazing tripod you need to get yourself
one of these just because if you need a
tripod on the go this is where it's at
because the thing weighs to do and he
has a scale onset yes 50 grams so for 50
grams this is really worth it because
what happens is you end up taking the
legs out it's like tinker toys and then
plugging them into the side so yeah it
requires a little bit more setup but
talking 50 grams for a tripod that has
the ability to carry this monopod the
way that you do that is you grab
yourself a little coupler here and so
I'll have links to these you know
barreled parts but basically this is a
quarter tone barrel call it means that
now my monopod just became a tripod well
and I do the same thing with the camera
on the top of there and there we go okay
be very careful with this because you
may end up doing what I did
trying to get an epic shot of a Buddha
and then knocking your nun photo with
your tripod destroying your $350 360
camera oh ouch yay
I'm sorry that happened it's okay yogi
is out and the LG is less expensive now
so and the Samsung gear VR I believe
just came out recently which is like the
size of a softball so it well it may fit
in your pocket you might look on does it
called the Samsung gear the gear 360 360
okay yeah okay so moving on from there
did you bring an actual real-world
camera yeah this is a real camera it's a
toy I did and actually this is one that
I've been feeling very passionately
about for years because I used to be a
huge fan of the rubble line then I the
t2 why the t5 I yeah fantastic DSLR
cameras you throw yourself like a Tamron
lens on there with image stabilization
you get yourself like a you know F 1.8
they're huge
yeah right they don't go in your pocket
no it's done the Sony rx series the
rx100 I've been using this since the
mark 1 this is the mark to the mark
sorry the mark 3 the mark 4 is out right
now it's like $1,000 but before you gasp
a pocket camera being so expensive this
isn't just a regular pocket camera I
mean it's got you know your cool
features that you find in pocket cameras
so you know LCD that flips out but
between the EVF here you can actually
end the lens you can take real
photographs it's almost as good as a
micro four-thirds fall has a huge sensor
we're talking like f 2.8 across the
gamut I think it is I think it's like 18
to 70 millimeters so okay fairly decent
zoom and the other nice thing for me
thinking about it in terms of video is
that it shoots AVC HD in at least 17
megabits per second which means you end
up with a high quality video file really
useful good image stabilization the only
the only accessory that I actually use
with this is mounted on the bottom right
here and this is the Manfrotto pocket
series tripod and it's like the best 15
bucks you can spend if you have a
compact camera tripod boom and then you
know just there you go and you're ready
to go
done and done and it just kind of lives
on the bottom of there okay but this I
actually didn't bring what did you bring
it is 3 this is 350 grams so you have to
be Darin and grams
yes you want to be a street price will
black tar heroin in Chicago and then buy
yourself a gram scale on Amazon make
sure you do them right after each other
so that when the NSA is it's a really
bad idea yeah anyway the point is my
phone became my primary camera Oh as far
as my phone is concerned the accessories
that I need for that are really only two
things why first of all you want to get
yourself if it's not a waterproof phone
already as more and more becoming that
this will become less necessary okay
this is by giotto and it's the best
eight bucks I've spent on you know
camera protection because we had the
opportunity for instance to do a little
jet skiing in the gold coat on it was
awesome so you know there's sab like
rocking it oh my god to try and like fun
times so for eight bucks to mean that
you can actually get some photographs
and look like a dork while you're
getting them yeah well you know that's
good it's better than having somebody
swipe your stuff while you're you know
chillin in the water and they're on the
beach there you go the other major
accessory that I highly recommend in
fact if there's one piece of gear that I
would take away from this entire segment
it's this and it's like 20 bucks it is
by Joby
the people that make the gorilla pod
yeah and this is the grip tight micro
and so it's basically just a little tiny
fold up tripod
that will grab your smartphone right so
if you want to get all you know fancy
with that which is fantastic if you have
something that will do long photography
but this folds up into as you can see
nothing cool and actually it's two
pieces so a lot of the times I'll use
this in conjunction with some other
parts like for instance my man Fredo now
I just hook up this piece and I can
carry my phone on that Manfrotto as a
selfie stick or just this in my like you
know change your cigarette lighter
pocket or whatever have you I keep this
to go in conjunction with the the 360
camera to like be able to leave that
somewhere with confidence that the wind
isn't going to knock it over yeah so as
far as like my go-to like this little
tripod guy lives in my jacket and it's
amazing okay so what did you bring for
audio okay so for audio actually this is
both a camera and an audio thing this is
is the mango bluetooth drum it is a
bluetooth speaker is a teeny tiny
Bluetooth it's a bluetooth speaker that
weighs thirty seven and a half grams him
and his grams and it actually makes some
pretty decent music which is really nice
because if you're spending a month
traveling to be able to listen to your
favorite playlist in the hotel room good
for the mental health but also it
doubles as a shutter button so if you're
doing some photography where you're
trying to like hide behind a rock you
know trying to get out of frame yeah
well at the same time get capturing that
cool photo it has a shutter button cool
that's kind of cool it weighs nothing is
fifteen bucks and it just kind of goes
in my bag for mental health because you
know well ya know music it's okay cool
and from there did you bring any beer
yeah another cheap thrill is the is
these mini VR glasses people keep asking
me where these were from this is by this
particular one is branded hamid there's
a bunch of these out there but i'll link
to these they're 15 bucks so basically
what you do is after you take your VR
photos and download them to your phone
you can now just clip this on and
there's a couple of alternatives to
these out there you're going to look
dorsally pretty cool it's awesome in
that you
share the experience instead of just
like spanning around the VR photo on
your phone you can hand it to someone at
the bar and they can be like oh that's
that crazy dorky thing and then they
look like a dork and they love it yeah
so it's pretty cool actually it's kind
of a fun one it's thankfully pretty
light we're talking a 21 grams so I
don't know I'd say worth it if you've
got the extra room and then since you
were filming stuff did you bring a
external mic yes that is huge
in fact this this kind of goes back to
very first episode of hak5 and that is
just understanding that audio is like
90% of video yeah it's nice that this is
well lit but honestly if you couldn't
hear us if we were using the internal
mics on these cameras you wouldn't be
tuning in it's because we're wearing
labs and from day one so I'm a huge
believer in the lab I mean shotguns have
their place but this is this is branded
by mo vu and there's a bunch of these
out there but basically this is a lav
mic that has a very special tip that's
made for smartphones I have to make sure
your Android or if your iPhone that you
get the appropriate one yep but when I
plug this into my phone it shows up as
microphone just regular external
microphone and now when I take videos I
can have good audio with those and I've
used these in the field before I was in
Amsterdam doing a field shoot for threat
wire
oh yeah this came in handy so I don't
know you can find these for like fifteen
to forty dollars and if you're doing any
sort of video work you have to have this
because the internal mic in whatever it
is you have is crap and I saw that you
brought some Bose headphones is that
true oh yeah
the QuietComfort 20 sub turned me on to
these damn you say cuz yeah they're
amazing and they're expensive and I was
just swore by I used to swore I used to
swear by costs the plug headphones
they're like 15 bucks and they're in
here and just their like ear plugs you
squish them down and they sound great
and it's what I used on hack across
America on the motorcycle in some states
where it's legal to motorcycle with uh
with headphones yeah long stretches
across Nevada let me tell you and so um
these change everything yeah they're
really sudden I haven't a crying child
behind you yeah kind of disappears yeah
just it's nice not having to listen to
the plane noise the entire ten-hour
flight to Japan I mean I don't mind the
roar of a Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney orgy for you
in a while but for 13 hours drive me
nuts
mmm so this is airplane sanity another
airplane sanity piece of kit is a Kindle
just a simple Kindle paperwhite in fact
I would even say like get the one with
the ads and hack it there's these are
you know what can I actually say
honestly Shannon what I need to like
gift this or sell it or something
seriously I just switched using my phone
because it's already got the data
connection really and it's already in my
pocket yeah I am I very much scrutinize
all this tech and I'm showing you a lot
of gear here but I very much scrutinized
things where I have to really like put
into play its size its weight its value
and if there's anything else in my gear
that can do the same thing so for
instance I didn't bring my rx100 yeah
because my phone my s7 edge takes almost
as good photos in similar light yeah
same thing with the Kindle I'm getting
you know like a pretty decent experience
just off the Kindle app so I don't know
I would say like I mean this photo right
here is from my phone right and so yeah
I would say you can take photos like
that from your phone I don't know Iran
okay and any accessories for your phone
or for the pictures yeah this is a this
a really fun one the Polaroids it is a
really cool interesting key tech it is
this is basically a photo printer what's
really nice about this photo printer in
addition to being pretty cheap at 130
bucks you Bluetooth your phone to it
you're able to print photos that are
also stickers so this right here that's
the lead really nice full bleed all the
way it's the exact sizes of a business
card and what that means for me a lot of
times small business I will just go
ahead and like put that in my journal
yeah so it's nice to be able to have
some context when I'm looking back at my
journal to be able to see like oh this
is that time I was at that waterfall
blah blah
and that's pretty cool um I shipped it
back halfway through the trip because
because you weren't using it I was knew
you weren't gonna use that I know and I
used it a ton in Honolulu but it did not
use it at all in Gold Coast I think I
just broke your thing
oh no it's - what'd you do this is a
really bad what is that it's a mouse it
is the the sense a mouse recon anyway
it's a fifty dollar Mouse bluetooth and
you just flip it over like that and lock
it in place and then what you've got I
need some Mouse yes oh that's in I mean
it weighs nothing and it why'd you bring
your mouse because I do a lot of
illustrator work on what your phone no
I'm my on my oh you brought your mother
yeah I brought my laptop so I gotcha
I brought the surface pro for I'm still
getting used to it I'm not a hundred
percent sure I do like how well it has
been running VMs I would say that oh
that's good I was afraid because it's a
dual-core not a quad-core that I wasn't
going to be able to run as many VM yeah
- yeah but as far as my machine primary
use for creative work illustrator
Photoshop premier loving that I actually
didn't bring the mouse because you know
you can get similar results out of the
pen because the Adobe suite is now like
touch happy so nice there you go so any
other tech that you brought that's not
necessarily up here well there's a
pineapple yeah I was about to say like
of course I'm not going anywhere without
my panel I didn't bring the tetra I
didn't necessarily need five gigahertz
where I was going yeah and the this is
actually our new edition of the nano
tactical which includes these these
antenna upgrades that make them internal
so they sit inside of the case which
means no chance of those antennas
getting caught by anything it's just
like a really nice package I use this a
lot of times to relay Wi-Fi in the hotel
room thing and that nature it's almost
like my primary Linux box when I'm
traveling with a surface to just you
know Wi-Fi connect to SSH into it so
yeah definitely cool that is in your
wheelhouse I'm rocking a pineapple I
figure okay is that everything that's
everything for me um
and yeah okay yeah before I start
murdering all the darlings isn't my oh
gosh is it my turn to show and tell
yes okay all right cuz shannon has a
different philosophy than me obviously
that's okay so it's your primary camera
uh well mine's a little bit different in
a little bit larger Wow yes it's the
sony a7r - this one I bought just the
body only it's three thousand dollars
that's a huge trade-off in size yeah an
equal and price and quality isn't but I
mean this guy your candle to it as far
as the grass edible quality shoots and
rods
buta beautiful we're doing as double of
civilization I was so that was the thing
that I wanted to get out of this trouble
and that's why I bought this I bought
this for Japan so this is the whole
reason I got it so I brought this along
with this F 1.8 55 millimeter lens and I
also brought a separate lens which is a
24 to 240 millimeters so this one's
great for architecture this one was
awesome for portraits I really like
portraits at 55 it's a great scale that
you can get or focal length so I'll talk
about this bag in just a second because
it's a really really nice bag for
photography people and it requires that
whole bag if you want to carry that
camera but surely there's a camera that
you brought that doesn't require a bag
did ya let me find it this GoPro Hero 4
so this is the GoPro Hero 4 silver it's
really nice it has this little monitor
on the back so you can see everything
through the screen while you're taking
the pictures which I love that they
finally included that on GoPro cameras
to get a lot of use of yours cuz I
almost brought the session and then the
last minute just ditched it for wait I
didn't I didn't use it barely at all so
I it was really just a waste of a tiny
bit of space a few grams if you will see
all those grams add up yeah it wasn't
worth it for me to bring it but I have
used it in the past for like you know
going to places where I'm swimming
underwater and stuff like that because
that's very useful for my camera
I brought the slick mini this is a
tripod it's about 60 bucks on Amazon and
the thing about this guy is it truly is
many it's not human size it's not going
to be human tall too
we want something like 55 inches or so
in fact and this one's 43 - do you we
use the 55 inch variation of the slick
it's amazing and it's it's kind of been
our go-to for years as far as like value
for the functionality and the weight of
it so I wasn't planning to take pictures
of people with my tripod but I did end
up taking a lot of pictures like from my
hotel room of you know the Tokyo sky sky
viewing stuff like that how did you get
absolutely beautiful
yeah I'll post him on like Instagram and
stuff so you guys can see him quickly
came out really really well
I got a splitter it was like five bucks
for audio because you know I need to
split audio so me and my hubs can watch
the same movies well wrong place Bob's
house none subs that account on Twitter
it's mr. snubz mr. Steve don't tell
anybody I shared that on hack 5 okay it
doesn't watch the show it's okay no it
doesn't it's I know so I get say
whatever I want
anchor they have USB hub it's 40 watt
they do have an upgrade that's 60 watts
you I haven't gotten that one but this
one's 20 bucks it's really great to have
on hand it just plugs into the wall wart
like normal I've been using the 60 watt
I almost brought it yeah it's 150 grams
so oh no the surface grande power brick
USB port on it of course and then I have
a laptop that's another pro tip oh yeah
charging up the laptop does work but I
like this because of all the hubs and I
have all the USB things my GoPro has an
additional battery and this is the
charger for it it takes a mini USB so I
just bring that along with my little
case of all my little cables and yes
senior high five okay it's a hack five
there you go hack five tactical game
sorry microphone yeah so I just bring
this to keep everything organized and
I'm really really happy I brought this
with me because it was nice to organize
all those cables with you know them just
like at the bottom of my backpack not to
see you when you came up through the
field kit Sarah in the hack shop it's
like oh this is perfect for makeup oh it
is course it's totally perfect for
makeup too it's true but I don't have
another one for makeup because then I
would get them confused and knowing me I
would put the wrong one in the bathroom
so I just don't have it second one yes
the bose qc25 comforts - they are
entity on the plane of course the Hutu
wireless travel router or AP / battery
thing so this is a access point as well
as a battery do two and one you mean a
battery powered Wi-Fi acts exactly
different functionality is very
different functionality yeah I'm not I'm
not like man in the middle leg people or
anything like that
obviously in places where you're allowed
to so in this case I was using this to
plug into the lake hotel's Ethernet and
then VPN over to get into like whatever
I needed to get into because that was my
choice that was how I was able to get
you know data while I was in a different
country at the time and then I also use
it to get 10,000 milliamps per hour
battery out of this USB port so it was
nice to have this on hand and it's fully
charged together so it lasted a long
time really really happy with this
purchase and I plan to use it in the
future and one thing that I found
important like once during my trip was
this little tip tipper scale so this can
help you weigh your luggage so I wanted
to bring just carry ons that was my
thing just carry on I bring one backpack
and you're done well I'm a I'm a woman I
have makeup I have hair accessories I
have a lot of things I have additional
shoes so I brought my backpack and also
a carry on like suitcase alright so I
use this to make sure that on the way
back my stuff wasn't overweight don't
you just wait at the airport yeah but if
you find out that your stuff is
overweight oh they're gonna make you
check it and stuff at the airport yeah
no it's so instead I'll check it in my
hotel room and then since they never
weighed backpacks I put all the heavy
stuff in my backpack and put all the
light stuff in my suitcase and I'm like
yeah I mean the course this is under 10
pounds huh right Wow
 and in fact hang on it's a turtle
honey man it's a trial laughs how many
backpacks did you bring though one okay
wait Jack how many bags did you bring
three maybe better question how many
bags did you bring back uh
six that was Japan though right but you
had a friend bring you an entire checked
snow ace I was a choice that we both
made together he said do you think we'll
Dean additional suitcase because my
friend met me in Japan and I was like
yeah so cuz he like flies business
instead so he was like I'll just bring
an empty suitcase so we can just pack it
like crazy with souvenirs and I was like
okay so we came back with like lots of
sake so you really yeah like you know
how they limit you yeah I definitely
brought way more lots of sake so you you
left with like 60 80 liters of gear you
came back with like 200 liters yeah most
likely not just sake okay I just brought
carry-ons and just came back with
carry-ons he had to check the bag so
travel adapter of course can't live
without a travel adapter if you're going
overseas this is just an adapter not a
converter but it also has her battery in
it so I like the fact that this came
with a battery as well I was able to
plug it in on the airplane too and use
the outlets there through my own little
adapter which was super handy as far as
what I used to pack everything
I brought a backpack it's the Swiss
skier travel gear scan smart backpack
Budda Budda woo found this to be the
most comfortable for myself just you
know with my own stature everybody is
going to be different but I liked it got
it on sale for Black Friday as I do and
I also brought I know right I also
brought a carry-on spinner Dulcy helium
suitcase so this guy it's purple too hmm
this guy was super handy and very very
easy to use except for on the sub well
good it has four wheels it has four
wheels go and that was big for me and
then the time by I mentioned that I
would re mention this this is a great
handy bag for cameras especially small
cameras and it's small enough that I was
able to like carry it on my side and it
wouldn't drive me nuts
so the nice thing about this is yeah it
has these you know the the velcro sure
but it's also quite a Velcro so if you
slip it down it opens really quietly it
has a zipper on the top which is awesome
and then it also has this removable
lining for you know your your cameras
well I mean when you're bringing
$3,000 camera you should have a deist a
glory definitely and it comes with a
waterproof cover for it - which was
handy but I never needed it so that was
good
mm-hmm so that was about it Wow it's a
lot of gear a lot of gear but I was able
to pack everything into half of a
suitcase and a half of my backpack
I brought half of the gear on this table
and then I threw half of it away along
the way no I'm Jeff did ship a lot back
uh when we get back I'm going to talk to
you about my very alternative packing
philosophy and how you get to being
ultralight and it requires lots of
murder so we'll be right back no matter
where in the world you are when you have
a fantastic idea you need to bring it to
the Internet and do what Shannon and I
do and that is head over to domain comm
they've got this epic domain discovery
system that makes it super easy to find
the perfect domain name just for you and
their checkout process is incredibly
simple so you'll have your website up
and online in no time and the best part
is they have been supporting hak5 for so
many years that they have the hook-up
just for you it's called 20% off at
domain.com all you have to use is the
coupon code hak5 to take advantage of
that and you know what you should tweet
them at domain.com and say hey thanks
for supporting hack 5 all these years
when you think domain names think
domain.com we're back and darren is
going to share his philosophy with
packing yes I'm working but packing hey
it's a package check here you go this is
your packing hiking you should have put
that in the cold open Shannon look at us
podcasters I have been doing this for a
while and I've been doing it wrong a lot
here is a photograph just I'm not
podcasting both podcasting and traveling
here's me miserably in Berlin with a
gigantic backpacking backpack a big
mountaineering backpack on my back and
you can't tell it from my face but I am
miserable and there's one reason for it
it's called the Lenovo t42 antic
external battery and a power brick
that's like this big and next thing you
know you're like wondering why you're
like you know carrying around like 40
kilograms and you're like anyway yep get
it so by doing the wrong way I've
learned to pare down and live without
and
out it's it's much simpler than you
might think you didn't do wrong or
anything we all teach their own but this
is kind of the this is what I've come to
like like if there's one thing that I
would have done different as far as like
because your photos way better than mine
I would have brought like one of our
tactical bags with the camera for that
is totally separate system all right but
in that I was really just going for
ultra light I would say start with the
backpack I love that backpack thank you
I love this backpack - very nice just
get yourself like a nice pack or a
JanSport or whatever okay
whatever small backpack and the reason
for that is if you start with the gear
then you'll end up going with some
massive backpack to fit it all yes all I
gear you'll want to bring but you don't
actually need it so start with the
backpack first that you'll want to
actually put on your back you're like
hey this is extra small uncomfortable
and something around 20 litres yeah and
then boom after that you'll you'll
figure out how to make it work I think
in the future I'm gonna go with a
backpack like that the reason why I
brought a larger backpack was because I
was planning to bring home so many
souvenirs I wanted space Shannon went to
steal to just bring homes I pretty much
took home the entire neighborhood of
Cuba basically um if you yeah and that's
the thing is like just like a small
backpack not a big mountaineering
backpack those are great for
mountaineering the great like they've
got one but they're not good for for
urban travel because they've just got
one giant pocket and they're yeah and
all your stuff when it gets mixed up and
you end up being that guy don't make
yourself a huge mark you know you'll end
up looking stupid trust me I've done it
uh so anyway don't be that tourist get
yourself like a very comfortable
backpack and if you can one with a
laptop sleeve yeah not just because it
protects your laptop but also because it
adds some rigidity on the back of the
laptop which is fantastic and so some
extra compartments nice as well so once
you have all of that done what you'll
want to do then is to lay everything out
and this is everything and actually this
is everything before I started removing
things everything I wanted to bring
especially in the top-left really wanted
to bring you did bring the cat right I
wanted to pull bad it turns out
Australia doesn't let you like bring
weird animals to their country and they
won't let you take in
of the Kangaroos oh that's just so like
what's that you can bring part back
parts of kangaroos we'll get to that so
grab yourself your backpack lay
everything out and then basically what
you want to do is categorize things so
for example I have everything laid out
here in categories of my tech as well as
my clothing and my toiletries and then
go into subcategories be it your camera
gear your SDR gear your your computers
and whatnot and then weigh everything
individually I know I'm crazy I weigh
everything individually rather than just
weigh the whole tie entire bag because
then you put much more of a value on it
and suddenly you're like do I really
need to bring this 400 gram thing that
all it does is charge my stuff when I
could just charge off my laptop and save
400 grams when in all that's mine you
know if like you're going to spend 400
grams on anything in this 360 camera
weighs 120 come on
so like oh man this value per gram
that's me I'm crazy I know then test to
everything what won't fit ditch it and
start murdering your darlings which is a
quote from William Faulkner actually
it's not it's misattributed but the idea
is that you would proceed objectively
without any sentiment towards your gear
meaning I feel emotionally attached to
it you'll need that thing that you have
that emotional attachment to in fact
attachment is a totally different thing
but like less of it is good I would say
clothing wise this is just me and this
is a totally separate segment has
nothing to do with tech but I'm the four
pear guy so yeah what you know what I'm
wearing plus through spare get yourself
biodegradable castor oil get some
paracord to make a clothesline and
castor oil yes where's that come in it's
soap soap yes you're going to clean
along the way and then compression to
actually your friends and you want
multiple compression sacks because you
want one specifically for dirty and only
for dirty and next is up and know which
one is which okay yeah that out of the
way basically you want to leave your bag
30% empty you can later fill it up with
souvenirs yes like like when you brought
home kangaroo scrotum that's so weird
dude it's
the official it says it's a genuine
Australian souvenir so thank you did you
buy that from a tourist no this is
because HACC labs loves us thank you I
feel honored you can you can keep those
on your side of the table also known
anyone touching them another fun one is
you know knowing your threat actor
talking about all this gear fitting it
into your backpack what I like to do is
use some use carabiner use all your
Meanor on your zippers and so the idea
here is all you're doing is you're just
Caribbean airing the two zippers to each
other so that they don't easily open up
and a locking carabiner is nicer but
basically what I'm saying is as opposed
to those TSA locks which are a joke and
you can print the key with a 3d printer
and basically the whole idea is to just
not be low hanging fruit because of a
pickpocket once you get your bag and
suddenly they have to get through a
carabiner you're not worth it so that's
that that is security to the one there
so I believe last off we have a couple
of tips as far as different things that
you can use and some apps yeah so let me
go ahead and log out of my account so
you can't see all of my information
about upcoming lights I'm like what is
she doing you're a huge fan of this one
sir yeah so I'll tell you a quick story
I was basically landing at I believe it
was a layover flight and my flight was
delayed so I knew that I was going to
miss my next one and everybody else did
on the entire plane and I was super
stressed out so as soon as we landed I
turned back on my data and I got a text
from this company they're called TripIt
you can find him at TripIt comm they
texted me and they were like you're
gonna miss your flight here's the phone
number for your for like United or
whoever it was so I was immediately able
to call from my seat still on the plane
like taxing to the Kate I called them
and I was like hey I'm missing my flight
can I get a new ticket on the next
flight available and they were like yes
so they just had me go to customer
service to pick up my ticket and it was
ready to go so I don't think I asked
them to email it to me I should have
done that
would say me even more time but since
that happened I was the first one with a
ticket everybody else was racing out the
door to get in line at customer service
so that they could get tickets chances
are they would probably end up on
standby well I already had one I had a
seat so this this app does more than
just that but it's yeah for managing
your yeah so trip it or trip it pro
which is the $49 version I use TripIt
pro but you don't have to it basically
tracks what's happening on your next
upcoming flights so you can set it up
with different trips you just email them
your flight itinerary along with like
hotels and taxis or whatever kind of
services you need to use while you're
there and it'll list everything for you
and it'll send you notifications if
anything changes if there's delays or if
there's a better seat on your flight or
whatever it might be I find it really
useful I've been using it for a few
years so I'm a big big fan of them and
then you recommended Hipmunk correct
yeah I'm a big fan of Hipmunk adjust in
that it's kind of one of those like
go-to I don't want to think I just want
to swipe and have the hotel booked yeah
it has an animated gif of a hip little
chipmunk that spins around and stuff
well it's everything is being booked and
so I don't know the better way to
explain it is just that you don't have
to enter in all of your information
every time that you have something and
just that in of itself the amount of
convenience that that adds reduce stress
and so much happier
speaking of reducing stress - okay last
few tips okay yes in fact I didn't
realize that we were both firm believers
in the bows that's on my list of life
there's others there's other ones that
are out there that are noise reduction
technology or noise canceling technology
all those are tÃ©cnicos are like a third
the price and almost as good yeah so all
right there's all sorts of options
available
I should review them on tech thing there
you go that's good stuff
that is just like a sanity one and props
except for for tuning us into those just
final little tiny tips before we get out
of here people keep asking about this
and you can't I learned this on hack
across America and motorcycle you want
something over your neck when you're on
the motorcycle and as it turns out you
know a bandana or handkerchief or
whatever have you is awesome for
everything including going over your
eyes when you're trying to sleep
having headphones on and plane is really
bright and everything and so just yes
fantastic for so many things I like
melatonin for if I'm trying to get sleep
on a plane melatonin is awesome because
it is also wine not at the same time
I've got a funny story for an after show
so the uh oh man sorry you totally
derailed me with this this whiskey story
the point being melatonin while awesome
for putting you to sleep on a plane or
otherwise check to make sure as it turns
out in Australia it's a controlled
substance
so are you serious yeah what it's over
the counter here so anyway you just have
to make sure that you're checking the
right box it happens to be the same
boxes are you bringing in firearms so
interesting conversations there that
brings up border agents when speaking
with bird agents have the utmost respect
and charm and when they ask you what
you're in the country for just say your
beer new women varying results
especially in Heathrow the guy yeah
today guys
hmm well we've got some nice ciders ha
oh really really that happened and then
finally uh if you're back in a pineapple
just wanted to point out that you really
want to upgrade and that's not me up
telling you that's me telling you that
if you bring in the mark one it ends up
looking like a grenade on the x-ray yeah
firsthand so anyway thought I'd lend on
something like so yeah I think that is
about it so we'll go ahead and wrap up
