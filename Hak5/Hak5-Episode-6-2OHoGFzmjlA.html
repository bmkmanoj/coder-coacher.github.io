I'm just um done with you I'm totally
done you Frank Frank
here's a game laptop right shove it all
to the guy look out quick wait honey I
didn't cause you've been that somebody
make happy in that quit John John he's
awake he's not he's got to to your night
whoa man you're right a weird dude yeah
drink all right let's go get a drink
what do you wanna go check no regrets is
great let's go let's go
all right tech TV this place had some
real memories for me my name is Leo
Laporte you may remember me from such
shows if the screen savers would call
for help
well that's all over now they're taking
the place down and folding it up frankly
at 76 six years old I'm too old for this
thank God hack fives here to take over
kids
everybody welcome to hack point five I'm
your host Wes and I'm Darren if this is
your first time tuning in hack point
five is a technology of variety show for
the hacker the mod or the coder and the
do-it-yourself geek in all of us and we
like to wrap all that tasty information
in a light tech humor blanket and bring
it to you on the 5th of every month in
this episode John's gonna bring us a
coding challenge I'm doing a mod with a
laser and an iPod he's also going
downtown with Harrison for late
afternoon hack Andy here gives us a nice
VNC install tip that'll make your
network administration just to touch
easier so let's go ahead and get this
party started
Cheers one of the things that we like to
do between episode releases is hang out
on our forms one of the fans on our
forums have posted a coding challenge in
fact this is one of many coding
challenges that we've had on our site
this one is by husband inspired by wet
electric and the code challenge is to
input N and K and the output should be
the number of possibilities you can add
k numbers so that the given a result of
n I don't know anything about code so
with me here is John who's just taking
the code challenge and was he an e yeah
I checked out the forums I looked at it
I said you know this is actually gonna
be a lot of fun
so there's actually at work yes I was at
work coding something I shouldn't have
been but that's okay we'll leave that
out we're living yeah we could for
living said it doesn't matter alright
and I was actually with one of the guys
I programmed with and we were like okay
well let's see he can do this the
fastest unfortunately I lost he beat me
but he's much sharper C++ programmer and
since part of the rules was still in C++
I went ahead and did it so we did get it
finished we got it complete this is
actually the code for for it written in
C++ can you explain to me what exactly
okay yeah I probably and now you can
realize what programmers actually go
through you know like the develop
management gives you this and you have
to build something completely different
so basically you're going to be
accepting two variables there's input of
two variables n and K or whatever you
decide to call it then based on that for
example n I get the value Ted K is going
to give me the value 3
I have to come up with three values that
will equal the value 10 so for example
we have 8 plus 1 plus 1 okay that's
three values okay what else could equal
to 10 5 plus 4 plus 1 exactly and
basically have to come up with all the
combinations that will okay I'm with
that rosette to come up with that result
but it's not just 10 and 30 yet to come
up with every possible solution oh wow
yeah so but it was a lot of fun a lot of
fun so we're gonna go ahead and dip into
the code this this is C++ I did rewrite
in PHP but all that information will be
there for you so is the challenge of the
code to get it done in the least amount
of lines or is it the most finesse what
is it actually it's a mixture of both
this is this is something a little
different I'm actually gonna challenge
the viewers Oh showers of viewers yes
now I purposely I didn't purposely like
you know make this could bad but I after
writing it they're actually excuse me
after Tolly wrote it and I went up and
clean it because television when he did
actually finished all the code and then
I went back and cleaned it we noticed a
lot of cool areas where we could really
clean this up like optimize you can
totally optimize I'm sure a lot of our
viewers are gonna go oh yes I really you
know I really hope the viewers can come
in and just hack away and there are a
lot of spots where the viewers can can
come and clean this up so we're gonna
I'm gonna go over a few points that will
help the viewers get started we this is
written C++ like I said we did use the
sta libraries vectors and we also use
the algorithm so we used you know your
iOS stream back there and algorithm
header files so that we can use those
classes next we're just going to create
a few vectors however I'm gonna give you
a few a few hints to what we did first
off we used recursion now you probably
have no idea what that recursions are
very it's a very basic thing but it can
get become very complicated like GNU
like yeah yeah it's because GNU is not
Unix
okay it's back to the port recursion is
basically have a function and then you
call itself yeah you call itself and
basically it just calls itself over and
over again but it does it's not an
endless function or endless for loop it
actually has a stopping point and it
sounds pretty complicated it can be but
it can also be very simple so we did use
recursion you may want to keep that in
mind when you are building this
application and let me see what are a
few points that I can bring out to help
the viewers we use vectors we use
iterators if you decide to do this in
PHP you're not gonna need your iterator
so you have your 4-h with anybody yeah
they could come into any language yes so
I've got C++ version for you I've got a
PHP version for you and we're so I want
to see in Perl
I want like yeah all the funky
semicolons and yeah so the challenge is
for you guys and I guess we'll go from
there and great so if you'd like to show
John up and tears coats too bit go ahead
and log on to the forum's hak5 org slash
forums and take the coding challenge
John thanks so much for the awesome code
I cannot wait to test it out of my own
network and coming up next I think what
is getting a hands dirty on cents
so the problem that was presented to me
a few weeks ago back when I was at my
party is that I needed to play music
from my computer to my stereo that way
anybody could just walk in and click you
know song in the playlist without having
like burn a CD or a whole bunch of CDs
and keep them like next to the stereo
there's a couple of solutions but I
wanted to do it wirelessly that way I
want to run wires all the way across my
apartment because I'm a neat freak and
that will not fly in my apartment and be
because the longer the cable and in this
case would be a really long cable the
worse the signal degradation gets so I
went out I'm a sucker went out and
bought air tunes which plugs right into
the stare at the stereo receiver and I
can play music wirelessly from iTunes
the only problems this sets this sets me
back about $150 so Wes kindly reminded
me that I'm a noob and as a leader and
much cheaper way to do this and it's
really cool because it involves lasers
letters what is the device the pulse
lasers okay basically what we've done is
take a pen laser pointer and using
amplitude modulation we'll be able to
carry our audio signal from our source
to our receiver across the room okay
this is like direct line-of-sight yeah
absolutely
okay well where'd you first hear about
it picked it up on I hacked calm but the
original article was from a website that
side toys calm made by a guy named Simon
field okay well I see a lot of little
parts here um do you think you could
explain to me and viewers what they are
and how is it awesome we can get them
sure all right starting off we actually
picked up the laser pointer here from
think the thinking thank you say
something good registered yeah awesome
no think get calm he ran about 10 bucks
there okay so we've got that and then
I've relocated the batteries from the
laser pointer into this box here this
came from rat Shack okay RadioShack and
now you can run these parallel though we
just chose to a battery pack to make it
easier to a wire right yeah this just
makes life a lot a lot more Sunday cool
and I have to ask this question yes it's
not the full laser pointer you just hang
out no no there's a whole barrel that
goes behind this and that's what the
batteries really for my story but this
was a part number two seven no 3398 be
okay and then we've got a
nature audio output transformer this is
part 273 1380 okay and this is this is
all for the actual transmitter half okay
then we need to receive yeah and then
for the receiver we've got one of these
CAD cadmium sulfide photocells
cadmium Academy over photocells this is
276 16:57 double-a battery because this
is more like a resistor it's not it's
not like a solar cell that actually
creates electricity this will just vary
how much is going through so we need a
double-a battery
these are plugged into mic input well
ones are our source which would be like
a headphone jack and then one would be
an input like I like I might have a
little switch here yeah a little toggle
switch that I decided that I wanted to
pick up for this because you like
switches I do like switches and the flaw
I saw on this man's original design was
that uh
once it's all wired together the lasers
just on oh okay so you don't have to
like unplug it and plug it back in later
you want to use it well I mean it yeah
you just switch on/off got it done cool
well I guess we should just head on into
the heck and do it yeah so starting off
we've hacked up the laser pointer here
and what we have to do is run our wires
and different directions okay we come
we're gonna come straight off of the hot
line of the battery pack here and then
this will just get attached directly to
the laser pointer itself okay so for the
time being we'll just kind of twist it
on right here I'm going to solder all
these connections here shortly
that just gets tied on to anywhere that
there's you know the positive is okay
gotcha and you just have to pay
attention to how that is per your laser
pointer all right so that's just a
direct line and then from there we take
our negative side and that runs to one
side of our audio transformer right here
just like that and then the other
negative gets bridged from the battery
pack to the transformer and we'll just
twist this connection together
and I know it looks like a tangled mess
you can take a lot more time and make it
neat stick it in a hobby box housing
right yeah get a hobby box from Radio
Shack and make it look pretty
catching let me take a look at this I
can follow you yeah take a look at it
this way I mean there's that's just a
really simple thing right there okay
there's our continuous loop and then on
the other side on art now there's two
sides to this there's a thousand ohm or
excuse me a thousand milli ohm something
like something like that I can't
remember exactly and then there's an 8
ohm side to this so this is this is the
output yeah this is the output and this
is the 8 ohm side okay and that's
decided with only two wires are red and
a white okay right there easy enough
yeah and that just goes to a standard
Jack like this you can go comes up from
right inside of this little red housing
they can it's not positive or negative
you can just point out either side as
far as I tell ya as long as you keep all
your side straight in a uniform then it
won't be any problem very good and I've
got all those connections inside of
there soldered it takes about maybe 15
20 minutes depending upon how fast you
work to get this side done okay
and then our receiver over here is of
course our double-a battery as a power
source then we've got the little photo
Salladhor so photocell right here okay
just like you solar cells and like
powerhouse of it right if we have like a
million so anyway that you know and this
this polarity doesn't matter on this
side either okay so you just run one
line from the battery pack to the
photocell photo cell to your jack you
plug and then back from that jack to the
battery over here I mean that's all
there really is to it and then you can
wire the switch in on the hot side over
here
that's not an actual phone that's an
optional thing you know I'll do it for
my own purposes later right gotcha
well should we test it out is it ready
to go as it is right now yeah pretty
much is all right well we haven't have
not happy to have we put it here ahead
of time yeah purposefully
hey stereo yeah let's pull it up and I
will let you take it over from there
alright so we've got our stereo right
here go ahead and turn it on
CDs the best thing no CD no right extra
sound going on so we will plug in the
music coming from the iPod yeah all we
got to do is soon-to-be it's laying
right now so now we just line up our
laser a lot laser sight hit the little
button I'm gonna turn the volume up see
if our listeners can hear that there we
go I hear it so in this case you have to
very steady hand but it wouldn't be too
hard to make a mount for it if you know
where it was and I had some binoculars
do this now that's pretty good I mean
sounds good sounds great that's okay
the only downfall is that as opposed to
you know something like err Tunes or
something make it yourself and you have
that line of sight problem but this is
much cooler than air toonsters can do
other things like blind people if you
really wanted it to you know yeah you
know if somebody starts effing with you
you know
music you just turn to the bank and bind
them yeah exactly that's a really cool
feature Wow this would you know be
something you know I mean it's not gonna
replace air tunes I'm sorry no but not
at this point it's it's for people that
want to do things like this for fun like
we do all the time
yeah that's really cool thanks a lot for
showing us all the pertinent information
will be available in the show notes and
hi-5 org slash forums yeah I guess
that's it cool music and I think that
sums it up thank you guys
alright so that was a really quick and
easy mod you know I'd pick that up on
the internet it's a lot of fun so up
next we've got our security we
pretty bad security
I like bad security yeah you know you
know Harrison it's charming in his own
special place and its own special elite
hacks or script kiddie yeah like we need
all these things owns yeah the owner
anyway let's go ahead and check out a
hack
all right so y'all might have recognized
this spot from episode 3 when we did our
art cache poisoning
Harrison here's getting ready to show us
another suite security loophole for
joining us is another just absolutely
beautifully talented hacker Isabel my
name is Isabel say hello Isabel so we
decided to do something a little bit
different today yeah this time around
instead of having a specific hack in
mind we went out in the field to find
out what was available to us
unfortunately this network is not on the
way memory network so it's not gonna be
a lot of fun so let's head down and find
a wireless network that is on the way
memory Network founded in 1693 by the
Reverend James Blea the College of
William and Mary is the second oldest
institution of higher learning in the
United States second to Harvard she's
gonna show us where the wireless
networks are you know I sort of feel bad
about owning William and Mary kids
because they don't really know any
better
so Isabelle has taken us all the way to
the college of women marry bookstore in
1862 during the American Civil War
drunken soldiers of the fifth
Pennsylvania Calvary set fire to the
Wren building reportedly in an attempt
to prevent Confederate snipers from
using it for cover I believe they have a
Wi-Fi access point here and not only
that but it's tied into the Wainwright
wireless network Wes weapons of mass
destruction please aah so the first step
in any successful attack is to run a
little bit of enumeration on the network
that way you can gather some information
about your target so we decided to run a
few in map scans so we could figure out
what systems were vulnerable normally
you need a key because you can jump on
the wireless network but they have a
device that are a piece of software that
authenticates you from a website now we
just happen to have a username and
password which yeah some things are
better left unsaid but if your student
number 1763 thank you so we're gonna
first find out our subnet and then run a
few in map scans so the first scan we
ran is a ping scan now that will show us
what computers and how many computers
are on the network I have a hard time
imagining that all of these computers
are wireless users because everybody is
on break so all the students are gone
there's nobody to use a wireless network
I have a feeling what it looks like is
they're using something like the
SonicWALL Soho 3 tzw which is integrated
Wireless into the firewall so the subnet
for the wireless can be set up to be the
same as the subnet for the wire
computers so what we see on our wireless
network connect is the same thing wired
the wired network the next game we ran
was a version scan which revealed the
application name and version of every
software and service that's running on a
particular computer and we did this
several times until we found a
vulnerable computer now this is
interesting I'm seeing this it's
actually really interesting there you go
I don't know why why in the world
somebody's got an Apache box up but it
looks like there's an old Apache server
running ok so the particular version of
Apache that was running on this computer
was 1.3.1 7 which is very old and also
susceptible
to numerous attacks why don't we jump on
the web and I'm gonna run a security
focus real quick and see if we can come
up with some sort of exploit for this
version of Apache security focus is a
great website that's not only hosted the
bug track mailing list but also has an
up-to-date list of exploits now some of
the other good site so you can check out
our exploit tree and packet storm
according to security focus Darren
you're gonna kill me
it looks like this was built in the
Metasploit now so I can see his face
already he doesn't want me to using
Metasploit alright you take over that
way he can't hurt he can't like yell at
me so I get yeah yeah okay alright so
you're gonna use Metasploit because it's
already on that computer the IP address
is okay so starting off with Metasploit
we have to decide which exploit we're
gonna use and we decided to go with the
Apache chunked win32 yep now the next
step is to set the remote host now the
remote host is obviously the target
computer that we will be exploiting and
from there we decided to do a show of
all the available payloads for our
particular exploit and we set it to the
win32 bind payload right now we have to
set the target that's which operating
system and version of the patch you were
going to be explaining we set the target
to zero which is the window windows
generic mobs brute force right and we
went ahead and executed the exploit but
this particular payload was a no-go it
did not work yep so what we did was
unset the payload and then reset it to
the win32 reverse shell now just as a
quick reminder if you're using the
reverse shell you have to make sure to
set your localhost your El host which is
your computer so that shell gets
reflected back to you
from there we executed the exploit and
bingo we have a sea prompt and Darwin
yep piece of cake there we are okay
alright so Metasploit has come in handy
and proves itself useful once again
interns like freaking out right now
because the last month but anyhow we've
got rid directory on this computer so
obviously the moral of this story is not
go exploit Apache but rather make sure
that you know who else is on your
network for example number one don't
ever ever ever use a school network
ever number two make sure that when you
do join a network you know who else is
on the network so you want to scan it
within map just like we didn't find out
who is vulnerable because the
vulnerabilities on a network affect you
directly if we were mean which were not
we could have chosen to take advantage
of that server we could have set it up
as a host for all types of other attacks
for example we could have made a whole
phishing site out of it and done DNS
poisoning to Spearfish certain users on
that network the other things we could
have done are endless
but make sure that you know who else is
on your network and what services are
running that way you can choose to not
be on that network if you know it's
vulnerable last month's trivia question
was incredibly long it was obscenely
long last month's trivia question was
like kind of an Easter egg hunt where
the viewers would go to a special URL
where they'd find a video question and
then the answer to the question was the
next part of the URLs appended to the
URL that URL took you to the next
question and so on and so forth that URL
if you're following along at home is
right along here yes this right here
right you're all through here and let's
get rid of that so that was actually
okay the last trivia question was at
midnight on the East Coast that would be
5:00 a.m. GMT correct On January 1st of
the new year
yes so that question was basically
matched the cast of AK v Harrison West's
John and myself with our respective
laptops answer that is I've got the Dell
gateway Harrison's got the IBM and John
has
back HP yes for sorry oh yes it's one of
those yeah so that was correctly
answered by Ilya yeah well yeah you're
Julia buddy congratulations so we're
gonna take the old poster that we had
the black-and-white right we're gonna
all sign us and we're gonna ship it up
at all Yahoo and New York right on this
month's trivia question in 1904 the Koch
curve one of the earliest fractal curves
appeared in what paper send your answers
to trivia hak5 org up next is our VNC
networking tip but first a word from our
sponsors meet Adrian he's a web
programmer but unlike other programmers
he's pulling his hair out trying to code
a new web application he's in TCL and
ColdFusion that's right Adrian you could
have had your app done yesterday
how'd you use the new Microsoft web 2.0
services framework integrate with new
open source XML JavaScript and
peer-to-peer dynamic Ajax the new
Microsoft web 2.0 services provides user

framework now available on cd-rom
welcome back to hack point 5 I'm here to
give you the code tip this time I want
to go into some JavaScript a lot of
times it's paying the but when you're
trying to view pages or do some
pagination really really fast instead of
doing this page request well I got a
trick for you let's go and get started
we are going to only use javascript in
HTML so we're going to go ahead and
create a function in JavaScript called
show page
ever you decide to do and it's going to
accept an ID next we're going to create
a variable it's gonna have the total
number of pages now there's a lot of
flexibility where you can change this
where it's set dynamically I went ahead
and set it to 2 since the HTML is only
going to be handling two pages next
we're going to go ahead and create a for
loop this is a really cool trick when
you're managing lots of pages or you
want to do some pagination instead of
specifically hiding those div tags one
by one by one you're still for loop hide
all of them and only show the one that
you want to display so that's basically
the idea of the way that this code is
set up however there's a lot of
flexibility within it because you can
set this stuff server-side if you're
using Ajax or you can set it client-side
if you're just sticking with some
JavaScript next one we're just going to
our actual HTML and I went ahead and
created a very simple div ID navigation
and set two links to say click here to
display page one or page two
now on click we're going to actually
call that function pass it that ID for
this example we have one and two or you
could dynamically set it and it will
call that function hide all of those div
tags and then only display the ID that
you sent it
so if I click page two I'm sending the
number two to it and then it displays
that page next we're just going to go
into the actual style it's going to
involve very very little CSS the
important part is you actually want to
set that div tag to a style display:none
known is actually going to hide the div
tag on the page load then when you
actually call the function and set that
div tag you're going to put display
block and it actually blocks is all the
stuff all of the styles of that page
specifically none so that's your basic
code tip of the day for with some
JavaScript hope you guys enjoyed see you
soon we're gonna take a question from a
viewer Jay writes is there a way to
schedule a batch file to defragment my
hard drive while I sleep you see Jay is
downloading a lot of BitTorrent and
other files that are kind of mucking up
his hard drive and it's taking multiple
passes with the defrag to really clean
it up now first things first when it
comes to defrag windows requires at
least 15% of free disk space so he can
actually swap the files and bits and
bytes back and forth that's a bare
minimum
actually try to shoot for 20 to 25
percent free disk space and you know as
we know with dumping DV footage and
stuff we use a 200-year drive huge files
yeah and that's a lot of space so you're
losing but it's really a good idea
because especially if you're working on
TV footage audio editing you know
anything that's hard drive intensive
even BitTorrent you know that's you're
gonna see a huge performance increase by
doing that nightly hey yeah if you're
asleep and your computers on at least
give it something to do yeah now I know
it's something that you do and I'm
starting to do now is uh when I'm doing
my bit torrents the torrent itself is
downloaded to one partition of the drive
and then I'll transfer those files to
another larger partition so that way
I've only got the one getting gunked-up
yeah and then you just schedule a batch
job so to schedule a batch job what
you're gonna want to do is create a file
in your C Drive called defrag CMD and
within that file you want to write with
notepad or another text editor defrag
space C : you know if that's the drive
you want to defrag and then Wacka Wacka
C colon backslash defrag dot log what
that'll do is that'll run the defrag and
that'll also append the log or the
results of that defragment to defrag got
log on your C Drive so you can go and
check it make sure everything's working
yeah then just schedule that you want to
use the at command and that is at space
in this example Oh 1 : oo that'd be 1
a.m. slash every M / t / w /t h / f / s
/ su space C colon backslash defrag CMD
so that will go ahead and schedule it so
that at 1 a.m. every day it'll run the
defrag that CMD so in Windows they don't
have a command for every day of the week
you have to do each one individually
yeah oh my god that's so what you know
it's it's not the bed actually the a
command is really cool it's just like
cron and UNIX and if you want more
information on that head over to SS 64
comm / NT / @ HTML great resource for
finding out about all those cool windows
and T's CMD stuff you ever wanted to
know if you've got a question please
feel free to send it to questions at
hack 5 org it doesn't have to be -
directed to either down or myself any
cast member will find an answer
for you great so last month Harrison was
able to get a VNC session on Darren's
computer using Metasploit
however Darren today is going to show us
how to do this the legit way through a
computer network so once you show us
what you got it right well I'm gonna
take a few steps back yeah last month
Harrison did get VNC access on my
computer using Metis flight and it was
kind of cool but what I've done is I've
dug in and this is one of these tools
that I use to administrate a huge
network of computers and it comes in a
lot handy
first take a step back VNC is a remote
desktop application it allows you to
remotely log into somebody's computer
and you can use the mouse keyboard you
see what's on the screen it's really
nifty so it's a lot like RDP it's just
like Remote Desktop Protocol and Windows
and it's also similar to like things
like go to my PC and stuff but it's open
source it's really neat and there's a
really there's a lot of great tools for
it and this is one of those that I love
alright this is called fast push and
it's from Dark Age co uk and it's a
great little tool that allows you to
remotely install it on a Windows network
so if you're running a Windows computer
and you're on the network and I need to
get to your computer then I could use
this tool if I had your administrator
password to to install the VNC service
on your computer and then login okay and
I show you how it's done it's really
simple alright so here we go we've got
fast push open this is it's the just
extract the zip throw it in the root and
it supports a lot of different VNC
distributions there's you know the
regular real VNC various versions of
that as well as ultra VNC z VNC and my
favorite type VNC now see that's where I
have a little question for it I don't
really know a lot about the different
VMC's others so once you give me a
little idea of sure you just like much
well there's the real VNC which is the
original one created by AT&amp;amp;T Labs ok
there's a tight VNC which is kind of
like a spin-off on that and each VNC
distribution kind of habits at a little
spin on VNC type VNC is really cool
because it has like JPEG compression so
if you're on a slower network you know
it may not look as good but it'll allow
you to get the job done a lot quicker
and then Z B and C and ultra V&amp;amp;C
have their own little features but I
mainly just stick to the real
distribution and the tight distribution
all right okay so we've extracted
everything here so we'll go over to a
command prompt and it's real simple the
command is fast push eight or fp8 and
that'll bring up this nice little splash
screen here where we consider options
it's pretty easy we just enter in an IP
address of the computer on the network
that we want to install it on so in this
case one nine two one six date 1.1 39
and then we're going to give it we're
going to tell what version of VNC would
one install in this case it's going to
be real three three seven and then we
need to give it a user name and that
would be administrator you need to make
sure that the user that you're
installing this with has administrative
access on that machine and then the
password and then we're going to give it
we're going to say PWD and this will be
the password for the VNC server so I'm
just going to call it test ok so good
press ENTER and it goes ahead connects
to the remote machine and installs this
so I don't actually have to go to that
machine so if I'm on a huge network with
hundreds of computers and I know which
computer need you know to install it on
it's great or if I'm a programmer
standpoint I can see what you just did
get all of what I need all of the
computers if I want to all at one time
yeah it's it's great all right yeah I
could you know create a job to install
on all the machines across the network
if you have the administrator password
for all of this and it makes systems
administration of breeze so everything's
installed and I'm going to go ahead and
fire up the ANSI viewer connect to that
machine and password there we go
Wow and I was like that was really and
now I'm on my machine at home I like
that's really really cool there's also
one little things that I'd like to
mention and that is with there's on the
Dark Age homepage there's a little tweak
for the 337 version of real VNC which
has this cool little feature where it
replaces the regular VNC service so that
it doesn't have a
try icon and with someone and with some
of the other switches that you can use
with fast push it allows you to like
turn off putting icons on the desktop
and in the Start menu so you could put
kind of like a silent installation of
VNC on your computer or your friends
computer that is really awesome I really
appreciate that I've learned a little
something new if you guys are interested
