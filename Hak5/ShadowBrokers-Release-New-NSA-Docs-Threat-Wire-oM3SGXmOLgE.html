it was a pretty low-tech hack inmates in
an Ohio prison build their own computers
to access the Internet and the shadow
brokers offer up a good Friday surprise
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for April 18 2017 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom if you
haven't checked out our patreon yet
please do so we have lots that we want
to do for this show but we can't do it
obviously without your support my next
goal is to add a monthly Q&amp;amp;A exclusively
for our patrons and we are going to
upgrade our threat wire set super
excited about that to patreon.com
the link is in the show notes now on to
the news the past week has been full of
hacking claims and now that a bit of
time has passed we are getting a much
clearer picture from several different
stories my first coverage is of the
Dallas emergency sirens debacle Dallas
Texas is covered in emergency sirens
that are used for tornado warnings and
other emergencies it was installed in
2007 by a company called federal signal
and the system totals a hundred and
fifty six sirens that use a total type
system it's basically controlled by tone
combinations used by the emergency alert
system in the National Weather Service
and by shift keying commands sent over
UHF via emergency radio frequency by a
dispatcher the frequency reserved for
emergency broadcasts is 700 megahertz
range and legally no other
communications can use that range but in
the case of Dallas someone was able to
duplicate the tone combinations used to
turn on and sound the alarm system and
played it repeatedly for over 90 minutes
after this happen city officials
disabled the alarms and the Dallas City
Council plans to invest $100,000 in
enhanced security of the system when
this story first surfaced many suspected
that it was a server hack but it was
actually a very low-tech problem since
the radio spectrum is quite public
anyone with the right equipment can
listen to the tones in their area and
reverse-engineer them to understand what
they are used for transmitting their own
tones requires a little
more legwork but it is totally possible
finding the culprit though would
probably be very hard to do
now while this prank is a relatively
simple hack and I do prefer to call it a
prank in this case it does bring to
light an ongoing situation of insecure
city infrastructure this isn't the first
time or the very last time that we're
going to see a hack two municipalities
but it has gotten at least one city in
this case Dallas to finally look into
upgrading their old tech I guess it's
better late than never right
two of our patreon supporters sent this
story my way so big thanks to Jason and
Desi matrix if you are a patron of
threat wire post your story ideas and
links in the community tab on our
patreon page and we might pick your
story for our next episode
now way back in 2015 a complaint was
issued by the Ohio Department of
Rehabilitation and correction to the
Ohio Inspector General about two
computers found at in a ceiling above a
training room in a prison that were
connected to the Internet they were not
owned by the state of Ohio so the prison
staff they were a little worried the
just release report by the inspector
general showed that these internet
connected pcs were being used for tax
and credit card fraud porn and drug
recipes apparently you can look up drug
recipes and anything else on the
internet all from inside the prison and
the only reason staff found it was
because software alerted them as some
kind of excessive data usage on their
lines after discovering the odd data
prison staff found the physical pcs by
tracing the computers port number back
to a network switch that resided close
to the training room where the inmates
were trained in PC usage and that's
where the computers were found
inmates wiped parts from a computer
disassembly program that employed them
and installed an operating system on the
two machines four months prior to their
discovery the inmates were pretty well
versed enough to figure out networking
the PC as well as using Open VPN cane
and other tools popular in InfoSec five
inmates were involved and have now been
transferred to different prisons you can
read the whole report at a link in the
show notes it's kind of hilarious
Windows has been in the news a lot this
past week first a Microsoft Word
vulnerability was found by security
researchers at fireEye
and
hosted last weekend in a blog article
the problem is a zero day that could
install malware on fully patched PCs via
word an attacker could ride an email and
attach the malicious Word document and
once open the affected computer would
connect to a malicious server giving the
attacker more access this could affect
Windows 10 users as well and it does not
require macros to be turned on so that
makes it even worse Ars Technica later
reported that the hack is being used in
the wild to infect pcs with malware
called dry decks which is used for bank
fraud along with this two other flaws
were being exploited in the wild one on
Internet Explorer and one on Microsoft
Office 2016 2013 and 2010 Microsoft
released a patch for the 0 days last
week on Patch Tuesday and it is rather
crucial to update now remember shadow
brokers as well they were trying to
auction off a whole bunch of hacking
tools that they had reportedly obtained
from the equation group which is the
cyber hacking unit that has been linked
to the NSA several months ago with no
buyers well they finally released about
300 megabytes of data which they dubbed
lost in translation and they included
archive folders titled Windows Swift and
odd-job the windows folder held hacking
tools for older Windows computers like
XP and Server 2003 odd-job contained a
tool used against Server 2003 to Windows
XP professional machines and the last
contain presentations about the Swift
Service Bureau in the Middle East called
east nuts you'll probably remember that
Swift was hacked too late last year yeah
that's kind of what this is about
so east nuts denied any Swift hack
saying that the data was old from a
server that was retired in 2013 the East
Nets documents show credentials account
information an admin account info and if
true could be proof that the equation
group was indeed targeting Swift Bank
bureaus several years ago from companies
in the Middle East
according to Microsoft most of the
vulnerabilities shared by his shadow
brokers were already patched as well of
the remaining ones called Englishman
dentist which is a super weird name a
steam audit and exploding can none could
be reproduced in Windows 7 and up were
not at risk security researchers have
also been delving
into code released by shadow brokers
that seems to be oddly similar to
Stuxnet Anna coincides with the first
detection of Stuxnet way back in 2010
this code could link the NSA to Stuxnet
but that hasn't been confirmed by the US
government or researchers thank you
again to all the wonderful fine people
out there who contribute to patreon.com
