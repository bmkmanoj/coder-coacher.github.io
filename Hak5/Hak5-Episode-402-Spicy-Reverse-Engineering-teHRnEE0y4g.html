brought to you by go daddy.com Netflix
com Beck's beer and new Blu calm the
most trusted name and personal
lubrication specially formulated for
noobs what he planes Tetris better than
you do
hey everybody welcome this week's
episode of hak5 I'm Matt less talk I'm
Darren kitchen for those of you who
haven't seen hak5 before this is a
technology-based show basically focusing
on everything from systems
administration the white hat and black
hat hacking and we also cover the other
side of the spectrum into some hardcore
gaming awesome yeah yeah we got a fun
show all super packs for you guys
tonight and we're gonna be talking to
our good friend Chris girling he's down
from Virginia Beach Chris what are we
talking about tonight we're going to go
over the first part of my reverse
engineering series that we're starting
first parts would be tools and theory
and then we're going to actually go in
and use those two tools in theory to
modify a program to do something else
that other than what it's intended to do
so its of course are you saying that
we're actually going to do a series on
something that's not just trying to take
a high level concept and cram it into
seven minutes and goodness exactly yeah
I like that yeah sweet we're going to
make that a multi-part I can't wait for
the practice got to learn some theory
Shannon what's going on over there I'm
gonna be talking to you guys about some
dns stuff I'm talking about something
called opendns sweet and I heard that
you and the spice girls did something
recently no no not the Spice Girls but I
am gonna be cooking some some goodies up
with some spices I'm talking to you guys
about an open source community managed
application called spiceworks tasty IT
infrastructure goodness that's how we
roll sweet all right well let's go ahead
and kick it off I'm gonna head over
Chris and see what's going on with
reverse engineering I will see you later
alrighty alrighty what's up Chris so go
dude tell you the walking so reverse
engineering what's this all about all
right somebody that's completely new
completely a little bit but I'm gonna
watch in here okay what is reverse
engineering it sounds like i'm bob the
builder but backwards that's pretty
close the whole concept reverse
engineering on a high level is taking
something whether it's I mean it could
be software or anything final product
figure out how it was made how it works
and kind of just turning it around and
and making it do something either go to
you know for good or bad that was
intended to do so if you want to modify
something to make it better or you know
change something and not make it worse
normally like in the open source world
and Linux
send all that fun stuff if I wanted to
modify Emacs I just go and download the
code for emacs make my changes turn it
into x and compile it this is for when
you don't have the source code ok cool
so we're not going in any illegal you
know cracking or anything here this is
all you know this is all mostly legit
yeah this is all legit stuff it's good
you know people do this stuff for
practice all the time especially for
analysis to look at a virus or something
and figure out how it works so then they
can write a patent you know right the
patch for it and would this have to be
used in debugging absolutely debugging
is probably the number one use of it any
kind of program that's ever written lots
of debugging goes into it to find out
whether it's doing whether you know what
it's supposed to do and then of course
you know cracking serial numbers don't
like that yep ed jens yeah you can do
that too we find out to your side of the
net absolutely not quite in the show
notes oh that's you're googling
enjoyment so uh so yeah so we're going
to go over a little bit of the theory
here and we're going to actually I'm
going to demo demonstrate some of the
tools that I have open in front of in
front of me here okay so the basic
theory is with software debugging or you
know cracking is that you want to find
out how the program is structured mm-hmm
what you want to change in it and then
actually go through and take like a hex
editor there's different editors for
different title programs and actually
modify those values to change them to do
something on a great example this is the
game genie the what the game gene for
then it's a game genie that was that was
a bad example everyone Silla bat was hex
editing no reacts editing the memory of
the game you know get myself more lives
so so if you've done any sort of
programming this is going to make a lot
of SAP solutely if you guys are not if
if you remember the old days remember
when you would play games and there were
basic files and you'd have to go into
the dot bass file and you would change
some variables may be playing some
nibbles maybe the one with the monkey
that throws the banana across the city
and you can change things that that
change the speed of the game or how many
lives you have so this is the same kind
of thing just a gleam genie but we're
focusing on windows on the windows side
you okay so we're taking an executable
and without the source code
you make it do something different
exactly what kind of tools do we used to
do that okay the first one that's
probably the most commonly known is ID a
pro now we're using the free version
they actually get distribute now you
have to pay five hundred dollars for it
doesn't have all the you know most
current features but it's good enough
for almost any you know any work that
you want to do so what it basically does
is I already open notepad plus plus dot
exe here I love notepad and uh yeah it's
a great target it's good editor and in
fact we are we're actually going to use
that program in the second part of this
okay so to actually modify the hex
values cool so notepad plus plus we open
it up and it does an initial auto
analysis okay and when that's done
you're looking at ITA view a which is
just a bunch of registers and you know
it kind of takes you through the program
as it's written kind of an assembly
exact source oh no this is just how it
kind of lays out I believe I don't
exactly know what code because I'm not a
programmer but its assembly you see like
hex values and stuff here it kind of
debugs it to a point where it so is this
like the machine code this is a machine
code mostly the machines got to have
kind of a programmers mindset you do
have to be able to kind of understand
what you're seeing as far as knowing
what hex means and knowing different you
see like push call move test you know
different okay so those are like
assembly assembling sure so and it'll do
a there's a program called strings and
I'm going to hold it up really quick
just silly because we have a window here
mmhm strings the standalone program you
can download it from technet mmhmm yeah
there we go we have a zoom zoom function
here and you can run strings on any
executive bowl and what it does is goes
through and it'll pull any Unicode or a
ski / 3 captors long so if you're
looking for you know any kind of
function calls or things like that so if
I wanted to take like I don't know say
like there was a code for Duke Nukem 3d
and I could take this and run the DN 3d
exe through this even any kind of like
words yeah likewise sentences yeah any
sort of sentences that were English it
would what Matt you with a dictionary or
something oh that's actually
comprehendible and that would give spit
it out to us so then we can find all
sorts of weird secret exactly it helps
you find what you're part of the code
you want to change ok so you zoom
back out here so I da pro does this for
you automatically there's a window right
here and assume in on that and this is
the this is the strings portion of ID a
pro so does that for you sleep so after
that you know you start identifying
parts of program you want to change and
from there you would go into a so give
me an example of a little thing that we
could change to notepad plus plus okay
well one thing that I actually found
it's actually at the bottom of the
strings it was the alphabet yeah the
alphabets in there so we could we could
reverse it we can recompile it and then
give it to our friend be like aah chak
TextEdit so then when you type you type
the letter A and you can see ah there's
no it's like rot13 with a couple others
yeah exactly so yeah we could do that
will premiere not I'm not going to do
that right now because we're going to
actually give you the goodness and then
the second part of this but another tool
that's very similar to this is and we're
just going to run through these because
these are very similar programs is Ollie
dbg so it's a debugger program okay
pretty much straight up at deprogram
debugger program and it sections off the
code and what's actually tied to each
other so you know this is going to
process together this is going to
process it together so all of these
places where we see like these these
sections with these lines here mm-hmm
those are like individual seconds the
individual segments of code so when you
have like you know you have like a basic
go to line 10 or something like that
yeah that's okay you know that's
basically what that is cool and uh these
see this eax thing right here yeah
that's a 32-bit register they go through
and it's you know you can get very in
the woods with this but you know II ax
BX 32-bit 16-bit 8-bit you get into big
endian little endian and we're gonna
have to save that one for neck we're
going to get that excited so there's
three of the tools and you had one other
that you brought yeah there was the
win32 disassembler very much similar to
the other ones the only reason that you
would use a lot of these different tools
together is it sometimes different
executives are made with different
compilers like you have a.net program
they would do is dot net reflector which
I bittorrent season three on it
uncompelled neck yeah it's mostly dotnet
co-manage code oh so yeah but there's
one this you are soft w32 the assembler
this is just for like any kind of code
very general very good general news
Perhaps sweet yep so that's my pretty
much a general overview okay and well I
think we understand the theory of it and
it's cool that we have the tools and
you're going to have links in your in
your blog post show notes to all the
tools i think when we get into the
practice of this next week it'll make a
lot more sounds really cool to you and i
know a lot of this flying by real quick
i think what you really need to do is if
this tickles your techno lust is to go
check out Chris's article download these
programs and take I don't know notepad
the calculator any program that you're
somewhat familiar with and start pouring
through the output of one of these
things because then when you come back
next week and we start talking about
this get more in depth you totally
follow along with us I told you just
give her viewers homework tonight mmhmm
yeah you did anyway homework do your
homework and I I'm really interested in
this stuff because I feel like you can
like learn a lot just from dorking
around oh yeah I mean you don't have to
i I'm not a reverse engineering expert I
mean I know there's gonna be people are
gonna be emailing me there no no I'm not
an expert I'm not an expert okay just
play one on TV I just play one on TV
awesome I just stayed a Holiday Express
hey there not a song thank you having me
I'm in thanks for the excellent segment
and let's just go ahead and check in
with Shannon here and see what's going
on with this month's trivia week's
trivia this week's trivia that's great
you sure you're not an expert because I
would definitely go to you for all my
questions it's super crazy alright this
week's trivia is sponsored by Go Daddy
Go Daddy's awesome they have ninety-nine

for detail
and get your piece of the internet at
godaddy.com on to this week's trivia
which i'm going to read because i'm not
going to memorize this the v2 rocket was
the first ballistic missile and the
first man-made object to achieve sub
orbital spaceflight it was also reverse
and it engineered by the Soviet Union
leading to what copycat rocket that's
your question so we want you guys to
answer that in the forums instead of
emailing us like we used to do in the
past seasons we're doing it in the
forums this time at the hak5 forms of
course basically what you're going to do
you're going to go into the trivia forum
answer the question if you're the first
person to get that right we're going to
PM you and ask you for your address and
your your name so we can send you our
hak5 stickers or hak5 schwag I don't
know we'll mix it up a little bit
alright so the next segment we got mad
over here and he's going to talk about
this open source program called
spiceworks but first let's take a break
you need new blue yes you do let's face
it last time you play pirate you
actually found a way to burn yourself
you couldn't build a birdhouse as an
engineer and you're not going to heal
anyone running around with a fake German
accent and a hacksaw ensure your mob
gets higher Frank counts grenade jumping
indoors you are new you get owned a lot
and it hurts but now there's new blue
new bloob is the most trusted name in
personal lubrication specifically
designed for noob like you this topical
cream prevents chafing itching and
general discomfort that comes with being
last guy on the score list so pop on
some new blue and get owned like a pro
noob lube is manufactured by microchip
program suit holes free samples
available at new lucam
everybody welcome back to hack live
sorry about the little mishap that we
had before apparently Paul is not able
to operate a mixer properly he could
little trigger-happy on the action you
know that's cool I understand he's
excited about being back but anyway
we're going to go ahead and move on
today I'm talking about spiceworks and
to help me out here is Chris girling
what is spiceworks spiceworks is in
essence a IT asset inventory helpdesk
reporting kind of thing okay so it helps
you just make you know and make an
inventory of everything you have or
manage it or make an inventory basically
you know with you and I we run systems
you know for for companies and it's it's
a pain in the ass to try and track down
you know what these systems are what's
on them you know where they're actually
at what IP addresses they have so on and
so forth and on top of that what I'll go
into a little bit later is some of the
advanced domain level functions of spice
works okay but what we're going to we're
going to focus on first off is the
ability to discover your networks
inventory now the great thing about
spiceworks is in the latest version 3.1
they actually just a lot enabled the
ability to scan non windows devices so
you if you had a linux boxes or
macintosh machines on your network you
could actually get all the details about
all those could you can and maybe manage
them to a little bit as far as the
management goes it's more over for a
monocyte well not not so much the
management it's more spiceworks itself
in itself is more of a dashboard okay to
get and collect and report on all the
data of the machines that are actually
in your network so what we do is in the
process of starting spiceworks we go
ahead and install it and you enter a
username and password now I should say
that spiceworks is ad-supported okay so
there are advertisements there are
advertisements in your in your dashboard
here okay but that being said they're so
unobtrusive when you're working you're
doing your thing you know whatever what
helps to be free right it helps to be
free but you can also pay
or to remove that and I believe have
more of an enterprise support right
thing exactly now there is a great
community let's just start that off
mm-hmm if you have any problem as a
spiceworks community is that like a
forum or forum mailing list you know
whatever it you it's great it really is
a lot of bright people writing a lot of
custom stuff for spiceworks great we're
just going to focus on the main stuff so
we've already installed spiceworks and
basically what it is it runs as a daemon
or service on the machine okay it's a
windows-based product so you need to
install it on a windows-based machine do
you need to make like firewall
exceptions yeah I mean if you if you set
it up to a port it'll ask you which port
you want to install it on it defaults to
a tee you know so but I mean a lot of
times if you have a server you're not
going to assault on a tee just you know
yeah so anyway so you choose the poor we
chose 8080 okay and it runs this Damon
and it's all managed through the web so
what we can actually do is I've already
ran a scan and it's as simple as
clicking the start scan button there's a
tutorial that goes into when you first
open it up this shows you how to do
everything right it will ask you for
your network range it'll ask you if
you're going to do it's like a wizard it
walks you through all the steps and
configures it right exactly you can do
your your local machine or you can do a
network-based scan we've already done
the scan here and what we've got is as
soon as it comes up here we're going to
go into the workstations and choo is my
box that I have upstairs in the hack
house so we can click on shoo and we can
scroll down here and this either is your
IP address and we're zooming it a little
bit here we can see the name the
manufacturers a generic computer the
owner is Matt it's in a workstation
group the IP address the model the
serial number asset tag now the asset
tag on dell machines will pull the asset
tag from the dell like like your service
tag you're so that you would need for
the support right hong exact so you'd
have to walk down there and look at it
right now the great thing about once you
initially perform and you know group
your different nodes that you actually
have
you put him in two groups okay that's
great you then start to schedule
automated scans once you have everything
and it looked for configuring well it'll
look for new things but on top of that
it will monitor the things that it
already knows about like we've already
got an event here on time twenty-five
percent dis creaming right okay so we've
got one event and we can go into here
and into the general info and it says
hey 20 minutes ago d was less than
twenty-five percent free okay so if
you're running out of space on like a
database server or something like that
where you need it'll preempt you let you
know that another harder you can
actually go ahead and take pre-emptive
measures before the entire thing
actually crashes awesome so beyond that
we now have the ability in spiceworks to
go ahead and make changes to the core
entry inside the software so we can go
ahead and we can refresh and we can look
at the total disk usage the IP address
usage things of that nature we go over
here to software we can actually since
we can actually see exactly what's
installed on this this machine which for
me managing you know I don't manage a
whole lot 30 35 machines but to know
exactly what's on a machine my mission
to get the thousand machines you'd want
to have a you probably have a baseline
install of everything writing it you
want to know if something if somebody
installs something on that box maybe
that's you know they got permissions are
not supposed to do anything right you
know if there's a game on there this way
this way I mean if I'm if somebody's
hooked into the VPN I can scheduled
scans when I know that they're going to
be connected to my VPN and I can run a
scan on there well it doesn't run on the
machine I can run a scan against their
computer and see exactly what it since
what's installed now the one big thing
about this product is going to be you
need administrative access to actually
dig deep into the machine find the
software find the hard drive size but
you can still scan everything without it
you just know how to get that much of
its going to place it into a into an
unknown node in into an unknown group
so we've got 11 unknown devices here and
these are all everything that we've got
in the house so we'll take my machine
upstairs and it will give you this error
it says this device appears to be a
windows computer but you screwed up in
in typing something in or it's not
responding a firewall will block that
remember windows username or domain and
password for the machines that you want
to target obviously it's great for a
domain because you've got a domain and
bin you know that kind of thing for mac
and linux users the root or an ssh user
and password with permissions to view
the system information but to be honest
with you i mean for a free product i
mean on the left-hand side they give you
videos documentation support direct
links you can ask a question ratings and
how to's and then they also have IT
services if you want to become a service
provider that you can actually tack on
okay the other nice thing about
spiceworks is it has a built in a help
desk now for you and me we work with a
large large krazy stoopid retardedly
hard help desk tickets ticketing systems
this has a really nice built into the
interface you can add notes per machine
you can change good for a small network
yeah I mean I've heard of people running
it on hundred even thousand you know no
networks and having it run great I don't
know it to me it would seem almost a
little bit counterintuitive to have to
manage that much I don't know I haven't
played with it on a level like that and
working in this environment where we
don't have a domain it doesn't make a
lot of sense to have to go through each
machine and set up the individual
permissions for those machines to
actually get there but you can add new
assets by by yourself you don't have to
scan for them but the reporting aspect
of things is also really important
because I want to know things without
them being critical so we can run we can
run reports based on computers that have
that have antivirus that don't have anti
iris we can you know search by
applications on a machine disk usage of
n summary the whole nine yards I really
encourage you if you've got you know
some free time to go ahead and check it
out it's spiceworks calm you can
remember free version and the the paid
and paid and the paid version but I mean
it really is a nice piece of software
you've used it i have used were your
initial impressions it was a different
it looked a little different when i use
it as about a year ago but i liked it
you know it was a we did it on a small
land at work we had about 40 or 50
machines and it was the scan didn't take
very long at all no I mean if you've got
the correct authentication same
credentials it's gonna go main
controller knighting so I liked it was a
very good tool I'm actually interested
in trying it out again now I might see
the new version of itself yeah they just
came out with 3.1 which I will let you
guys know does have the ability to scan
exchange servers now we don't have one
here that I can test it out on
unfortunately but go ahead and play with
that that's just something that they
added in a three-point oh release I
think you guys be really excited for
that now what we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and guys see she's
getting a little bored by me rambling on
so we're going to do is we're gonna go
ahead and kick it over to Shannon for
this week's land party of course I'm not
getting bored Matt you know I never get
bored whenever you're talking damn right
alright so this month we have a land
party coming up it's being sponsored by
Netflix and Netflix is awesome so I just
suggest if you're not a new member yet
you check it out Netflix has over 90,000
titles online including lots of blu-ray
titles with free shipping both ways to
your home and write back they have over
40 shipping centers so almost all
delivers deliveries happen in just one
business day the netflix plans start at
just 499 and as a new member and a hak5
viewer you can get a no-risk two week
free trial membership so check it out at
WWF flexkom hak5 and don't forget the 3
w's because that's really really
important for us and for them so this
month slam party that's counter strike
source some CSS i think we're going to
own it up at least i know i will I don't
know about you you're kind of a noob
can't say much well he would mow you
down oh she has message he would mow you
down with p 90 but he doesn't have a mic
so tell them all the information you can
just sit there and look like a noob like
you are already don't worry don't say
anything so our land party its counter
strike source it's going to be on sep
tember 20th and we're filming the next
couple of episodes on that day so you
can go to hack 5 org and watch us
streaming live not only the land party
but us filming the episodes and you can
view our you can join our servers to be
playing with us in the games at game
hak5 org now we're going to hit it up at
christine's little apartment over there
and she's going to tell us about a
utility yeah well before I want to talk
about this utility I want to mention how
popular the dual monitor and triple
monitors are and I know Darren even has
three of the same monitor well one of
the problems with that is that even with
three of the same monitor there's a
color difference between them and that
can get really annoying especially when
you're trying to do editing like we do a
lot obviously an easy solution for that
that I found is called Calabrese and
it's on Calabrese com and if you go to
the website it's got a really useful
link right here you can click on the
primer and it shows how it works it even
has a really nice analogy to cooking on
here which is great wonderful but we're
going to go ahead and do this and as you
can see my computer looks like it's been
owned by the evil server it's all red so
we're going to go through the
introduction that you can set how often
you want to do this if you want to
recalibrate every couple days once a
month however you want to do so we're
going to click Next this part here is
just to make sure that your contrast and
brightness settings are adjusted mine
are good now this is the part where you
want the color inside of where the black
lines are to match the color that's on
the outside now we can see ours is a bit
off so that looks about right that's too
light that looks good
and should be good click Next save and
you just see by the mutable landscape
here we're all good to go now another
interesting thing I want to mention real
quick on the home page there's a link
all the way at the bottom that you can
put the calabrese icon on your website
so your visitors and readers are going
to see the same color graphics that
you're seeing this is really useful if
you run a graphics blog or a photo blog
or anything like that that's my tip for
the day I'm going to head it back to
snub Z for some opendns thank you
christine i'm definitely going to check
out calabrese myself because I know my
dual monitors definitely need that yeah
you're one is like way better than the
other yes also you should check out her
hair show notes because they're in her
blog she's got a link that you should
probably show to your like employers
because actually shows that going dual
monitors or even more after that I have
like a nine to fifty percent efficiency
boost as somebody that's been running
triple monitors for a while I can tell
you totally true diminishing returns a
quadruple though oh yeah yeah so
recently there's been a lot of talk
about DNS vulnerabilities of course
coming out of the whole black hat or not
black hat um a DEFCON dan kaminsky
speech and got me thinking like wow I've
always been using my my isp provided dns
server god you're still using your
regular dns it came with the ISP mmm
it's just the NS how important is it
really okay well I need to tell you
about opendns because they give you so
many good features it's it's just a
really good service I gotta say I mean
it's completely free you don't have to
download anything you just set up a
couple of different network networks
connections right down here and you're
in your programs oh yeah I mean changing
your dns server is easy i just never
thought that changing my dns server
would actually come with features yeah
it's super easy ok so do you want me to
tell you about cup couple of these feet
oh so what are the things that really
make it cool all right well I'm gonna
zoom in here so I can show you these a
couple of my favorite ones are the
phishing protection for pages like I
don't know maybe Twitter Fisher yeah
it's kind of a fun
that's that's kind of a fishing site so
we want to steer clear that one so well
it's gonna block it but I want the
traffic ok ok I understand any well
opendns is gonna it's going to keep you
away from any kind of fishing sites just
just in case you're kind of a new band
decide to give away your password it
also gives you domain blocking and adult
site blocking in case you have kids in
the house or you have a business that
you want to run and keep people working
and you don't want them go into Facebook
and MySpace and all the different social
sites adult site it's the bridge filter
I don't know 4chan maybe there you go
that's one of them yeah a couple of
other cool things is it has this really
cool customization so you know how when
you ever you type in something really
wrong and it links you to the regular
DNS that says oops oh that's something
that our isp does here we have cox
communication in virginia and if you get
something really wrong they like instead
of just saying you know like there's no
server there they give you this like
 page with like all these ads on it
and stuff so instead exactly you get
your own instead of that you get your
own logo sweet and that's pretty cool
some results okay yeah so I set that up
I'm gonna show you how that were you
said it was gonna help me with my fat
fingers too oh of course yeah anything
would help you with your fat fingers we
also have to be PC quit talking dude I'm
talking alright we also have a nice typo
correction and that's one of my
favorites because I always type in CMO
instead of calm and I always get
redirected to the wrong thing and it's
horrible I hate it so i'm going to show
you an example say i'm typing in
something and I completely messed it up
alright i'm going to show you it right
here I completely messed it up so I'm
gonna press Enter you can't do it while
you're zoom after I am zoom okay and it
says oops you went to the wrong site
instead of giving me a whole bunch of
different ads down here it still gives
me the ads but up here I get my own hak5
logo instead they're like a hack five
brand google search that's released
right it is it I like that idea or any
Google search I really like that idea
you can even add in your own little
spiffy toolbar search up here where you
can just type in one word say i typed in
banana
and we set it up to go to Disney com so
I press ENTER banana takes me right over
to disney go com it's like I can think
of some useful useful stuff for that
rather than yeah so you can send it for
the facebook instead of my speed that
enter ago I like thee okay and that's
something you don't have to do just
necessarily on your one computer you can
do it on like you know your whole
network exactly so you can do all sorts
of really cool things with this gadget i
love it i really suggest that you guys
check it out for sure you can download
or well you're not really downloading it
but you can definitely check it out and
see if you really want to put this onto
your own connection your own server at
your house business or your school if
you even if you're running a school it's

everything from there alright thanks so
