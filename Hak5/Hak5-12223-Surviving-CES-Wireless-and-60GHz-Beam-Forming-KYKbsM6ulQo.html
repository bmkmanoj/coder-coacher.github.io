Shutterstock I'm been looking over here
at this I want to know what that is this
is my itty-bitty Fitbit see if that says
let's go hi snubs how you doing how'd
you get it to do that so you gotta just
set it down for a little while and then
eventually when you pick it up after
it's been a while it says like let's go
or vamanos or hurry pick it up pick up
the pace and then it says hi snubz yeah
it'll tell you your carbs how many steps
you've been taking how many miles you've
been going how many calories you've
actually burned for out throughout the
day so um the reason why I brought this
with me is because when you go out at
night in Vegas you're partying a lot and
when you're at these conventions you eat
a lot of crazy food like you know
chocolate throughout the day and candy
pretty much whatever you find and
whatever is cheapest in the convention
hall and I was a little bit I had a
couple of issues like last year's just
coming home you know five pounds heavier
because I was drinking beer all day and
I was you know eating Little Debbie
snack cakes instead of a decent meal so
I just started tracking everything with
this little Fitbit and it turns out that
I've been definitely been eating way too
much and drinking quite a few more beers
than I should well that's like a quite a
pedantic pedometer how does it know what
you're eating and all of those other
things you can track it so I have this
little application and I can login here
and show it to you so this is my
application and whenever you run through
here you can see my weight you can see
how many steps you've been taking so
I've taken at least six thousand steps
today how many stairs you've climbed
I've haven't climbed any actually
because this place is all on the same
level except for the south hall and then
you can also see let's see which one is
this your calories burn for the day so
I've done pretty well your BMI your
weight and all sorts of other
information and it will sync with this
via bluetooth smart so every time you
put them close to each other and you
press the recent button it just sinks
all the information from the paw
and then you can plug in your food
intake and everything that you've eaten
throughout the day here and that'll sink
back to the Fitbit so you do have to be
good about actually plugging stuff into
the application yeah but to be honest
like when you actually carry this around
and when you're following your footsteps
and when you are more interested in you
know covering this type of tool it
definitely makes sense to actually track
it and since they have this application
I've I've just I don't know I kind of
did it whenever I was walking up to up
and down the stairs or whenever I'm on
an elevator or whatever so I just do it
now and then and it takes like two
seconds you know what I found this is
you didn't tune in to hi5 for fitness
but i will say technology related
wolframalpha you just I was gonna say
you google something on wolframalpha wow
that's horrible you search for something
on Wolfram ever like you know a banana
and it's going to tell you like all of
the potassium and all the other stuff
about whatever that that is that's crazy
huh well luckily with the Fitbit
application I've been able to just plug
in like little debbie snack cake and it
tells me you know 300 calories because
it already has all the information for
me right there so I don't have to go on
wolframalpha does it does it track of
the radiation of your of your bananas
though no cuz I'm just saying bananas
all radioactive anyway uh cool all right
well hey let me show you my app all
right so get this I had this idea
actually a while ago I had this idea Def
Con and I finally got around to
implementing this because everyone the
idea being I don't need to be connected
to the network competing for that
resource all of the time because I'm not
necessarily sending receiving messages
all of the time and that's really all my
phone is good for at a conference is
just communicating by text right well so
I just don't want to play this game at
all what I want to do is kind of like
have a periscope where I can just like
get on the network get anything that's
in the queue send anything that's in the
cube and get off the network the longer
that I'm not connected to the network
the longer my battery will last because
not competing with everybody else I just
imagined you like popping your head out
of the water and going whoa all spectrum
okay we're good yeah is it seriously
like being in a cell phone fallout
shelter
like popping your head up to see any
other survivors cuz you know otherwise
your phones what's that Billy spectra
yeah exactly so here's what I've done
here people have been sending me
messages for ages to check out the
android app called tasker and i finally
it was actually as i was waiting to get
into the previous press event last night
that I was just standing there for like
ten minutes I was like okay I'm gonna
download this figure it out because
that's a thing where I can automate
Tasker is kind of like Automator for pro
s10 the idea is here we go here's one of
my tasks this is my task where I can
take a breath of air or whatever might
my periscope up app and all it does is
within this I can set these different
contexts like the context here is if the
battery level is under 50 is between 0
and 51-percent run this program and this
program is really simple what it does is
is to disable auto brightness to set my
brightness level 20 I've even configured
it to work with a plug-in I've got this
plugin what is it called called a screen
filter i love screen filter coolest
anyway uses that to dim the screen even
more so it's like a it has if this then
that kind of built-in basically is the
same thing and you know what i love if
this then that because it kind of brings
programming paradigms to people that you
know are like social media people but
not programming people and this is one
of those things where if you're not a
programming person euro uh you could do
some really cool automation stuff with
your android phone and never even know
that you're that you know a programmer
uh the really cool thing is it's all
super sequential there's no object
oriented stuff you remember that from
like Java classes it's so how God do I
remember well here's where the fun stuff
has basically all i do is going to set
airplane mode to on and then really
close that and then wait five minutes
whoops what did not mean to move that
down there anyway i wait five minutes
and then i turn airplane mode off and
then I wait a minute and 30 seconds
enough for me to connect to the network
send any message that's in my google
talk you receive any message that
network has for me uh and then basically
a loop it just goes to number four
that's awesome that's very cool I could
totally use this on my own phone yeah
it's been working out really great I'm
actually super surprised if I uh I take
a look at you know battery usage it's it
has been a nightmare at this conferences
yeah I remember last night you were like
uh my phone didn't charge can I borrow
your battery I'm at zero look at that
that is insane that's that's CES for you
that's a day in five hours oh my god
that's crazy so anyway I just thought i
would share that i don't know what the
equivalent is on iOS so if you do know
and i will say that while Tasker is
really cool not all of the cool
functions that you might want to be able
to do are available unless you're rooted
like I would love to have to be able to
reboot my phone change my cpu clock
cycles I really wanted it to like
underclock my phone and stuff you can't
do those if you're not rooted so I guess
I'm gonna have to get around to reading
this device but just thought it throw
that out there so everybody that's
emailed me to check out tasker it's the
coolest thing in the world okay now I
realize what you're talking about this
is the coolest segment world I can't
wait to keep making more Tasker programs
and so you've got a favorite Tasker
program be sure to hit us up feedback at
