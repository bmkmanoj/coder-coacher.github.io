by domain.com I kind of feel like I
should be starting this off saying like
perhaps 5 i'm darren kitchen i've been
doing that all day well it's finally
nice to kind of relax for a moment here
at the red touch media booth yeah I feel
so much better actually getting to sit
down my feet even though I got dr.
scholl's in my my soul's I gotta say I'm
so tired actually considering this isn't
even airing until next week everybody
else probably even just viewers at home
who aren't here probably also have a CES
hangover right yeah you're probably
right especially you know drinking after
watching all those segments huh drinking
just to get through them um actually
well what are the things that I wanted
to talk about kind of in our whole like
you know idea of surviving a technology
conference like this is kind of review
some of like the tips that we've learned
over the years of getting through these
without falling over yeah I definitely
am interested in what you have to say
today because I've been having a lot of
issues with my cell phone so uh this is
really just kind of candid off-the-cuff
I figure I'm actually going to retouch
on a whole lot of fun signal theory
stuff at the main white board at the
hak5 studio later but since this is a
perfect example of a situation where you
just have a ton of people there 150,000
people here yeah just about that's what
they estimated when it first started
about 150,000 people and all of those
people are trying to share all of the
cell phone networks all the major
carriers and so here in the United
States basically you're in one of two
camps you're either with AT&amp;amp;T or tmobile
on a gsm network or you're with verizon
or sprint on a cdma network and so I
figured that I just kind of illustrate
some of the stuff that will actually I
picked this up at my queer my husband's
work shop around torque on about the
differences in the way that those
signals work and so we've actually
talked about this several seasons back
when in regards to pulse code modulation
in regards to like the way that audio is
put on a CD in other ways that they're
done on like wire lines
landlines and stuff very similar in the
wireless space basically what we're
talking about is there's a finite
resource there's a little bit of
spectrum and what we want to do is share
that with a ton of people and so there's
two different ways that happens so this
doesn't work the same whether you're on
you know AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon it's different
no no so if you're on verizon or sprint
you're on a CD em a network and that's a
carrier something multiple access
carrier division or or somebody correct
me anyway it's it's a different type of
multiplexing and you're going to see
here as I illustrate it in just a moment
as opposed to gsm which i cannot
pronounce because it's german and came
from a long time ago and i'll have to
look that one up but gsm is essentially
a tdma technology so TDM a vs cdma is
really what we're talking about here I
think I know what tdma stands for ok
what is to the msn for a time division
multiplex multiple multiple think that
is multiplexing it is multiple access
and then access yep multiple access the
idea in in this case is we have our
finite resource actually both these are
finite resources we have time on both of
these and times constantly going forward
and then we also have our spectrum over
here ok and so with our spectrum the way
that it works in the case of a tdma
based technology like gsm like what's on
ATT and tmobile is that if i have four
users over here let's see one two three
four up to the same thing over here so
i've got four people connected to my
tower well if i need all four of these
people to talk the way that it's going
to work is person number one here and
this is really kind of you know not
getting into some of the other crazy
finesse that they do but but basic idea
here is that person number one is going
to get
this chunk of time and then he's going
to stop broadcasting and then person
number two can take over and broadcast
for a chunk of time person number three
can do the same person number four can
do that and then we can go back to
person number one so this explains why
why I'll get a drop call but several
minutes later I can call my mom back
there's so many factors but basically
within a time division multiple access
based network you have a you know if you
only have a single transceiver a single
cell network and you've got like you
know ok this is with four people right
now imagine 50 people imagine 63 people
imagine 127 people imagine 150,000
people now mind you not all 150,000
people at CES are in the same hall at
the same time but it really is like a
juggling act that the carriers have to
do to just be able to get all of this
technology to work and it really breaks
down when you have all of these people
trying to use that same little slice so
the way that cdma does it differently
and this is why my survival tips are
based on because I'm on sprint but my
survival techniques are based on this is
so in this case user number one speaks
on all of the spectrum will say a
majority of it you know with tdma we can
a week you'll always we can slice
spectrum till the cows come home but
we're just going to say in CDMA person
number one talks and they look like that
ok well now person talk number two talks
and looks like that now if you and I
were both say at the hak5 studio talking
over each other on a segment which we've
never done no never we would just get
like louder and louder yeah probably
discern both of our voices that they're
getting kind of loud just kind of figure
out what yeah all right well the idea
there is um you know there's really cool
Vanessa can go into figuring out who's
voice is who's and the problem though is
you know person number three gets in
here person um before gets in here and
what happens is that noise floor right
raises as more people are talking so
it's like being in a big
banquet hall and the difference between
passing the hot potato or the torch and
saying like okay now you can talk now
you can talk now you can talk and just
everybody going nuts at the same time so
that explains to me why CD if you're on
cdma you don't have as many issues with
the calls dropping or your text messages
getting out because you're still sharing
the spectrum but wouldn't that drain
your battery life if you're doing that
because you're trying to reach for that
higher level on the spectrum tower the
whole time I don't think that that
either of these technologies can be
attributed to while I calls dropper text
messages go through however I will say
that in both of these cases what happens
is our phones are set up in such a way
that when you know they're so when
they're far from the tower or when
they're competing for other resources
with other people you know within the
geographic region of say you know say
this is the conference hall and I've got
a I've got a tower here and I've got a
tower here and got a tower here and so
this one is like oh no I'm over you know
I'm seeing that I've got some overlap
here that's actually causing problems
because this guy here is like a you know
so he's continuously searching for the
best one well what I'm saying is these
towers they will since they're all part
of a bigger network they'll
intelligently tweak the way that they
use their power so that everybody uses
the the resource most efficiently what's
unfortunate is that not all liver phones
are as efficient as as they could be and
so what generally happens is the noise
floor rises in both cases of CDMA and
GSM and so those are the circumstances
which do attribute to the fact that your
calls will drop but moreover what
happens is when we're in this banquet
hall all screaming at the top of our
lungs at the same time that's my analogy
that equates to the wattage that you're
that the transceiver in your phone is
using and to be able to transmit it like
you know the difference between 300
milliamps versus a watt is huge and
that's going to drain your battery much
faster and that's exactly what happens
when you go to you know any sporting
event
a big conference like you know here when
we go to like Def Con or shmoocon or any
of those batteries drain faster because
you're around more people with phones
yeah it totally makes sense now since
this is hack five and we're discussing
how do you fix this problem what did you
do well I've got a little app and I
guess we'll this is something that
people have been like telling me for
ages to take a look at so in just a bit
here I want to actually show off just
some really really really horrible code
that kind of mitigates this in and a
very brute force and nasty hack job
manner but before we get to that I'm
been looking over here at this I want to
know what that is domain com is the best
place to go for your next great idea if
you need to get a domain name consider
getting yourself calm co.com domain is
