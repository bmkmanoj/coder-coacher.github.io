Netflix welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down the concepts tools
and techniques for hackers network gurus
and IT ninjas
I'm your host Darren kitchen and today
we're getting a little promiscuous with
wireless cards now as part of our
foundation series of hack tips today I'm
covering the fundamentals of wireless
packet sniffing with kind of a practical
approach here and backtrack Linux with
well my favorite the aircrack-ng suite
so we'll have you cracking your first
encrypted wireless network but first
it's time for the terms like a sleazy
prom date a network interface in
promiscuous mode is one that gets action
from everybody let's think about a
network traffic is like a cocktail party
picture Alice and Bob on a loveseat
chatting it up well Charlie's deep in
conversation with Dave over at the bar
meanwhile Eve is sipping a Hendricks
martini listening in on everyone's
conversation you see in order for Alice
to send a message to the Bob she has to
address it to him by his network
interface cards MAC address or media
access control address now this address
is unique to every network interface on
the planet Bob is going to be different
from Charlie's from Dave's anyone else's
and on a hub based network Alice's
message is going to be heard by everyone
by default when Charlie or Dave hear a
message addressed to a MAC address that
isn't their own their network interface
is just going to go ahead and drop that
frame completely this is where
promiscuous mode comes into play you see
if Eve's network interface is in
promiscuous mode she doesn't drop the
frames that aren't addressed to her this
is great for well packaged sniffing say
if Eve is a network administrator
attempting to debug a faulty network
likewise if Eve has like malicious
intent the same applies to eavesdropping
now
promiscuous mode assumes a hub based
network which is why we use switches
today they wort this by only sending the
messages to their intended recipients or
serve ways around that but that's a
different act tip now
that brings us to monitor mode now
monitor mode or RF Mon for radio
frequency monitor is one of six modes
that wireless network adapters can
assume similar to promiscuous mode
monitor mode allows the wireless network
interface to sniff packets that just
aren't intended for them now unlike
promiscuous mode however an interface in
monitor mode can sniff packets from
access points that aren't even
associated with I mean as long as you're
within range now again this is great for
say an administrator trying to
troubleshoot a faulty network or maybe
on the darker side of the hats somebody
with malicious intent such as
eavesdropping or cracking wireless
networks now it's important to note that
not all wireless cards can assume
monitor mode until recently the windows
API didn't even support it in just a bit
though I'm going to be showing you how
to set up your wireless card in monitor
mode and start packet sniffing in
backtrack Linux but first let's thank
our wonderful sponsor with more than 20
million members Netflix is the world's
largest subscription service instantly
streaming TV episodes and movies over
the Internet members can instantly watch
thousands of titles streaming TV
episodes and movies over a vast array of

ps3 game console and the Nintendo Wii
console as a Netflix unlimited number
you can instantly watch as many movies
as you want anytime you want for one low
monthly price there never any late fees
or due dates as a new netflix member and
a hack tip viewer you can get a free
trial membership go to WWF flexkom hak5

so they know we sent you now before it's
seven your wireless card to monitor mode
in Linux for the very first time you're
gonna need to check its chipset
compatibility and thankfully the
aircrack-ng team has done a wonderful
job on their wiki going ahead and
listing some of the most popular PCMCIA
card bus Express card PCI mini PCI even
USB adapters which is great I like this
as far as USB is concerned this encore
adapter it's got a raw link chipset it's
802 dot 11n that works great
I'm also very fond of the Alpha
aw us 0-3 6h this one's got an RP SMA
connector on it so I can put like a
bigger antenna on it and it's got a real
tech 81 87 chipset which has great
compatibility now if you're not sure
what your chipset is really it's just a
matter of coming over to your terminal
and if it's say USB going ahead and
typing in LS USB alternatively if it was
PCI you type LS PCI and I can see right
here I have the realtek semiconductor
Corpse RTL 81 87 the cross-reference
that with the wiki and I know that I
should be good to go
alternatively I could plug my card in
and as soon as that happens I can go
ahead and run say DME SG and get a whole
detailed report of what's available now
actually turning your card into monitor
mode is really just a matter of running
Ehrmann tach ng so Ehrmann tak ng we'd
run give it the parameter start and we
tell it our interface and in my case
this is wlan0 and I've gone ahead and
done that and I can see right here my
real tech and it says monitor mode
monitor mode enabled on Mon zero so if I
run iw config see right here Mon zero
mode monitor now we can say issue
airodump-ng and our monitor interface
and start listening to whatever's out
there in the air so arrow dump tak ng
Mon zero and there we go
all of the bssid is and traffic going
through and we could you know sniff
possibly a four-way WPA handshake for
cracking but we'll get into that here
shortly now anyway that's pretty much it
if it worked it worked if it didn't well
then you may need to use a different
driver or a different wireless card but
thankfully between the aircrack-ng wiki
and the mad Wi-Fi site there's a wealth
of information on supported devices now
stay tuned because coming up here on
hack tip Shannon will be enhancing
Windows experiences and I'll be diving
into the command line essentials as well
as having you crack your very first
wireless network in no
at all but until then I want to hear
your feedback programs or commands are
given a warm fuzzies get me up

more great stuff just like this I'll be
there reminding you to trust your Tecna
