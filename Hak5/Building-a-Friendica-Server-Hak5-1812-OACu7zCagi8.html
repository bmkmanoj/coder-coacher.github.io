by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen my name is
Shannon Morse it's your weekly dose of
Technos welcome everyone to our humble
abode I am very excited our humble abode
needs some more stickers I agree if
you're good substance that you want to
send from your own hackerspaces or
series awesome hacker whatever I don't
even know just send them to us
just yeah I don't even know caffeine
caffeine this should we get somewhat a
cavity it's amante in the break but it
would be very awesome show we're gonna
dive right in because it's I hope that
it's gonna be a lot long because we are
building service today it's gonna be
exciting kind of working backwards from
the whole setup in that last week we
demonstrated the end product what we
have achieved and that is to build
ourselves our own little social network
using friend akka with open source
software so now we're going to take a
step back from that and actually build
the server and then we gonna take
setback than that and actually build the
virtual hypervisor II good stuff that
all of its running on so it's awesome
yes I'm super excited to get into this
this is gonna be like my first on hack 5
building a server thing really yeah my
first one I think you're wrong crazy
you've done so many segments Eve I've
done other stuff outside of hack 5 but
I've never done anything with you as far
as building servers go okay so this is
cool I'm excited yeah I'm gonna wear it
a lot let's let's go ahead and get
started that so what we will be doing is
friend Iike as we talked about last week
is a free and open source software epic
awesome alternative to the likes of
Facebook and the Twitter's and the stuff
it's a social network that integrates
with a lot of other social networks you
can like link your different accounts
and stuff and it's federated and what
that means is it links with all of the
other friend eco servers including other
diaspora servers as well so basically
there's a bunch of different open source
initiatives to create what are called
decentralized distributed social
networks and so as opposed to your
traditional like hey here's Facebook and
it's this castle over here and you're
you're either in the castle or you're
not this is the idea
of instead of one gigantic castle that
somebody owns and changes all the rules
of Forrest's way that the privacy
settings work all the time there are all
these little mini castles and they all
speak to each other and so all of your
data isn't in one person's hands and
it's also you know there's there's all
sorts of other good stuff that goes
along with it so what what are you gonna
be building this on top of we are going
to use as the base of this Ubuntu
because I am comfortable with it
CentOS you could do the same thing with
that Linux distribution with Debian it
would really any linux distro but i am
i'm going to guy i can't help it
right and Ubuntu is based on Debian and
so it's got all of the goodness of life
being able to quickly and easily get
your dependencies done but apt-get
installs so we'll fly through some of
that
okay fact one of the reasons why I love
Ubuntu is during the setup during the
anaconda you get the choices to like hey
what do you want this server to be I've
got that choice right here oh I'm being
asked so cool do you want it to be an
open SSH server yeah so we just checked
the box and boom I didn't have to set up
anything now it's an open SSH server
don't want to be a DNS server now you
can do multiple yeah lamp oh yeah I want
me some lamp post lips doing something
that I love yeah I saw you messing up
your lamps with the WeHo and the Amazon
echo on tech thing check this thing
it's good stuff it's pretty cool yeah so
as opposed to something that illuminates
the room lamp stands for Linux Apache my
sequel PHP forget traditionally okay and
it's called a stack because you layer
those things like together yeah you
layer them on top
you know you get yourself a Linux base
and then you just you toss some Apache
up on that that's a web server they toss
some you know my sequel on top of that
you can just post gressive your Postgres
guy and then you use the page thing
yeah the PHP is the icing okay you could
also use Python or Perl or any other
language as it starts with a P except
for Ruby because it doesn't start with a
P so you know nobody wants lamb there's
not a thing
yeah but it makes it simple as far as
like just checking the boxes and now
I've got like the baseline stuff done
which is great so this is the part where
this is all being done as a virtual
machine oh and you know what since I
asked it to become my sequel server as
well it's now asking me to come up with
a root password for my sequel okay so
that's our database and your password is
Kirby my password is Kirby one two three
of course and I'm gonna go ahead and
repeat that and basic today that's
different than our user password this is
just for the database and then we'll be
able to log into our database and create
all of it for tables so now we are in
progress bar land yay okay and
installation is complete all happy all
right let's log in Kirby one two three
yep that's the one and get our
dependencies on okay now friend occur
requires a lot of you know basic stuff
so PHP five we're gonna need curl we're
gonna need a bunch other stuff and we
can pretty much get most of it done with
just apt-get so let's do ourselves so
some sudo apt-get goodness like I said
PHP five curl command line addition of
PHP five does Gd stand for good we'll go
with that probably need to do a nap yet
update before I can do this mm-hmm okay
with that all done now we should be able
to get all of our dependencies oh
Shannon what's wrong with my command
here sudo apt-get phi5 Oh install tak
why yeah there we go
didn't you watch active yeah you know
come on dude you dislike three years ago
everybody at home was like dude okay you
know some people don't know it yet
and at this point we can basically go
ahead and just check our server and see
if it's running with the dependencies
and all the good stuff that we're going
to need so let's head over to our web
server which is invar WW HTML is it
always in there typically with you know
typically with apache yes and so we're
gonna go ahead and create and we're
gonna remove that index page it's like
hey you've set up a thingy thingy and
now we'll create a new one so I'm gonna
become root and head back over to rww
and I'm gonna use Nano to create an
index dot PHP file now and write just a
little bit of PHP code I'm just one
function PHP info this right here is
going to give us all of the infos about
our PHP installation so right now if I
let's see first of all figure out the IP
address of this guy on the network so if
we head over to 10 down 73 the 31.1 49
we get our PHP info Wow and what a
mainly interested here is the SSL stuff
and boom we have everything looking like
it needs to okay so it says registered
streams Oh rest stream socket transports
and then it includes SSL and SSL version
3 mm-hmm okay yeah that's pretty much
what we need we also we need to set up
some stuff in our Apache to allow to
rewrite URLs and what that means is kind
of changing rather than having really
long URLs with like index dot PHP
question mark and a bunch of stuff we'll
be able to actually dynamically make
URLs like slash profile slash snubs okay
yes and to do that there's pretty much
command line tool for enabling Apache
service is called a to and mod or Apache
to enable mod and the mod that we want
to
is rewrite that's easy yep and now we
can do a service Apache to restart and
that will take effect we can also make
these changes by editing our
configuration file and so Apache 2 is
typically set up to host a lot of
different sites yeah we're only gonna be
hosting one site on this server just
friend guy right so we don't need to
make a bunch of different virtual hosts
for a bunch of different web sites if we
were say becoming a web host whether or
not we want to just host this friend to
con this
Ubuntu VM not put too many eggs in its
basket and in that case what we need to
do is edit the default configuration
file which we can find you know yep
gonna use some Nano to head over to your
Apache 2 folder and you'll see that we
have sites available and sites enabled
if I go into sites enabled I'll see the
my default configuration and I can go
ahead and edit that file huzzah
so this right here is the configuration
for everything responsible for the
default anything the star at colon 8080
being the port number that is the
default for HTTP and we can give it
things like the server name which
doesn't really matter for us right now
you can see that document root is in VAR
WW HTML just like we had just like we
had said before if we wanted to we can
change it to be pretty much anywhere and
at this point what we need to do is go
ahead and add right after where it says
document root slash more social www HTML
we're going to go ahead and create a
directory for that and allow a override
and so this is our default configuration
and right under where it says oops right
under where it says document root we can
go ahead and add the parameters to
enable that rewrite module I can show
you what it looks like on our live
server because it's currently running
and you'll see that this includes things
like the name of the server server name
social Dahak five org the server
administrator is administrator hack five
org you can see the WW root we even do
this redirect permanent here
that moves everything to http that's the
virtual host down here which is showing
star at port 443 443 is the default for
port for HTTP so 80 for HTTP 443 for
HTTPS ok cool and that goes into a whole
nother thing which we're not going to
get into today about installing the
certificate but it's very
straightforward so we'll probably come
back to that at some point if we need to
but what I'm going to need to do here is
on our new server create this directory
and within it I'm just gonna say allow
override all boom and there we go okay
that's done and now at this point we can
pretty much just if I fullscreen this so
it looks a little bit better we can go
ahead and restart our server just like
we did before with a little bit of that
action and it's complaining that it
doesn't have a server name yet but
that's fine it's not gonna cause any
errors in the install well the thing
about this is we're basically redoing
what we have already done before and
since it's actually live short of taking
that site down and then doing this one
and then doing a swap arewe it's not
going to be too feasible for the segment
but we're still following most of the
steps that you would need to follow to
go ahead and roll your own and as you've
seen thus far it's really a matter of
rolling in a patchy lamp server sorry
blue two lamp server installing the few
dependencies mainly PHP five modules
enabling mod rewrite and now we will
just get to the part where we grabbed
the copy of the latest and bestest ever
version of from nikka unzip it to our
web root and then make a few changes
okay so they have this download
available just straight through their
download tab on their websites easy to
find the link yes or you get it through
github but either way so we're gonna go
into our HTML place here we're going to
remove that index that we had created
previously and we'll go ahead and W get
which is to download over the web our
the latest version so it's from github
ger to her
whoo we're task force yay yeah there we
go and we can go ahead and unzip Master
dot zip we don't have unzip that's the
fun part of installing it and now we
have and there we go it's in friend akka
- master everything we need is in this
folder we're gonna go ahead and move
everything down a directory there it is
and we can remove that friend akka
Master directory there we go at this
point we are almost ready to go we do
need to change now we downloaded this as
route so if I do LS tech la you'll see
that route is the user and group for our
ownership yes we can see we Kat our / XE
/ passwd folder our so file that we have
a w w data right there and that is the
user for Apache you need to chain that I
need to town it so CH o WN to change
ownership and we're gonna give it to w
WD on the group W W data to everything
we're gonna use a tack are right here at
capital R that's going to make it
recursive so it's not just the files in
this directory but it's all the files in
all the directories and now when we LS
tack LA again we can see now they're all
owned by data very cool yes we do need
to set up our fully qualified domain
names so that it will work on the
internet I learned about it from my
Wireshark tutorials inactive we actually
just did this a few weeks ago - um with
the jitsi server so we just edit our
Etsy hosts file and right here we can
just go ahead and right now the name of
the server is in boom - what we'll one
is this to be say social because this is
going to end up being social hack v org
and we would do the same thing editing /
Etsy slash host
okay and change this to social right and
exactly the same as we did with that I
guess it was two weeks ago when we
rolled our jitsi server and made it
hangout hack five org it's the exact
same process it's a social dot hack five
dot work yes
similarly like we did in fact with that
installation where we setup it to have a
static IP address and that is going to
be very specific to your environment but
what we did was we edited the file in
Etsy network interfaces so that it would
always come up with a static IP address
rather than a dynamic one which is
important when you're hosting a service
on the internet because the VIP address
keeps changing then nobody knows where
it is that's never any good so that's
the exact same process that we did with
the jitsi stuff so the rest of it is
pretty much diving into the installer
yes into friend akka itself so we should
probably do that but we'll first take a
quick break it doesn't matter if you're
into Apache nginx are hearing different
about it because you just want to get
your idea up onto the entry webs as
quickly as possible you should do what
Shannon and I do we head over to
domain.com the sponsors of this very
fine program here because they make it
so easy to get your website online
lickety-split that's right the vetted
domain discovery system will help you
bring your brilliant idea to fruition
and if we haven't already told you they
are an awesome place to do business
because they're affordable they're
reliable they're easy to use and mainly
because they're just really cool folks
they're really cool folks to like party
and get down with you can tweet them at
domain.com and see why they've been so
epic for years with us and you know what
you see just say some nice things so
well yeah if you if you find yourself in
needs of the interwebs you can head over
to domain calm and just as a hack fan
fan you get the hook up use the coupon
code hak5 to save 15% off on domain
names and goodies so check it out
domain.com when you think domain names
think domain.com
all right we are we are so close
it just needs crit databases get some
emails on and configure our htaccess
file and we'll be good to go yeah yeah
okay that's one of the fun things about
social network is it has to rely on open
standards you know that it's kind of an
interesting juxtaposition is that for as
closed as the Facebook's and Twitter's
of the world are they still rely on the
openness of email that's right folks
email the original social network it's
it's almost as if like somebody invented
a protocol that everybody can speak and
use it to send you know status updates
and photos to each other
join my mailing list anyway we need to
set up the server to speak email okay so
that when you sign up for an account
over at social at hak5
org you'll get emailed your password you
goodness and all that so this is
basically friend nakiya that's going to
be emailing you as a user like hey
here's your password reset or whatever
yep okay and for that we're going to go
ahead and set up postfix or send mail or
one of those two to get the server set
up so that it can email us and notify us
when things need to happen why did you
choose postfix over here Samuel I just
it's you know because it was because
quick because Darren because because
Darren because there are options on this
beautiful thing about open source
there's so many options
that's like text editors we could use
Nano all day but Emacs is sitting right
there say hey let's play it we're like
no Emacs stop it anyway you're so mean I
know I just love me some Nano all right
let's go into it okay cool so with all
of that what we're going to do is set up
our postfix so that it will actually
speak to the interwebs email so let's go
ahead and jump in here and get our
dependencies met so just as before we
need to have to get installed a couple
of things here postfix which is an email
server e thing mail utils live Sasol to
tak to CA certificates
libsass ol to attack modules and that
should do it
and what we're going to do is we're
gonna choose an internet site here
because we're making a site on the
internet yes you choose our fqdn we
actually haven't set this up properly so
we're just gonna go ahead with the
defaults it's gonna be just fine but if
we were we would be getting it our fully
qualified domain name which in the case
of the live server is social that hak5
beador where we invite you to come over
and join us on the social thobe thingy
it's the social yes
and with that all done we pretty much
just need to go ahead and start editing
a couple of configuration files so you
can see postfix you'll see we have a
couple of files here
we're gonna need to edit the main CF
file so i'm gonna use vai to edit main
CF why aren't you using me though
wait why oh because you know because
because why not exactly and I'm gonna
come down here to the first instance of
where it says relay host and I'm going
to go ahead and delete that and come
down to the end and hit I to go into
insert mode I'm very excited about all
these colors going on well that's one of
the nice beautiful things about vibes or
vim it's it's colorful or VI no matter
how you pronounce it it's all going to
be good and so what we'll need to do
here is add a couple of configuration
entries now typically this is where you
put your ISPs SMTP server or if you're
running your own SMTP server SMTP by the
way Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
awesome protocol for sending mail that's
been doing that since the 60s I think I
want to say the sixties so you know
maybe like I said the og social network
and we're going to be borrowing Google's
yay yeah because that's just how we roll
so what we'll do is insert relay host
equals smtp.gmail.com in brackets colon
and the port 587
yeah typically SMTP is port 25 I want to
say yeah but 587 is the SSL version
because we're gonna be using this is
some good stuff
cool yes secure that email that's right
you memorized all the different ports
huh no you should waiting Shannon you
should know every port from from 0
through
65536 all see you on port 2 701 5 mm-hmm
playing some counter-strike sorry I'm
gonna stop right now I'm a little
caffeinated today if you haven't figured
it out SMTP underscore Sasol underscore
off underscore enable equals yes we're
also gonna go ahead and intern SMTP
Sasol password Maps equals hash code and
slash etsy postfix Sasol past word or
passwd this is the file from which it
will find the password for our account
ok that we're going to be using and then
finally on setup juice we're going to
set up a couple of other options like
security options like security
no anonymous 10ms setup smtps ASL sec or
ity options yeah secure 18 thank you
there you go
as well as a few others let's see we'll
need to set up our TLS see a file so
SMTP TLS CA file and where we gonna
store that probably in slash Etsy
postfix
CA cert pema SMTP use TLS that's right
we want to use TLS that's that HTTP kind
of SSL e goodness okay and that's it for
this
after that we pretty much just need to
go ahead and set up our password so
close that oops I instinctively hit ctrl
X because I'm and I'm in nano mode you
want to hit escape : W to write : X to
quit see that's that's why I you don't
have to remember all this stuff's just
bottom screen and finally we can go
ahead and set up our password files so
in that case I'm gonna use nano now to
edit sessile underscore passwd and in it
what we're going to basically do is give
it our Gmail goodness so smtp.gmail.com
: 587 space and then what is the Y what
user did you set up snubs test one at
gmail.com oh okay
: and then the password and the password
is Starbuck with a capital S and I'm
gonna change that after we record all
right and then when I'm in Gmail I also
need to change in the settings under the
little settings gear tab right under
forwarding and pop/imap and
to enable pop and IMAP or just enable
IMAP either of them is going to give us
access to the Google SMTP server I
believe and that's what's going to allow
us to send messages through Gmail
because we're too lazy to set up our own
SMTP server there's a couple of notes
here this is fine for testing but keep
in mind that Google limits you at 500
emails per day that you can send out
over their SMTP server so I didn't
realize that so if you're really heavy
emailer you're using Thunderbird and
you're just like oh yeah five hundred
ninety-ninth email anyway but it's
really important really good one
otherwise you know check it with your
ISP a course set up you're on we compile
I got those savings changed in the Gmail
so that's ready to go yep now we
basically need to change the permissions
chmod 400 to our sasol password file and
now we can go ahead and and post map it
so and we covered what 400 means in a
hack tip as well yes you went into all
of those magic Linux terminal 101 yeah
great and at this point we can go ahead
and send the CA the certificate
authority through T and put it into our
into the CA cert them that's basically
our certificate stuff it's I don't want
to dive into a like giant router
certificate authorities we can't we can
go down that route hole when we set up
SSL but suffice it to say we basically
just need to take a little bit out of
this see a dot PEM and then put it into
a see a certain pen so in that case it's
pretty much just a matter of cat Etsy a
sell certs premium and we're going to go
ahead and pipe that to let's see T tack
a
flush that's he most fix right where we
are really see a certain okay booyah
and now if we cat see a cert dot Pam
you'll see it's the same stuff it's good
stuff and what we want it to be and so
at this point we can just go ahead and
reload postfix it's an init D which
means all of these services if we LS /
NC / and knit D what you'll see are all
of these different services that are
running on the computer namely Apache -
that's you know what's running our web
server and all of the other good stuff
you can see my sequel there and so we
can actually tell it to restart by
issuing Etsy and D postfix restart and
if I just do this you'll see the usage I
can say start/stop restart reload flush
check or all of those different things
that it supports and in this case I want
to say restart and that's how you could
do you could do the same thing to any of
these services Apache is a little
special in that it has like its own
little ways to interact with we just
showed you how to set up its modules
using a - and mod there's a bunch of a -
utilities if you type a - and hit tab
you'll find a bunch of those for
configurations and stuff like that and
then another way to do that would be to
do use service so service Apache to
restart would be say the same as doing
what I just did with post fix there and
we could say Apache to restart and it'll
work just the same yep good stuff so now
we are pretty much ready to test our
email server and it'll just be going
ahead using those Gmail configurations
those for those that account that we had
set up so let's take a look at that I'm
going to basically echo some stuff into
it so I'm going to say hello world to
test this and we're going to pipe that
to mail we're going to use tack s to
give it a subject and we're going to say
testing a postfix and then we're going
to go ahead and give it a email at Lake
in hak5 dot org and there we go
now in just a moment you want to go
ahead and check to see that you have
some email because you should have
something from me that says hello world
and there you go this is pretty cool
it's a fast and easy way to get yourself
set up to send email from your server
just borrowing some gmail server it's
great for anything under five hundred
messages per day we will be switching
this over to our own SMTP server but you
know for testing purposes it's fine and
there's that similar ways to do this
with send mail with there's a light
version of send mail another alternative
is s SMTP which I find a little easier
to set up than postfix but whatever have
you we now have it sending emails which
is important because when we do the
final setup we're going to get an email
from the system with our administrative
password which we'll use to complete the
setup the next portion of this would be
basically to put this on the internet so
you know you probably need to set up
your port forwards or firewall to expose
really you just need to expose 80 and
443 those two ports for your HTTP and
your HTTPS and then back to the local
server we're going to go ahead and set
up our database this is always fun so my
sequel my sequel is a free and open
source SQL database there's a bunch of
SQL databases my sequel is one of the
most popular and we're going to go ahead
and enter it by doing my sequel tack
tack password it's going to ask for our
password that we set up when we first
installed this server and now we're our
my sequel prompt you can do things like
show databases everything ends with a
semicolon and we can see that we have
three databases you know information
schema we've got a my sequel performance
schema we can create a database by doing
create database and we're gonna call it
friend acai and then with show databases
again boom now we have friend acai so
this is gonna be a my sequel database
for the friend the code server yep okay
yeah and later if we need to do
administration of that database we could
use the same program or you can install
like a PHP myadmin which is a basically
a web GUI front-end that allows you to
do these sequel things a little prettier
but see also like goes-- AC cool
something that everybody should learn a
little bit of you know select star from
users where clue it was greater than one
anyway you get the idea to quit its quit
with a semicolon of course and this is
by I love that about that okay so now
we're gonna finish up the installation
right right so we've got an email going
we've got databases going we've got our
webserver going with all the mod
rewrites and all the stuff that we need
downloaded the latest version from
github unzipped it which set up our our
we've set it up to use the right user
which is WWD we've set it up with the
right permissions so it can access
filesystem so now last bit is to go
ahead and actually pull up the browser
to our web server and actually finish
the wizard because now it becomes easy
which is this is the fun of doing it
yourself right so let's go ahead and do
just that if I go yeah if I pull up 1070
331 149 I get the awesome friend a
communication server setup thingy and
it's checking all of my dependencies and
whether I have them or not and it's
telling me right here URL rewriting
htaccess is not working check your
server categories right why are we
running into that issue we're running
into that issue because we need to
complete our setup of the URL rewrite
feature which relies in our case on
what's called a dot htaccess file which
tells apache how to do stuff with its
directories and all sorts of other fun
things and we can get dive into regular
expressions if we really want to with
this so how do we fix it pretty easily
we go back over to our server and we're
are we're a website is VAR w w HTML and
what we'll need to do is create so I'm
going to touch htaccess and we're going
to go ahead and have to put a bunch of
stuff in that thankfully I've act
they already I've already got all those
are the options basically yes as you can
see they aren't going to be in the show
notes but these are the options that are
going to enable my rewrite rules and
make it so that this all works so too
quickly just put all of that in there
I'll run that cat command again but this
time I'm going to redirect it with a
Wacka into my HT access that's an
alligator that's a walk-up that's the
carrot whatever is it's kind of you guys
know it's a walker so now if I click
check again oh yeah we have a bunch of
green lights we have bunch of green
lights we've got all our dependencies
met could you believe it all of that all
of that ticket dependencies go yeah
servers are fun uh and then the rest of
it is pretty much a next next finish
yeah and you will get to the point where
we are where you can start tweaking your
social network and making it your own
and changing the names and adding your
own images and applying different themes
and installing which at that point
building your own myspace it basically
you know what this very much reminds me
of what it took to get WordPress running
back and say 2001 when I started running
WordPress yeah it's very similar to that
yeah would to that project has come a
long way in making this easier to get up
and running you know what's really
interesting about this too is franaqua
actually has a set of installation
instructions that are essentially built
for if you're already using shared web
hosting so if you've got yourself like a
dream house or one of those other shared
web hosting just like you would roll a
patchy server or I'm sorry not in patchy
a rolling your own WordPress server you
can do the same thing much more easily
because you don't have to go through all
of the process of setting up the
database through the command line and
setting up your your mail server and
setting up all of those other you know
dependencies and stuff they should be
already set up they've actually got a
really great guide that we will link to
in the description now that we've done
way right now you can install it just by
copying some stuff over in your favorite
FTP client and there's a couple of hacks
because you may or may not have cron to
schedule tasks we'll get into that in
part two but otherwise you know I think
it's important to always do it the hard
way first yeah that way then you know
everything that you might run into now
you can do some troubleshooting yep
pretty much the rest of the install here
is just a matter of filling out the
basics it's gonna ask us for instance
where the database is it's local host
because the database server is running
on the same server as the web server the
login I don't think we created a login
we should have created a user we're
gonna use root that's not really the
greatest password God sex love or admin
add yes all of the above patinated and
the database name is friend akka and I
can't remember if it was had a capital F
or not did it let's see oh here's
another tip as long as we're doing tips
in the command line if you hit ctrl R it
will search your history and we can type
in my sequel just by typing my and hey
there was the last time I typed anything
with my that's so cool
and yes it's lowercase friend akka so do
array and this is gonna go ahead and set
up the rest of it we give it our email
do you want to use the fake email that
I've been using yeah it's okay we're
we're gonna actually pull the the
already baked turkey out of the oven at
this point because there's just a few
other nuances that I don't want to have
to get into right now because I don't
want to break things that are working as
as far as the fully qualified domain
name and actually putting it out on the
internet we're all doing this local on
our network here but if you guys do want
to check out the finished product of
this it is really cool social hack five
org and we can get more into this soon
because here's the
people thing similar to you know that
awesome open source CMS content
management system that is WordPress we
can install plugins reinstall all sorts
of cool stuff so ton of plugins that you
can install so yeah we can do some of
those next week yeah and you can write
your own or whatever you want to do I
mean we can tweak this to our hearts
content we can go ahead and open the
religion you know putting about
religions that have you it's it's pretty
cool when you're running your own
services so I know this was a long
episode that I'm sure there will be some
questions leave those in the comments
there's some really great discussions
going on with this stuff which I love
and we'll probably let's just go ahead
and wrap this up
yes feedback at hak5 org if you guys
have questions about the installation if
you've run into any problems or if you
have any comments that you want to make
about our install of course yes value
that feedback we're not able to respond
to every single email but we do read
them all and we really cherish that part
of the community also hak5 org is where
you can find all of the you know links
to the other shows and social networks
and things like that so you know in
addition to being at social bihac that
org we're also on the Facebook's and the
Twitter's you know gotta love them all
