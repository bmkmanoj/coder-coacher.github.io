security cyber espionage nightmare OPM
breach we got a time line all that more
coming up on threat wire I'm Patrick
Norton this is threat wire for June 15
2015 through our security privacy and
Internet freedom well actually it's not
really personal it's for everybody out
there and what we're talking about
things being out there I'm gonna pull a
quote for you right here quote the best
option then could be to get sensitive
data off the internet entirely whoa that
one comes from cyber espionage nightmare
look at the case the u.s. is built
against agents of China's People's
Liberation Army at 61 398 they became
famous for hacking into networks and
American companies like us steel Alcoa
Allegheny technologies Westinghouse not
to mention United Steel Workers which
represents 1.2 million people at this
point you're working in retired steel
workers that's a lot of information
there it's doubtful that any of the
agents named in the indictment will ever
be extradited much less come to trial in
the US or anywhere else though the FBI
most wanted posters are always a nice
touch it is pretty clear though that it
is getting harder to keep secrets secret
if they're online or accessible to
machines online or was the article
quotes of vertically gore of Carnegie
Mellon University Scilab quote we made
access to services and databases and
connectivity so convenient that it is
also convenient for our adversaries it's
kind of deep isn't it the article
discusses the spear fishing techniques
used to deliver the malware that tapped
in the u.s. steals networks that allowed
for example Chinese negotiators to
secure business strategies pricing and
quite a bit more around the time similar
breaks took place at Westinghouse
ATI now co-assistant and they all happen
when they were in negotiation with
Chinese vendors Chinese workers Chinese
businesses are fighting over tariffs
with the government of China and before
we decide that the IT folks of these
companies must be idiots go read the
article learn a bit more about how
layers of security on email and web
servers and AV tools and desktops we're
just circumvented by a little spear
phishing some hot points and some
modestly sophisticated management by
hackers look a high-quality air gap
between your business data and the
Internet
might be a good idea it also makes
getting access to that data and sharing
it an incredible pain in the ass links
where the show notes and as always
comment down below
speaking of sensitive data getting
stolen Krebs on security has a great
summary of the breach at the US Office
of Personnel Management aka the HR team
for the federal government at this stage
the OPM story includes attacks on the
OPM computer networks uses which
provided background checks for homeland
security key point which took over the
background checks from uses anthem
health insurance primeira and care first
blue cross what's frustrating what
really ticks me off for the huge group
of people impacted by this collection of
hacks and breaches is that a lot of it
could have been prevented or at least
made significantly harder with better
security practices speaking of which if
you're impacted by this or if say you're
alive and have concerns about identity
theft here in the US go get a security
freeze we got links to Krebs advice on
them in the show notes I use one myself
and highly recommend them Krebs also
links to an excellent write up on ARS
technica calm which points out some of
the issues in OPM security practices
matter of fact until 2013 it says the
agency had no internal IT staff with
professional IT security experience and
certifications
not to mention issues with a lack of
multi-factor authentication mess of
poorly managed networks many of which
were administrated by outside
contractors go check out why the biggest
government hack ever it's a great read
alright maybe it's just a little
depressing meanwhile in more cheerful
news after tens of thousands of
taxpayers had their IRS refunds stolen
the IRS will quote require a more
rigorous authentication process before
releasing information and refunds and to
broaden efforts to pinpoint patterns of
fraud end quote says Patricia Cohen in
The New York Times you can expect these
new features the security stuff in place
to the 2016 tax season the article goes
on to quote IRS Commissioner John
Koskinen quote for the first time
everyone in the software industry will
share aggregated details about their
filings to help us all identify fraud
not so good as the news also in the New
York Times this time by Nicole Perloff
that the state sensors in China are
inside VPNs and tor privacy tools which
in theory should master online
activities especially when you duck
through the Great Firewall the article
reports that have users were logged in
to any of quote 15 Chinese Internet
portals including those run by by the
you Alibaba and Ren Ren the hackers were
able to steal names
dresses sex birth dates email addresses
phone numbers and even the so called
internet cookies that tracked other
websites used by a user and the quote
and derp of course the code that made
this possible
beyond the unpatched J snop
vulnerability on the servers in those 15
portals why are things not secured the
the code that was actually made this
possible was injected into people's
machines if I have web browsers in a
watering hole attack so let's just stop
using the internet and web browsers and
just go back to email which is also easy
to censor in China right before I go
home and stop using the internet or just
start banging my head against the table
