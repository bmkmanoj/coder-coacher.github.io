show on an AMD based PC it wasn't smell
like those dull Intel machines but then
when I saw the new g5 Macintosh with a
PowerPC chip I just knew I had to have
it so i started using final cut pro and
it just screamed with that PowerPC chip
I like those dull Intel's then I heard
about that new Macintosh four to five
times faster I was doing this big video
job and I had like this crazy deadline
so I ran out and got one as soon as I
could it's like fast like really really
fast okay so I can't run final cut pro

was my beer
do I Paul give me another beer hey
that's the last one what yeah God that
was awesome we didn't brief we didn't
refill before we started the show oh
yeah that that was so like I got an
email from some noob today and I'm
thinking maybe like he doesn't
understand the point of the show cuz I
think maybe he's like thinking it's
supposed to be like hacker school and
really it's it's not and maybe like
nobody really understands like why we
even started the show like you know Wes
and I we had this idea and it's because
like I really just wanted to practice my
micro you know I'm like I'm so over pro
at like editing but I was so tired of
like editing like footage of my cat I
know that I could like take this noob
like any day in like Sony Vegas well
like premier avid I mean I'd even get a
mac and like take this new of unlike
final cut you know there's like a lot of
micro that goes into this then I don't
think anybody really understands that
it's not like you know it's not easy I
wouldn't say it's like hard because I'm
so pro but I just don't think they get
it so I guess what I'm trying to say you
know is that maybe instead of hating and
stuff you should like respect and like
understand that we've got a dream and we
just like to do this tech entertainment
stuff and if you want script kiddie
stuff like I don't know what to tell you
but at least we're doing it consistently
and you know what at least it doesn't
lick my balls

okay raise your hand if you think your
backups should be private I mean like
really private you know none of this Bo
gets like oh we store your private key
in the cloud right there with your data
no that's nonsense you know any of that
recent stuff in the news about
intelligence agency backdoors no I'm
talking about serious privacy real
crypto strong systems we've talked about
in the past on hak5 I pretty much do it
with any cloud service but you know what
cloud service I love cuz they take this
seriously and they're they're like legit
on this is crashplan you know they get
it they've got a free client for Windows
Mac Linux and Solaris and get this you
can bring your own blowfish key now the
fee open-source cypher from bruce
schneier totally vetted nothing ever
touches the network without first being
encrypted and not only this is the best
part not only can you use the free
client brake to back up to an external
hard drive for free but there's secure
off-site storage totally unlimited I'm
putting like my fourth terabyte on there
right now and it's zooming at like five
megabits per second I am saturating the
connection we have here at hak5 you
can't always get that with other cloud
services you really need to read that
fine print because saturating a
connection being able to actually get
your data up there back when Paul's
about to do with all of our hak5 footage
ever to send them a giant mega terabyte
hard drive agra terabyte it's the new
hella terabyte and so as hackers geeks
and IT professionals we know the
importance of off-site backups at a hack
five you guys as viewers get this you're
gonna get a huge hookup they are really
stoked to be working with ice here and
they want to give you basically the hook
up on a one-year unlimited plan see the
normally 50
a year but get this if you go to the
special pages of the set up just for us
at crashplan calm / hack it up you're
gonna get twenty percent off it's like a
year of unlimited backups for less than
four bucks a month it is never too soon
to back it up so I highly encourage you
take advantage of this offer head over
