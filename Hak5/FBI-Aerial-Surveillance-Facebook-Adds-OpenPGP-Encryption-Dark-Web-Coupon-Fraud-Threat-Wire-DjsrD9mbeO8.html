from above Facebook announces the
ability to use open PGP for their email
and couponing fraud on the dark web all
day and more coming up on threat wires
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire for June 3rd 2015 your summary of
what's threatening our security privacy
and Internet freedom and thank you for
supporting us we've been doing this show
for one month so far for the relaunch
and we couldn't be more happier that
you're joining us so let's go ahead and
get started with the first story now if
you've seen some odd Cessna planes
flying overhead and long circular
patterns it's possible that they are
being used by the FBI first surveillance
in an article posted by the Guardian
yesterday at least 115 planes including
several small Cessnas are being operated
by the FBI under fake company names with
video and sometimes cell phone
surveillance technology now according to
spokesman Christopher Allen quote the
FBI's aviation program is not secret
specific aircraft and their capabilities
are protected for operational security
purposes the FBI's planes are not
equipped designed or used for bulk
collection activities or mass
surveillance
now the fake company names are used to
protect the flights operational security
that makes sense and the FAA knows about
it as well
while reported to not be used for mass
surveillance there a V Asian technology
can be used for that exact reason and
undisclosed to the public but this
information raises the concern that
aerial surveillance is just recently
starting to come to light while it could
be used to counter terrorism and
criminal activity definitely it could
also be used as a breach to our civil
liberties and become intrusive on
collection of our sensitive data it's
kind of 1984 bunch yeah I think so
Facebook is back in the news this week
with their new secure email
communications rollout Facebook
announced the ability for users to add
their open PGP public keys to the
profiles on Monday allowing into an
encryption of any notification emails
from Facebook which would also include
password reset emails and new login
notifications to add your own open PGP
public key all you have to do is go
to contact and basic info where you
change your email your phone address and
stuff and stuff and then choose add a
public key the Facebook article we
showed and we also linked below gives
how to set up PGP for your own identity
as well as what it is
so PGP aka pretty good privacy basically
lets you encrypt and decrypt data with
better assurance that your subject
matter wasn't read by a third party I
highly recommend a service called key
based I Oh which is very consumer
oriented it's very easy to encrypt and
decrypt your PGP messages and if you
need help we also did a segment all
about PGP on hack 5 now as a couponer
this story is rather important to me the
FBI indicted bjergaard rotting me of
Louisiana on Thursday with charges of
wire fraud and trademark counterfeiting
he was accused of being the dark web
user known as the purple Lotus and
selling batches of counterfeit coupons
for 25 bucks a pop the coupons could
then be used to buy hundreds of dollars
worth of brand-name items for free and
he could have done 1 million dollars in
damages to the brands in question total
now couponing can be used for lots of
savings and counterfeits over time do
detract from the amount that brands are
willing to discount on said coupons as a
couponer you also run the risk of
downloading something nefarious by
purchasing from an unauthorized person
or having the FBI knock on your door by
using said fakes at a store now law
fraud of this type is it new it has
become prevalent with the growth of
printable coupon use and it is a very
sad reminder for us to use caution when
trying to save a buck or two lastly our
featured comment today comes from not
man oh five who in response to the TSA
failing several security tests wrote the
TSA just provides a false sense of
security to the simple-minded
they are post active nothing they do is
to avert new methods of terrorism they
only focus on previous methods and they
don't even do that well they waste our
money on machines that have been proven
to be easily tricked and they managed to
continue hiring perverts who use their
position as an opportunity to grope and
abuse people not all do this but there
have been many cases to prove my point
don't get me wrong we need checkpoints
but they need to employ better more
efficient methods that
don't continue to violate our rights
just so we can fly to our destinations I
could go on and on for hours with a
really long discussion about my own
personal feelings towards the TSA but I
won't here alas I feel you on that but I
will say that it is really funny to
watch a whole slew of hackers after an
InfoSec security conference going
through security at the same time and
all of them asking for pat downs as
opposed to going through those creepy
scanners even if they just show outlines
they see us rollin they hatin thanks for

course if you have any thoughts on
