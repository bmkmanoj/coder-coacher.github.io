dropped Verizon was hit with hack bad
luck is a-comin and more USB hacks all
that coming up now on threat wire hello
world I'm Shannon Morrison this is
threat wire for March 30th 2016 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom patrons be
on the lookout new security episode by
Darren kitchen is happening this week on
the patron feed and if you want early
access to extras behind the scenes and
more check out our patreon page it's
over at patreon.com / threat wire and
thank you to everybody who is supporting
us onto the news yes it is official at
least the FBI is saying so they have
found a way into the iPhone used by the
San Bernardino terrorism suspect as
reported on Monday they are now asking
the judge ruling over the case against
Apple to vacate the order so basically
they're dumping the court battle US
Attorney Eileen Decker said in a
statement our decision to conclude the
litigation was based solely on the fact
that with the recent assistance of a
third-party we are now able to unlock
the iphone without compromising any
information on the phone the third party
company is rumored to be celebrate an
Israeli company that specializes in
phone data extraction but this hasn't
been confirmed so my biggest question is
how did the US government get into the
iphone and our apples phones really a
secure as they've purported to be and
what happens now with the several other
phones across the u.s. that the
government is trying to break in to
against apple's wishes i highly doubt
that apple's going to receive any help
from the US government to find this flaw
in their iphones and fix it specifically
if it'll make the feds job harder to do
which obviously it will now while there
are a lot of theories going on around
right now there's a lot of rumors there
aren't a lot of verified facts related
to the specifics of this news how they
got in and who helped them and if there
was any useful information actually on
the phone or was it all just a waste of
time and given the snowden like effect
that this story is going to have on the
general public in which I've already
been seeing with like my own grandmother
I'm really hoping
that introduces more concepts about
security to a larger consumer market
verizon offers cellphones and TV service
but also telecommunications for
enterprises and they were just hit with
a hack stealing 1.5 million customers
basic information off of verizon's
enterprise portal website yeah the
security hole has already been fixed but
the data has made its way to the Deep
Web where the 1.5 million records are
being sold for $100,000 or limited rates
for limited amounts of data currently
little is known about the breach but
customers affected are being contacted
so this begs the question how much is
your data worth according to this about
fifteen dollars now is it wise or unwise
to publicly disclose that a
vulnerability is present in a popular
piece of server software that and the
free advertising for a company that
comes along with discovering a new
vulnerability is currently under
scrutiny by many in the infosec
community bad luck is a new
vulnerability that was found by Sir net
a German company and their Samba team
members Stefan Mets mocker sorry if I
mispronounced your name the problem is
in code written for samba software which
is used to integrate Linux or UNIX
servers with windows boxes now not much
will be known until Patch Tuesday which
is on April 12 when a fix will be
administered for the bug but the hype in
the Free Press for sir net also comes
with a cost with how many days are going
to happen until the patch is actually
released on April twelfth black hats
with plenty of time to also find the
vulnerability and use it in the wild not
to mention the guy that found the
problem also worked on the same software
for many years writing code so what if
the problem actually persists in his
coat not somebody else's don't know now
for current admins using Samba as part
of their network you'll just have to sit
and wait which is very unfortunate and
hope that the vulnerability doesn't go
wild before April 12 USB drives those
things that you get at conventions all
the time the one thing that you really
shouldn't plug into your computer when
you find one in the parking lot talking
to you mr. robot after years USB drives
have been known to be a perfect breeding
ground for malware and a nutria
called USB thief has been found in the
wild USB thief leaves no trace on the
victim computer and can only be run on
the original USB flash drive it was
installed on it pretends to be a part of
a portable application I mean lots of
programs these days such as Firefox
notepad plus plus chrome a lot of them
run as portable programs just on a USB
flash drive and they just allow you to
boot them up from the drive instead of
installing on the PC it works really
well and it's quite quick for smaller
machines now when run USB fief runs in
the background with a mix of aes-128
encrypted files in sha 512 hashes it
protects itself from being copied to
another drive because it depends on the
drive itself ESET ESET Ireland was able
to reverse-engineer some of it so they
released information publicly on this
malware USB thief is most likely
targeting towards air-gapped computers
or machines that have no connection to
the internet hence air-gapped so our
best warning would be don't plug random
drives in and if you do don't run
portable apps unless you created them
yourself from a reliable source now
early access to show summaries
behind-the-scenes pictures Darren
security videos it's all available for
patrons over at patreon.com / threat
wire plus plus and this is a big plus
when we hit our next goal which were
really really close we're going to be
able to afford a top-notch RSS feed and
I'm so looking forward to that because i
know there's tons of you out there that
