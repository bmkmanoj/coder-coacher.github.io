those of you who haven't seen the show
before we r I T ninjas and we do
everything from mainstream IT to
homebrew gaming and we also do land part
is speaking of bland parts we have the
counter strike source game going on here
they're playing a little bit of think
this office and Joe Eagle is dying a lot
so yeah we like that game to hack five
org every month new land party of course
you guys know that this one one coming
up on the fourth is Team Fortress 2 yes
but of course is that we got a great
show for you guys lined up today we have
Chris grilling now is he down from
virginia beach or is he down from
richmond now talking to us about about
windows automated installation kit and
it is richmond we're just moving in on
monday actually awesome yeah so it's
going to be same distance from this
house but you know no no tunnel drive
through that's not very nicely well
looking forward to the windows stuff and
I hear you're doing something with Dig
Dug no not dig dug although I really
wish they would bring that back let
multi-player Dig Dug ohh epic get out
said it or make it happen I'm doing dim
dim which is an open source free online
or you could install it on your own
server WebEx clone go check that out all
right and I'm going to take one of these
fun routers and it is yo Seeger or yeah
Sager I don't know fix my pronunciation
you're just failing all the time oh dude
that's what I do I mean I got a lifetime
ticket to the veil bus and I'm going to
be putting the latest version of younger
on this and showing you guys how with
the cool little video I've put together
that is going to condense it all down to
some easy steps to make these guys
friendly for everyone I want to be your
friend yay really like how they do yes
alright so let's kick it off let's do it
all right I'm gonna head over and talk
to Chris and see what's going on with
the windows automated installation kit
yeah so Christ building a windows XP
Vista USB key that you can boot off of
ya so I kind of like the old linux
livecd but windows exactly okay we're
this come from right it's all about it's
called Windows automated installation
kit and I got it from a moment he had a
nice forum post back in August and
explained you know how to do it
everything linked up how to do
everything here's the actual post right
and so what it is is it allows you to
deploy however you want to do it vista
XP you know it's it's it's just windows
automated installation kit i mean you
can so it's so it's not like running
windows no that's on a USB key no i mean
it is it's the environment if you get a
lot of the environment but you don't
went once you're done you can't install
certain things it doesn't have dotnet
sounds a lot like the bart PE very
similar CD i'm used to which was a
pre-installed environment how is this
similar to that it's it's very similar
to it and and what you can do Bart p is
a little bit older I know that I was I
originally was going to just go and do
with that but i already had vista
running on this laptop so it was a lot
easier to demo and show off the newer
windows automated list elation kit
because it's you know it's it's updated
has all the drivers and i don't have to
i didn't have to mess around and and
okay so let's take a second alright so
i'm going to quickly show off here this
is the actual microsoft site where you
download it from it so it's completely
jit you know again you have to use
portable apps and things like that
there's no dependencies that you get so
you couldn't use this to run net and to
go exactly build a server off if you do
install stuff like that you have to do
it every time that you this is not a
replacement for an operating oh
definitely not so is this for repairs is
for build what is it a lot of people use
these for like fast deployment or like
image repair imaging there's an image
tool that's really really nice on there
will actually show that off in part two
where we actually boot into it so this
is the command prompt that you bring up
with it and accorded a couple of the
different links that moonlit provided to
actually help me build this I'll
actually zoom in here so everybody can
see so this is just a step-by-step tells
you how to do it and this is the command
you're going to put into the thing to
copy over your environment files I did
x86 here because I'm just going to stay
32-bit for now so after that once you
have that copied
you go and open up this part you have
your you put your thumb drive in I just
use this part I created a new I mean I
cleaned it create a new partition
formatted it and then after that you can
do it two ways one you can create an iso
which i don't have the right right now i
don't have the right files that i need
to do it it's just not I don't have it
set up right to do the iso part so what
i did is i made it so that when you
stick the USB Drive into a computer and
just automatically if you have the USB
booting enabled okay you just boot right
off of it so it's not like a youth read
rabbit no it's not a y'all to the scene
of the cd-rom no but I will have that so
after you after you build everything
well after you have everything set up
initially what you can do is in a
there's a folder here called the iso
folder and is if we look right here i
created a folder based on that command
called when PE x86 and that's going to
have all my stuff that i want to build
my image with okay in there is called
the iso when you use the ex copy
function to copy everything over to the
dr anything that's in this is 0 folder
is going to go with it so right now i
have firefox or bad packages anything
you want anything that standalone pretty
much anything that doesn't require so
you could put together like you know how
movies has those USB keys full of tons
of goodies exact all those goodies on
this and then if you've got a broken
machine you could boot up it onto the
windows PE environment mm-hmm have all
of those tools at your disposal to fix
your buddies NTFS permission problems
exact worked up registry or whatever
exactly so i have firefox minesweeper
portable minesweeper know as you're
mentioning all of this it really occurs
to me that one of the things that this
would be very useful for is any of you
people that have like a acer aspire one
or an epc or msi installing it on there
yeah so it's the process okay well you
don't have a cd-rom with these new
netbooks and sometimes installing if you
want to install windows or dual boot
with windows something like that it's
kind of difficult unless you have a USB
cd-rom or you do some some weird
trickery this well it sounds like a USB
key that you could boot off of prep to
drive and set up this to exactly i'm
almost certain you can do it
we'll do that good all right well let's
do that in the second part of this
series on using the windows pre-install
environment is that correct that's it
windows automate installation kit to use
the windows pre-installed environment
okay you've got to write up on Chris
Grayling calm and be up there you and
then of course moonlit gotta thank
moonlit oh yeah definitely admitting all
this and we love when you guys submit
that so you know check out the hak5
development board thanks a lot mulet all
right well I'm gonna go and head over to
Shannon and see what's going on with
this month's trivia hey hey what's up
like new geometry lessons yes I see an
original a yes spicy and very original
who's this pie dish up made this and he
posted up on our wiki but now if you
guys want to add a really cool wallpaper
and you want us to show it off during
one of our episodes just stick it on the
forums and we'll check it out we got a
section just for fan creation so we're
looking forward to seeing all kind of
crazy stuff I know that there's already
a bunch on the wiki and well yes anytime
you invite pictures on the forms and
speaking of the forums every week we
have a new trivia question I know
they've been kind of easy in the past so
we're making this one a little bit
harder you guys ready for it alright so
windows PE can be booted from pxe what
value identifies the client system
architecture as dec alpha in PX es dhcp
options i know the answer you do yeah uh
I'm not gonna tell you it was a 42 what
is it now okay fine it's 1337 sweet of
course where can they post those answers

Christine but first we're going to take
a break
if you're like me and run a lot of
virtual machines on your Windows PC you
might be interested in the software i
found called desk space it's 3d virtual
desktop that allows you to run up to
four spaces on your Windows PC in the
shape of this nifty little cube here you
can move it all around and it's very
customizable you can change the
transparency of your cube you can train
how you even get to the cube so for more
tips like this check out the hak5 forums
and check our show notes for the links
for this thanks Kristine all right
Darren so we're here with some yah
Seager stuff what are we actually going
to show the people we're going to show
them how to set up y'all say gir more
jager if you're American it seems we
can't get it right the first time we can
never get anything right the first time
I move so it's the Oscar or yah sager
which is it yes yes so yeah I'm going to
show you guys how to unlock fun router
and make it a very friendly router with
yo cigar and in order to do that and not
take 20 minutes on a live to tape shoot
i decided to put together an
instructional video so we're gonna go to
that right now let's take a look check
it out yas occur is the wireless router
that wants to be your friend when most
people open their laptops their wireless
connection managers look for wireless
access points that they remember probe
requests are sent out saying hello it's
me again it's my home wireless around
yah sager or the yes man is so nice that
when it hears these probes it replies
yes IM and connects the new friend
running a yo cigar is a lot of fun
because when people connect through your
yah seeger you get to sit in the middle
and watch all the internet traffic just
think about how helpful you could be
with all your new friends so how do we
go about building one well yah sugar
prefers open wrt machines with the
theros chipsets and currently work best
on luffa narrow routers
laufen era routers these little guys
were designed and manufactured by act on
and come flashed with custom font
firmware the basic ideas that they let
you share your Internet's with fellow
Fionn arrows and in turn borrow a cup of
packets from other phone arrows while on
the go it's a noble idea and a great
community and we're delighted to see
these happy little creatures in the wild
but we've got plans for this router
using the power of fair use in the
ancient art of ninja hacking skills will
unlock this little fanara install yah
Seager toss it in a plastic pineapple
and weaponize the little guy but first a
quick look under the hood laughlin era
runs a lockdown version of open wrt
requires 5 volts power runs on a 183
megahertz MIPS processor has 16 megs of
ram 8 megs of flash and speaks 802 11 B
and G he also has a serial port which is
great for unbreaking leads which can be
used for hooking up SD cards an
omnidirectional 1.5 DPI antenna and a
standard rp-sma connector for more
powerful antennas now let's get hacking
first we'll need a computer a virgin
Venera an Ethernet cable and some
special software this is a good point to
note that when you first take a virgin
fanara out of the box it is imperative
that you do not work so sleep
introverted doing so will allow this
little Funaro to connect to the
mothership and download the most recent
firmware and at that point it'll be a
bitch and a half to unlock and that's no
fun so on with the unlocking step 1 give
veneris empower open your wireless
connection manager and connect to the my
place access point the wpa key is the
serial number located on the bottom of
fanara next browse to HTTP 192 168 10
dot 1 and make sure fanara is wearing
firmware version 0.7 point one release
one or below if not consult the hak5
forms for further reading on downgrading
step 3 click the advanced link on the
router Status page and login with
username and min and password admin next
open the ssh enabled HTML
file this file is provided with the
unlocking guide on the hak5 wiki the SSH
enable file does just that by injecting
Funaro with a little code we can start
drop bear the ssh daemon step 5 ssh over
to 192 168 attendant 1 and login as root
with passworded men step 6 there is no
step 6 step 7 rename at c / init d /
drop bear to s 50 drop bear now he'll
start up everytime Funaro boots we're
halfway to unlocking step 8 transfer
over our patched kernel and red boot
config i like to use SCP to move my bits
but you can use whatever step nine patch
the kernel reboot and eat some pineapple
while he comes back up step 10 reconnect
to the my place access point ssh back in
and patch the red boot config then
unplug the phone arrows power and finish
off that pineapple step 11 flashing the
Vanaras firmware it's time to replace
the font firmware with open wrt kamikaze
so fire up the free funk a p-51 ez flash
utility it's available for Windows and
Linux it makes the flashing process
super simple connect an ethernet cable
between your pc and fanara point the
utility at our open wrt filesystem and
Colonel plug the Funaro back in and
immediately click go this process can
take 10 to 20 minutes so go find some
fruit it's nature's candy step 12 okay
this is an easy one as long as you're
not running vista telnet over to 192 168
1 dot 1 hey would you look at that it's
open wrt now let's go ahead and change
the root password so run passwd and hit
enter type i love pineapples hit enter
type I love pineapples again and finally
enter next we need to enable the
wireless so go ahead and toss in these
commands from now on we can ssh into our
badass new unlocked Venera step 14 copy
over our packages again i use SCP but
you can use whatever anyway all the
packages are included in a little
archive over at hak5 org step 15 install
web a--the web if is a sweet little
front end from the ex wrt project check
it out at x
wrt org step 16 browse over to HTTP 192
168 1 dot one login with username root
and password i love pineapples if you've
been taking this literally now take a
moment to appreciate the beautiful
interface especially the real-time
dynamic updating cpu meter okay now we
need to make some room for yas occur so
we'll need to rename / w w / index.html
to web if to HTML make a note of this if
you want to revisit the web interface
later okay step 17 install Ruby simple
enough step 18 install yahoo gers
patched mad Wi-Fi drivers step 19
install a jerk or from package or
tarball step 20 finally log into Yost
occur at HTTP 192 168 1 21 you'll be
redirected to yas occurs pretty control
panel make sure your interface is up and
go ahead and turn karma on meh sit back
enjoy a hacker cocktail and watches yas
occur gets friendly with everyone around
that's it your Venera is hacked slap on
a battery pack toss it in the plastic
pineapple and send it into battle
because now it's one badass packet ninja
or send it over to the hak5 forms where
you can learn more about Funaro mods
oscar extensions or other platforms of
yas occur supports thanks there and it
was great informative quite entertaining
i must say looking forward to the next
part of the yas occur sec next part of
the oscars segment will be when we sit
down with robin wood at torque on and
that will air on episode four or seven
cool yeah so i think at this point i'm
going to talk to shannon you there let's
talk about the land party I'm here I can
feel it coming I can feel like of it
what's going on over there we're playing
some counterstrike yes we are playing
some counterstrike it looks like Loki is
in the lead right now with 26 kills and
only 10 does rock that's really good I
have to say I think I had like two kills
today probably two head shots not very
good but I really wanted to tell you

calm / hak5 and remember please remember
to type the ww and next up we have matt
over there he's going to talk to us
about a dim dim dig dog something like
that Matt what's up man what's up hey we
uh we don't have a vga for you what do
we do that what what we're that I'm not
even ask so guys today I'm going to be
showing you dim dim that's di em di em
calm for those of you who haven't heard
of dim dim basically what it is it's a
free web ex alternative now we've all
heard the commercials for webex an
online meeting collaboration tool what
I'm going to show you is an open source
application that you can either use
their hosted version or install on a
vmware server or any standard Linux
server and go ahead and host your own
meetings now the limitations of the
hosted solution are going to be 25
participants when you use dimdim com if
you host it yourself you can have
unlimited participants and make any
changes that you want so long as you're
not reselling it to the dim dim
application what we've got here is we've
actually opened up a meeting that I'm
hosting and here in the lower left you
can see my video as well as my audio now
the great thing about this is is its
flash so if you use ustream or stickam
or anything like that before you can use
dimdim
basically just uses the same you know
permissions as any other flash
application that wants to take over your
microphone or your audio we've also got
desktop sharing setup and as well as
public chat on the low on the right-hand
side of the screen now if we go ahead
and switch over to Shannon I'm going to
go ahead and show you Shannon actually
joined our meeting and what we've got
here is we've got her looking at me so
now Shannon is looking at my video she's
could be thousands of miles away looking
in my video listening to my audio and
watching me move around the screen as
far as desktop sharing goes application
sharing goes and things of that nature
the great thing about dim dim is it
allows you to meet with people who you
don't have locally in your office I've
used it a bunch of times you know I I
know of a couple people that have used
it it's a great application you can guys
can go check it out or download it if
you want to host your own at dimdim com
that's d IM d IM com sounds a little
funny but it's a very serious tool and
i'm sure that you're going to get a
whole lot of use out of it now let's go
ahead and bring Darren back in because I
figured out how to bring it back it's
just one of these see how easy that was
the hacker skills let me tell you that's
how we roll so Darren you just got back
from tour con that's where you were
totally and now we've got another kind
of coming up yeah we're going to daikon
