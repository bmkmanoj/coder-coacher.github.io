airfoil designs installing ubuntu from
within windows and DC power supplies all
that and more this time on hak5 this
segment of hak5 is brought to you by
domain.com hello and welcome to hack 5
my name is darren kitchen i'm shannon
wars since your weekly does check a lot
and it's awesome and delicious sparkly
what oh oh my TV is sparkly yeah you're
revision3 anyway we have a great show
today I'm going to be dual booting
ubuntu via windows to do i thought you
were going with pig pig knee began
Biggums penguin penguin guy big guy pink
guy no actually I shouldn't make fun we
got an email from the developer that
offered to like you know help you out
like personally which is really cool but
but yeah I think it's but then again
you're gonna go the long way in what Go
Go gnome I might you know hmm I don't
know yourself I don't think I'm cool
enough for customize it KDE what you're
not cool enough anyway two bucks yeah oh
yeah and pranay is back from the quad
shot project to talk about in like
airfoil stuff really geeky licious yeah
we gotta go back many good questions off
the end we haven't seen huh oh good no I
was just kind of say we haven't seen the
results yet but we're still you know
hoping that everybody voted for us yes
we hope everybody voted for us so don't
wear cheesehead yeah I don't really want
to wear it she's had either but I can't
wait to see the Virginia is for lovers
shirt on bed- that's gonna be funny a
lot of people you know wrote in the
store liqueur gonna leak it's like no
it's a closed system and the other thing
was that I guess we didn't really
properly show this off but the
motherboard itself this is pretty cool
hang on a minute unscrewing vga it
actually does have a video card the
motherboard itself is actually in
I chococat three-ring binder which has
been modified so that all the ports and
stuff that and this just so that
everybody so that we're clear on this
that's a full ATX just want to make
thrown that out there anyway have to be
full ATX something like that yeah
something like that yeah cuz me I went
to Napa Valley this weekend yeah would
you do there I hosted a bachelorette
party in Napa Valley had some wines
while everybody else had twins had the
wines but I was being number one no i
was the DD who did I mean well you are
you were mirroring drives yes I was the
designated driver for my girlfriend's
out of the Bachelorette and I still got
to taste some wines but I had to use a
little spit can that they offer you at
the winery use so no spittin yeah a
teach you that in Missouri you can be
the DD for this podcast on Oh screams Oh
dad it is wait I think it is hold on let
me check it is hey know what I like okay
I like when people send us cool stuff at
548 mark street number 39 371 you're
lucky because we got some really cool
stuff this week Collison really okay
yeah close your clothes your computer
cuz we kind of kind of have a big box
okay whoa I told you it's a big boss ooh
floppy floppy she doesn't love windows
31 did having a quarters yeah I had all
of my basic files on these oh man every
Bobby though it's for a gateway 2000 we
have here's the user manuals for all the
cool stuff oh wow this is microsoft
windows 3.0 ms-dos ms-dos 62 to upgrade
okay so this is my favorite living Lords
now um before I show you this I'm going
to read who it's from is from Nick hey
says hey hak5 crew I've been a fan of
the show since the very beginning and
thank you for the hours and hours of
entertainment and education you've given
throughout the years i was recently
going through some things that i had in
storage
that i found and i found some of my
computer parts and software collections
that I no longer have used for and
thought that you guys would make better
use of them than I keep up the great
work hope you have some use for this
package I'll put it on the set yes we
will yeah and guys now our junk thank
you owe me the photo frame case mod yeah
yeah whoa yeah there's a lot of RAM yeah
it's not only ran too there's rarely we
got some pc100 there's some CPUs oh wow
check it out Tandy is even much less lon
XP 2100 and assuming needs a broken so
i'm not gonna take i had the extra try
on mobility whoa look at all of those
cpus okay we have to make some kind of
energy k 6 too okay actually we've got a
plenty of cpus now we're gonna have to
make a cpu mobile if we should we should
make some which is elated one we
t-mobile is like laptop i I don't know
which one this is enough to look up the
model it says it's a motorola so yeah
interesting dude sweet thank you that is
pretty oh it it's gonna latch how
fantastic is that yeah we could use it
yeah sweet okay cool thank you so much
Nick that's fantastic you know what
let's get the ball rolling just let's
get the ball rolling let's get flying
let's zoom out of here let's throw over
to pranay and find out about flying and
stuff and then when we get back deal
chase will be here yeah this week we
have the pleasure of having pranay
what's up man from the quad shot project
we've got the quad shot in the studio
again I'm super stoked because you're
gonna you're going to show me how to
build a an airframe and everything that
there is no about avionics in the next
five minutes right well I'm going to
show you a little bit of walking it for
sure I i I'd love to know so this is
what's actually this material well this
is actually extruded probably in its
sorry expanded polypropylene EPP it's
basically foam what we've been doing to
build our prototypes is taking a block
of form and using a CNC router to cut
out the shape which we designed and
hopefully if things go well on
Kickstarter and they've been
so tremendously well thanks to all get
good you've got and we should be able to
injection ball them which will give it a
nice clean finish oh nice so I guess
when it comes to the shape of the
aircraft that's kind of one of the most
important parts how do you come up with
that well there are several parts of the
shape of an aircraft this is basically a
flying wing and so the wing itself is
made up of these 2d sections called
airfoil so you know the whole wing shape
where it's taking the front and it has
this teardrop shape right right i mean
every every every kid has taken a piece
of paper and blown across the top it's
actually yes but it's a slightly more
complicated version of that and so
basically what we have are two or three
sections within this wing and they're
all essentially joined together by a lot
now the loft essential is decided by
what kind of sweep we want and that is
partly decided by the drag that's on the
aircraft and partly decided by the
stability we want because we want it to
be swept enough that the center of
gravity falls in a specific location on
the aircraft and that helps it maintain
stability in flight and how many
airframes did it take you a duration of
those to take you to get to the perfect
one ah this is the 8th wing and I think
we've pretty much frozen the aerodynamic
design at this point basically what we
started off doing was designing the
airfoils themselves 2d sections and we
use a couple of programs called x1 and
ABL which were written by a professor
mock drill at MIT and what I have over
here is just a front end version that
another gentleman wrote up and it
actually shows ah this is open source
does this is open source except about
five it's excellent front end software
for X boil and a beer and you can just
download it off sourceforge and you know
you can see for example after we run our
analysis on different airfoils you can
see the boundary they're separating and
you know becoming thicker okay so now
you mean the blue part here is the
actual wing the yellow is representing
what the yellow is actually representing
the boundary layer which is essentially
the slow-moving portion of air and a
slow moving on top of the wing right
next to the surface because of the
friction up here is at the friction up
here is the pressure that you can top
surface antibody actually see here as it
turned here the pressure got pretty
dramatic apps
what is that really representing well
the people the main thing that we look
for is the difference in the pressure
between the top surface in the bottom
surface and it's that pressure
differential that really you know
manifests itself as the upward force
that you see of the lift and so
basically when it's at the maximum third
position you'll see that the top surface
and bottom surface have very different
pressure because there's lots of
pressure pushing it up or you know this
low pressure on top and it's a very low
pressure on top and much higher pressure
on the bottom surface you know speaking
on a fairly basic level and what happens
after you get beyond a certain point is
that the pressure that you see well
basically because there's this really
huge negative pressure P court is this
huge low-pressure area in front of the
airfoil and there's a high pressure area
at the back of the airfoil the airflow
actually wants to move backwards and at
that point the wing stalls and Yemen as
the aluminum and that's not good so are
you know as you can see it's a VTOL
aircraft and it goes through some really
high angles of attack so our I you know
our real design criterion for the Air
Force was to make sure that that stall
region was pushed as far out in terms of
alpha as possible alphas the angle of
attack and so you can see over here
we've managed to actually and the dark
blue is the is a standard nakka 20
wetzel work nagra is the nationally
national advisory committee for
aeronautics which is the precursor to
NASA okay so this is kind of like a
baseline airfoil this is a bass line
symmetry careful we chill symmetric air
force because we want to attack you
don't have a fuselage or anything's you
don't have a fuselage yet and we wanted
this aircraft to fly the same way that
they fight upside down or right side up
is there a right side up yeah well it's
ideal I guess so so this is a standard
nakka the dark blue and you can see that
it really stalls fairly sharply you know
right about just over 12 degrees over
here and this is our F wall in the light
blue and you can see that it stays
evolved with CL 1 which is pretty good
all the way from five degrees of our for
all the way to 20 degrees of how fun
it's only about 20 degrees then stars
yeah which is fine because by that time
your trust is you know you
lifting force is coming from the props
anywhere so like if you come up with a
shape and then run it through a
simulator or how did he come up with
these figures so basically this fame the
f-word definition is written out in
terms of x and y coordinates and you
know there are many ways of doing it
different people do a different ways a
good way of doing it to start with a
standard air for like an Akha in case
you want to submit your care foil yeah
and then look at that pressure profile
that I was showing you earlier and
basically change the shape of the
airfoil to make sure that pressure
profile does what you want it to do and
you know there are optimizers in X foil
that will allow you to do that and some
things you can tune by hand nice now
what about the can you tell me about the
different modes of operation of the quad
shot here because I know that with the
autopilot it does a lot of different
things what are those different modes so
basically we have three modes the first
one is an assisted hover mode now what
happens in assistant hover is that your
sticks which are right here essentially
when they're at the center what you come
on is the angle of the aircraft and the
IMU on board which is the inertial
measurement unit tells you or it knows
what it calculates what the angular of
the aircraft is and basically so when I
push it all the way forward it wants the
aircraft to be at 90 degrees which is
fully flat forward so it's flying right
and then it's not a down like a
helicopter anymore it's an airplane yes
and every day right but if I let it go
then it centers itself so we resets back
to resets back to vertical and so that's
really easy if you're a novice fire
because you know if you start panicking
let this sticks go and you're right it's
up all right so that's the first mode is
it will just stay vertical what's the
other one absolutely the second mode is
a forward flying mode so essentially
what happens in the for applying mode is
that you hit a switch and this wing will
you know the aircraft will spool up the
top motors pull down the bottom waters
and mix in some of elements and flip it
forward and do this for you all you have
to do is hit a switch okay so then you
can tell it to you know take a dive
right let go of the sticks and it'll and
it will go back to forward flight it
will go back to forward flight now the
thing to remember when you do go into a
diet is that you're controlling the
angle of the aircraft against you're not
controlling the altitude directly so you
know if you do
go into a sharp dive make sure it's ok
so far enough above the ground yeah but
yeah anything so yeah again that's a
fairly highly assistant mode in fact the
good thing about that is that you know
how many you try and turn an aircraft is
to bank it and then you have to feed in
a little bit of rudder so that that this
doesn't have that it doesn't have a tail
so how do you how do you compensate for
that well we have a little I'm you on
the thing like I said and it measures
sideways acceleration so what you want
to do is to make sure that your sideways
acceleration is zero when you're
actually turning that's called a
coordinator turn and so basically what
it does is it if it sees that the
aircraft is slipping one way or the
other it will automatically spool up
propellers on the left or right side
depending on what you're trying to do
and make sure that your turn is
coordinated so it always said it's
totally smooth it's totally coordinated
so all you have to do is hit a stick you
know just a single stick and return to
the term for you so so so much now as
you did that also we were seeing right
here on the plotter variations here in
the data that you're getting back what
is this data that you're getting back so
the data that I'm getting back is over
here is the estimate of the aircraft so
basically this is what the angle oh wow
that is so cool that is just coming
straight in from the IMU yeah it really
is like a like a wiimote oh absolutely
yeah yeah in many ways it is and so you
know it knows what this heading is it
knows what is bitchin you are okay so
what is the top one the top one is what
you set from the remote control and we
call it the reference so that's what you
control suppose I turn on this remote
control right I wouldn't have to spin up
the profs for this one so quickly ask my
colleague Chris to step in and Chris
could you just hold that and have you
put these on just safety first all right
so if I spin up the propellers and this
is a safety mode the system doesn't turn
on and there's a process pinning it
gives a good indication that things are
wrong now if you look at the reference
over here what happens is that when I
pull on it it moves ok so nice setting
is what you're telling it to do
absolutely but it knows what it is is no
I am here right
and in fact if you look at the bottom
graphs over here yeah right these are
the commands that the autopilot is
feeding into the motors at this point
when I put it well what's the green and
the red rep ok so the green is the
Yoakum on the red is the Royal Command
and the blue is the fish come on ok so
it's order to pitch a lot right there
right because I put this thing down so
if I pull the stick down which means I'm
telling you to pick up uh-huh what
happens is that you can see like I see
it sending the command and and if you
were to tell it to roll you would see in
the 3d absolutely so suppose I set it to
the attitude mode for the telemetry and
I tell it to roll there you go nice and
you can you can totally hear that it's
like adjusting which which propeller is
getting the power so if i want to y'all
you can see it moves around and it's
just getting upset because it's not
actually yeah because chris is holding
it steady at the moment so I'm telling
it to do all these things when it can't
do it so if won't do it in fact if Chris
could you just move it around a little
bit oh wow ok so i can see he's now
moving the aircraft the bottom view and
like trying to anyway trying to fight it
yeah because it wants it wants to today
and i'm not putting in any commands it
because like i said easy mode bball the
stick will be ok and it's all good that
defines the first few mode and then of
course the third mode is the fun mode
the third mode is the phone mode the
third mode again is a simple switch away
all you have to do is you know from this
is too and that's three and what happens
in more three is that is really like an
aerobatic aircraft at that point you
have very direct control of things
there's always the autopilot running but
what you can do is tell it to point any
which way you want you can tell the set
point to rotate at about 720 degrees per
second or more argyros max out at a
thousand twelve hundred degrees a second
say she is limited so all of that so you
can do some crazy acrobatics oh yeah I
before the maneuvers that have had the
aircraft spinning around at between 800
and a thousand degrees it is just crazy
yes just applying wing price then I bet
yeah and I spin on a dime it can turn
around on a wing tip so yeah I'm going
to be the guy as soon as I get my name
on the Kickstarter I can't wait not only
we're going to be packaged sniffing
from the sky with a Wi-Fi pineapple but
maybe you an acrobatics while I'm at it
dude thank you so much it is p 1 t and
people can go over to fly quad com like
watch our comm awesome and all of this
software that you spoke about as open
source you can just get this aligned
source this is all in a project called
paparazzi and the link to the wiki is on
our website i love and yeah we can find
any great thank you guys so much way
back in just a bit it seems to be
something more like straight forward by
USB rubber ducky calm no it should be
more hardcore like like tactical Assault
ducks calm I'm leaning towards
programmable human interface device calm
