by busted tees couple of eyebrows how
does how is this you know as far as in
the eyes of the FAA and in the eyes of
the FCC well as far as the legality goes
because the the u.s. RP is really the
only questionable one and we've
configured it to operate on 925 point
two megahertz which is within the 33 7
centimeter amateur radio band and I'm a
licensed ham radio operator so that
makes it legal as long as we transmit my
callsign all the other RF frequencies
are public use you know Wi-Fi Bluetooth
the the zigbee like they're all that 2.4
gigahertz I am Dan free-for-all as far
as the drone itself the FAA has specific
regulations for hobby what they consider
hobby grade UAVs under 400 foot of
altitude at all times must be line of
sight and must have the ability for a
manual takeover of the airplane at any
time as soon as you put this in the air
and make money off of it you're in
violation of FAA rules and you have to
get a permit ok so this though has the
capability to fly over 400 feet
obviously absolutely ok uh you probably
could now this is using an Arduino and
some open source avionics software right
yes yes I say you could probably
automate the takeoff and landing yesh
right actually the take-off yes the new
version of the DIY drones are jus pilot
mega uh-huh has the ability to do
automated takeoff and landing so are you
required to do manual takeoff and
landings or is it just that you have to
have the capability to we just have that
you just have to have the capability to
intervene I have to have a fail-safe
switch so you're actually standing there
with some remote controls so we'll turn
the sticks ok and as far as the line of
sight is concerned you have got a 4g on
here so you could say go fly over that
building miles and miles away and report
back to me the telemetry for via 4G
right absolutely yeah but all of your
tests of course have been in the legal
operating areas right tempting as it is
to send it long distances and do real
work with it
you know in the effort to restrict it to
a proof of concept we do so is that how
you guys feel about this as a proof of
concept what's the the motivation behind
this is demonstrating capabilities or
what there's just be the hacker because
you can yes it was because a lot of a
lot of folks told us we couldn't do it
which is yeah that's the wrong thing to
say so it's only impossible because
somebody hasn't done it yet yeah so what
we really wanted to do is showcase that
you don't necessarily have to be
dropping Oh day every day to be you know
a value to the community that you can go
out to these various open source and you
know off-the-shelf parts you can really
put together something powerful without
having to have some advanced degree from
MIT or you know one of these high-end
schools or be a rocket scientist you can
really do something impactful and and
give people things to work with without
having that that background yeah well
it's a great mashup of all of the
existing technology in a way that has
just never been done before what are you
guys planning on putting in this guy
next
well I think one of the things we're
looking at is a three axis camera
something low light that we can that we
can steer over the Internet of course
and stream back to us over the the big
pipe that would be great in addition
we're looking at things like our own
custom airframe or perhaps one of the
larger glider style airframes that are
available are they like kits to start
doing that or how do you even go about
beginning to build your own airframe hey
this is not your typical like you know
hacker skill set err but that's awesome
sure well I mean the maker community is
getting into carbon fiber now they have
Do It Yourself carbon fiber kits you
know that being said there's also a lot
of commercially available glider kits
that are that are being used right now
by hobbyists and they range in size from
you know really small things two things
that you could probably hang some
significant weight 12-foot 15 foot
wingspans so there's really a plethora
of choices for us nice don't tell me
about the new control surface so if you
remember last year we had a big black
pelican case with a touchscreen monitor
and it was very big very bulky and it
was the primary interface to the onboard
payload computer just in testing alone
we found that to be very you know
obtrusive and hard to use so what we've
done is we've we've built a new project
box and we've incorporated a dumb stick
of arrow for an operating system to
effectively run as a router and we've
connected it to an asus access point
hotspot okay this is just a wireless
client to this be that well the xB gives
us the connection to the airplane the
wire let the Wi-Fi hotspot allows you to
take your laptop your even your android
cell phone connect to this wireless
access point and now you have access to
the onboard payload of the airplane and
you can manipulate the tools that are
available and you don't have to have any
you know special custom hardware or
anything and you just SSH in and can run
all the tools right from there at your
at your laptop like you're used to does
that mean that this control surface here
could potentially run more than just
this guy here maybe like a fleet of
these guys you're limited in USB
connection so for every USB connection
you could have another air
plain that would you could use to access
via this box so what is it 100 and 127
but they're still ways around that yeah
but I wouldn't know anything about
trying to put 200 radios on a computer
127 airplanes huh well I'm just saying I
mean so yes I mean it's entirely
possible you could control multiple
airplanes with this one box you would
have to have an operator for each one
obviously okay so I got asked about the
the media stuff because it's obviously
blown up since last year what has been
the craziest thing that that's happened
that since this project kind of went
public for you guys Wow just realizing
that people are really interested in the
project yeah last year it was great we
received a lot of attention from from
the peers and folks at Def Con and then
through your show of course and it was
wonderful we got a lot of great ideas
and we we still talk to a lot of the
people that we that we talked to as a
result last year's show and this year it
was just amazing to see the number of
people that had considered this last
year and then are interested in it again
this year it's just exponential and
hopefully it will result in some
innovation yeah so I gotta know as you
know the people that watch the show and
they get interested in this sort of
stuff like taking you know taking
hacking to the skies is this open have
you open source everything can people go
somewhere and find out how to do this
themselves if they can you know pick up
an old drone from an army surplus store
or something well everything we've done
is available on our website as much as
we can provide know that we thought
useful sources and you know where we got
various components bits parts pieces the
actual assembly we kind of didn't really
detail it in great detail because each
implementation is going to be a little
bit different a little bit unique and
we're hoping that that you know we don't
want just people to photocopy it won't
we want people to go innovate and learn
so yeah I mean as much as you can go
build this it's all we think we put it
under GPL yeah so I think that's
beautiful because you know hacking the
skies it's just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
