threads welcome to hack tip the show
will we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today
I'm going to unselect I my PC now there
are plenty of programs that you can
download and tools that can help you
make your computer faster but I wanted
to go through a refresher of some of
those really simple steps that we
sometimes forget to use number one
rebooting it all of those background
programs that you forgot you had open or
even some that you closed still may be
using a bit of memory ever see the
computer say that it ran out of virtual
memory that happens to me all the time
and a reboot can help that number two is
T SRS terminate and stay resident
programs are little software packages
that launch at startup and stay launched
they make you think that the actual
program boots up really fast when you
really click on it but as much as I
really like vampires TS are sucking a
valuable amounts of RAM is just plain
unnecessary number three get into the
habit of running a disk cleanup tool in
a defrag of your hard disk I use a
program called defraggler that my friend
Dave turned me onto it's much cleaner
than the built-in Windows defragging
tool and it gives you a bit more
customization number four watch out for
those beta tests and brand spankin new
software upgrades sometimes software
upgrades can just make your computer not
work so well for example I had to deal
in grade my version of VirtualBox so
that I could boot off a USB or create it
into a VMDK though this didn't really
slow down my computer it did really give
me a headache the next one is erase and
start over maybe you just want to clean
up your browser or clean up your whole
computer just sometimes just a bit of
spring cleaning can go a long way
uninstall the programs that you never
use the ones that have way too many
add-ons the ones that start with a new
install you know just start over
so fresh and so clean clean now the next
one I do this on my mom's computer every
time I visit her along with defragging
and running a registry cleaner scan for
adware spyware and viruses you may be
the best out there downloading the
safest software but little things do
make it past from time to time maybe not
very often but it's still worth a look
the next one is visual effects like 3d
animations and moving backgrounds which
although very very pretty can really hog
memory keep it simple and save your
memory it works one of my favorites are
all of those handy windows optimization
tools that you can find for free online
check out the earlier episode of hack
tip for ideas on which ones to use or
try the website alternative 2 if you
want to try something else
now all this and a bag of potato chips
is awesome and after the break I have a
few simple steps for hardware upgrades
that can really help that old computer
if you need a very cheap fix only
suckers pay full price and if you love
alternative apparel brands like Kidrobot
Hurley and Stussy and hate wasting all
your cash on them listen up you can
score these premium brands at up to 80%
off every day there's a new invite only

hit up jack threads.com slash hack 5 and
you'll instantly start saving without
having to leave the house and I'm back
and two hardware upgrades that candy
Slug your computer are purchasing new
RAM and a new hard drive now you don't
have to go as crazy it I did on my most
recent computer build and buy like 12
gigs of RAM because you might not
actually really need it but upgrading
from 512 megs or 2 gigs to like 4 gigs
or 6 gigs or eight gigs can really
really make a difference and number two
is update that old hard drive I upgraded
my old 500 gig hard drive with a new
to terabyte 7200 rpm Drive that gave me
a lot more rotations per minute as well
as more space for the price of hard
drives these days it's your call to
whether you want a solid state or a
rotating disc I like getting two
terabytes for less than 100 bucks
because I don't move my computer around
much and I can get several years out of
my hard drives but hey whatever floats
your boat and by the way what does float
your boat like these tits wanna add more
