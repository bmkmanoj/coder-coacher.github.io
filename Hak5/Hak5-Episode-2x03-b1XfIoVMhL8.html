1 1 0 this episode of hack point 5
Darren makes us more paranoid about u3
technology with the USB hack so the
software job from an aphid a calm comes
down to show us some code monkey
goodness Paul comes back on this side of
the camera to show us some great
homebrew voice over IP and we head up
north to meet with our friend Andrew in
Toronto with some mini zombie
all that and a whole lot more on this
episode at point father
okay so last episode we talked about a
way to use the new u3 technology in
these readily available high-capacity
relatively USB keys to own somebody
spots now using a similar technology we
have come up with the USB hacksaw to
back up USB drives that have been
inserted into that machine
Darren yes we're talking about the
hacksaw what is this hack and how does
it work okay well first of all it's
based on a program that was released I
think mid September by a french hacking
group called USB dumper which basically
allows you to backup anything on a
removable media you know invisibly
automatically and we've taken it a
couple steps further right okay now what
tool is are we going to use to
accomplish this particular hacked I want
to just go ahead and insert this on this
machine real quick I can open up the
folder and show you right so
installation consists of plugging in the
hacksaw USB key into any computer where
I'm sorry I should qualify that any
windows 2000 or greater computer right
and this is where the modified
switchblade comes in because it's going
to use that same youth reads virtual CD
Jesse CD partition to install itself
thank you max damage and you can use
homages solution as well
yay an on year three USB like it key
like this one that it would just auto
run when you open the so for that see
last episode so you don't assume that
tell on the way key go right through
that so if we go into the WIP folder on
this USB drive and go into CMD we can
find this go CMD file here and this is
the actual installation procedure and
I've commented that as best as I could
and what this does is it copies the
tools over to a hidden system directory
now if you're logged in as administrator
it will put it in C called access where
I'm sorry your system root which is
normally sequel backslash wisdom so this
e : that word secret bagless yes C colon
backslash windows backslash dollar sign
NT uninstalled kb9 three one three three
seven dollar sign so it kind of blends
in with the rest of the image and it
looks up all that stuff there some
anywhere to try and write through all
that try and find something wasn't
especially be there they'd have a hard
hard time doing so I know what they're
looking for it looks kind of legit okay
if you're logged in under guest this
works as well and it can't write to the
windows directory so it will install it
to application data so that BC backslash
documents and settings backslash user
name backslash operation and that's a
system or a hidden folder at least so
long story short light four because I
know you told me this will auto run
later like every time they restart this
computer it will auto run and put itself
back in RAM and now if your
administrator that's where the changing
the registry goes into because you could
do that as administrator right but if
you're a guest it goes into this Start
menu right so it'll still auto run it
goes into the Start menu under the
startup folder with a blank icon and a
blank file name or shortcut name so to
do that I guess we can get into the
tools the tool for that is shortcut UFC
and that's a really nice little command
line program very short cuts who would
have thought mmm we also use rar
which we may be familiar with as a
archiving tool very similar to zip and
that's what allows us to say like
somebody plugs in the USB key on this
machine that's got 50 Meg's of documents
it will cut those up into ten five
megabytes
chunks ready to be emailed right we also
use to email Blatt and Blatt is a
command line tool for sending email very
similar to send mail if you're running
the UNIX stuff and we also use s tunnel
which is a command line program that
allows you to create an ssa I'm sorry
SSL connection to our mail server in
this case we're using SMTP gmail.com
because readily available yeah and we're
using the modified USB dumper
application right okay so so that's the
installation
now what's this hat gonna do I mean how
how's it gonna work and you've got it
you this machine's been hacked already
right as soon as I plug in the drive
just a few seconds it takes care of the
rest okay and say for argument's sake if
somebody wanted to be blackhat about
this this was a client computer on a
university network on campus right and
you've owned this machine and you know
you've owned it right so you're gone
you'll get your speed key goes away I
take this out and then some unsuspecting
college student ie me comes in oh darn I
got to use this I
I don't have a printer in my room I've
got to print this out I'm not going to
carry just my paper on here I'm gonna
have a lot of stuff on here probably
write my space pictures maybe yeah all
right so I'm gonna insert this into the
machine and and we just you know get the
the normal removal disk what do you want
to do and that's all there was to it
right now this has been backed up if we
open the folder we can actually see
what's going on here so I'll go ahead
and CD $2 son NT what did I say was NT
uninstall KB 9 3 1 3 3 7 I start this
folder I can see that here's the payload
from our USB hacksaw mm-hmm and what it
had done was it ran to send dot batch
file here have a go ahead and edit this
we can see that this is where we
configure our options for what email
address we're sending it from what you
missed we're sending it to as well as
password to the sent from email right
they the account in this case we're
doing a Google account my email account
so that it can use s tunnel and blat to
login incentives files right and it's
also removed to those files from the
system after it back them up ok so it
cleans up after itself as well yes very
nice so we head over to our Gmail all
the sudden Hey look at this contents of
goody drawer and if I were to open that
up I would see the same thing that I
would see on this Drive and that is some
screenshots from the Goldeneye source
project which we'll talk about later
earlier depending on when this goes so
that's how it works
now I can see how this could possibly be
a self-perpetuating hack he's like very
worm ish it could it has the potential
to do that because and we've made it
easily modifiable I mean the source is
out there the batch files are easy to
open up and you can take this to the
next level just like many of the
community members have done so on the
forms right so it would be trivial to
add some code so that Wes is USB key
that he brought to the you know college
campus to print out his term paper when
you plugged it in you could make some
code that would send it to this code and
make some stuff happen
yeah and but you could make it so that
it would put the same payload on here
and then when West takes it to another
computer or they would tell two friends
and they've their tails to friends and
so on it's on now the only my only
question about that is this is not a
youth read right you would use all
muscies technique which is the open
folder and then it would execute exactly
so but there is a potential for that
happen but we're not going to show we
don't have any code to do that now
assuming somebody has taken a blackhead
approach to using this as a USB backup
more so is there any way for home users
and like sis admin's like ourselves to
prevent this from happening sure yeah
you right now my best advice is to
follow best practices when it comes to
removal maybe especially in the
corporate environment and that includes
disabling auto run and we've got links
on our show notes to do that I think
also one of the big things is actually
education abusers because many users
just don't think that oh it's innocent
it's like just lobby no it's not it can
run stuff as soon as you plug it in so
then in that case if somebody's can be
using your computer home oh use my thumb
drive yeah not some hold down shift
while you before in holding in it it
hold while you insert it so that way
autoruns disabled yeah if you hold down
shift we put in but that'll take care of
it as well and also next episode we will
have a kind of a rundown will you be
doing a review of some of these
enterprise level security applications
that will take care of removable media
and we're you know just getting those in
the labs now so look forward to that
review on next episode all right well
thank you Darren for increasing my
paranoia of thumb drives and I mentioned
that it's a non susceptible to antivirus
yeah you did
okay head that's what mine oh well if
you want I've got the antidote right
here the antidote is and the the hack
tool here we go we get the axon we got
the antidote Oh what's really going to
plug in yeah you look like a joke thank
you anyway so for more information on
this hack obviously visit the wiki at
hack five door toward slash wiki that's
where you can find the source code
everything has been commented so let's
kick it back to those ugly guys on set
yeah
back to you guys
all righty yeah that's really really
unsettling to know that now you can
infect my machine right and you know
what I think we need to make it very
clear that we're not encouraging people
to go out and do this on university now
what's the corporate networks that would
be very bad Lim is trying to let people
know that it can be done it's available
protect yourself be handcuffs that you
know can pull them by the man-bat so
don't write he'll do it and you know you
can actually use this tool to backup
your own stuff like we mentioned then
it's a good backup method um but if you
are going to be traveling with your USB
keys and two random computers really
look into some encryption specifically
what we recommend which is TrueCrypt and
we will cover that on the later segment
and have links and write-up in the show
notes
so don't get too scared it will be okay
right
now next up we have ali with trivia what
was I supposed trivia question it was
what are the ingredients of chucks on a
rampage from the secret Easter egg on
3.11 which was correctly answered by
Brian here a one-shot vodka one-shot
triple sec and lime juice that's the
most god-awful drink
jerem ever had in my life yeah I'm sorry
I made you drink it was Kyle so drink
the kool-aid yes
this one's trivia question is firewire
400 a competing standard for USB
high-speed is rated at how many megabits
per second send your answers to trivia
at hack 5 dot org and next up we have
the software Jedi from a napa day calm
so take it away
if you want to make an impact online
godaddy.com has what you need calm names
as low as $1.99 plus world class hosting
fast and easy website builders and much
more plus as a fan of hack 5 enter code
hak5 dollars off any order of $30 or
more get your piece of the internet at
godaddy.com
well today we have the pleasure of being
joined by somebody that you may know as
the software Jedi his website and apid a
comm has been getting a lot of buzz on
web sites like Digg and all around the
world has been getting a lot of great
attention and he's here to join us today
and share some of his code monkey
goodness
so Dana hey thanks for coming down here
and you know so a NAPA day calm what is
that and and why is that well it's a
site it's really a blog I created about
two weeks ago three weeks ago where
every night I code an app any type of
app it's community driven so it started
off with me kind of just bragging to a
friend that I could do this and from
there it just led until you know me
setting up to actually doing it and now
it's been going strong for about 15 days
cool so uh so so far what have you
written
I've written some really useful apps for
for people in a corporate environment
some joke apps I have an app that you
can make any computer in your network
make a move sound like a cow I have
another app that changes your wallpaper
based on google image keywords some
graphical apps some utility applications
that you remote into servers and things
like that yeah I particularly like the
move applications because it's got that
the beautiful setting where you can tell
it to move sometime between 60 seconds
and an hour and it's random and if you
put that on you know 15 computers and
there's no way to stop it and there's no
waiting city that's more exciting you
have to actually kill the task locally
the engine yeah so I'm sure everybody
Eicher not about like that yeah IT
department why is my computer milling
great so out of all of the apps you've
written so far what's your favorite the
Google wallpaper I think that one I've
run every day sense on both well not my
home PC anymore but my work PC and all
the people in my office a lot of them
also run that app and for somebody
that's nothing in there with the Google
wallpaper what does that do you want me
to show you yeah you'd love to go ahead
make a little it up okay so the Google
wallpaper application lives down here in
the SIS tray it's a
but GP don't ask me why it's not at GW
it was late that would make a lot more
sense but what you can do is enter
keywords things like volcano from our
Mars Smurfs
yeah let's just do Smurfs that's one I
haven't done what will keep this little
hand bugs here the safe search filter
we're going to leave them for the Smurfs
let's do that yes because I'm sure if
you uncheck that things could get quite
interesting now there's only one girl
Smurfs though so I'm not sure how
interesting it will be no that would
make it even more and so what it's
supposed to be doing right now is
changing my wallpaper but instead we're
still staring at my beautiful children
but because we're doing the screen
capturing software so that's probably
eating up all uh so there we have some
girls dressed as Smurfs for Halloween
and every one minute or so it has has a
setting here the the change rate usually
at first we set that to one minute
because it was so fun but then you start
getting repeated images so you find that
30 minutes works better the other thing
that works well is using lots of
keywords so if I use a volcano I can
also use volcano lava and stuff like
that so just keep mixing up the way the
key words are and then it works better
it gets more images now since you've
started this you've been having an
active IRC channel while you develop the
code how is that change the way that you
write your code oh it's great I get live
feedback while I'm writing the code
because not only do we have the IRC
channel we also have the WebEx which is
going now we try to screen broadcaster
it wasn't working right but um so so
people can actually watch as I'm typing
I've had people correct the typos as I'm
going yeah I was there when you wrote
one of the applications and I'm you know
an IRC on my right monitor I'm watching
your screen in the left monitor and I'm
doing my stuff in the middle and I'm
like this is really cool who would have
thought one day you know coders would be
like rock stars people be tuning in to
check that out and become a social thing
I've been getting comments that people
are mesmerised they get stuck like last
night I would
cohdon slow I wasn't even you know doing
that much yet the the whole WebEx is
filled it's like why what are they
watching what are they yeah you know I'm
just waiting for that next line of code
to come out I'm thinking of doing the
same thing when we when we edit because
so many people have been like how do you
edit the show like that well then I
could just be like go watch you know do
it with the the check going on is is
great getting and you get that feedback
too
you get that feedback live hey we don't
like when Darren looks like that can you
edit that part out all right and so you
know you're getting the constant
feedback you're getting the people
correcting your code you know I'm sure a
lot of your creative ideas comes from
the community as well that's how we
started every night at about 8 o'clock
and mix it up a little bit but at about
8 o'clock I invite people into the room
the chat link appears if you don't have
IRC you can just go to the page and get
in and just start soliciting ideas now
people sell me an app you know convince
me to write it send me screenshots
whatever and can you show us the console
app because it cuz sure I gotta say that
this was my suggestion is the app that I
was joined in and I was like oh this is
the coolest thing you need to code this
and it's really cool and I love it so
what we do is we press control tilde
just like you would in quake or Unreal
Tournament and all those other games I
own you in and from the top of the
screen we get our console window and
most commands work in here some things
that aren't supported it was written in
four hours but this is also open source
you give out your source code as well
and have people been really taking to
that and evolving the programs after
you're done with them in a day there's
been certain programs that have evolved
within minutes of me releasing them one
in particular was the application that I
have one that hides everything except
the active window and someone went in
and added options to it you know within
five minutes and me putting it out and
post it away for everyone it's really
neat that's really cool now there are a
lot of beginner coders in our audience
and you're obviously a veteran coder so
what would you you know be your advice
to them besides documentation because we
know you don't in your code as well it
is fully documented lots of comments do
I would say you know just write lots of
code you know that's how we all learn
you know experiment play with things it
doesn't have to be the next killer app
it can print hello world when you're
starting out you know that's just as
exciting but then dig in the source code
you know if you want to know how to use
a function there's lots of sites on the
net
you know besides Google that you can
search for code write on what did you
start writing code in at first gw-basic
qw basic TC jr. well did that actually
have the the gw-basic on the ROM is one
of those I'm not sure because I believe
well I had a PC XT and if you boot it
without any hard drive or floppy drive
and it would actually go right into base
yeah I don't think it was no W that
round it was just left with a floppy
drive a hard drive no way yeah right on
but yeah it's good stuff so you've gone
from gw-basic - what's your favorite
language now c-sharp everything except
one application that I've done is
written in C sharp it's what I use it at
my day job so it's what I'm most
comfortable with I've done a lot of job
in the past a lot of j2ee so I might try
to you know do some of that so we get
some cross-platform stuff going on so
what's after a nap a day for you I don't
know I'd love to hear from everyone what
they what they want to be after at a nap
a day I'd love to I definitely don't to
keep going at a nap a day for any more
than another 15 days they should do it
for years - what happens yeah maybe I'll
change to a nap a decade or or an at the
century that's good idea yeah but well i
should'a be something I'd like to keep
this community thing going it's great
you know if I can get other people
involved to help me with this you've got
a really active IRC channel and some
really cool people in there and and
you're obviously growing a great
community so you know we definitely
encourage that and we find that same way
with our show so now I want to see that
keep going in fact this show is coming
out on the 5th of October so you know by
the time when you see this right now
he's actually still coding and if you're
up at you know eight o'clock at night
Eastern Time us then head over to your
IRC Channel what's the server it's on
IRC dot freenode net okay and they can
find you and pound the software jet
software Jetta awesome
and they pitch your ideas of whatever
application you want to see and get
involved because you're gonna be doing
this into what October 15th yeah
somewhere around there October 14th or
15th now I've got one more question
before we get going because this has
been I asked a part of our community
what they would like to ask you so I
have to ask why or Emax fiery Mets no
pet no studio there is no by there is no
email no buyer email no sorry the
software Jedi doesn't do diary doesn't
do the picot or the bash I'm sorry just
bashing your head on the keyboard
awesome all right well hey thanks for
coming on you're welcome anytime and
it's it's awesome so definitely head
over to this man's website and apid a
calm and you will find a complete list
in our show notes hak5 dork thanks then
thank you next up we've got Paul to show
us some open source voice over IP on a
slug nice but before that let's check in
with Allie about the polls well last
month's poll was 360 Wii or the ps3
which one would you shell out for and
the forums consensus was wait for the
win 50% the other guys came in at 25 how
many photos should we have yeah and you
know what we got it from the horse's
mouth and Serrano didn't we yes we did
we visited with some familiar faces up
there let's check out that footage with
their opinion Jen the 360 the Wii or the
ps3 well I've been really lucky at e3
this year I got to play all three of
them and as in terms of the ones I'm
going to get first well unless I win the
lottery I'm getting a we love the Wii
there's so much fun
tennis was awesome Mario was great and
after a few minutes of batting it around
you don't even think about what you're
doing with the control it was just that
intuitive now is it the price point or
is it the games or is it what the price
point helps a lot definitely for the
cost of a ps3 I can get the Wii and
possibly every launch game that kind of
is a factor I love the 360 now I'm
actually starting to come around to
seeing how how much fun you can have
with the Xbox Live Arcade
of course it's got to mention Dead
Rising probably the best zombie game
ever done way better than any of the
Resident Evil series and it's to be
party to online it's kind of hard to
fight against that so eventually I'll
get a 360 but I think the Wii is is tops
on my list oh and the ps3 what do you
think way too expensive i bulk at the
360 price and the ps3 makes a 360 you
know with the hard drive with live makes
all that look cheap even if I bought all
wireless controllers and the most
expensive cables I still wouldn't touch
that price right and how many do you
think launch units 4 million or 2
million or 17 probably 17 16 of them to
Japan so we get what we collect over
awesome thank so much 10 okay so here we
are at the Fan Expo here in Toronto
Canada and what better place has to the
poll question then in front of the
owners booth himself Jeremy from pure
ownage so let's go talk to some of the
fans first and see what they think the
poll question is xbox360 ps3 are we what
are you willing to shell out for man I'm
getting ps3 Metal Gear Solid 4 that's
why that's that's this little reason is
Metal Gear Solid much yeah I could
probably ps3 play Metal Gear Solid and
then smash my ps3 and I think I get my
money with worth loss all right none of
them actually I'd be going with PC all
the way and user Amiga 60 for the ps3
going for the big pack through $600
going all out gonna throw it all my
credit card I have my credit card paid
off just to go back in debt for it
PlayStation 3 for the Final Fantasy
series you're waiting for that rerelease
of Final Fantasy 7 aren't you I'm one of
those hopeful fools but the RPG system
it's it's always been in the PlayStation
PlayStation 2 and will be the
PlayStation 3 okay so here we are with
the owner Jeremy that's right that's a
owned yes you see
been rubbing everybody and you've been
increasing the value I've seen now we've
got a quick question for you
ps3 360 or we what do you want to shell
out for we I mean I haven't played the
we're the ps3 so it's kind of unfair and
I played 360 but I mean in terms of
getting me all excited and stuff but the
wheels got me pretty excited also
because I'm poor and I don't know if the
ps3 is gonna be an option yes so okay so
you want to flex the uber micro on the
we'd end that's what you want how is
that gonna work double wand oh man
thanks a lot appreciate it you do
alright so there it is folks straight
from the owner himself now let's go back
to Ali to find out what this month's
poll question is well this month's poll
question is Mario for the NES which
games got your green mushroom one two or
three and you can weigh in at hak5 org
slash poll and we'll be back right after
this
now many of you may be aware of the noob
epidemic plaguing our interweb today we
have noobs crawling all throughout the
place there in our IRC servers in all
forms in a game servers and until now
they've just been an annoyance
now that time changes I dr. Schneider
Hoffer from the mushaf new boning
project is here to demonstrate our new
boning appliances to turn tasteless
noobs into delectable treats for your
enjoyment now we have the noob kebab of
4000 yes you see the new kebab of 4000
has an innovative new grille design
designed to cook noobs in less time
without the fat because you've got to
watch your diet when you're owning noobs
now it's also compatible with the rs-232
interface just take any garden-variety
noob throw on some bacon just like mom
used to make
and in just minutes you have delicious
noobs for dinner we also have the new
bone of 3000 yes with its diced whip and
blend settings it'll turn any noob
into a perfect noob every time as you
can see just toss it into a glass with
maybe some brandy and one magnificent we
also have the noob owner Plus now the
noob owner plus is a toasting device
that takes a simple tasteless noob and
hosts it to perfection
now once the noob is toasted just place
on some bread with some seasoning mmm
and it's slow get this anywhere else
mm hmm mm just like mom used to make in
fact if you order today we'll even throw
in mom's new recipe cookbook at no extra
charge so order today operators are
standing by
now why pay for a service that could be
dirt-cheap have a warm run by a bunch of
profiteering gluttons that seems to be
the question of the day and here to
answer just that is their very own Paul
Tobias up from behind the cameras to
talk to us about asterisk Paul what's
asterisk asterisk is an open source
software PBX that can run on lots of
different hardware lots of different
platforms Linux BSD Mac Windows kind of
and it has all the features in a normal
PBX plus more okay so you say PBX but
for those that aren't familiar with PBX
what is that PBX is an office phone
system now where like you go up to a
phone and you press a to get an outside
line or you press my extension and I
attentionally you'll have to dial whole
number each it's all inside your say
office building yeah I'm used to that at
work I can call HR and yeah and I've got
an extension when I call the 800 number
and you know dialing through there
sherry on voicemail and all that stuff
and this way we don't have to go through
the traditional telephone providers like
Verizon or NSA I can't think of any
others so so what kind of hardware is
involved in getting a service like this
set up for our own home network the
system requirements to run asterisk are
pretty small you can run an awful
laptops I've run it off Pentium to like
dang gigabyte hard drive oh boy
but here if we are running it on this NS
L u2 which isn't your normal NSW - now I
didn't really have much to do with
changing it there knows more about that
right Paul came to me about a month ago
when we were talking about backing up
and network attached storage and we were
talking about FreeNAS brought this home
and this is a Linksys NSL you - it's a
little box that you plug on to your
network it's got a cat5 here as well as
some USB 2.0 ports and then you plug in
a removable hard drive and you've got
network attached storage however it runs
Linux and as
through the GPL the source codes out
there and many happy hackers have gone
ahead and modified it so that you could
run your own distribution of Linux on
there I believe you can even put gentle
on there we did a very simple install
which is called unslung this box which
runs a kind of a lightweight linux
distro that allows us to many many
things because it has a great package
management system and that's the point
at which I turned it over to Paul and
said hey take a look at this package
manager what can we do
alright since you know you unload that
that's just where Atris is going to go
what you really use Atris with our phone
because it's a PBX what uses asterisks
without any phones connected to it so we
have our these sip phones these grande
train budget tone to hundreds they're
really nice there are like 60 bucks and
they come with a lot of features they
even act as sort of a router in some
situations right you could actually just
get one of these grant stream phones
plug it right into your network and and
you could bypass Astra's completely and
go you know and use it as a router even
I mean these so many as rural forwarding
we could do an entire segment on these
this piece of hardware alone yeah what
if we don't want to use this what other
piece of hardware can we use oh actually
you can go phone lists and just running
off of say a computer with free software
kind of similar to Skype but it's more
open you do something like a Kega or
gizmos sip phone there's lots of
different sip phones out there that you
can use and I'll get a link to this on
the wiki right so for those that's a
soft phone and you would use one of
these yeah we're probably used to that
on Xbox Live and on Nimmo and Skype and
all those other fun voices be yeah
teamspeak Ventrilo now we could also use
our old analog phones correct yes yes um
you can use a media gateway which will
just kind of translate the IP packets
into something that your regular old
like touch-tone telephone I used to
haven't hooked up to like the telephone
the verizon network or whatever okay so
now that we've got our hardware and
we've got this box on slug which is just
into a Linux box we can SSH into it how
do we get asterisk on this alright in
order to install a source on it's pretty
easy because the version of Linux on
there comes with a package manager so to
install actress all you have to do is
type I PKG install asterisk and there
you go
you can also install the Astra sounds
just i PKG install asterisk state -
sounds ok so that'll get the bare-bones
Astra system setup on there but
obviously there's a lot more
configuration that needs to go on before
we can start using it as kind of our
home the home fellas here right exactly
so where do we go from here after that
you need to sense this version of
asterisk is specifically built for the
slug it places some of the directories
in different locations that the normal
asterisk isn't used to seeing and it
it's kind of hard to configure the
source code of Astra is to look for it
in different directories so what you'll
do is edit a comp file called asterisk
and it just lists where the directories
of all its parts are within your Linux
system on this look also we'll need to
be able to tell Astra's what modules
live because it's such such a
restrictive machine it only has two
hundred and sixty-six megahertz
processor and like 32 megabytes of RAM
you'll need to be able to limit the
modules that load so it doesn't get so
bogged down and sound terrible and just
run slow you'll do that by editing the
modules comp there's a couple ways to do
it the easiest way I found was to auto
load everything and then tell
specifically which ones not to live and
because it's a less powerful processor
and whatnot we can't load some of the
more processor intensive codecs correct
yes um things like the speaks codecs
more just higher quality code X's tend
to be too tough on the machine so you go
with like GSM a law or you law and
that'll allow us to run like four
simultaneous phones on this piece of
hardware right yeah great so you know
this isn't a good
solution if you're looking to do like a
call center no you definitely don't want
to go like that formal Islan for $80 for
this hardware and you know $60 for the
phones that you don't even need to yeah
if you just need a basic set up that's a
perfect solution yeah okay so we've got
our modules configured we've got
asterisk on four configured what's next
next you'll want to be able to configure
asterisks to be able to send out email
so it can notify you when you have like
a voicemail or something the package is
called esmtp that's just another eye pkg
isn't EP after that you'll edit the ESP
RC file and you'll connect you're
putting the information for your like
EST and your smtp server from your isp
so that's kind of similar to send mail
right yes they this designed
specifically to use the same kind of
like context --is and commands as sent
mail so like if I were to get a
voicemail I would actually get a message
from the asterisk assistant and it can
even attach that voicemail with it if
you choose to do that oh like as a WAV
file yeah sounds great so what's next
alright next you get into the main part
of controlling asterisk which would be
setting up like users which would be
like the phones or a soft phone on your
computer and then also your providers
getting connected to them so that you
can have an inside I mean now down line
an inbound line okay so you mentioned
providers what exactly are we looking
for in a provider and what is the
provider going to provide us they gave
you essentially an authentication string
registration string which is what will
be like your phone number and then the
password you use to authenticate with
them and the proxy that you hook up to
so the provider is really kind of a
gateway that's going to allow us to
bridge into the PSTN yeah and that's
that little bit looks switch telephone
network and that's kind of like the
old-school if you remember you know if
you've ever had a telephone basically so
we can call people's phone numbers and
we'll get a phone number that they can
call us on yeah okay so that a provider
we're just kind of limited to the
intertubes
yeah so you don't have to essentially
translate your IP address into a phone
number for you right that's other people
can call and you can call
from and we went with telex and it was
pretty inexpensive wasn't yeah it was a
five bucks route line and then we put a
lot $10 down 4.01 cents a minute yeah
it's it's a it's pretty cheap it comes
out to I think six hundred in some
minutes for ten dollars so I mean it's a
lot less expensive than it would be
going through the you know the regular
phone companies I guess so once we've
got a registered on our SIP providers
Network and we've got our telephones
with your users created through the
sitcom what else do we need to do to set
up kind of rules so that we can call out
and call in fun stuff like that all
right that's the main function of the
extensions comm file here's where a lot
of the fun happens where you get to
pretty much script out how Astra's is
going to treat its users as far as the
incoming line from your provider the
outgoing lawnchair provider where you'd
like dial eight and get your dial tone
you'll dial number who you ever want to
call and we'll also be your internal
context for say dialing one from Darren
was in the other room or something like
that okay so like I can if I have my
phone in my room Wes has it's been in
his room and he'll just dial his
extension and his phone will ring maybe
like go away
that's just like when I like instant
message him and he's like why are you
typing to me I live here anyway
that's cool so Global's and variables
what's that the variables are
essentially just easier way of defining
who you users up defining like saying
your trunks for your provider and then
like the users that's just having one
simple name for all to put instead of
like say typing what kind of user they
are and then like their name and
extension okay so it makes it easier
ones though you can just say like the
less is this person in this file and
that's all it is and then when later on
you call that variable up it'll be like
okay that's what that means
all right so now what happens when we
actually called a hak5 hotline that 800
number that we've set up all right all
happen is as you can see here they're
the call will come in and right now it's
set up like a home phone system where
it'll ring all the phones on the house
and if it doesn't pick up it'll go to a
like a general reading and say press one
to get leave a voice message for Darrin
or two to leave a voice message with Wes
and that's something we're you know
going to set up on our 757 or home phone
yeah yeah that's going to be like our
local extension a local phone number yes
for around Williamsburg right and for
the 800 number what kind of changes do
we have with the extension all right
file for that that extension file looks
like this way it goes down is Astra's
will pick up the phone first and it will
kind of give you the greeting of where
Desmond says hey thanks for calling the
hotline dial my extension or bless this
extension and it will ring to either
whatever extension put in but also you
can leave a general voicemail put the
cons together or everybody here will go
to the community email we put like some
some fun little Easter eggs in there
yeah well we've put in a 1 for you to
hear like the equal Ana's taken on our
phone system and then plays the music
now when you say the iguana's have taken
over the phone system there seems to be
a lot of little easter eggs here in
asterisk what's up with that
yeah definitely going through the sounds
file and in the astra system you can see
lots of things like they've gotten a
voicemail girl to say all these
ridiculous things like my favorite is a
the extension you're looking for this is
not the extension than looking for not
the extensions we're looking for and
there's also one about a going out
getting drunk and gambling it sounds
like the uh what does that mean
open-source developers have a sense of
humor yeah awesome cool so you want to
go ahead and give it a try right now
yeah ok so we're gonna go ahead and call
the hack 5 hotline and see what happens
anything I've seen
okay so if I were to dial an extension
you got that poem and we're getting it
up and then say some fun stuff you can't
get the equitable on wow that's a really
good latency normally if you take two
cellphones put them both on speakerphone
put them next to each other and say
something and get a good echo I can't
get it going on yeah maybe it's not loud
enough I think
hello okay awesome
you've written a great tutorial in the
wiki with step-by-step on how to get
this set up on asterisk as well as links
to external resources to do the kind of
the same kind of thing right yep exactly
um another great resource would be like
I've linked the O'Reilly book on
asterisk I've also linked uh - info
that's this book right here oh no no
that's a that's another great book by
roundabout switching the boy it gets
into the more sophisticated parts of
asterisks where you would say be setting
up a call center okay but there's a free
one as well yeah there's a free a PDF
you can get it like chapter by chapter
and like one huge PDF I feel like
reading PDFs and it sounds like this
system is so expansive and has so many
things that you can do with it I get to
even like later on being able to do
leave some hacking without yeah that's
exactly why I wanted to get into this
because it has a built in a system
called an AGI asterisk gateway interface
where it's specifically designed to
allow asterisks use other programs say
like nmap or something a little more
interesting so you can be eighty miles
an hour and mapping somebody at the a.m.
and get some hacks or flakes that'd be
great
so yeah Wow so now that we've laid a
great foundation I suggest that if you
are interested in rolling your own voice
over IP network in your house and ditch
in the old telco go ahead and head over
to hack 500 org slash wiki take a look
at this man's great article and get your
voice on
now if you guys think this mod is cool
wait until you see what we've got in
store for you we head up to Toronto to
talk to our friend Andrew he's got kind
of a hack with a Nintendo Power glove
and MIDI and a Speak &amp;amp; Spell that's some
crazy stuff so but before we get into
that let's talk about last month's game
server and this month's game server Ally
well some of you might know that last
month game was battlefield 2 how is that
guys that's all right dad
you know what I'm not even to take my
opinion on the matter dad about I'm
really bad at the game yeah I certainly
may be buttons may be better luck this
month because this month's game is
goldeneyes source yes you guys may
remember I actually play you guys may
remember about last mid last year and we
talked to one of the developers of the
Goldeneye source project which is a mod
for half-life 2 and it's kind of like if
you remember Goldeneye for the n64 and
ported and we've got some exclusive
screenshots right now because they are
releasing a remember it's the first beta
or like a release panel or something
like that but they've got a great
version coming out for you on the 13th
of this month and these it just looks
gorgeous yes it doesn't mean if you take
a look at these screenshots right here I
mean I think they've really harnessed
the half-life 2 engine it looks
beautiful I mean I think they've taken
the old Knight to the next level and
then beyond any that thing I think
they've actually made it to that golden
knife looks how it should have when it
first came out definitely and I cannot
wait to start owning people in this so
we will be playing on the 21st and oh
you know what we've been getting emails
about the competition you me the Unreal
Tournament yeah it's gonna happen and
you're going down
and I might go down I mark my words are
gonna own you
no you're not because if you want to
sign up it's a at hack 5 org slash land
party thank you for saving us from
ourselves we'll be right back after
these very important messages oh hey Mac
that's a little blad mm-hmm
I say this noob is pretty nasty
I should blend this one once more yeah I
think this one's done
mm-hmm missamma new sauce
come on yeah oh oh that's a bloody noob
mmm maybe with some syrup mmm some bacon
can't go wrong with bacon yes
oh that's going to be good that's gonna
be good
noble rific bad is really bad your kite
it's got this ah I feel like Pikachu
with the ketchup
all right cut
okay so we're back in Toronto Canada and
we've met up with our friend Andrew who
is an electrical engineer and he's here
to show us how to make a Speak &amp;amp; Spell a
power glove and MIDI all play nice
together so how's it going Andrew how're
you doing buddy how's it going laughs
I'm awesome
nice to meet you glad to hear it now so
what's going on here how are we gonna
get all these completely different
things to work together with happening
of course well naturally basically what
we have is is two parts we have a MIDI
converter for the power love that makes
it into basically a musical instrument
and then we have a mini converter for
the speed Uncle Phil that makes it into
a musical instrument too and they're
going to talk and I'm gonna make some
noise anyway hopefully will be awesome
and hopefully it'll sound like music so
you know we're talking about music and
we're talking about MIDI so MIDI was
originally made for music right yeah
it's a network standard for synthesizers
to communicate with one another was
invented in the early 80s and it's
pretty simple which is great because it
means it's pretty hackable and how are
we going to adapt MIDI to this archaic
technology that is a speaking spell well
in the case of the Speak &amp;amp; Spell what
we've done is we've bought a kit from
highly liquid comm that actually allows
us to take many messages and look up
information in the wrong of the Speak
and Spell and get it to play word
fragments which actually sounds really
cool yeah we were playing that with that
before and it's like that but at any
rate the the kid is a great beginner
project so we'll go through that
hopefully uh hopefully be cool enough
for some people at home give it a try as
well
sweet yeah it's good you want to go
ahead and crack it open and sure talk
about the inside okay so we've got the
speaking spells finally cracked open and
this is one that we had out this isn't
unmodern and this is the modified
modified one correctly yeah okay so if
you just want to give us a quick
overview of what's going on in here and
what you did differently you know what
where's the kid what part of this is the
kitten this is the kid right here
basically sticks in this big empty space
that has been commuting for MIDI
modifications it's pretty easy to
install you got a saw to the board
together yourself that's pretty
straightforward and then there's a
wiring diagram on the website of the
maker of the kit that we use to connect
it to the board as well we had to
actually cut a hole in the case for the
MIDI connector it's pretty easy to do
you can use a dremel it's kind of like
standard case modding right yet how
about a hole yeah basically anyway you
can whatever and then there's the wiring
back there just two wires that go to it
and screws in the plastic easy enough
and you said the wiring diagram is
really straightforward so it tells you
exactly where you need to make your
connections and everything else right
yeah it's it's really easy to follow and
pretty much impossible to screw up
anything's possible but at least with
these boards here they have you know
like nice solder points and everything
it looks like so if somebody wanted to
do this remember now granted it is
precision solder work so I'd imagine if
somebody's not you know might not want
to make it your first project ever right
is I don't mean to deter anyone either
it's pretty straight forward and just a
little bit of practice with a soldering
iron beforehand I think they'd be able
to get this no problem and I mean so I
mean there's there any kind of like
what's what's so cool and unusual about
these speaking spells that just make
them available for this kind of MIDI
modification well we were really
advanced for there
the speaking spell came out in 1978
which is mind-blowing if you think about
the fact that it basically has a
computer inside mm-hmm
what we're actually doing with the kit
is interfacing to the 4-bit data bus of
the microcontroller that's inside the
speaking spell and we're basically
putting some information on there that
it's not expecting to see we're forcing
our own kind of bug
so we're sending our MIDI to its
hardware as put and we're making some
stuff happen we're just putting it right
in and making stuff nice that's nice and
kind of brute force but it works and so
maybe it's fun
maybe I'll just show you a couple
features of the board there's actually a
couple different there's a couple
different modes or ways that you can
install this kit mmm
there's actually three the first one
emulates the keypad so basically we send
MIDI messages it pushes an equivalent
key on the keypad which will let you
have the full speed and spell
functionality under MIDI control the
second two modes are a little more
interesting to us because they let you
make cool noise was what it's all about
for me anyway this ROM modei and ROM OB
and basically in the ROM modes the MIDI
messages will look up in a table a word
fragment and play it through the
speaking spells output in the second ROM
mode a sequence of notes will look up an
entire word
the Speak and Spell and play it at the
output so you can either have control
over you can have access to any word
that's in the speaking spells lexicon or
you can you can make any word fragment
knows and it has millions seemingly it
has endless banks of these fragments of
words they've been play out so it can
make really cool noise really cool beats
really cool kinda mm-hmm intelligent
sound yeah I mean when you're doing like
very unique music that you take part and
you help with that that's like that's
the epitome that's what you're looking
for something that nobody else has
unless they have a speaking spell with a
MIDI chip well that's fine
that's kind of the point of the game
right both people are interested in
getting that sound can defecate and they
can have something different unusual
that's awesome thank you for showing us
this now next up I think we should go to
the power glove you know because that
was like if that's like a homebrew like
there's no kit involved in that when you
did that so that's a step up from here
let's take a look at it all right okay
so now what we have laid out in front of
us is the power glove but it's not so
much the glove itself that you worked on
as it is this the whole plastic box do
you think basically what this box is is
it's an interface that you plug the
power glove into the old-school Nintendo
Power glove into a port right there yep
and it converts position information
from the glove to MIDI and sends it to
other instruments and in our case also
the speaking spell nice now again you've
got like a thousand different ports on
here so I was just wondering like
obviously this is Nintendo this is
obviously MIDI out now we've got this
little thing here and this here and that
there what are they well how this box is
like pretty hacked up it used to be a
I couldn't help it used to be an actual
like turbo add-on box for the old NES
that I had when I was a kid anyway um
the actual processor inside here is a
pic microcontroller which is pretty
common you guys might have used it in
other projects ah so there's a in
addition to the MIDI and Nintendo
there's a programming port that lets me
update the code sis are you running in
the yet it's running the microcontroller
there's a power port and there's uh in
my case I actually also have a serial
port on here that I used when I was
debugging and making sure that I was
getting my power glove messages okay
this wasn't originally like you said
designed for you know oh no this circuit
is pretty hacked up to this is actually
a completely different pic circuit that
I've used for a different project and
I've just sort of uh I put the whole
circuit board from the other project
inside this box and wired everything to
it so it looks like uh it looks like a
real mess but I will uh I'll get a
schematic for you guys for your website
so to make a little bit more sense be
clear for everybody yeah that's what
busy you got like the serial port you
know welcome nowhere right yeah it's
just not hanging out okay so this
translates data know what what's
generating the data from the power glove
how does that work the power glove
actually generates the data on the power
glove is in two parts
there's the glove itself and there's a
sensor array and the way the glove works
is it measures the position of the glove
itself relative to the sensor array
which is ultrasonic so it just does
these distance measurements there's
basically a computer in the glove
triangulates where it is from the
distance measurements and puts together
this packet called a high-res mode
packet the glove can output a lot of
different kinds of data but we're
interested in the high-res 3d position
data so basically what the interface
does is it finds the x y&amp;amp;z position of
the glove in that high-res packet
and converts that in the case of our
demo today just into MIDI notes but it
can convert it into any kind of data
that can be sent across the MIDI cable
so we can control synthesizers we could
control performance parameters we can
control lighting with it we could do any
performance art installations nice so
anything that you could ever do on a
MIDI Network you can do with you love
you can have it well in our case we can
program the the microcontroller in the
interface to do whatever we want with
the information okay so you shown us how
the power glove works and how we get
MIDI from that and how we get MIDI from
the Speak and Spell but at this point
all right can you show us how everything
works when it could comes together and
makes a big happy MIDI circle sure we'll
take a look at that out Thanks
okay so now we've got everything hooked
together and right now what you're
looking at in his lab that you're
looking at his love is a MIDI instrument
this is actually a MIDI musical
instrument right here and this has been
plugged into the Speak and Spell and ran
through the sound system in here so if
we were to hit a key say that one we are
now hearing the Speak and Spell like
bits and pieces from the ROM playing
through the stereo so like
this is basically the first half of our
glove to beacon spell crossover project
this is the first half of it here this
is getting the speaking spell to
actually make some noise from some MIDI
data to actually interface with the
midian for that whole that side of the
plane to come together not that plan
comes together
I mean like this is really exciting that
we've been sitting playing with it it's
so much fun you know my internal
four-year-old is pretty ecstatic with
this whole project it's like a giant toy
it is a big giant babies like throwback
toy which has been melded together with
modern-day equipment this is so much fun
so should we take a look at the glove
part yeah well we go ahead and do that
in so since we've got a musical device
making funky sounds now we're going to
take an alcohol device and actually play
back musical notes yep all right let's
go look that thing up and then we'll
have one big pretty heavy
okay so now we look on your hand that is
a power book is it not it is so okay now
that's been plugged into your little
mini hackaday device and yep there it is
right there
and that's been ran through the
synthesizer over here and through the
computer and everything else that's MIDI
abide and we can now control musical
notes with this correct so how is it how
is just working here what are we looking
at Lea basically we got this is the
sensor array from the power glove of so
what happens is the sensor and the glove
work together to determine the gloves
position in 3d just in the case of this
demo we're only we're only measuring in
the x-axis which means left to right in
this case so this is going to be making
a musical note pitch of which is
determined by the butt or right position
of your blood yeah in front of the in
front of the sensor array okay let's go
ahead and take a listen
so now we're hearing a constant note so
there's the gloves kind of coming into
the field and you actually bring it all
the way down the ladder yep
has a pretty cool sound to it does it
actually is really cool sign kind of
like it's like the whole like demonic
very like 1950s
organ music of I need a dealer of doom
oh now you are only you know using the
excesses to modify the sound now can we
take like the y-axis or Zed as you say
in Canada and change of different things
yeah yeah for sure the interface
actually measures all of those
parameters including finger parameter
and role of the glove so you could
theoretically map those controls to
anything you wanted in the MIDI data
stream you could send you could have one
synthesizer or being controlled by the
x-axis something else vertically you
could make volume expression control any
kind of performance parameter that you
want to send over the MIDI link you can
do nice and now we're using the high-res
version right now yeah you said so this
is all this is taking three-dimensional
movement plus role of your hand and yep
actual making a fist so you sit here and
like actually start boxing and do
something completely ridiculous if that
hadn't been all mapped ahead of time
that'd be kind of complicated but maybe
theoretically possible it would
certainly sound cool anyway yeah you
know you like something like a punch of
drama
yep you know so we know that makes music
you know the Speak &amp;amp; Spell makes sound
but can we make the power glove make the
speaking spell make sense let's do it
manifest wait all right so we've got
everything hooked up I'm actually
wearing the glove this time hi and the
glove took to the speaking about
speaking spells hook to the stereo
system so once and returned it on your
just gonna hear like this huge loud
speaking spell racket right yep and
you're gonna be changing the racket a
little bit as you okay
I have to rock the globe out like like
the Wiz did or something like it like if
you can rock it out that much yeah
alright let's let's go yeah I'm gonna
plug in the MIDI and you should be ready
to roll along and there it is
now as I move my hand back and forth
basically this is the same demo as we
were running with the stringed
instrument earlier it's just a note
repeated over and over again and you're
changing the pitch of the note as you
move the glove around so if you hold it
we're not actually changing the pitch
we're running through the wrong exactly
exactly so if I hold my hand very still
you should be playing the same sound
fragment over and over again and then as
you move it around you can garble ate it
as you look up some other sound
fragments so I can sit here and just
feel like wow and that's actually pretty
awesome the turntable robot death noise
interpretive dance yeah scratch with
that but I'm not actually scratching so
it's just like random random random
sound effect that is frigging group and
then since it's all MIDI you can
interface with any other MIDI device
start acting like that and you would you
want to do assuming you had programmed
yeah program the interface correctly the
team zero taken all with functionality
of the blow I just go ahead and turn
that off so if people want to find any
more about you where they where can they
