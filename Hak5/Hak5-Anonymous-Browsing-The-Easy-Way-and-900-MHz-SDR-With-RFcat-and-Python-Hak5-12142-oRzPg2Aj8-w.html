2013 Ford Fusion so the first step is to
go ahead and download the RF cat
libraries and I'll go ahead and W get
that file and tar extract that guy
alright and CD over to RF cat and less
the readme and if you go through this
readme what you're gonna find is that it
has all of information you need to know
about going ahead and flashing your
dongle with the firmware thankfully this
dongle is already set up and so we don't
really need to go through too much more
it actually shows the wiring diagram of
some of them like the CC 1111 emk or
Chronos dongles on how to get those
going this is really pretty instructive
yeah it's pretty instructive and so once
we have that going we really just need
to set up two really simple dependencies
and then we should be good to actually
start using that library and then start
using some Python programs written with
it to do fun stuff so first thing we'll
do is sudo apt-get install Lib USB - one
does you were at zero yes we wouldn't do
that
and next we need to sudo apt-get install
Python back USB and so we're going to
notice here that actually does not find
that dependency and that's kind of a
bummer but then again we are in a very
fresh install of Ubuntu 1204 so real
quick what we'll do is apt attack a
cache search and then we'll say Python
and we go through this we'll see yeah
and this will show us what is available
in our repository and we'll see I'm
looking for Python tach USB and let's
see no I have all of these other things
Python tach you stuff but not USB I
could also grep for that and so the
reason why is because this is in a
software source that is not enabled by
default so this kind of lends us to like
start talking about software sources but
basically if we sudo nano this file and
/ @ c / apps old sources dot list we can
see here are actual sources and we can
go ahead and enable some other ones I
can actually do this most easily by
opening up the Software Center I'm going
to edit and software sources no because
I don't feel like I don't feel like
typing the commands but I check those
two boxes and hit close yes you're right
I can do it in the other way I used to
go a big deal so with that done you sudo
apt-get update and now when I sudo or
when I tap cache search for Python
you'll see that I have many more things
in here so let's go ahead and grep for
the word USB and now we see python USB
is listed in there so we can sudo
apt-get install python tak USB and there
we go now if i LS we'll see that we have
this program here called RF cat so I
will do sudo dot slash RF cat and the
tak our operator will give me an
interactive shell and you can see that
this right here is is our interactive
environment using Python to go ahead and
playing with this so I can do things
like gives me a couple of examples of
like Deeping or we can be for dongle and
then we also have we can set frequency
and it'll allow us to choose like you
know here's a for 133 megahertz we can
set our modulation type and it supports
a SK and okay and so it's really
customizable what's nice is they've done
all of the heavy lifting as far as you
know making sure you can transmit making
sure you can receive and set your
frequency and stuff so using this
library you can now do some really cool
stuff and they provided a real simple
way to do some basic stuff like for
example if I do Dee ping you can see
that it actually sends the alphabet and
you know I can receive those I could
also if I want to transmit DRF here let
me get some carriage returns in there D
dot or F X MIT for transmit and then
just just like I would do like printf
I'm like hello world Wow and then it
transmits that doesn't have any return
but if there was something else
listening on that same frequency I would
see hello world in whatever modulation
we both agreed on so go ahead and exit
using the exit operator and that kind of
gives you an idea of how powerful that
library is now here's the cool thing at
torque on 14 Mike Osmond did a challenge
to see what kind of cool stuff people
can do with the badge and route the box
team these are the guys that put on an
awesome hacking competition oh yeah yeah
they put together a chat client using
that library using the dongle and making
their own Python you know front-end to
that and coming up with their own
protocol for this chat so you'll be
transferring all your chat messages over
the radio and wireless or anything else
well that is one in the same but yes
instead of doing it over 2.4 gigahertz
over Wi-Fi that we're used to I'll be
putting it over like 433 I know what you
meant
so let's go ahead and talk about how to
get that started first of all I'm going
to need app I'm going to need a git so
I'm going to sudo apt-get install git
because it doesn't come on who moved to
by default
get being a repo happiness program
okay now I can actually get clone the
repository and they have it over at HTTP
colon slash slash they're on github.com
slash not get hit what
and this is gonna go ahead and clone the
torch at repo and I can go into torch at
now and see that they have a fun happy
little Python program and if we actually
nano torch @py
you'll see that they actually you know
it's pretty well documented so you can
kind of look at this as an example of
what cool stuff you can do with this
they pull it they spit up on end curses
screen you can see here's their their
interface for some of that you can see
down here they actually have a
description of their I guess it's in
another one yeah
nano Lib torch @py here we go this is
actually an example of their message
wrapper so you can see that you know
they started they've got a an ID number
a type and index the last chat the user
that's sending it and then they've got a
section here for the date for the
payload and the end of course whenever
you've got comments you're gonna see
things like this is confusing and
whatnot so that's always fun but with
all of that now we can actually go ahead
and run their tour chat program by doing
sudo dot slash torch @ py and you can
see here I have my interface and so they
you to change my name I'll say I'm
Darren I don't put a message out there
and say is anyone out there and Shannon
who has my laptop set up with another RF
cat dongle and go ahead and respond
there we go and I'm like hi snobs as you
can see now I have a chat and it's
totally not going over the standard
message standard so like two point four
that we're used to so first off the
convention the people that are at the
hacker cons they're not going to be
thinking actually hack this well okay so
that's the thing is you're talking about
security through obscurity now and and
you're right like so this is a protocol
written kind of on the fly the the root
the box team put this together in two
days
and they there's no encryption being
used here so anybody with another torque
on badge could potentially just sniff on
the same frequency and watch our entire
chat security could be adding it on the
application layer if we're real with PGP
or something and if this were rewritten
in that kind of a way with
store-and-forward capabilities that's
totally a possibility and so the reason
why I'm starting to learn Python because
I want to do just that
I don't know lick a Python like at a
very far distance or just like next to
each you know so the torque on badges
don't have the greatest range we were
testing before with you in the other
office and it was working just fine I
don't know what the exact range I know
that the lower the frequency is
typically the further we can get on with
similar a IRP and with similar wattage
and that's good to know and so yes this
could potentially be a lot better than
Wi-Fi at 2.4 gigahertz this is lower in
the spectrum at like 433 or 950 or
whatever but the torque on badge itself
while it does have an antenna it's
actually kind of built in it's right
where those where the sponsor logos are
but there's traces underneath this that
created with this particular one there's
actually solder points here to put
yourself just like a pennant you could
put a bigger antenna on it and you could
probably put a better tuned antenna
depending on what frequency you're using
so if you were just using 400 megahertz
you would have like you could change the
length of the antenna based on what
you're using yeah interesting but from
my understanding there's considering
this is open hardware and I also I know
and anyway it's my understanding that
hardware that there will be more
Hardware dongles for this sort of stuff
so kind of throwing this out there now
to get people to start thinking about
that kind of stuff because when that
becomes available it'll be really fun so
that like a hacker conferences or
wherever we can I start you know using
other kinds of radio not just Wi-Fi and
that's really exciting because you
really learn a whole lot when you're
basically building a whole stack yeah
now this makes it easy to get started in
software-defined radio because you don't
have to think about like how to create
amplitude shift keying or a frequency
shift keying signal that's the nice
thing about this Texas Instruments chip
is it does all of that stuff for you
personally if I had to I'd use on-off
keying because I'm lazy and it's really
easy but we're going to get into what
all of those concepts mean because it's
really fun when you start looking at
Wi-Fi in like lower down in the OSI
stack and you start like getting into
the actual link layer stuff and how the
modulation works and you know how I get
out about that but sending you a bunch
of random oh yeah you know here's
another cool thing is W load web page
it's a neat feature that they added
where if you enter in a URL and your
computer say your computer isn't online
uh-huh and you enter in a URL my
computer is online I'll go ahead and
fetch that URL for you
and it'll open in Firefox for you I mean
totally not secure yeah in the way that
it's implemented but just kind of like
as an idea of like hey we can bridge the
Internet through those frequencies it's
so cool
yeah and I'm sure there's well actually
now that I say all of this stuff I
realized that that oh no nevermind I
assume you can do encryption over I
assume so now I completely understand
why you were so excited when you got
home work on because this is awesome and
I can't wait to see like what the
developers start working on well yeah
and that's the thing is like remember at
Def Con last year the badge was that
like you had this IR transmitter on it
and if I was standing in front of you
our badges are communicating yeah
they'll start lighting up and
communicate I think and that's pretty
cool but imagine if like I can plug my
Linux computer into it and give it like
a message that I want to like send out
to this person and I have their PGP key
and so maybe I want to send a message
dual core and I don't know what I'm
gonna run into them but I've got a
circle of trust right and I can say this
is an encoded message to dual core and
theirs is a key fingerprint so that
that's like boo it's being sent to and I
run into you and you're at the booth or
whatever yeah and my dongle talks to
your dongle and it says hey I'm trying
to send a message to XYZ is this a
person you've seen before and you like
your dongle is all like yeah dual core
I've totally seen him he comes by the
booth sometimes and I'm like cool when
you see
again give him this message yeah totally
cool concept it's something that I'm
toying with I really need to learn
Python to get this going but I want to
encourage you guys to get involved if
you have ideas of how to put something
like this together it's just it's so fun
when you start thinking about computing
and communications outside of what has
just been provided to us by those
industries and start thinking about like
oh how would build our own you know free
and open stuff yeah not to get on a
tirade about the evils of the Internet
and why it's not actually enough but
we'll save that for another time anyway
um with all of that said feedback at
hak5 org is the easiest way to get in
touch with us and expect to see more SDR
goodness in the future I think we're
gonna go into PP GP and VPNs before we
get to that because we're gonna be
building on those technologies when we
do get to SDR brain that's kind of a
road map of what's ahead very cool
yes I'm looking forward to that and I
have something pretty cool don't you
want to show you guys oh yeah that's
right what are you getting into this
week yeah so have you heard of tails
absolutely I'm super excited about oh
wait no this isn't Sonic's friend and I
was gonna go and get all the rings no
not that one
now I want to go play sonic thanks a lot
yeah sorry about that another tails it's
still really cute this is the young ear
outer stuff yes oh yeah I love ya some
of that yeah it's awesome that's like
awesome layer of obscurity and security
and concluded awesome stuff math yep so
the next day on top of a what is it
called a hostile network that is the
Internet
yes yeah so I don't know I'm seeing some
concepts colliding here oh yeah it's
pretty good alright stay tuned we'll be
back here in just a bit
and Paul's gonna figure out what camera
we're gonna be on
we love technology here on hak5
especially when it gets integrated into
our cars and these Ford cars that we've
gotten to drive around this year have
been loaded with technology today we're
checking out the 2013 Ford Fusion now
this car is packed with tons of cool
features and my favorite is the sync
with MyFord Touch system sync has you
covered whether it's getting directions
or changing the music using touch
controls and voice commands sync with
MyFord Touch provides an easy-to-use way
to access your vehicle systems with your
hands on the wheel and your eyes on the
road there are two configurable
instrument panel LCDs controlled by to
switch pads on the steering wheel and
there's an eight inch touchscreen in the
center stack this is just one of the
great features that you'll find in the
2013 ford fusion tune in the future
episodes pack 5 to see more thanks again
to Ford for sponsoring today's show and
for their commitment to technology
