by domain.com time once again to check
for 110 this week's questioning the
first one comes from beardy jesse he
says I noticed when Darren was
installing stuff like Python USB and RF
cat a couple of episodes ago that when
the are you sure yes or no option
appeared he typed why to continue makes
sense to me when this is sensible the
capitalized item in the brackets is the
one that Linux assumes you want and will
be performed simply by pressing enter so
instead of wasting a good half second
reaching for the shift in another half
second pressing Y you can plow through
that option just by hitting Enter
yeah no totally didn't know that this is
and like this has just been the paradigm
in all kind of like text-based you know
like das a sh t CL any of those and the
idea being yeah sure there's a default
sometimes like in brackets or something
like that you know abort we try fail
ignore that's crazy I didn't know you
could just press ENTER but it makes
sense the reason that I don't is the
same reason that when I wake a computer
up that's got a screensaver going is I
wake it up by pressing the control key
or the shift key it's just natural out
of fire key because I don't know what's
going on in the screen and I don't want
to accidentally say yes to something and
so it's so yes you're right you could
say the half second but after having
been assisted min for a long enough and
knowing that oh yeah I just keep hitting
Enter
you'll be fine you didn't need that
database
did you that's great that's good
feedback so thank you very much beardy
Jesse our next question comes from Chris
our he writes have you ever considered
using aliasing sudo to please I love
that because in your life so funny you
know please all mtech RF slash news news

conflicting versions of black blue to
