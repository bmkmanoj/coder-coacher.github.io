Sail University welcome to hack tip the
show where we break down concepts tools
and techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and today I'm
getting into your viewer feedback for
the Linux terminal 101 series now I have
learned a lot about how to use shell but
you guys have sent over some really
useful tips in the past few weeks now
here are a few of my favorites that I
found helpful the first one comes from
James and it's all about alias
he says if a command has been alias and
one might want to run the unalienable or
the command for example his command is
alias LS equals
LS tak L now this command will usually
run LS tak L if you don't have a
backslash in front of it so for example
he types an LS slash user slash bin
which will give you LS tak L as the
output if you put a backslash
LS slash user slash bin it'll give you
the output at LS only for slash user
slash bin that's a really good one and
it takes two of our hack tips and puts
them right back together so thank you
for that
mink says I wanted to say you guys had a
clever hack with your expansions to
include the leading 0 in the months and
years but you can also do something like
this you can say simply bracket 0 1 all
the way to 31 with another bracket now
note the leading 0 in front of the 1 is
0 1 that will force a leading 0 on all
of the numbers to match you could also
say something like 0 0 1 all the way to
0 0 9 say were you listing the secret
agents in mi6 ha ha good one mink also
couldn't you use expansion to describe
the files to delete RM yeah that's a
good point - good one now Matthew writes
in there's a cute little easter egg in
all of the linux distros if you press
alt + f2 for the run prompt and type in
free the fish let's
try this alt f2 free the fish oh oh
there is no Easter egg in unity well
let's see what he said he said this
little fish is going to swim around the
screen and he likes to call him Steve
and he'll run away when you click on him
the funny thing is the fish cannot be
turned off without restarting the distro
and he very much enjoys Steve's company
while working now unfortunately Wanda
was removed in 11:10
that's a Wanda the fish when a boon to
switched over from Nome to unity but you
can get her back in I have instructions
in the show notes now we'll be right
back with some more of your tips but
here's a word from our sponsor 15
billion mobile apps have been downloaded
from the App Store in the android market

hack tip go to Full Sail edu / hack tip
to learn more about this online degree
program and we're back with more of your
viewer feedback and tips now the first
one comes from yarn or Jorn depending on
where you live I guess so he says to
reverse search your shell history you
can just press ctrl + R that save me a
lot of time
that was it that was actually a really
important one because I didn't know
about control and art so thank you yarn
or Jorn Steve writes in the best
terminal thing ever is called
tab-completion
and I know a lot of you guys have sent
me comments about this I try to remember
but a lot of times I just don't remember
I just type it out
I took a typing class what can I say my
students really seem to use it but it
saves so much typing and it prevents so
many typos so when as students are
slowly typing out something like them /
I see / just config / odd Network yeah
anyway you get the point he just wants
to take the keyboard and slam it with
them
no I'm just kidding he just wants to
take the keyboard from them and just
type in them et tab this tab any tab s
tab if tab e tab anyway basically just
type in tab and have it complete the
entire thing for them now you guys have
sent in some really great tips and
feedback and keep them coming I hope
that they help out some viewers as well
thanks to everyone who has been sending
feedback over for a Linux terminal 101

I have and thank you because I've
learned plenty from you as well
