I was looking for old hack five video on
YouTube and I came across it on this
channel called anywho and the video
starts playing and there's the pre-roll
ad and then it's followed by in any of
title screen that tells you to like
subscribe and stuff and I'm used to
seeing these I've seen these YouTube
spam accounts over and over again the
rebroadcast hak5 material they just read
up loader stuff sometimes they even like
give it an Instagram filter as it were
so that I don't know maybe it doesn't
get automatically picked up by YouTube
spam bots but what I didn't expect was
that this would be from a revision3
affiliate I had seen the ante whose
stuff on revision3 before and it just it
left a really bad taste in my mouth
so what I did about it and here's where
we are now so hack five video is going
all the way back to Episode one are
released under what's called Creative
Commons and it's basically it's like
copyright except it gives the content
creators the ability to set certain
exceptions which is really awesome
because in our case we use this one
called BY sanc that stands for
attribution share-alike non-commercial
and so you can you know you you don't
have to have my express permission to
use hack five videos in your computer
security course you know as long as you
just give credit where credit is due
everything's fine anything you want to
remix it you're going to use part of it
in your material that's fine as long as
you hear it adhere to the license and
notably the only big restriction really
is the whole non-commercial thing which
basically says don't rip our content pop
it on a burn to DVD and try to sell them
on eBay
because that has happened and that just
kind of irks me so I sent a DMCA
takedown notice and to YouTube and that
breaks my heart because I'm actually not
even a fan of the DMCA and the fact that
I have to wield that power drives me
nuts but the video was gone in just a
few minutes but here's the thing it
didn't stop there
the more I looked into this anywho
channel it found that it's like full of
hak5 content and it seems that it's got
like our videos going back like four
years ago and they've been like
systematically ripping us off and
injecting their little subscribes anywho
pretty you know bumper thing before the
video and it's not a pre-roll it's like
after
there's like an ad and then this is like
baked into the actual video file I'm
like what and they've got one of our
videos that's got like a quarter million
views after a two minute ad and I'm like
wait a second so somebody is making Bank
on hak5 content and they've got like
nearly a half million subscribers and
from 3000 somente videos and what do
these videos just others that they
ripped off and so I don't check them out
on Twitter and they've got like four
hundred followers something is totally
fishy
so I'm going through the feed and I'm
like who are these anywho people because
I don't really keep up with revision3
anymore and it's boobs
it's boob thumbnails and penis jokes and
I am livid and at this point I have no
idea what to make of this but this
morning I get a call from revision3 from
an executive and I'm told
dude it's no big deal turns out anywho
is a revision3 show and they've just
taken over the revision3 channel for two
weeks in a branding campaign or
something like that and I'm like what
what you can rename your YouTube channel
and then inject a title sequence to
every YouTube video and and I've just
never heard of this and I'm just like
what on earth happen and I'm like
thinking back to when we're at
diggnation in Brooklyn and Alex and
Kevin come by and Kevin Rose is like
dude you should do a show on revision3
and we're like sure and it's like when
we joined it was like system and Digg
nation and pixel perfect and tekzilla
and now I'm just like boobs so I don't
know what to make of all that
but that story and all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
