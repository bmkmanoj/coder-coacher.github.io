mount manager has a vulnerability it has
been patched and square credit card
readers are exploitable all that coming
up nail on threat wire greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for August 12 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom I caught the DEFCON
head cold so I apologize for sounding a
little stuffy huge thanks to everyone
supporting the show and supporting us
there is plenty to talk about so let's
go ahead and start with story number one
Microsoft patched Tuesday which is going
away soon brings a security patch for
USB this is not for USB rubber ducky nor
is it for bad USB it is for the windows
mount manager which is used to give new
USBs a drive letter when one is plugged
in the exploit would allow an attacker
to use the windows mount manager to get
elevated privileges on operating systems
all the way up to Windows 10 since this
attack requires physical access to a
machine it's labeled as important by
Microsoft an event log is also available
to detect attacks on this vulnerability
which can be very useful for auditing of
attempted exploits against a network
square credit card readers are a very
popular way for anyone to accept credit
card transactions last week at the black
hat conference two researchers found a
way to bypass encryption in those
readers they required a few components
wire soldering iron clips and a
screwdriver plus the obvious square
reader the hardware hack could bypass
the crypto chip on the device and the
software hat creates an audio wave file
that can be decrypted and replayed over
and over this encrypted recording can be
saved and be used to make a transaction
later on according to square quote any
card reader on the market can be
deconstructed the chip could be crushed
and then reassembled by using the
undamaged shell of the reader at square
we have processes in place to prevent
malicious behavior on damaged treaters
our square register software contains a
number of security precautions that
protect cards that are swiped on
unencrypted readers if our encrypted
readers are damaged they will not work
with square let's all hope that he is
right and lastly it turns out
the car hacks just keep on coming in
many fancy cars an immobilizer is in
place to make sure that a key fob is
near the ignition switch before it's
allowed to turn on this helps with
problems like hot wiring and it's found
in a lot of cars with keyless ignition
such as Volkswagen audis Fiat Honda has
cards like this and Volvo you can bypass
this with a radio amplifier to fool the
transponder but in 2012 researchers at
radboud university actually broke into
the crypto system used in the
transponder the mega most transponder
allows unlimited attempts to
authenticate with the key fob so after
listening into the exchange a couple of
times the researchers could make a fake
authentication and get this less than 30
minutes that's pretty fast and if you
were even faster than that this flaw
would require new keys as well as new
transponders to be installed in all of
the cars here's the kicker though the
researchers took this information to
Volkswagen and other companies in 2012
and after months and months of
discussion Volkswagen filed a suit to
silence them in the UK withdrawing the
papers so nobody got to see it for like
over a year the researchers were finally
able to release the findings this year
I'm all for coordinated disclosure with
the company involved and I seriously
hope that the automobile makers had
plenty of time to fix the problem in
their products since they went about
this in such a harsh way now before I go
I want to remind everyone that we love
reading your comments so share your
thoughts below on the YouTube page I
also want to give a huge thanks to
everyone who has supported the show so
far over on our patreon if you find
value from this and you can spare a few
cents an episode please consider
becoming a patron I love you guys it was
really fun to meet you over at Def Con
even it's at patreon.com / threat wire
we may even get to feature your adorable
fur babies like these ones in the very
next episode and i gotta say they're
very adorable so thank you for sending
in your pictures our plan is to do the
show three times a week as a milestone
go with a rotation of patrick norton
darren kitchen and me now we're still
working on funding up to our second
episode per week goal so if you haven't
already check out our patreon page and i
hope you will continue to contribute and
keep this completely in
completely ad-free of course if you
can't donate like shares subscribing all
that stuff goes a long way so do me a
favor this week just share the show with
like to your friends that haven't seen
it yet go do it and you can find all the
episodes and everything else about
throughout wire at the White threat
wired net and with that I'm Shannon
Morse and i will see you on the
internets all of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
