a tsb and render man plus more from
Derby con 2013 in this segment of hak5
this segment of hak5 is brought to you
by the Air Force collaboratory so what
got you into a dsb hacking I mean it's
like another complex system did it start
at a DSP or did you start with like air
traffic control to begin with well it
started out that i bought a nap and you
know you look through the camera on your
phone yet overlays a plate information
oh where does this information come from
it's kind of cool that's a based off of
a dsb automatic dependent surveillance
broadcast which is a whole bunch of
ground stations run by volunteers that
upload this information sharing you
generally nice map service why is it
that it's uploaded by volunteers like
public info it's public info the FAA
does provide a fee but it's delayed and
scrubbed and that this is the the raw
information right out of the kind of
stuff that you feeling like flightaware
yeah it's a flight aware of other sites
like that to use they actually use the
FAA feed because it's got the arrival
times in a row that but the a dsb stuff
is just you're plucking the raw data the
same air traffic control would be using
I started looking into this they can hey
that's kind of cool but the problem is
it's unencrypted and unauthenticated so
there anybody can read this stuff and
you know for a hacker hearing
unencrypted an unauthenticated on
something like you know an airliners
like oh dear god what now so to kind of
like give the the 30,000 foot overview
if you will as opposed to traditional
means of like seeing where planes are
based on radar and simply you know
getting on the radio and communicating
with ground stations how does a dsb
differ and how did we come to have this
a DSP is part of a larger system called
next-gen which is the next generation
air traffic control they're trying to
modernize the system and you know try to
do more with less conceal we're trying
to get more more and more people are
flying basically the plane has GPS now
and is reporting it's positioned air
traffic control rather than air
control hitting you know bouncing a
signal off the plane so it's a lot more
exact and a lot higher update so you're
able to pack flights in because you have
a better assurance of where they
actually are so rather than just
depending on sale Ike a spinning rado
radar dome to actually say hey we've got
big metal object in the sky must be an
airplane and that guy left at this time
and he's radioing saying he's there so
it's probably him there's also a
transponder oh and then there's old
transponder systems right read and reply
back with like flight number and stuff
like that so how is this any worse than
that if it's providing more information
in a faster update interval well with
the radar you were actually bouncing a
signal off met you could verify yes
there is actually something there with
the transponder it was really quite
difficult to forge I mean you'd actually
have to put something in be queried by
the the secondary radar the with a DSP V
is its broadcast it's just broadcasting
every direction to everyone it's there's
no querying or challenge response or
anything with that so it's able to be
intercepted easily and well then
everything should be able to be
intercepted and no security protocol or
anything should rely on the fact that it
can't be intercepted so there's nothing
wrong with sniffing but I imagine that
this is what is this like TCP of the sky
is it is there actually a network
protocol where there's really it's
omnidirectional there's no contention
protocol it's just there's no
association with a ground station before
sending a payload no it's just
constantly just sitting there beaconing
a Wi-Fi access point just saying I'm
here I'm here I'm here once a second at
anybody that wants to listen well
somebody else is doing it on the same
once a second then they're just talking
over each other yeah there is actually
problems where is you get packed the
flights in too close together they end
up talking over each other and just
squashing each other just interfering
the crazy because there's no actual
contention protocol bills into this
thing Wow when did this protocol okay I
can't imagine such a I mean it seems
obvious like if you're trying to fix the
prob
of being able to pack more planes into a
runway of using technology like this but
the whole concept of not putting in
parts of the protocol where I don't know
there's actually a clear to speak if you
will or a CTR clear to send like you
would have and say you know traditional
radio based networks I don't know where
how long ago did this come about and the
initial protocol was developed late 90s
early 2000s but they had to work off of
existing radios existing equipment so
it's the same kind of mode s datalink
that was there previously they just you
know jam more information into it
because they didn't want you know the
industry is terrified of mass
obsolescence you know they don't want to
have to replace half the avionics in the
the plane so if they could reuse the
radios just you know send some slowly
different information over them you know
they really like that idea and so like
this was not an overnight deployment I
take it no there there modernization is
over 20 years wow so this really makes
scatta look up to date it's the same
idea where you've got something that is
developed and is already you know pretty
much obsolete or made redundant by other
better ideas but because you're having
to change out literally there you know
this this massive network every plane
every you know air traffic control
station it's just this humongous system
that nobody I don't really think anyone
understands it completely well it is a
massive hub-and-spoke network and the
packets are people you know your MTU is
how many people can you pack in a 380
yeah and rom is that when you've got
limited bandwidth to get people through
because you've got you know 20 miles
between flights because Co that's the
most you can actually pack them in and
you've got more and more people wanting
to do more and more flights you know
suddenly now price the star skyrocketing
on things you know it's this weird game
client demand and so technology can
hopefully if you've got if you can get
the flights packed in tighter then you
could get more throughput run you don't
have to build extra runways or in that
would be like adding more bandwidth yeah
more runways but that's not as easy as
getting them in closer okay so we we
condense our packets we get them closer
and we use technology to save us but I
mean obviously as security researchers
we see a complex system we see some
inherent vulnerabilities like
unauthenticated unencrypted know you
know nothing of that sort I take it you
just see this and then you call up the
ICAO or whatever the regulatory body is
and say hey I found a vulnerability in
your system right yeah problem is most
of the time those phone numbers don't
exist you put up ICAO it's you know like
who the hell are you talk to you talk to
the media person they're gonna say no no
there's no problems dirty engineers
that's the problem is getting through to
the engineers but the problem is it's
all done by committee you know that
you've got you know all the airline
manufacturers all the plane
manufacturers all the various you've got
each country has their own regulatory
body for flight control having to get
everybody to play nice together in the
first places you know damn near
impossible well it is to be honest it is
like the one of the first true global
networks I mean you look at like
Telegraph's you know transatlantic
Telegraph's you look at transatlantic
flights those were some of the first and
the internet is really just like that on
like hyper speed yeah it's I would still
argue it's one of the most complex
systems out there internet probably
there's the biggest but you know air
traffic control the fact that we're able
to fly halfway around the globe you in a
day is amazing because it depends on
compatible I mean ok so there's problems
with the protocol we're not going to lie
a DSP has you know some inherent flaws
but ultimately aren't we still relying
on a man and an air traffic control
tower that unfortunately is not being
paid enough and is unfortunately work
too many hours and also a man in the
cockpit who again is not paid and
overworked but still we're talking about
in our people here the people still have
the final say but the problem is with
technology in order to do more with less
we're relying more on the technology to
accomplish certain things so it's a case
of garbage in garbage out if because
it's unencrypted and not authenticated
if I'm able to eject or in
luan's that data decisions made by those
humans are going to be done incorrectly
you know they're going to make decisions
thinking oh crap there's you a plane
just below me that's gonna hit me I'm
gonna you'll pull up and suddenly know
your stewardess azhar on the ceiling
yeah that's no good nobody likes serious
on the ceiling right yeah yeah we're
actually I mean even to like fast
forward and totally you know think like
20 years in the future when you know you
look at drone technology now where we've
got like predators and things of that
nature and even on like the hacker side
with even just Arduino flight control
stuff 20 years in the future maybe FedEx
or UPS or DHL is going to be asking the
question why do we have men in the
cockpit you know that you're just start
seeing more and more of this dependence
on technology that may not necessarily
be ready or for you know with this being
its prime time that you know like I said
with this particular protocol because
it's unencrypted unauthenticated what
can I inject into the system can't you
know they're already doing tests with
drones using a DSP because if they're
having to fly in commercial airspace
could you test could you just start
injecting stuff and I mean it's just
over radio you figure out the modulation
and you send it over that frequency
deepa Billy okay what would happen if
you did that if you just started to buy
like a huge number of laws dealing with
the interference of traffic signaling
device something doesn't it so you know
violate some laws when you send out you
know fault like when you do mac address
spoofing over Wi-Fi it is this but we're
also talking about you know airliners
with people and lives here it's a lot of
metal and and lives involved and frankly
everybody is so bloody concerned about
air travel safety and everything like
that they tend to come you know shoot
first ask questions later situation so
that said for that for that reason it
can't be Penn tested because that said
they're there I wouldn't necessarily pen
test on you a live system as it were but
that's there's got to be like test labs
out there for for proving this stuff for
verifying that you know equipment works
you know
to be a way that we could you know and I
keep challenging the fe I want to be
wrong on this stuff I want it you know
all have you gone to the FAA have you
gone to ICAO or any of the other
organizations any of the media of God
where the the reporters then goes you
know the press contact but it was gonna
statement back saying no no it's safe
it's safe well how is it safe we can't
tell you it's classified hmm like okay
well meet me halfway put me into one of
these test lab let's let's test this see
what happened it's like Wi-Fi was
classified like trust us it's cool web
works yeah but that's the thing is that
we're dealing in a situation where
actually my ass WEP yeah i mean my butt
is in those seats I'm flying I need to
know what the heck is you know keeping
me safe sure if it's not safe I'd like
to be helped you know help fix it cuz
you know obviously I want to be able to
continue flying and no it's safe if
they're certain that it's secure and
safe and well what's the harm in letting
me you know it's it's additional
assurance you know they prove well I
helped them a pen testing it who is
that's the trick is that the FAA said
well we've never re going you know
detected a ghost flight you know in our
system it's like okay does that mean
that no one's ever tested or you just
haven't detected one you know that's not
a comforting statement so I get that it
would probably be totally not legal to
start sending out a dsb packets however
sniffing these up it seems like there's
a whole network of amateurs what is what
is uh what is the vulnerability there
just the fact that you have access to
the raw data and you can't filter or you
know what people have access to you
can't say well these flights are
sensitive let's not put those they're
going but all the data mining potential
that if you can watch you know some of
the corporate private jets you know
where they take if you've got a you know
the corporate jet flying into the head
off the city of their competition and
you know that they've got some you know
financial issues gee I wonder if they
were about to be bought out you know
that sort of stuff being able to track
you know pop stars and stuff like that
if you know they're on that flight you
can see where they're going and stuff
like that you know they suddenly go off
to you where there's a sum like
addiction clinic or somebody right it's
not like the president's flying around
here force one with an e DSP transponder
saying Air Force One visit the Air Force
collaboratory at Air Force calm /
collaboratory work with real Airmen to
solve some of the Air Force's toughest
science and technology challenges your
idea could change everything this week's
tech Nola's photo of the week comes from
ross now this one was Darren's personal
favorite of the week he said hi Darren
I'm a big fan of your show one of my
favorite shows was season nine episode 9
03 where you built a computer case out
of a photo frame ever since that episode
I was motivated to build my own computer
case so here's one of my projects that
I'm most proud of Darren is this it
almost looks like a trash can it kind of
looks like one of those things that you
put fish into my boob ah it's not so
good have you seen my bucket I love that
that is so cool and it's it's very
original you can send your pictures over
to feedback at hak5 org have you built a
computer in a bucket I want to see yours
as well and make sure to put the subject
line as technol us so that we're easily
able to find it
