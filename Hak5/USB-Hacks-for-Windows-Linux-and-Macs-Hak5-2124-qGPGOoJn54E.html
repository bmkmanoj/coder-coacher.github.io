Windows Mac and Linux this time on hack
five well welcome to hack 5 my name is
Gerren kitchen my name is Shannon
Voynich Widdowson technolog welcome
everybody to this episode of track 5 we
have some super fun stuff that we have
been working on today for the first time
ever what on this show in 11 years when
there's a Mac in front of me ah no I'm
just kidding I'm sure some people out
there use Mac's but we have never had a
Mac on our show I mean we ever Paul had
a Mac on the show a couple of times a
season but we've never really gotten
into hacking max hmmm which is fine hmm
there's no shame in using a Mac we just
need a cross-platform payload today and
that's exactly what we're going to do
because we have a Windows there's a
here's my Windows yeah I don't know
what's going on with nearing this season
he's gotta back you got it my windows
you got it and a Mac and then I got my
Linux if you got your Linux going on
this is so weird
I know so what we're going to do is we
are about to venture off onto a pen test
engagement and I'm very excited to go
along with you on that we can't get into
too many of the details now client and
what for and all of that you guys know
it but we will be talking about the
research that we discover along the way
and I'm really excited to get into some
of the analysis of it but leading into
that I thought it would be really fun to
you know what just dev live mmm
right so the idea here is we need to
develop a payload for the USB rubber
ducky that will act as a USB drop okay
that we can litter say the parking lot
as an example it's very similar to what
was done on bridge around - robot yeah
it's a common attack vector basically
you take USB drives you litter them
around eventually someone's going to
pick it up and be like whoo and plug it
in right and usually when you see that
done they're either using a USB rubber
ducky or they're putting some kind of
malware on the actual flash drive so in
our case we're actually using a USB
rubber ducky exactly in fact I'm just
going to break out a brand new one
so we have our turkey Ardun Turkey we've
got our done turkey would have heard
we're going to be diving our turkey live
in many ways so I don't worry about that
as it's all going to work out in the end
and the Felix is actually a good example
of kind of going over the best practices
of what would be you know liquid this is
an actual engagement we need to do some
you know typically we have a little bit
more information about our target right
and one of the first things that we want
to do is our standard well on any
engagement we're going to do our pre
engagement interactions where we ask the
client certain things about the
network's like What's in scope what's
out of scope right now as if the CEO
doesn't want you to hack to his phone
you want to make sure that you know that
before ahead of time so you can like
whitelist his phone exactly so I'm just
going to continue assembling the duck
here so we don't have that luxury in
this case because we're kind of going in
blind in some ways that's just part of
this particular operation the the other
thing that we'll wanted and on those
though on those interactions you always
want to ask is much oh yeah oh yeah
absolutely the kingdom you know you're
not going to get everything but it
doesn't hurt to ask
after that the next step is to do your
own reconnaissance right and use all of
the open-source intelligence gathering
tools at your disposal whether it's you
know naked or Metasploit or melty go
after you go in particular it's
fantastic or for for doing you know
intelligence gathering on an
organization absolutely since we're
going again up kind of more broadly
speaking we don't we don't actually know
the details of all of the organizations
in this until we get there so that's
going to make things I don't know so
that's why we're developing a payload
that will work against any particular
system because we don't know who's going
to plug in what right so this is not
kind of really going why I know a lot of
people always ask like why don't you run
this into via globe with us and one of
the reasons why is because we need like
the hardware for multiple different
operating systems to actually work so
that's why we have multiple different
laptops here yes you want to plug in
that USB rubber ducky and make sure that
it already works no matter what and
there's your ducky when it's all
assembled and of course it just looks
like a regular thumb drive so that's
what's going to allow it to blend
in fact once we get to the site I have a
good feeling we'll be able to pick up
some of these with the clients that are
the variants logos absolutely and that's
a really fun thing about this this is
the most generic USB case you probably
have one of these that has like the logo
of something silly I remember I pulled
out right off over the years going to
see Yelp or any of companies would have
very similar thumb drives and they would
just hand them out yeah expecting you to
plug it in with a bunch of light PR
stuff on them totally exactly and you
know the that's that's the fantastic
vector because it does look like what
they're expecting it to be yeah and so
those are the bidding for us and if
we're if we craft our payload properly
for this will get execution within a
second yeah or two at the most
so the tricky part and this is that we
don't have that we are skipping the
steps of reconnaissance we are basically
trying to cover as many bases as
possible right had we done particular
reconnaissance and realize like okay
that's a shop that's standardized on the
one brand of like this I don't know pick
a brand like HP or gel hands that are
all running this one version of Windows
or whatever have you then we would
develop our payload a specifically
targeted for that machine and we'd go
out and get at a physical machine that
is running that not a VM you know VM
will work in a pinch but of course for
example if we're going after an ATM or
some you know esoteric like banking
system that that uses like hyper
terminal or something right I'm sort of
like dumb term and old it that even uses
ps2 well now we need to get a ps2
adapter because you don't want to get to
the site and then find out like good at
Jack its USB and find our ground I can't
plug it in our USB port because anything
os/2 warp right the other the other
aspects of that would be you know since
we don't have the luxury of knowing what
our particular target is we're going to
just try to make assumptions that
they're probably going to be Windows Mac
or Linux boxes and hope for the best I
think we have a pretty good chance yeah
so this particular payload is going to
be really simple but the trick here is
to make a cross-platform
so let's go ahead and get started now
that we have a pretty good understanding
of where we're going with us okay so
first off what is the point of this
payload what is it going to do well
let's figure why don't we just go ahead
and make a really simple one to open a
web page okay so on a web THC I don't
know and this is going to be very
similar to most payloads we're going to
do a quick little delay to give the
computer a chance to you know notice the
duct plug in right and then I don't know
this is Windows so we're going to do GUI
are to pull up the run line I'm going to
delay for a hundred milliseconds while
that GUI element pops up and we're going
to do string
I don't know hmm mr. W example comet is
always a good one easy and then enter
the cupids simplest payload ever I'm
going to go ahead and write that file
and if I now take the microSD card
reader I go over here to my sd card you
know let me get rid of all of this stuff
on here done with those payloads and let
me just go ahead and code this so I'm
just going to use Java attack jar encode
jar specify my input file as WebP exe
and my output file as in this case you
know the root of the sdcard inject up in
you know typical yeah doc encoding we've
done this people on the show eject that
go ahead and unplug that and so now I'll
take that SD card out and I'll just pop
that in the duct let's go over to this
windows computer here and so I just plug
in the duct and a second later there we
go
I got example.com yay ray it works their
work full of course events with the
windows payloads but unfortunately if I
plug it into the back the Mac now it's
not going to do anything right because
you pay you you scripted it for the
Windows machine so how are we going to
make it cross-platform with Lee Mac this
is where it gets tricky um so if I
switch over here to the Mac now let's
see hey this one actually has ports and
we picked it up over there yet if I hit
the equivalent of Windows key or here on
the Mac nothing
and however if you do what we call it
command space right the equivalent of
GUI space
I get spotlight and from here I could
actually type in HTTP colon slash slash
WWE example comm and it'll pop up Safari
and there we go so all we need to do in
that case is modify the payload so that
in addition to hitting Windows key R it
also does windows key space which I know
will work because when I test on this
Windows box Windows key R doesn't do
anything yeah if I if I after it doesn't
cause any problems and I don't believe
it's going to matter which order I do
this is Windows machines basically
ignores window space right exactly and I
believe the Mac is similarly going to
ignore Windows R so let's switch back to
the Mac here which is right there and I
hit command space and then hit command R
nothing happens so that's good because
then I can start typing hooray okay so
that's actually a perfect example of how
a lot of times when I'm developing a
payload I will physically do it on the
keyboard I'll actually good yeah totally
you just take why it's so nice to have
the machines here especially if you know
more about your target exactly cool all
right so what's next well the next thing
then would be to make this
cross-platform so it's we just having
that in back over to my Linux box yeah
let's go ahead and before we do our GUI
our let's do GUI space and then let's
add a little delay just 50 milliseconds
okay okay so now we've done Goose Bay
Xingu ER and then we type in our thing
and hit enter great ok let's save that
and encode it after I plug the SD card
and there we are the SD card showed up
I'm just going to go ahead and delete
the inject up in off of it and let's
encode that new one and there it is and
I'll safely eject great flower rinse
repeat pop it out and pop it back in our
duck okay okay now let's try it on the
Mac okay
and I'll pop it into the USB port that
it actually happens to have
cuz that worked that's funny kind of
keyboard assisted keyboard assistant you
noticed that yeah okay so let's go back
to that and see what actually happened
this display and I'm going to go ahead
and close out with P and Q hey it's
keyboard setup assistant because it was
a key word cannot be identified and is
not usable until it is identified yeah
yeah and it wants you to like hit
continue and like type a couple of keys
and such to like figure out what kind of
keyboard it is oh man and it's all like
weird and stuff so that's funny
brings up a good point what's that our
way of like keeping rubber duck you know
working no it still works well obviously
it is obviously watch this so I need to
remember which for these buttons which
computer nope wrong one got it anyway Oh
so on this Linux box I'm going to go
ahead and just plug the duck into my
computer okay now obviously you're going
to see that it did you know it did GUI
space it did GUI R and then it type that
hit enter now of course that's not a
bash command Sebastien's all like dude
what are you doing
right you may also notice over here in D
message which have been watching that
new full speed USB device yada yada yada
product is ahead keyboard manufactures
Apple and we have if we do LS USB oops
we have a vid in a pit for the eye okay
so this is the vendor ID and the product
ID okay so every you know how like MAC
address is the first three octet of a
MAC address whether it's Wi-Fi or
Ethernet whatever in the same well it's
the vendor yeah right so for instance
you know you could pull out a Wi-Fi
pineapple and you could look on the
bottom of it and it would say 0 0 C 0 C
a 8 F 7 a 2 6 ok someone will get this
eventually and be like that's my boy a
little issue um and the first three
octets of it specify the actual you know
vendor who makes it right for us which
is awesome right and you can similarly
do sort of the same thing with all USB
peripherals you all have a vid and a pit
or a vendor ID and a product ID which
specifies who the manufacturer is and
then what product it is
as an example where is that keyboard
back there yes let's see that so this is
a logitech k400 R so it would have a
vendor ID that would be you know some
hex characters that would be specific to
Logitech okay and then the the product
ID would be some hex characters but
specific to this K 400 okay right so if
we wanted to emulate a k400 Logitech
keyboard all we have to change the
product or the vendor ID yes times the
vendor ID in the product ID okay and
that's pretty simple to do with us we
were lucky there's versions of the
firmware from the community specifically
been dead snake has made some amazing
contributions that allows you to change
those vendor IDs and product IDs are you
saying we should change this to an apple
vendor ID yes because if we do that then
it's like oh it's one of my Mac
keyboards I love those funny so pop up
not happen if you change it to that
vendor ID yeah hah yeah exactly so
that's nothing we're going to do now
okay and I still don't have it right
figured it out there we go it's this one
I'm going to go over to my firmware
directory and their images okay so I
have copies of all of the different
firmware here and the one that I
actually want to use is quite simply OS
X the hex right and so there's just a
version of the ducky firmware which
works exactly like the vanilla one it
just happens to have the vendor ID a
product ID of an Apple keyboard so that
it doesn't cause that problem any okay
imple simple so in order to do that was
just going to do sudo DFU - programmer
and then erase okay so in order to
pursue that I need USB rubber ducky to
be into DFU programming mode right so
dfu is a what holding down and plugging
in at the same time
exactly yeah DFU is basically the way
the Apple devices can have their form
row written it's the bootloader kind of
like you might have read boot or you
boot or your bios whatever have you of
course
so I'm going to hold down the button
plug it in in fact I'll switch to the
screen so you can see and I'll push to
this screen so you can see the message
on the right so this time instead of
plugging it in and getting product
bored there we go
it says product is the 1832 you CDF you
manufacture animal it's got it and when
I do you know LS USB I'll get a
different thingy so here we're just
going to go ahead and II actually erase
the firmware that's currently on it
oops I have to specify the chip you know
I've done this before and here's an
awesome bash tip control R and oh yeah
erase and that wasn't it control R and
it is a t32 there we go
right I want reset and want erase if you
know you've done it recently you can
also use history you're right I can okay
so we've done that in fact I'll use
history and I will grep for the 1832 you
see three be one two five six because we
love chip numbers there we go
and this is actually the flash command
that I want which is pseudo DFU
programmer which is an awesome tool you
can use sudo apt-get install it and then
actually it's this one
because I want left half hex yeah right
so let's take a look at that command
again because you see I've got all of
those different from wares in this
directory and so what I'm running is as
route the DFU program utility saying hey
this chip right here what I want you to
do is flash the firmware and I want you
to suppress the bootloader memory and I
want you to write OS X DX cool so I do
that validates good to go and then
lastly we just reset it so watch over
here on the right side where we have
where we're watching the the log file
and we'll do a reset to basically
restart it he hid keyboard yep yep
keyboard apple inc all right go so this
time haha Apple Inc and when i LS USB
you'll notice that the vendor ID and
Product ID has changed 2:05 AC to two to
seven and it shows up as an apple oh
that's so funny
right okay so this time this you want
right again when I switch to the right
computer there we go and I plug the USB
room duckie into this Mac
oh yes there we go pop-up no Pato how
cool yeah and you know the Windows
machine doesn't care either well I can
just go ahead and here I will I don't
feel like Shannon I don't feel like
looking in the HDMI so I'm just going to
hold it up so everybody but essentially
go ahead and plug in our duck dudududu
nice there we go
so it didn't hurt a thing on the Windows
machine didn't hurt a thing on the
windows side doesn't hurt a thing on the
Mac side so we have our Windows machine
set up so that runs on there we have it
set up so it can run on Mac what if
somebody has a Linux machine
specifically I'm going to assume that
most people are probably using Ubuntu
because that's the most popular one
distrowatch would agree with you oh
really
ok and to everybody else watching at
home please leave in the comments your
favorite Linux distribution and why
Ubuntu with unity is the worst and so
lamin is with your lamer four and your
not Kay rattle tree really the only non
you don't like it is because you're old
ha ha
all right fine so we're going to go
ahead and update this payload to also
work in Linux
I say Linux I'm kind of cheating in this
because it's obviously not going to work
if you're running KDE
because you're failing or if you're
running xfce on gen 2 and awesome to you
but let's just take a look at what we
can do to make this a little bit better
so I'll go ahead and pop the SD card
back in the computer while we update
this payload and get back to my ducky
encoder directory and nano that web file
that we've been working on and basically
what I'm going to want to do is before
any of these key combos GUI space for
Mac or GUI are for Windows I'm going to
do alt f2 and then we'll do a little
delay 50 like we like to do and the last
update that I want to do to this script
actually is because this GUI are may
actually put an R for some reason on
your Linux box I'm going to go ahead and
after that GUI are let's see it will do
another delay 50 just for fun and we'll
do backspace just in case it has
actually typed BR right so all this is
going to do is you know on a right here
we're just going to pull up basically
the equivalent of the run line okay
right so if I hit all F to lips all f2
on mine I'm going to get enter a command
you're going to get something different
because you're not running gnome 3 I'm
running gnome 3 because it's awesome
check out this window managing
awesomeness that's pretty cool yeah and
then we'll do our GUI space for Mac and
then GUI R and then backspace and then
run our string and actually you know
what this entire time we've been going
to example comm which I'm sure the
fantastic website but let me just
SSH over to a server and we'll create
something you know I don't actually want
to give away the server that we're using
because we're going to be using it on
this engagement so forget what I said
we're going to use in fact 5 you know
what ha here's here's what we're going
to do goo GL and I am going to shorten a
URL I am going to shorten example calm
and I'll hit copy
fantastic I've got a copy of that the
reason that I want to do this is because
you see I have 0 clicks on it so far I'm
going to hit this and say analytical
data right we're going to come back to
that in just a second cool now when I
come back to my script
and go ahead and paste that we're going
to get rid of the s to save a character
because it doesn't matter and I'm going
to just save that file and lather rinse
repeat as we say the s doesn't matter
yeah you know why because they're going
to add it back and it's going to make my
payload length either and I don't care
about the security of it when I'm
hacking a bunch of random machine so I
guess the browser's will add it back so
it doesn't matter
well we'll Google though because when
you hit them on HTTP they're going to be
like oh you hit the wrong site years so
yeah you're right potentially this could
tax could be man-in-the-middle the hacks
could be hacked fantastic please do that
all right
and yeah it's leather rinse and repeat
that so I've got my high file there I'm
just going to go ahead and delete it so
I've got positive confirmation
that it has been flips and woolen coat
it again so Java attack jar and code
input files web app allow /media yada
yada gotta inject dot then looks good
eject okay great so now I don't pick a
host I guess we'll just stick with oh no
we'll try it on my machine try it on
your machine so let me place Kassie hdmi
cable because we have four laptops on
the set pass the HDMI that's it uh hey
they work right that's awesome yeah I
get my HDMI back I got I know I need to
continue showing this here you go okay
so now we know that it works on the
Linux machine does it still work on both
of these fields yeah sure let's try it
on the Mac again to make sure but it
shouldn't hurt innate hurt anything plug
it in again on a Mac and loop cool works
works free hooray and then of course on
the windows side I will let you just go
ahead and there you go okay here's the
duck good okay plug this baby and wahoo
example to come it works it works
yay and more importantly if I now
refresh over on this screen go ahead and
do a ctrl R hey we have click awesome
right and we can see the browsers you
know Chrome and Safari and the different
platforms
it separates them out Windows Mac and
hey x11
what is it oh is that Mac no x11 is a
Linux window manager oh that's the
window thing yeah no system D eats it I
know it's not just empty I did well in
Whalen yes I'm not rolling my eyes I
love x11
and with a necessity okay cool so so now
that we know that it's cross-platform
it's working everywhere we're set right
basically there wasn't any
engagement we don't have the ability to
do recon yeah we were able to we weren't
able to target what we targeted by
saying all three mana platforms
our research was essentially saying
let's imagine that there in the most
generic state okay especially you this
windows one it's going to work on
anything from like Windows 98 and above
yeah browser installed okay so then we
did we wrote the payload we encoded it
we tested it lather rinse repeat we've
optimized it by putting a firmware out
right we're ready to deploy awesome so
that right there is just a quick little
overview on kind of the you know the the
ducting workflow as it were which is
also outlined in my fantastic book which
you can get at the hat shop and I edited
you're welcome because if I didn't there
would be tons and tons of typos you know
we're doing next what making a lots and
lots of that Kentucky is that we'll be
right back going to take a quick moment
to thank our awesome sponsors domain.com
for supporting us all of these years and
remind you guys that when you have that
brilliant idea just a Shannon and I do
we go through domain.com first and we
register that awesome name and using the
domain discovery system at Julian calm
and they're very simple checkout process
makes it a breeze to bring that idea to
reality and get your website up and
online in no time flat and get this the
guys over domain comm huge fans packed
I've and you guys say we have a special
coupon code just for you it's a check a
five and it saves you 20% at checkout
and if you don't need a domain name in
this very moment you can still tweet
them at domain.com and say hey thanks
for supporting hack 5 all of these years
thank you for believing in us and we
really appreciate it so when you guys
think domain names think domain.com we
have officially made one duck one
cross-platform ducky
this is going to get us so far in our
pen test no it is not no it is a numbers
Jack it is a numbers game we're probably
going to have to make a lot of dot 332
make sure at least one of them gets
plugged in we need 330 ducks oh that's
going to take a long time dude ducking a
how you know we're going to do we're
going to bring back our good old friend
chirpy chirpy
I remember chirpy this right here back
in the day when we did that manually yes
this is a USB and micro SD card
duplicator and in fact up until I forget
at what point we changed our
manufacturing process every single duck
was flashed and what we call chirps the
tail oh my gosh there are actual
payloads taped to the top of it there
are micro SD card records in here but um
we should probably find out what's on
them that we really should yeah every
single one was flashed by and
and oh man we are going to be sitting in
front of this today like we used to
well I used to solder every single
battery pack exactly manifold every
Wi-Fi pineapple mark one she and Mark to
market area or two if you have a mark 2
and you came with a battery pack they
were soldered by hand by smell tape it
battery packs ok so we're just going to
plug in like 20 of these at a time and
let it chirp away right yes ok yes and
it was PPP from when it's done so big
hence the name jerky otherwise you know
CP inject op then to slash media slash
whatever whatever whatever yeah and just
sit there with an SD card all day long
you might prefer that if you work for
some company and you get paid hourly
done weirder stuff as assisted men John
asked me about my relationship with cat
5 all right if you have a relationship
with cat 5 you'd like to share that's
awkward
no no pics or it didn't happen you can
just leave those in the comments so I
think that's about it for our segment
right yes and everything indeed I'm
looking forward to hearing what you guys
think this is actually surprisingly the
first that I've seen payload that is
completely cross-platform I see
completely where we're fudging it a
little by saying unity yeah Ubuntu but
whatever okay we probably want to get
all of those hits anyway yeah I mean
most of the people at the place where
