POSIX and this hack tip is brought to
you by Eero welcome to hack tip the show
we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morse and
today we are talking about POSIX or
POSIX if you feel like saying it that
way as well so what the heck is that
yes POSIX this stands for the portable
operating system interface aka POSIX for
short and is defined as a family of
standards specified by the I Triple E
Computer Society for maintaining
compatibility between operating systems
so POSIX defines the application
programming interface the API along with
command line shells and utility
interfaces for software compatibility
with variants of UNIX and other
operating systems
so basically POSIX makes stuff stay
compatible in operating systems that's
the short format definition problem was
way back in 80s a whole bunch of
different manufacturers wanted to fancy
up their stuff they got incompatible
drama ended up ensuing and then the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers the I Triple E for short they
showed up they made a set of standards
for folks to follow and the standards
they came up with were aptly named POSIX
so physics took the originally developed
UNIX that happened to just understand a
ski-in collation order and adjusted it
so ASCII tables would be read with
something called locale the locale
adjustment allows the operating system
to choose the best format based on
whatever language the user is working
with so if you don't use English that's
totally fine they made it available for
any language in the world well almost
that is a dictionary collation order
rather than the regular older ASCII
order so one way to think about this is
the older ASCII order just reads the
alphabet as all uppercase a through Z
first and then all lowercase a through Z
so if you look at that if I type this in
it would look through ABCD all the way
through Z and then it would get
everything else
ABCD all the way through Z like that now
if I go ahead and control C outta there
if I wanted to do a dictionary collation
order that reads the same listing of
letters as lowercase a uppercase a and
then lowercase B uppercase B and so on
and so forth all the way to lowercase e
uppercase is e at the very end and then
of course there are also your numbers
and your symbols that you'll find on
your keyboard now when it comes to
regular expressions with grep for
example you probably won't run into any
issues but if you do there are POSIX
character classes that you can use now
luckily there is a website for this
there's a great run down over at regular
- expressions dot info in this website
you should definitely check it out if
you haven't already for regular
expressions basically if I scroll down
you can see it here this table explains
all of the different ways that you can
use POSIX character classes to get the
output that you expect whenever you are
working with different kinds of regular
expressions now we are going to delve
into converting back to regular ASCII
format in case you run into any
complications right after this break
when you're looking to improve your
wireless network making sure that your
entire home has a strong signal is a
definite must that's where Iiro comes in
they are launching the very first second
generation mesh Wi-Fi system that comes
with one arrow and one to two beacons
these are mesh access points they're not
extenders they're much smaller than the
originals they plug into an outlet they
have an ambient nightlight in case you
gotta get up in the middle of the night
and they are more powerful than the
originals as well but if you already
have the original arrow devices that's
totally cool 2 euro has your back these
babies are backwards compatible and they
can be purchased separately so systems
start at 399 for all of the components
together but if you just want to buy one
beacon to add on you totally can and
those are 149 each we've gotten a chance
to test these in the warehouse so I can
honestly say our Wyatt wireless usually
does not reach from one end to another
but the EO mesh does a really great job
of fixing that headache and giving me
the speeds that I pay for from my ISP
plus it's very easy to set up it's
really reliable 2 euro is also
announcing the ero plus subscription
which includes advanced network security
monitoring supplementing the features
that are already built in they
you get for free with the device and
content filtering which is also really
great for houses with kids now with any
system you get automatic updates you get
two factor authentication for your admin
access you get eros backing with a bug
bounty program and they also do third
party audits which is awesome we also
have a coupon code for you for free
overnight shipping to the US or Canada
you can visit eurocom and at checkout
select overnight shipping enter hack tip
HHA tip to make it free check it out and
learn more at eurocom we are now back
and now it is time for some examples so
I'm gonna pull up my terminal here and
I'm going to go ahead and control see
that so I am going to type in grep tack
N and single quote a through Z all
capitals close that out and I'm going to
look specifically in my hack tip I don't
remember the full name so I'm gonna call
it hack tip asterisk for wildcard txt
and hit enter oh I'm in the wrong folder
let's change directories over to I
believe it's called test and try that
again there we go okay so now I can see
that it outputs highlighted uppercase
letters from my hack tips show note
document it's the same thing if I just
end up typing a through Z and actually
type it out a three ZD whatever but this
time of course I didn't type out all the
letters so it's only going to get me the
output for ABCD and Z so not a big
difference there same output if I wanted
to use the POSIX setting though it would
be the same thing pretty similar grep
tack H in this case single quote and in
double brackets I'm going to put upper
end it with single quotes again and then
close that out with the file I want to
search hit enter and that's going to
give me the exact same output again now
say for some reason your output was not
correct for grep or some other program
that you are running
you're kind of sick of POSIX maybe you
can convert to regular ASCII collation
order instead of dictionary collation
that you get with POSIX so you can
easily do this by changing the language
environment variable since it is tied to
your operating system language settings
like we mentioned previously when out
lying whatever pose X is now you can use
this by typing in echo dollar sign
uppercase lang and that is going to give
you the language of your operating
system so in my case I'm using u.s.
English basically next I can type locale
and hit enter and this is going to bring
up the locale command so instead of
having my language sent to US English
what you which you can see appear and
also in that language line right below
it
I could easily change this to export
Ling equals POSIX all in capitals except
for export and this is going to revert
that back to regular ASCII collation
order now if you do add this to you bash
our C file like we've mentioned
previously on a hack tip it will make
the change permanent this is very
similar to how I change the colors for
my default terminal whenever it opens up
now the last thing I wanted to talk
about with POSIX is the two types of
expressions that it comes as there's
either basic or extended so basic
regular expressions aka BR eak and
extended regular expressions AKA e ar e
they each work a little bit differently
so BR e is built into grep and as such
basic meta-characters are also
recognized so this includes the carrot
the dollar sign the period the brackets
the square ones and the asterisk or the
wild-card ER e includes the parentheses
the squiggly brackets and it also
includes the question mark and the plus
sign like that
now both the parentheses and the
squigglies can be treated like basic
regular expression characters only if
they are escaped with a backslash right
before them with extended regular
expressions back slashing any of the
meta characters will make them literal
characters and now you know one of the
many reasons why EGH rip is super handy
because extended grep supports er E
characters as well as bre ones so now
you have an overview of POSIX and ye
grep existed keep in mind though EGH rip
is deprecated since now the same
extended output can be done with grep
tech e which is what they say you're
supposed to do I don't really care which
one you use I'm sticking with grep tech
because it's the one that's easy for me
to memorize now be sure to subscribe to

today's episode until then I want to
hear your feedback comment below and be
