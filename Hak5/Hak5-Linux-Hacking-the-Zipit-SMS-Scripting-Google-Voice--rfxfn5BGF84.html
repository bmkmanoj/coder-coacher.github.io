unlocking google voice hacking with jae
beom via dim dim in a first look at the
Google Chrome OS all that and more on
this episode of hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by the United States Air Force dimdim
easy free web conferencing go to assist
express and domain com got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain hello
and welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse sweet and
Matt's not here so we're totally talking
about Lennox and open source and Google
in Twilight Twilight really well I
thought that's what we were doing this
no no no no just cuz you got to go see
that movie doesn't mean that you're
doing that machine fine what are we
doing a prett uh well we're taking a
first look at the google chrome OS jason
appalam with the google voice hacking a
lot of fun code there and I'm making
this do stuff other than its intended
purposes hey did a diverse and talking
about time right yeah yeah seriously so
have you heard about this new google
chrome giggity giggity OS the giggity
giggity giggity can say that yeah um
I've heard of it but I haven't played
with it ok so for like if this has been
like the the lowest Hamer puts it the
magical unicorn that everybody wants it
to be the you know I yes like we've
waited for this for like a lotta
unicorns lately yes and it's the idea
that all Google is gonna do their own
operating system remember like coupon
too and stuff so so it's true Google is
working on operating system other than
Android which I finally got with the
droid brine and now right finally enter
the world of smartphones because as I am
told the blackberry wisdom but but but
now I mean aside from there I don't I
don't know what the distinction is there
because Google now has the android for
phones and maybe some other embedded
device like your our coats and stuff but
from what I've seen in the press release
and whatnot that this is intended for
netbooks okay that's nice so does that
mean it works faster it boots in seven
seconds yes and it's entirely cloud
based OS so you know Google with their
awesome google apps like their google
docs and gmail and does that mean you're
never actually downloading do s well I
mean the OS is on your computer but all
of your documents are in that fog place
I get it yeah oh cuz we trust the cloud
and you know we'll always have
connectivity the Wi-Fi never goes down
right monkeys never get in the middle
but uh but I mean it's it's an
interesting concept and to spur
development I guess they've gone ahead
and much like they do with the Chrome
browser you've got the chrome browser
and then you've got the chromium project
which is like the open source side of it
where as it's more experimental the
developers can have fun with it so
before this actually releases like the
year ahead of time they've gone ahead
and released the source code and put it
out there so that anybody that wants to
have fun developing little I don't know
because it's all web at base but if you
want to develop with it there's even a
hardware spec if you want to get
involved with the google OS project you
can go ahead and go to chromium org and
I get the source code and I've gone
ahead and do and done that and I think
next episode we're going to be taking a
look building that and stuff but I
figured we'd take a first look and just
kind of get an idea of it because it was
actually some some people have gone
ahead and compiled it as a virtual
machine and now for VMware for some
reason but I've got converted that Dover
to you know virtualbox the proper
virtualization technology alright so the
figures take a look so show me what you
got here alright so I'm gonna just go
ahead and reset this VM because yes it
crashes well you sorry one at y 2 3 4 50
check that out aardwolf tab at gmail
yeah that's fine that's your password my
password is long you got it wrong
aardwolf you can say it out loud it's
okay
and there you go and after your
ridiculously long password is provided
you were greeted with crumb a web
browser and you could try to close this
tab but it would just it just reopen
very good can we do that now because my
mouse isn't oh I have two mice that's
what's messing me up all right so we
close this tab and then it immediately
pops up another one I know right so but
we have all of these like web app so if
I like click into here I've got my gmail
and facebook and Hulu and I can take my
gmail here and that's probably not one
that I want to publish so hang on real
quick we're going to cut away from that
we always use a Facebook as an example
I'm using the wrong now still having two
mice nvm because I'm remote desktop tin
to a vm this is not as fun as it looks
let's go into a facebook you can see
that in my email actually have 495
unread so if your email mean you're
wondering WTF but you can right click on
these and set them as a pin so now it's
just this little tab here and you can't
close it and it takes up less space and
the idea is that you would have you know
because you use firefox right yeah you
always have like Gmail open in a tab
right awesome that's a ideas oh it's in
the cloud supposedly if you want to get
fun hacking with this ctrl alt or ctrl
shift T will get you a terminal I've
been very unsuccessful in getting that
and I really wish that I could if you
find an open dialogue you can actually
get to the root and see your app sees
your bins your libs and all that fun
stuff so it is running on Linux and I
think it's very cool that it boots up
this quick so but this is just a first
look we will talk way more in depth with
it when we compile and have our way with
it next week yeah yes but the first you
are having your way with another linux
device yeah this is the zip is e2 and
i'll go into much much more detail about
it but it's basically just for instant
messaging and nobody needs that so we're
gonna make it do a lot more fun hackery
like like owning up some My Little
Ponies like go nyan well
I already bashed that pics headed I it
was my birthday and I got this full
candy and it was full of candy and I was
really really really hyper her for the
rest of the day it was amazing I loved
it all right well let's take a candy
break and what we do let's make one of
her excellent sponsors which one that
one outcome Bella will you marry me
Bella will you marry me dot-com what you
don't have to be a sparkly emo vampire
to get a great domain in fact just from
being a kick-ass hak5 fan you get
fifteen percent off your order at
domain.com they've got calm names for
less than ten dollars a year hosting for
six bucks a month and killer VPS hosting
plans remember those ssh tunneling
tricks we did last week yeah that's the
power of root access baby and with
domain coms virtual private servers you
get just that a hardcore server with
your very own shell to bash dedicated
resources and cpanel or plus web
management tools to get your linux and
windows server on without the hassle so
whether you're a crybaby vampire looking
to make your message stand out or a
network guru looking for some serious
cloud action check out domain com and
they're not looking to push you with
upsells you don't need in fact they want
to hear feedback from you yes you the
packet love and hak5 fan so tweet them
your thoughts at domain com and save
fifteen percent on your next order when
you checkout with coupon code hak5 got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com
while you want a sparkly ring I'm a
sparkly vampire sparkles
joining us tonight is our very own Jason
Applebaum coming in from Northern
Virginia to talk to us here about some
awesome google voice hacks we've got you
in on the the dim dim where screen
sharing so let's get our code on Jason
how you doing man doing pretty good all
the way up here in Northern Virginia
it's kind of getting cold right on well
we are playing with google voice tonight
tell me about google voice just give me
an overview before we get into the
nitty-gritty of the code here so google
voice is is is a system where you can
actually give people out your number and
it's send or receive SMS is and it's
kind of a way to unify all your numbers
so that that it's more than just like a
number unifier it supports SMS which is
actually really important to us there
are a lot of cool things you can do with
SMS you set up like like reply servers
or you can do searches like if you want
to set up an amaz amazon search or price
search while you're on the go you can
text your own your own google voice over
and it can reply back if you have a
server running on on listening to the
google voice but it's it's a kind of a
cool system that allows you unify all
your numbers so is that kind of like you
know how you've got like a short code
for like Twitter the 40404 is that we're
gonna do something similar something
similar without paying five thousand
dollars for a short code okay is that
really what it costs yes about 5,000
month ouch and google voice is free
great yeah free with invite grab
yourself an invite just bug someone
mm-hmm okay so so what is this code here
what's the language and what does it do
so what we have is we've got a library
provided by somebody yet on somebody
actually i found on google code somebody
created a library for google voice using
java my language of choice i'll actually
have the links in the show notes for the
for the library scene going imported in
your own project and it's actually
really really simple so you see here all
you do is you create your your voice
object right here and there's a special
script right here right here it's a
little uh yeah well is that your
password no no i see i see your username
i see the password 123 I'm assuming
you're going to change
that after this segment yeah what is
that fu CHMP blah blah that is your
google voice unique identifier that is
unique to your account and never changes
you actually have to scrape that from
the HTML it's on any google voice page
view the source and you find it it's
actually called the SMR number i believe
is what it is it's our NRA it's the rnr
no case so this isn't like a like when
you do the google maps fun stuff this
isn't like an API key that you would get
oh no absolutely not this is not a p.i
he tall what it is is it's a way that
google voice associate your account
without username and password and it's
embedded into all the HTML okay so how
do you find this just any google voice
page right click view source and
actually let's see i have a i got the
google voice page up right now you can
click view source and there it is it's
actually in here a couple times but that
that's the value right there you want
the entire value you want including the
equals okay so now that we have yeah
just go ahead and grab that number
mm-hmm so we've got a google voice
account we've figured out our R&amp;amp;R number
from the source code yeah and then what
you do is you that is the fourth value
here the the PHP version of this also
requires the aren't are some of the
libraries out there actually scrape it
from the HTML because that's that's
pretty much we're doing this library
just goes in references google voice and
when it goes in references google voice
you see all the screen scraping that's
going on basically because when i do
like things like get get current
voicemails get get SMS is that is just
an xml feed it's the same thing you'd
see if you just went to the actual site
its look at scraped off so now that we
have the the rnr number we have our this
this null string i have in here is
actually the the identifier is what they
call it you can make it anything you
want I wouldn't make it you know SMS
server running in the background that's
you know taking advantage of google
voice it's just I leave it null it's not
a big wall and let's pause on this for a
moment now you said we are just screen
scraping so there isn't like I'm
assuming
there isn't an API open for you to have
fun no there is not an API show so you
wouldn't put in here you know google
voice server or something why is this i
mean is this against the AUP or the tos
yeah it's against the term service to
automate your interaction with google
voice okay well then for educational
purposes let's follow on with the code
and see what other affair is just for
educational purposes sure so what you
have here is like I said it's a null
string that basically is the identifier
I think the one they put in there is
site or website but I know you can put
you can literally put anything you want
like hak5 is going to be our our tag for
this store okay um then you use your
password and then your your email
address that you access your account
with so let's start off with something
really really simple let's go ahead and
we'll do we can use this one right here
me uncomment that out so basically this
is sending an SMS to this number here
okay and it is of and this is the
message so what we'll do is awesome SMS
and we'll go ahead and send that by
running the program it gives your art
your your token your token is kind of
important on if it fails if you have all
your information right and you're
running this in server for all I hear
your droid yeah yeah I my phone just
went off so so you got the yeah I got I
got awesome SMS from you know that 814
number yeah so you know 841 hack SMS 8
14 hack SMS yes h ack SMS well okay well
you spelled hack correctly oh yeah see
which if you do a che ke you're missing
a letter so it's lately like hack aj SMS
for or something all right well anyway
sweet so I got the message I'm assuming
I can reply to this now yeah go ahead go
ahead and reply to that message all
right hello world PHP is cooler so I'm
gonna go ahead comment out that line and
then I'm gonna do this I I made my own
function called get SMS okay and you
have voice dot get SMS which is the
subject from from the library dot get
get SMS that gets the XML from our SMS
inbox and then if you come down here
what I've done is I've I've given this
code this code it's all going to be
posted up on the site basically what you
do is you come in here I went ahead and
I substring out to scrape this a little
bit better and then i went ahead and
converted their time because it's giving
it to a mmm p.m. back into 2400 just the
2400 standard to make it easier to parse
so in case in the future you want to go
through and ignore SMS is that you've
already seen I know so what you do is
you come in here then I'm dropping out
at elements of the phone number the
spaces the dashes the parentheses and
then I'm going to reply hi there from
all of us at hak5 ok so I'm going to go
ahead and run that it's going to analyze
if you see we have there you go we got
to one from you earlier and one from now
hello world the PHP is cooler than Java
debt I disagree really yeah definitely
oh then right now it's good actually
sent to SMS as one from earlier and then
one from right now and it's gonna say it
says hi there from all of us here at hak
5 so there you go yeah did just get that
array so you could really take this you
know really far do a whole adventure
game with this system cuz that's your
game yeah the venture game like a you
know you text message you know you're
somewhere in the forest you you end up
the magical horse you want to take a
left right or straight you can play the
rest mess so what are you proposing
porting something legs work or adventure
or something sure definitely could it
would just take a lot of messages and MP
advice if you're going to do that
unlimited SMS is great cuz they'll
charge a lot of money for bits all right
I love the idea of that so with this
code I mean that's pretty much laying
the foundation for anybody to go yet
gates it goes ahead it goes ahead and
give you a basic parser so you can get
SMS is I it'll tell you you can drop out
any old SMS Azure get any new SMS is and
just go through and send us message it's
really really simple whether you're
doing this PHP JavaScript their java
excuse me java there's 14 c sharp c plus
plus there's tons and talk
the different libraries because these
are all HTTP requests that's all they're
doing they're just they're just gets or
sets excuse me so it sounds like this is
one of the easiest ways to do this for
free I know that there's probably some
of those SMS gateways out there that you
can pay for yeah there's actually a ton
SMS gateways they cost anywhere between
i want to say at the low end for sense
to the high end 2010 send SMS and and
they're really the exact same thing
granite you can't do certain things with
this like you can't do theirs you can
send a big concatenated like a giant
strong add SMS concatenated being you
know if you send out message over 140
characters you get to you can do things
like that but but it's again against the
terms of service so that's do it at your
own risk kind of thing right but I could
totally see somebody you know taking
this and extending it maybe just using
it like have a private number where they
have a certain value and they can SMS
codes maybe they're out on vacation
whatever and they can SMS codes to a
server back home that tells a piece
there you having something that you
could feed your cat dsms it feed your
cat you could you know control your your
stereo system toaster toaster all right
yes everyone able toaster while they're
on the go I love this idea alright well
go ahead no I was going to say we could
take this we can keep going and take
this further and further and the these
are the same things that are all the
apps you see on the iphone the android
blackberry all those google voice apps
are based off the exact same thing
really yeah they're all just doing
screens craving okay well then I'm
really intrigued by this I mean
obviously the these api or not these api
is these frameworks that you're using
the java one you say there's a PHP one
yes sweet and and people could you know
go ahead and grab the code take a look
at your code get involved and where can
they send you like you know ideas or
code or you're going to share the code
on the forums yeah yeah the code will be
up at four on the forums and you can
reach me at Jason and hak5 sweet all
right and where's your blog and your
Twitter and stuff so yeah people can
stalk twitter i'm at Jason Applebaum and
it's jason a bomb com all right and your
your personal
phone number yeah that's a one two three
four five six sorry yeah well I'm
blacking mine out of your source code
when this gets into post but thank you
for the demo this was awesome thanks for
calling in and I got a real quick just
thank dimdim for sponsoring this segment
and making available this awesome free
screen casting collaboration software so
that we can actually get this done

dim calm / hak5
train so today we're hacking the zip is
e2 it's basically just a little machine
that lets you get on to instant
messaging via your local Wi-Fi network
whether it's gmail what else msn AOL
whatever and it's you can get it from
target it's about forty dollars we don't
really have a use for it though cuz we
all have cell phones you know what's the
use of having one of these tools for
instant messaging it doesn't even tell
her i'm not gonna pay 40 bucks for that
no so we're gonna turn it into a little
mini computer running linux i love this
idea yay so because this is like I mean
if a netbook is like a 300 ish dollar
you know portable well very portable for
laptop and users yeah not really a band
of stuff any money right now yeah I mean
there's this touching if you're looking
for cheap device to have oh yeah you
like your little sister would love one
of these especially if you make it into
a little mini computer I think that's
what this originally for though is your
little sister because it idea is the
picture on the front is of your little
sisters yeah get a little bonsai chica
off the computer so you can actually get
some work done and though she can
actually you know oh my god i'm on a
once missing you with all my friends so
so make it do more than that so what's
inside of it it's got a 2.8 inch 320 x
240 color display it's got a backlit
keyboard which is very nice a mini SD
card slot 300 megahertz xscale processor
which is kind of like one of your old
school smartphones 32 megs of internal
memory and 802 11 11 g Wi-Fi so it does
have Wi-Fi inside of it yay that's
basically like everything that you would
find in like your older smartphone and
for 40 bucks you can't go wrong so you
know what's especially I'm excited about
any device that I can throw in my pocket
with a battery that's got a Wi-Fi chip
because you know what I'm thinking so
what do we have here no what yeah okay
what are we working with alright so
there are a couple of things you need we
are going to be doing this using Windows
you can do it using linux on your
computer as well but we're just doing
the windows version you need a one or
two
mini SD card all right I have that here
hmm i actually have a micro SD card that
I then pop into a mini or yeah whoops
wait what is it it's a micro the
community that goes into this to the
regular SD yes so with all three of
these I can actually like you know move
the file around that's horrible answer
from my laptop to the Zipit and whatnot
and we also need the one or two gig disk
image from a Leo su-27s website we need
the fist disk right program and we'll be
using the GUI version of this the auto
flasher script and windows ext2 file
system driver which apparently does not
work in windows 7 yet well hopefully
Wilson hopefully it will soon and we
also need alius of 27 s latest usually
an image which you can also get off with
this website so let's get into unlocking
it alright well we have a virgin zip at
z2 here and you can t have the hacked
version right here right so so go ahead
and help me through this because you've
already hacked that one I want to get up
to speed because seriously after you
know you're doing that I'm just I want
one as well coors you'll enjoy it trust
me alright so what do i do first you
need to format your mini SD card into
fat 32 ok somebody hit my dog sorry
don't start okay so uh watch out I'll
pop that into my acer and get y'all
ready to wow get my fat 32 on okay will
format all right I have it formatted ok
now that auto flasher script you want to
extract the auto flasher to the root of
the SD card ok 7-zip action here hmm all
right anything else heinous and you also
want to extract all ESO 27 s userland
image and copy the z image dash two
point six point two nine file from the
boot folder to the SD card root and
rename it to Colonel dot bin catch all
that yeah I called all that are you sure
yeah I can really explain it for you
know i got it i just cracked out crazy
person well i'm just taking me a minute
man it's like a netbook you know i'm
trying to extract that read immature
forgot well we're going from Tonka toy
to like fisher-price or something she
but hey whatever man it's got a Wi-Fi
chip set in it and you know we probably
have some fun like the ward drive in
action or I mean we could we could
probably get like a little pouch for
curry on her back and then but she's my
girl on the neighborhood do it'd be so
cute nobody would ever suspect yeah
adorable little kiddo with this and what
is this on your bet always got a smiley
face on the front that means no harm
alright so where is this again I've just
attracted it the folder the needs in
boot what am I copying Z image tech two
point six point two nine okay they need
to rename that yeah you put it in the
boot folder of the SD card at the root
okay and rename it colonel been alright
so what's what's next boot the zip it
off of the SD card that you've just
docked that stuff on exchanging my micro
sd's just like all these little caddies
yeah you're still be here is that we've
got Oh Don you know all right no work so
now what I just boot it up yep okay here
we go it's gonna flash and then you'll
unplug the SD so there's flashing new
kernel fairness backing up the original
Wi-Fi firmware all right so it's turned
off yes it turns off and then you want
to unplug the SD card and reboot the zip
it why our fingers crossed hopefully it
works oh hey oh yay okay you got the
Linux guy so well you got the little
fake linux guy that has the fake beak on
the open is epic oh sweet so that's it
worked so yeah I just hacked my zip it
so are we done now no we have a couple
more things now we need to back up the
firmware off of this little guy and onto
your computer Dora alright so i will pop
the SD card back into my computer
okay oh there's a bunch of files on here
now I see so copy the files that are
Auto flasher script backed up from the
card to our pc and gonna back up
everything there we go very small we're
mostly just confirmed concerned with two
different files one is called helper
underscored GSP i bin see that here what
else and the other one is the GSP I 86
86 86 86 I've been ok so i need to keep
those yeah the one that's called helper
underscore you want to change that one
to read GSP I 8686 underscore GSP I 8686
underscore what hlp been hlp depends
sweet alright so renamed now we're gonna
write our disk image sweet how do we do
that so you need to open fist disk right
and locate the SD card okay so the first
disc right gooey Oh does this zaire
interesant all SS in in deutsch um yeah
it's German okay deal kemah good thing
for you alright so what do we do now so
I see my C Drive arresting marriage that
all right my D Drive got it what are we
doing I click on the cart cart and
choose image Laden image Laden and then
oof nah boothman opening oh ok I got
I've got a you know what you are any
Hong go thank you so what do I do here
in the image of a land i log you want to
choose the 2gig debian image and click
ok ok and if it gives you any warnings
just click buy them we don't need to
worry so the Debian z2 disk image GG
image yeah let's see we don't
yes ok or open gym I've engine sounds
like a bort so okay click OK alright
it's like okay says warning much tunze d
disc nice looked much of the diverse I'm
been very sober uh mr. Rodman I think
it's saying me that if I click yes what
we're doing it can't be much of a disk
is uber and it will be underwritten and
written all right yes oh so this takes
about 10 minutes so if you want to
chillax and grab a beer or whatever you
need to do with a plan thanks you're
welcome I'm on water tonight so at this
point we've got it the phys disc right
it's flashing the image onto the SD card
right I still have our zippy here just
chillin yeah he's just hanging out being
all like absolute loader with nope
nothing to do so I'm assuming as soon as
this is done with all that crazy bite
writing I'll just go ahead and pop this
out pop them in here hopefully blew them
up yeah pretty much you'll be able to
fit him up and then get your wireless
software working okay well in that case
why don't we go play some super mario
brothers on the way we okay i'm rebecca
and oh we could think one of our awesome
sponsors well we wait for the flash
that's so awesome idea we're gonna thank
the United States Air Force for
sponsoring this awesome episode of hak5
you
alright so now we need to copy those two
drivers back onto the card alright and I
have a little bit of problem here with
the ext2 manager and windows and that's
probably why it should be done in Linux
but I found that if you just eject the
card pop it back in if you've installed
the wireless t2 driver for windows you
may have to reboot for it to take effect
but either way if I come in here to my D
Drive now I actually do see the bin boot
of all those fun happy linux folders so
you go into the lib firmware order right
from where and then you create Libertas
to as a new folder all right okay now
what and stick your to bin files in
there got it alright so my GSP i bin
files going in Libertas to okay now what
eject safely alright safely all right I
never eject safely erasure but you have
to for this apparently well it is
because we're using a weird file system
in Linux or in Windows Windows is like
what XD XD to it was all about so safely
remove hardware I'm like do I even
remember how to do that I know I don't
remember all right stop yeah we're done
with you okay great save reject my caddy
take out my microsd now boot the Zipit
from the SD card again alright I will go
ahead and pop this in here and then what
we just turn around yep boot it up and
it should ask you for a username and
password a login I hope up there we go
we have the strange-looking mammal haha
penguin wearing a beak or something I
know sir would it mean when pain was
half beaks oh yeah oh yeah it's like a
like a wallaby wearing a fake beak I
don't know what it is sweet oh we're
just prompted here debian gnu/linux
5.000% a ms rude of course we're gonna
use root cuz we're living in the
a wild side here and the password is
debian and then you'll need to issue a
command okay what do we need to do now
now you need to move the bin files from
the Libertas to folder over to Libertas
oh okay that's easy enough okay cd2
Libertas two LS yet there they are and
the star this is worse than a centro not
been it's better than this entry all
right dot dot oops too many dots dot dot
slash Libertas i think that'll do it uh
failed to preserve ownership operation
not permitted ah bracing are permitting
well we're already route let's copy him
CP startup in two dot dot let's just
copy them to the route to the directory
before cannot stats startup in well what
do we have in here then well now we have
nothing we had him before and then i
moved um and it give me some errors hang
on cd2 Libertas maybe it did move
it was just like throwing errors because
it wants to be a bitch hey look at that
just wanted to be a bitch ok ok cool so
got some errors but regardless the files
let me just do a clear and in LSL a
clear LS tak that's an underscore tak la
yeah there we go they're not like zero
byte files or anything ok huh then if
this was in Linux we could adjust their
anyway whatever we'll do it in windows
fun what do we know reboot it by putting
in the shop boot shutdown prompt ok so
tech age shut down tak H tell it to do
that now and then free you want to reset
it by hitting it with a paper clip ok I
don't have a paper clip but I do have
there's like solderless breadboard
dealies so I'll just coming down here to
the reset button
hey there we go all right reset so now I
need to get you on the Wi-Fi so you'll
need to boot up again all right powering
on waiting for the incredibly long boot
sequence and you'll login as root Debbie
and again sure I'm gonna pass WD and
change that as soon as I can yes that's
good idea yeah like those people that
jailbroke their iphones and didn't
change the root password changed my
password passwd numbers well they got
rickrolled did you read that yeah that's
awesome they put a picture of Elmo's
Area fans yeah I mean the dude could
have like totally RM or f2 like / and
just removed everything and everybody
know me kiddo that would have been
horrible all right once again I will log
in route debian sweet went out hey now
we're gonna connect to some sort of
unencrypted Wi-Fi all right we have an
unencrypted Wi-Fi here at the house that
we just use for the test networks and we
could do this with wpa but a little bit
more complicated so see the show notes
for that you'll put in I have config
mm-hmm space f1 up all right eighth one
is now up hmm and then I w config f1 not
space space what space essid space my
Wi-Fi well actually here in the back
house it's open oh yeah right whatever
the name of yours is sure okay now what
and then put in d h client space f1
hooray getting ourselves an IP address
I'm a little I got an IP version 4 dance
yeah okay whatever I should've danced no
I shouldn't ah should never dance in the
show no so I've got an IP what now okay
now we need to start x windows and you
all put in start X and then hit enter
okay so we've got it booted up into x
windows here and I'm in my little 320 x
240 display this obviously isn't running
like full KDE or no money it's fluxbox
okay it's very simple and it's it's easy
to use yeah I mean this is pretty
lightweight and it has to be on this
little tiny processor so how do i
actually use this okay so the little
happy face button it you'll hold that
down and you'll move around with thee
okay happy face button mm-hmm arrow keys
yes okay and then we can make and I'll
move your mouse around sweet and then
the stop button is your right click and
the center button in the center of the
little d-pad thing is your left click oh
I can open an oh yeah so go to go to the
desktop and then click on applications
okay go to terminals and applications
and then go down to michelle's terminals
same thing removed then go down to bash
alright great so we've got ahead we were
in bash we've started x we're now back
to bash that's fine and this is not made
for 320 240 i'm gonna right click here
and maximize this oh there we go and i
guess i have to right click on this
again to make it go away
alright so okay here we go I'm in X i'm
back in bash what do i do so now you can
type in apt-get install and then
whatever the program is for this example
we use pidgin right so apt tak get
install pidgin
alright and let's just wait a moment
again making sandwiches you're gonna
because it takes a while I'm so full
after this hack just do with a couple of
beers it'd be so excited at the end of
it I'm so it's just slow drinker oh my
gosh alright well Shannon babysits that
beer pigeon is installing okay so we've
got pigeon installed yes now let's go
ahead and start that bad boy up and
there we go you're very not optimized
for 320 but yeah we really Vidgen but no
I mean I can see how with a little bit
of customization we can set this up so
that the screens right and now we've
turned a forty-dollar device that was so
restrictive and only let you you know
talk on instant messengers into a
forty-dollar device that lets you do
everything a little old smartphone could
do so he can even pigeon pigeon and get
on the internets and we're hoping that
we can get like Twitter and IRC client
on here okay I think that would be
really cool and I'm thinking finding out
what the what the wireless chipsets all
about and see if we can do a little raw
frame injection a little packet sniffing
yeah you do your little I'm having tough
and I'll do my social networking stuff
okay well yes what we both have our own
okay well you way we've got a browser
we've got pigeon we've turned the device
that could only talk on IM sinn to a
device that you could talk on im's you
just need to you know login as root and
then start X and then open your shell
and apt-get install right sounds silly I
would why wouldn't it they just pack
packaged it like this to begin we should
have 16 year old girls would sell much
more yeah much more of them by putting
all this stuff on there but of course
they didn't which makes it more fun for
