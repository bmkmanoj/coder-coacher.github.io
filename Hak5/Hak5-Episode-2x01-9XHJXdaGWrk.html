I just don't think she's getting any
better I think you're right but I don't
know what else to do other than give her
time dude I'm as worried as your and I
just don't think we've given her so much
time I mean what do you want to do we've
got a deadline I know we've got a
deadline dude he's not the same without
her
because I'm pretty nuts Windows Mac and
Linux unite Digital DJs and hope
conference in New York City this time on
hack five
so here we are season 2 episode 1 hack 5
I am snow yes so good to be back
1 year anniversary and guess who's back
with us have you vacuumed glad you like
I see back in the south
well had this nice little corner for me
seriously I mean that's that was fun to
build
you said including not just her no but
we've got the monolith and then we've
got new graphics we've got oh no it's
the same table same table shiny we'll
replace the table like oh yes so uh as
always we're gonna have a lot of good
content for you this tower pack show oh
yes so without further ado let's jump
straight into the first segment which is
I did a little act with some windows and
some Linux and some 9,000 OSX
so let's put it all together take a look
roll it okay so here we are and we want
to showcase this Suite software dan was
talking about that would allow us to use
one Mouse and one keyboard for multiple
multiple machines excuse me what is it
Darren it's called synergy and as you
said you're right it's like it's the
software that will let you take a mouse
and a keyboard and rule them all with it
okay so first things first you know
obviously we use a lot of Windows but
you know there's people are used
open-source Mac users is it
cross-platform can we use this totally
cross-platform that's why we've got set
up here we've got a Windows machine we
have a Mac Mini courtesy of our camera
guy Paul yeah Paul of the camera view
and we've got your laptop here running
gen 2 right so and we've got them all
networked together on the same land and
using synergy we have a server running
on the Mac Mini mm-hmm it could be on
any of these but we've got it running on
the Mac media we've hit clients running
on the windows in the Gen 2 box and
those all communicate and using the
network we're able to emulate the
keyboard and mouse so that we only have
one set of one pair of keyboard mouse on
the desk and then three monitors so the
way that the software works is that on
the server you will tell it on this
machine we've pulled it that the Windows
machine is to the right of it and that
the Linux machine is to the left of it
so that when you move the mouse across
the left side of the screen it will come
in to the right
of the linux machine and vice-versa so
you can move your mouse you know across
as if it was one big extended desktop
and that way whatever your cursor is on
becomes the active machine that your
keyboard will accept input from okay
computer will accept the keyboard from
yes so I can you know I can just I can
work on this machine I can work on that
machine and right between my web server
my web developer my graphics editor
whatever we can get a lot of is this
perfect for multitaskers that are
running multiple operating systems in
fact ill you know I've got two Windows
machines on my desk and they work great
I've got my editing box and I've got my
development box and I'm going back and
forth and I'm doing one up see I've seen
the uber micro for that and they run at
different resolutions but the coolest
thing is it approximates because I have
three monitors that are all the same
exact same Bank size right no it
emulates where they should be okay so if
I if I'm running if I'm running 1024 by
768 in this monitor and I want to go to
the monitor on the right hand side this
way at 1280 by 1024 I can go through the
right hand corner out and I end up in
the left-hand corner and tough levia
obviously awesome fantastic now we're
talking about using one keyboard one
mouse for three different machines now
all of these machines have some kind of
login process Control Alt Delete you
know just regular user and whatever OSX
uses because I've never touched it you
know when I reboot will I be able to use
that same single mouse and keyboard to
login service machines sure
with Windows for the control tilly it's
actually control a pause okay and as
we're starting up I think what you're
asking is I do I still need a keyboard
and mouse attached to the other machines
besides the server right right and the
answer is no now I still keep a keyboard
attached to one of my machines because
it won't get past BIOS without a
keyboard unfortunately but you know it
gives the old keyboard air press f1 to
continue what I love or anything I think
yeah anyway no you don't need to have a
keyboard mouse attached to each machine
if they don't need it because you can
set up on Windows it as a service so
that it starts up on boot and it'll be
you know running when you get to the
login screen same thing with the Mac
there's three different ways to do it
that are illustrated on the website and
with X with Linux it's
next configuration okay so yeah if
you're like excellent not conversing
exactly okay so since we're running all
of this over the network is there any
kind of network security issues now
granted well this is all in the land so
I'm not worried about it you're not
gonna run it be running some kind of
packet sniffer on me and I wouldn't be
setting up three different laptops at a
you know out of Starbucks or something
and you know hoping that somebody's not
like listening to my packets I don't
think what they say in the website is
don't run this on an untrusted Network
because there is no authentication and
there is no encryption so if you're like
in a dorm environment and you're worried
you're a little paranoid about somebody
sniffing your keyboard mass traffic they
could actually do that however you can
use SSH to secure it just got to make
sure that you do SSH port forwarding and
I believe it's port 24800 right and you
know we've we've talked about port
forwarding and SSH before in previous
episodes and we'll have links in the
show notes to some other you know SSH
servers that will run on various
operating systems but yeah by default
the software is not secure I'm running
it here in the studio you know I know
everybody on this land now you're on the
land i'm on the land paul and so i mean
you're not sniffing my packets are you
no no never
thanks no just kidding okay seriously so
all right so synergy has proven to be
like a really really versatile really
good program it's like oh yeah it's
fantastic for jumping between machines
and that happened to code like like I do
right now I have to like roll my chair
around and go from keyboard to Mouse
whatever right our friend Rob had had
two sets of keyboard and mice on his
desk you know one that he'd pull under
oh yeah yeah yeah that's ridiculous well
you know it serves a purpose to an
extent but then there's just like well
just tie it all together yeah so I mean
so we've gone through all these three
machines now sir any other features that
you'd really like to highlight that are
just really really clear that would look
really good okay this is the one thing
that blew my mind you know as well as
the fact that it just works seamlessly
and beautifully it has a clipboard that
works between all three systems so if
you were in
chat on your gen 2 box and you wanted to
copy and paste something over to your
Mac machine you would just copy over
here coming over here paste it and it
will work you like you say like you're
watching in Photoshop and you're like
you got a webpage open on the Windows
machine you want to like paste it into
GIMP copy paste images text they work
seamlessly across platforms so instead
of like the clipboard is cross-platform
cross-network I can go from here to
there there to here here to anyway it
makes it so that these three machines
don't feel like three separate machines
it just feels like your working
environment doesn't matter whatever OS
it is so that is beautiful beautiful not
make sure that I install synergy or it's
obviously on my laptop now I'm after my
Windows box so I can go jump between the
two because I'm tired of having to jump
back exactly I mean if you're thinking
about making the change but you're
thinking about making the switch but you
can't you know really like like the Mac
Mini is a perfect example of a reason
why you want to use synergy is because
you know I love the Mac knee I've been
thinking about really getting Mac minis
either that of the MacBook but if I get
a Mac Mini I'm totally setting it up on
my land and I'm totally gonna be using
synergy so that I can slowly make the
transition right and slowly get into the
reality distortion field that is Mac but
anyway I am Steve Jobs and you will do
what I think okay so we can bounce back
and forth between the you know all
machines using the clipboard that
synergy has built in which is incredible
now what about like gaming you know FPS
shooters you're using your mouse you
going back and forth with the keyboard
you Geoff razy now what happens if I
smack the mouse too far you know I ran
to the same exact problem I was playing
on the hack 5ut server and hidden sprags
on but it wasn't really happen and when
I would go too far left I'd look a
little too far left on my screen but it
would actually come out of the machine
and go into the next machine that would
minimize yeah so I found out reading the
website that actually there's a
workaround for that and if you press
scroll lock whatever your mouse whatever
machine your mouse is currently all
inactive you think it locks you onto
that machine
Wow so if you're doing a gaming lock
yourself in with scroll lock in that way
you won't work if you're like really
involved in what are you working on like
I've done it before like you know you
get really involved you just start
slinging the mouse underwear yeah yeah
like you're in the zone now like one of
those stupid things it's they're stupid
and silly but I have fun with it is that
like my screen savers it'll actually
sync them all it's like all your screen
savers so that all three go on at the
same time and you can actually configure
I haven't done this myself but you
supposedly the website says that you can
figure it so that one login will login
to all three machines at once nice so
that's kind of a cool feature that I
haven't really delved into but they say
that it's available and I just feel like
somebody have to research or anything
right and the website is synergy to dot
sourceforge.net and it's licensed under
the GNU GPL okay so it is an open source
open source and we heart open source
here at open source so I do believe I'm
out of Courvoisier though this segment
can happen in here yes so let's go
through what Ally's doing because I've
got a mod coming up which is like cool
because I did some stuff but let's go
check out this month's trivia thank you
yes
the last trivia question was in what
province in what country can you find a
40 foot statue of Optimus Prime that was
quickly answered by Andy who wrote the
statue is in Yunnan Province China
jinx was kind of took him up at the $25
gift certificate singing it is very own
pack 5 trust you check the last t-shirt
enjoy a 40-foot statue of Optimus Prime
you can't go wrong with that I mean
seriously whenever they needed it for
I'm sure it served effects oh there's a
really interesting story and we should
post a link in the show notes it's an
adventure
oh yeah later later guys it's time for
this month's trivia ok so what is this
what is it this much trivia question is
what is the frequency of the commonly
used crystal that produces a mixture of
seventeen hundred and twenty two hundred
Hertz tones often used to defeat a CTS

enormous amounts of material enormous
amounts of material
okay so a few weeks ago one of our big
photo bulbs that powers the key lights
went out and made this awesome explosion
inside and I know what to do with it but
it looked really cool so I give the West
to say hey man come on I know you can do
something fun with this and you've done
some really fun stuff with LEDs so let's
take a little thing to work with
I'll okay so what we got here it's
basically it's a a photosensitive light
so when the lights go dim it comes on so
it's a geek nightlight basically awesome
and it also doubles as a really good
beginners project to getting into
electronics okay that's a great great
mantra episode one that's awesome you
guys I actually do plan on doing a lot
more electron stuff this is a good place
to start and basically what we're
looking at it's it looks more
complicated than what it is it's
actually a fairly simple circuit once
you get past the wiring diagram which
actually threw me for a loop real quick
mm-hmm
where'd you get inspired by this this
actually came off of a hardware hack
that I saw on both Instructables and I
hacked great websites if you haven't
been there oh yes a great great resource
to find projects people have come up
with and if you want to repeat them
yourselves but the original project was
a moles noise level well okay so we're
using a big photo bulb here but you
could also use bottle balls with some
Courvoisier everyone even these core
pottier whatever strikes your fancy
whatever you have on hand we just
decided to use this light bulb you know
just don't know but if you're working
with glass please exercise caution
especially if you're gonna cut open
light bulb like this one because you are
working with glass sharp edge and a back
engine all that comes in there the
vacuums have two big problems the actual
if you have to if you happen to break
the glass so yeah it's a very extreme
course yes to follow all shop safety as
always with any mod that you do yeah
it's safe okay so can you walk us
through how this thing works okay
basically what we have here is a 9-volt
battery right here and that's obviously
supplying power oh my goodness
and two resistors here one is a 100 K
ohm resistor and the other ones it's
like it's a 460 mm - Thunder crackling
okay eludes me at this moment that
they're both connected to the positive
line and the
lesser of the two resistors goes to the
LED and the LED goes to this NPN type
switching transistor right that's that's
really the brains of all this this is
what's making it work because we have
two electrical currents running here the
other 100 km resistor is connected to
our photo resistor on the back here okay
right there so that's what's giving it
the special sauce so that just we don't
see that the LED is shining right here
yeah because I getting oh but I expose
it to the light and the LED goes out
nice easy
so when the light goes out the LED goes
on oh yeah awesome and and the way these
little photo things work these Federer
sisters work is more like they have more
conductive they are okay so it's
stealing the electricity from the
battery then what's it's it's bypassing
the current going through the light so
we still have a continuous electrical
current so you know it's actually
working
but the light's not getting power cool
and then no might it stops being
conductive and then the LED gets the
power and you also seem to have built a
pretty spooky little kind of I don't
know it's got kind of an oriental feel
to it little enclosure for this bulb
here and so can we put this all together
and see what it looks like yeah and of
course you know if I were doing this you
know like in a permanent thing I would I
would tighten this all up right I just
need that sword would beg for a quick ya
breadboard definitely I just wanted to
make sure I could illustrate the
circuitry a little bit better so if this
shorts out well of course it's going to
sort out this is live television
of course okay yeah is it shorted oh I
got wires touching Oh God never mind it
actually decided to work how about them
okay so when the light goes out I see
that's oh oh that's so much fun
also yeah I never still like that I sell
now and get you film to go now if
somebody wants to build them their their
own at home where did you finish it and
the show notes that will happen the pack
five wiki will have links to the ball
the balls like on Instructables
on Instructables or I hang octopus looks
sweet okay now when we get back we're
gonna check out Lehman Lee he's here to
show us some really nifty digital DJ
stuff but first we're gonna head over to
Ali for this
LAN party last LAN party was
counter-strike source I'm walking
Warcraft fan myself but you know
whatever floats your boat this month
game is battlefield 2 you can sign up
and frag the boys on August 19th at hack
5 org slash LAN party but if you will be
cool you can show with me and Azeroth
and block chase no dude
all about all about the battlefield 2
seriously all about the FBI no no and
you know if it is want to get on the
team you want to get on the team with
the guy that can crash a helicopter 360
upside down yes big guns
you think you'd cut me be compensating
for something BFG kill each other for
last month's LAN party shoutouts for
last month LAN party missing intellect
missing intellect with the new cannon do
you no no no that was the z0z one rent
and one the run around with the
brilliant auto ashati there's like the
only man that could hit there's the only
thing he can hear it was just like
here's a oh come on guy
and we haven't played another strike
since what move alone please
okay so alright so I'm back right after
these messages and then with LML
here at the NSA protecting American
citizens is our top priority that's why
we're introducing NSA local long

it's time to put your mind at ease
America support this wonderful nation
and join today just pick up your phone
and say I want NSA
okay so we've got a special guest with
us here today on hack point five and
that's Lehman Lee a professional DJ from
ETA F M online radio hey Lehman how you
doing buddy how you been good good good
it's a pleasure to have you here the
last row to come down and so what we're
here to find out from you is how the DJ
spins in the digital age
and so I guess we'd like to have a
little background from you right now as
to how'd you get into DJ well what I
really started off with uh was just a
computer and I downloaded software
called retro turntable I'm not sure
anybody heard of that before but when it
was was - mp3 players and it give us a
little pitch control and that's all I
did
oh I didn't have anything I am i cannot
cue my thing I can kind of kill my vinyl
I can I can acute any metal I just play
two records well - OH - acts like the
one and then play the next exactly
everything it's everything is a train
wreck it was horrendous
oh yeah that's that's bad and cent you
have since then evolved from that
particular state that's correct and so
we've got some equipment in front of us
right now and what do we got
when we're looking what you're looking
at is two turntables and a microphone
yeah yeah and DJ mixer and a headphone
and yeah okay so so so what's what's the
special sauce I mean we're talking about
a DJ in the digital age so obviously
something's got to be digital what is it
it's this model right here look at that
that's it that's the digital part that
what you're looking at it's the time
coded digital vinyl and this side is ten
minutes and this side is 15 minutes long
okay so you're telling me that this
analog vinyl has been encoded digitally
yep and Ben timestamp mhm okay so I mean
and that's working in what kind of
package like what is the entire package
of the packages go something like this
well I think the whole Patrick contain
this scratch have this software right
here and two vinyls and LCD is a CD
player LCD and CD the CD right here see
you right there hanging all this ad
here let's take a look at that and this
CD is encoded digital time stamped yeah
just like the vinyl yep mm-hmm
okay and what what's this called here
this is called a Serato Scratch Live
this made by rain American DJ company
they did a lot of DJ mixers back in late
90s but they the first program solve our
hardware they did was this and it works
terrific doesn't work like how does this
all interface together and let you spin
how you want to spend
well what these timecode of I know right
here mm-hmm allows you to manipulate
vinyl with your computer
and so what's going on is that when you
play these my nose it's like a dial tone
or something like that and the signal
sent through right here to scratch amp
and the the using USB to connect to the
software and everything's real time when
anything you can do with a vinyl many if
you gonna do with the bino you can do
with this time code of I know here okay
and in system requirements for that or
512 megabytes of RAM minimal
requirements 1.5 gigahertz okay so the
standard we should want a better yeah
well obviously the more the better yeah
nothing like this yeah when you're
dealing with real-time audio encoding
yeah we're sampling yeah may you know
whatever it may be
mmm but as far as today's standards
we're talking about minimum system
requirements 512 1.5 gigahertz that's
that's not a lot when we're looking at P
fours at 3 gigahertz yeah I know so uh
so you know it so what you're saying is
it takes the mp3 and you would load it
in your deck and the software here and
then you have complete manipulation over
it on the vinyl here on the turntable
yep so you can scratch you can jog comfy
juggle you can do a turntable litigants
do all kinds of stuff in that that easy
choice yes now what kind of bitrate are
we looking at here like for your mp3s
I'd imagine the higher the better the
higher the better that heíd about 300 to
320 villa 444 kilobytes 44 kilohertz for
mp3 wise wave it will play anything
OGG wave AFF AIFF I think ok stay like
whatever you can whatever
audio format is it will it will play
anything nice I'm gonna start remix in
my podcasts actually it does it does I
think it does connect with your iTunes
library
getting me I'm not killing you Wow wow
that is a very very powerful piece of
software and a Hardware combo now did
you have like as far as like sound
quality digital versus analog what are
we looking at here I mean well let me
give you an honest truth I still think
vinyl like 3 or vinyl mm-hmm sounds
better than digital because what you get
is a lot of a lot of bass a lot of beats
and a lot of highs in this well the only
problem that these are very fragile we
you break them that's it it's done it's
time do we break one of these you can
just go store and buy another one all
your all your mp3s are locating this
hard drive you don't have to worry about
buying another vinyls like cause like
ten twenty dollars for imports and maybe
five seven five to seven dollars for
domestic you don't have to spend all
that money yeah but then that doesn't
sound like a lot right now when you're
talking about one vinyl but when you
have to walk around with three or four
milk crates with 30 vinyl apiece yeah
good set you can definitely spend a
cassette with a final but this has been
first of all then versus 30 okay when
you get way to get a 30 gig hard drive
that's like 10,000 mp3s for it's just
you know having to have 30 vinyl which
are only like one or two tracks a piece
a side B side yeah so yeah you
definitely have a much better sampling
there I know if anybody wants to find
any more information about you or where
you DJ or how you DJ where can they go
they can go to a triple W that DJ -
leave me leave nets and I spent on you t
FM every Thursday night
don't let the schedule there because you
know this is why does it go come August
fit right so yes yes it is this but but
you can check out your website they can
check out ETA and see when you're gonna
play neck everything gets out there so
it might change a little bit okay but as
of right now you spend on Thursday
nights right okay thank you so much
again it's been a pleasure
mm-hmm and so let's go ahead and hit up
Ally for this month's poll Ally what's
the poll so we're starting something new
this month we're starting a poll where
we go out we ask people student
questions and we see what they had to
say this month it was pirates and then
just a zombies who would you pick if it
came down to a fight we went around
calling ones burg to find our answers
check out
zombies or ninjas pirates pirates
I'll take pirates yeah the last zombie I
saw was like an scooby-doo's
ninjas pirate zombie ninjas what I'm
just pretty good to them zombies yeah
what do you think zombie pirates yes
because the eyepatch
no because of Blackbeard I would have to
say zombies zombies because they're
already dead they can't really get hurt
it really is it gets me every time
so pirates yeah what's up with that man
seriously you know just because the
movie came out that's all I mean to me
it's like a ninja dude totally the ninja
because you can ask I'm all about
zombies man I have a good point about
the monkey we're not remembering that
zombies can get shot in the head by the
pirate and then they're dead yeah but
this is nothing been in sleep behind us
and just like the cappuccino and one go
well the news can use is like little
throwing star or can he can like cut
open the Pirates spleen and he can go
are my spleen you know okay we're
obviously all right but we would love to
hear what you guys have to say we will
be back right after this message
remember to take the poll on hak5 organ
no I pick Chuck Norris
hello my name is Duke and I'm a hack 25
minutes
I've got only one problem at least I've
got a terrible memory
and I always forget the date today
release with was it seven for the months
before time I tried everything but then
I find the solution I can spark a
subscription it gives me my multi dose
of Technology
every month on time so I'll never have
to miss another episode of my favorite
show hack point four okay so we're back
here at hack five and we visited the
hope conference in New York City hope
hackers on planet earth put on by 2600
it's kind of like you know security
conference little like DEFCON a lot like
New York a lot like New York a little
more lana sh hey you know it's the only
place that I know of that you can get a
little tipsy and get on the Segway they
love segways I want one and we ran into
Harrison there Harrison from sploit
person had a hacker conference imagine
that so we had a couple of questions for
him so let's take a look at that so our
hope and guess who we found it turns out
that Harrison kind of likes the hacking
stuff too so Harrison what are you doing
a hackers on planet earth it's actually
it's actually kind of a funny story this
is pretty much like a vacation for me
because I've been spending my whole
summer working in Indianapolis and my
girlfriend one of the good in New York I
was like well conveniently enough I
could find something to do in New York
this weekend but but your girlfriend
from what I understand is a hacker too
right uh it's not I mean I think she
probably wouldn't really like me calling
her hacker but uh I mean she's
definitely knows her way around a
computer suite so so what have you been
keeping yourself busy with um well
pretty much the whole summer I've been
I've been working and now split cast has
a release schedule oh my god a release
schedule
Faina so don't tell me the sixth of the
month knowing that the seventh
no actually it's every two weeks all
you're really insane on on a Sunday
whatever it's Sunday okay cool so that's
keeping me well actually I didn't really
take up too much time so it's not really
keep me busy mainly work work and work
and people don't care about your work
they want to see sploit cast yeah so
what's going on with that what do you
have lined up um well we got a lot of
guests coming on actually just I've been
carrying around Johnny's book for those
of you who don't know Johnny long Google
hacking good stuff yeah he's gonna be on
the show soon I don't really know
exactly when but he and I have been
shooting e-mails back and forth so I
decided to pick up this book while I was
here and and reread it so that I'm
familiar with it and you were saying
something earlier about about some pills
the blue pill yeah we're not talking
about the matrix though no no I actually
the termite had come she might have
taken it from from the matrix there's a
lady who's been doing research into 100%
undetectable malware so she claims based
on the new you know architectures of
like the processors that AMD is coming
out with which allow for better
virtualization so basically her idea was
to kind of put a hypervisor in between
the processor and the operating system
and so there's malware acts it's
basically another layer of abstraction
so malware sits between the processor
and the operating system and if you you
know if you've used a virtual machine
before you know that it's very difficult
for the virtual machine to detect the
host operating system right say it like
installing VMware on top of VMware on
top of VMware that's always fun to do so
I mean the idea here is that your
operating system is basically being
virtualized by by malware as a scary
thought man yeah and that wouldn't be
detectable by like normal means but you
don't think it's foolproof do you well
I've been talking actually a good friend
of mine
Lance James who's done a lot of work
with phishing and Malware who will be
speaking here tomorrow unfortunately I
got to catch a flight tomorrow morning
so I won't be able to see it but on the
same subject lance and I were talking
earlier about this and
as he mentioned you know malware doesn't
just doesn't just sit there
it does something you know so it can
collect all the data it wants but it's
got to send it somewhere right so he
thinks that you know you might not be
able to detect the malware on the
machine well or it would be very
difficult to do so but you can catch it
when it's like you know it's got an FTP
all this data somewhere so that your
criminals can you know use what they're
trying to capture from you right right
so with some smart packet sniffing you'd
be able to kind of I mean I don't I
don't know if you you would call it
smart packet sniffing I mean it would be
like very sophisticated packet sniffing
there has to be some way to actually I
mean I really don't know yeah this is
all just theory at this point we're just
now so well thanks for uh take some time
chat with us and enjoy the rest of the
con
so ran into Harrison at a hacker gong
that's always fun I'm really really
looking forward to the sploit cast every
two weeks that's gonna be great enjoy
his stuff yeah definitely if you haven't
checked it out head over splake ascom he
does a really great podcast and he's a
hack five alumni yes so we're excited to
say he's doing well with him definitely
also I was able to run into Jason Davis
hook up right probably the best panel
discussion at hope I gotta say out of
all the stuff that was really the best
thing for me I was really looking for
the quanta looking forward to the
quantum cryptography but that got
cancelled kept Mitnick got cancelled and
then the privacy is dead the guy got
arrested right before then that's
awesome yeah no privacy for him and
actually I think my my personal favor I
mean md5 panel was pretty good but uh oh
it's really good but I also liked
hearing filter own fake yeah that was
good - it was great but let's head over
to let's take a look at md5 look up with
Jason Davis roll that beautiful footage
so I'm joined here by Jason Davis who's
just finished a panel on password
cracking and time memory trade-off and
you're working for the site what is this
md5 look up look up calm yeah oh so can
you tell me a little bit about to
somebody that's not familiar with time
memory trade-off you know the basic
example we're all kind of familiar our
audiences with password cracking but how
this differs from yours
brute force and dictionary attacks with
time memory trade off compared to brute
forcing brute forcing you have to go
ahead and you have to compute every
combination for your certain key space
every single time which is sort of
ridiculous because if you do on one
three password it's going to take you
forever and then if you do that on one
password you have to do that for all
your passwords so why not just generate
them all but store them in the memory
the first time and then make it quick
recall all the other times
that's what timer trade-off is applied
to password cracking basic now I think a
lot of people are also familiar with the
popular rainbowcrack software or rainbow
tables and from your panel I understand
that what you're doing is similar yet a
lot different so can you tell me what
those differences are rainbow tables use
rainbow mathematics which is basically
pattern or interval oriented now when
you do that you lose accuracy so that's
why rainbow tables have nineteen seven
point three ninety eight point nine and
when you really get into the ninety-nine
point nine nine nine percentage the
tables increased drastically that's
because they have to generate all those
intervals all those patterns tell the
other thing in in hash databasing which
is what I do basically you generate all
combinations and you store them and
there is no pattern oriented anything
like that for whatever character set you
generated for you're gonna have a
hundred percent accuracy for that
character set but at the expense of disk
space yeah but as I said in the panel
we're definitely working on that we've
got a lot of new techniques that are
coming up I had some people did mention
some stuff to me you know and they're me
emailing me and hopefully I can work out
some more stuff to help reduce that
because right now we're relatively
competitive with the same size as
rainbow tables but I'm hoping that we
can we can beat that you know and
definitely definitely push the envelope
when it comes to long so so what kind of
what kind of tricks and you know ways
are using to reduce the size of the
current tables what's your technique
right now generally speaking what you do
is you store you store your text in your
hash well if your hash is 32 there are
32 characters which is 16 bytes you know
text is 4 you know you're gonna have 20
bytes there well what we do is we take
the hash and we cut it down and we see
our see it and then that cuts it down to
about 6
six characters which is about three
bytes and then you store your clear text
with that you see or see that as well
and what happens is you're gonna run
into a bunch of collisions and then you
group those so you not only reduce the
rows but you shrink the size and
everything it's basically like a really
pimp way to use CRC's as a compression
mechanism so yeah and anybody can try
this at home they can just go to md5
lookup comm and punch in a hash yeah I
have a ton of the research online that
explains everything in more elaborate
motion than you know what I did with the
panel but yeah they can they can use the
the regular single search online right
now and then eventually I'm gonna have
the the multi engine which can you just
put in a list of hashes and it'll just
crack them all and give you an output on
it so and when you did your
demonstration it was really amazing to
see that even when you would give it you
know five or more hashes it was able to
compute though as a matter of seconds so
what is it on the back end that's making
it still optimized basically the one of
the problems with well it's not really
problem but rainbow tables uses flat
files and you can't you can't really
build a web interface for flat files so
what we did was I put all of it into a
real my sequel database and we indexed
the whole thing and then I mean the
index is large but it allows us to break
passwords and literally from that
database server we can break them in
point twenty of a second so that's
that's one of the things that work
database and that flat file and it's
it's web oriented so a lot of the
overhead just flat out isn't there so
what kind of issues have you had with
storage the original database was wasn't
too huge room so like I had one by two
160 gig drives now we we basically the
limitations I'm up to one point 8
terabytes now and you know I'm already
like at one point five of that full so I
definitely in order to add more
characters to the database make it more
effective statistically you have to have
more space so right now I'm just looking
into funding for new hard drives just
you know new compressions that type of
thing and it's all research and we're
just feeling it out working out you know
whatever comes comes so you were talking
about characters what kind of character
space have you been able to put in
you're in
right now our new one which is 1.5 will
break one through five everything all
255 printable six and seven alphanumeric
eight alpha lower and zero through ten
length numbers what's what's the
eventual goal the eight everything eight
everything would be cool because then
we'll will literally hit about seventy
to eighty percent of all passwords on
the planet and you have any idea as to
what the size of that might be 14
terabytes Wow 14 terabytes so now you're
just doing this on your own or is this
for a company this is I basically have
separated myself for my company for this
one I'm self-employed and it's been it's
been funded on my own pocket and
everything right now I've done
everything myself and I've had a couple
people having me with testing
programming stuff like that well we
definitely understand how that is here
at hack 5 so is there ways that people
can support the project maybe even yeah
can they submit their own hashes or or
values anything like that or I mean they
could eventually when I when I put the
new one online I'm gonna see if maybe if
I can start taking donations because
then I can start building another server
with a better database and since I'm not
a big fan of charging for the service
you know I'd rather just have people you
know okay cool I use this I do 300 a day
you know I'll give them 10 bucks or
whatever so I might look into something
like that but you know other than that
it's just gonna be self-sustained right
and you also said in the panel that
you're a fan of open source so that
you're you're giving up the source code
for this so anybody can do this
themselves everything right now is
currently just open source so you can go
to the website download the utils the
only problem is that I haven't thrown a
lot a lot of documentation and with it
there's basically just some key notes
inside the utils what source code
without documentation yeah well it's it
was sort of thrown together you know
because I'm not exactly a c-plus
programmer I had to basically relearn it
force myself to do it and you know I
didn't really want to put it up there
because it's not exactly 100% stable you
know so it still needs critiquing and
with the next release once I'm done with
the new database probably in about a
month or so I'm going to throw up the
new utilities which are a lot more
stable and
than the new one will be a lie itself
and then anybody can make these at home
but what kind of aside from the storage
requirements what kind of CPU time does
it take to generate these databases
because it's written in real see it's it
basically takes five days to run through
the process and I do it I did it in five
runs so you're looking at about 25 days
for the one that I'm building now so 1.5
terabytes in under 30 days it's pretty
good that's amazing considering it's
only going to take a second to crack the
password out to that I'm willingly gonna
give up 1.5 terabytes in 25 days it
basically just I'm a server that would
be idling anyways to be able to
proactively audit anything I want say
and right now it's just md5 right yeah I
had a few questions about that and the
algorithm can be easily adopted in the
sources right now all it does is include
the md5 headers and run the basically
the md5 function you can change it to
whatever you want
because the way that the compression is
set up now it's crc oriented not
algorithm dependant so okay and as you
see this evolve where do you uh where do
you see md5 lookup going in the next
year I'm gonna finish the new database
in about a month I'm gonna leave that
online for about a year and if I have
the funding to move up the character set
to the next one then that's where I'm
gonna go and it's free for anybody to
use now that obviously must put a lot of
burden on the server on the back end so
is that something that may change or or
are you running into problems with you
know load on the server
um digg.com which is a popular like
bookmarking site we got hit on there and
that basically broke my server so I'm
definitely gonna split it up have a
database server and then two web servers
and but that's an eventualities come
around so that's I yeah definitely
because if we got slashed at it I
wouldn't be up for a week so okay and so
that means be nice guys so where can
they find any more information about
your research and then try it out
themselves everything is on the site and
there's a lot of research out there
right now on just basic timer trade-off
people that are they're taking the ideas
and that's what I want people to take
the ideas turn them into whatever they
want I want to see better versions of
what I've done and you know I really
think timer trade-off is the way to go
with password cracking now because
storage is so abundant why not you know
it just totally beats the pants off of
brute-forcing so great especially with
you know hard drives is cheap today I
need to say so well thank you so much
for taking some time to talk to us and
we'll be checking in and and seeing how
you're doing all right so this just
about wraps it up for season 2 episode 1
a big I feel so good to get this done
feels great to be back and of course we
got a lot of fun stuff to cover before
we get out of here of course first and
foremost is that a pod zinger teamed up
with the guys the pod zinger you may
remember them from episode with 7 or 8
we had an interview yeah good stuff and
they have actually decided to be the
sole search engine for hack 5 content on
the website and meaning you can will be
a little search bar at the top of the
website and you can type in a search a
text search for a specific thing and
it'll actually go through all of our
content and single out the segments in
the episode that we spoke about that
it's really neat stuff so give that a
try check that out also very excited we
just released the DVD the best of season
1 yes and it's a free DVD you can get on
BitTorrent head over to hack 5 org grab
a copy burn as many as you want given
all your friends its Creative Commons
and it's our six favorite sketches a
whole bunch of segments and some it's a
lot of Easter eggs and you know what
else we have on that some extra features
behind the set on the scenes cast in
there because it's fun stuff like that
so this is a bunch of tools yeah but we
can't do anything about that
fortunately yeah anyway oh you know what
the survey
yes this is a very very good way for all
of you to help us out doesn't cost you
any money so hey that's good for you but
we need this so if you could please go
to the website take the survey fill it
out and also you know you can add in
where you first heard of us how you got
turned on to us what was your first
computer without your technical yeah
whatever whatever your Technol us to
maybe let us know and if you're looking
to support us with money and you're
looking for you know web hosting we got
to thank our awesome web hosts to
dreamhost we head over to dreamhost.com
when you check out with coupon code hak5
because there's no point in hack five
you get twenty five dollars off yours
and that helps us and they are an
awesome web host with you know terabyte
of transfer and they're divided so that
great great stuff also shownotes have
moved to the wiki yes we thought they'd
be a little bit better there I mean we
have a wonderfully active community on
the forms so we thought you know just to
lighten the load a little bit we'll put
the show notes on the hak5 wiki and in
addition to that we also have
supplemental materials so you know the
longer edition of the interview with
Harrison as well as some other stuff
from hope and stuff that didn't fit into
the episode we've got you know the uncut
version of that yeah up on the material
now before we go it's kind of been a
hack five tradition at least with season
one that at the end of the episode for
some reason I get hurt and I'm not
really sure why that is so starting with
season two we're gonna try to change
that up a bit
and we just received the package a few
days ago from our good friend in the UK
melodic thank you so much for sending
this in this is a gift from a lot of the
UK oh is it
Wes has no clue what seriously fun if
you're not getting hurt what that makes
my day
Wes you've been tea-bagged you know
melodic this is for you in polish I know
I'm not bright and cheerful know we're
gonna tell everybody to keep watching
hak5 spread the word
he's Darren I'm Wes everybody reminding
you to try to take no less
I got Oh
right a business
I stole your oh my hat 5 season 2
episode 1 hearin 5 would be 0.5 feet
there's no point in height 5 remember so
an octave through them that's for sure
alright okay you settle in to do 72 and
I should be like a little your little
thing going on over there yeah you can't
have it all I don't think it's gonna be
that comes with your full arm boss again
starting over so I know season two three
two one about that time
okay we got it I got it I always started
yeah Dan's all like let me own this on
pro watching breaking bone again okay
but we're gonna need three food to human
statues in Yunnan Province Canada and
Canada China
thank you find a Canada man I get those
confused I know it's cool layouts all
competitive rates and Sukie man Libya
sister ba ba-da-da Enya Vice necktie
inspector I'm fishing boy to a beretta
