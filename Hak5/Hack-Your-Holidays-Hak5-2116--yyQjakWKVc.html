bloopers this time on hack 5 hello and
welcome to act 5 my name is darren
kitchen my name is Jana Moyes it's your
weekly dose of techno loss hack your
holidays indeed this is coming out a few
days before Christmas so we decided to
decorate with a gigantic Christmas tree
that is so tall that it's going off of
the actual camera we need a bigger
studio but it looks good though yeah it
does and you know as is tradition we are
doing our annual blooper reel for the
first time ever except for that one time
when we turn 10 yeah in August of last
year yeah yeah except for that one the
first annual one I like this idea you
know it's never too late to start
traditions Chanin 95 is 11 years old and
I think a really good tradition that we
should start this year is decorating the
Christmas tree mmm so this was a concept
that I had years ago and I'm so happy to
finally execute on this and guess what
we want to get you in on it too because
we are building our very own dr. Cohn
badge Christmas tree con veg Christmas
we have been to a lot of conferences
Shannon I know like like a lot I've got
a VGA Ken and I got a VGA cable stuck to
mine no seriously like this is supposed
to go to the computers here you know
we'll fix it all right now there are so
many of these and you know what they
should be displayed I agree
so let's put them up on the tree okay
let's do it all right so we'll be back
after the word from ourselves bloopers
and then we'll do sponsor break and then
we'll deck the halls I don't know why I
did that like obi-wan Kenobi like these
are not the VPNs you're looking for oh
this is my first smoke on press badge
they didn't have press badges so they
made me write press on it and it's a
bottle top opener from shmoocon 2007

and there's all these people like
checking badges and doing registration
