how to construct your own home arcade
cabinet so as promised this month I'm
going to bring you how to set up your
hardware and software so while we go
ahead and turn this bad boy around and
crack it open okay so now that we've got
the case all opened up in the hardware
laid out let's go ahead and start off
with the core of this whole thing and
that's a seller on four hundred with
passive cooling the passive cooling
saves our space with the lack of a fan
and for that same reason that keeps the
noise down next we have a Rage 128 Pro
integrated and between the two we have
more than enough system resources to do
what we want to do now over here we've
got an IBM seven gig mounted and that's
plenty of storage space IDE cable now it
would be rounded but some jackass keeps
interrupting me when I try to make them
oh excuse me
over here our controllers plug into a
USB hub and over here to the USB ports
the other ports being used by our USB
powered speakers because no cab would be
complete if you didn't have sound we
have a 90 watt power supply plug
powering the whole thing and over here
both our monitor and power supply are
plugged in plugged into a power strip
excuse me which comes out through a hole
in the back so we only have one cord
hanging out let's go ahead and turn it
around and check out the software end
okay so now we're all booted in and
we're running main 32 is our front end
for our main emulator now granted front
ends for me more like distributions for
Linux there's a ton of different kinds
so just pick the type that best suits
you what we like about MAME 32 is that
there's an option that we can scroll
through the games with the joysticks
instead of having to use a keyboard now
one joystick will do single selection
one up one down the other joystick will
do an entire page so like I said we're
running main 32s our front-end and
Windows XP is the operating system and
it just it runs very smoothly no
problems all you have to do is select a
game you want to play what's what's a
good one Darin yes go up one just page
up one yeah all right so we'll load up
that one
okay so as always links for all the
pertinent information will be in the
show notes so other than that it's time
for me to get my arcade micro on y'all
take it easy come on Darren get owned
please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
