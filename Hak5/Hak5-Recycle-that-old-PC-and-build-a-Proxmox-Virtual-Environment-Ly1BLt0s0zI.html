beauty and build a proxmox home
virtualization server all that more this
time on hack five this episode of hack
five is brought to you by nokia in the
calling all innovators contest go to
assist express support smarter with go
to assist Express and domain comm got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain calm hello and welcome to
hack 5 my name is darren kitchen and
this is your weekly dose of technical s
we've got a great show for you guys this
week Jason Applebaum is going to be
joining us to wrap up the series on
programming with a Q SDK and I'm playing
with some virtualization because I've
got an old computer and I need to give
it new life and you know I bet you do
like in your closet or under your bed or
wherever it may be
dude just because it's only a dual-core
I know right only a dual-core give it
some new life let's go ahead and talk
about virtualizing and putting together
a home virtual server much like we did
at the end of season 9 with the wall
mounted guy here we're actually putting
together a new one that one was based
off of Suns VirtualBox and this one I'm
having a lot of fun with a piece of
technology has put together to make
virtualization easy for the enterprise
it's called proxmox ve and I just
thought that we would just go ahead and
dive right in into a block because hey
why not man I mean this is this is
actually my old editing rig and I'm so
happy to be bringing some new life to it
because we have this really cool project
slated for season 9 that I think you
guys are really going to enjoy because
we're going to get you involved in it
includes this so it's going to be very
very cool but I've been getting actually
a couple emails regarding virtualization
basically saying what is virtualization
and all right well let's just run
through real quick before we get our
hands dirty in this great little Linux
distro but basically virtualization is
is having something virtually rather
than a physical version of it so you
know something such as a server or
something such as a router that you
would think of as a
physical device you can go ahead and
emulate with software think of physical
machines and virtual machines like a
kitten and a Tamagotchi
you know both can be Pat and fed and
purr but only one of them can scratch
your face off it now right Kirby now why
virtualized well there's there's
actually a bunch of reasons I mean first
of all you get to actually increase your
hardware utilization I mean most what's
the time a server sitting there say like
it's a mail server and it's just waiting
for somebody to check their email so
they can do something or somebody to
send them an email so it can yeah and if
you if you know if you administer a
Windows server hit ctrl shift escape go
over to the process tab and watch that I
set that CPU just sit there in idle
right well you're wasting your your CPU
if it's not doing anything it's probably
getting really bored and that's how
Skynet is born or something like that so
go ahead and get the most out of your
you know your xeon or your quad core or
whatever it may be also space and
electricity you know you may not have
like a ton of room in your server rack
and you need to deploy new servers hey
there you go if you've got a to you box
that can do double duty why not and you
know as long as you can say some
electricity save the planet
captain hero style and and there we go
right but to be honest the thing that i
love the most is just the ability to do
backups and load balancing and migration
and that is to say hey i want to backup
my server not i want to backup all of
the male data no forget that dude back
up the entire server make a clone of it
what if you could just like shoot a ray
gun at your like mail server and boom
there'd be a second copy of it in case
something went wrong right yeah yeah
because restoring MTA stacks and stuff
like that it's not fun got to rebuild a
box and then import your stuff and
configure all the doodads assisted
minspeak therefore yeah but now a load
balancing is really great because for
example with the product that we're
talking about today this free and
open-source product we can actually do
live migrations and that is to say we
can have a machine a virtual machine
running on one box and we can push it
over to another physical box running the
same software
Anna you know move around our our toys
if you will into the different toy boxes
and see how they fit the best you know
and I you know this is something that
you may be like well but I don't I'm not
a systems administrator I don't you know
run a data center or anything like that
but dude you're a geek and you know I
don't care if you're you know bedroom is
a NOC where you've just got a laptop
it's a great way to you know build a
home server or even on your desktop just
to play with some virtualization because
it's a perfect way to experiment with
new servers when I got started doing
this stuff I was getting the cheapest
hardware I could from the you know local
gosh do you guys remember computer shows
where you'd like go to the Exhibition
Center and there would be all these
vendors set up and stuff and anyway
spent a lot of time when I was young
buying used old hardware putting
together machines and networking them so
that I could just learn networking so
that I could you know learn how to build
all this stuff which you know led into a
better career path and good stuff so you
know have fun with that also
dude exploits having fun with you know
fun little tools like you know nmap and
Metasploit why not build yourself a
virtual network because then you can
just like have all the packages ask
you're fun you want because even the
network even the switch is virtualized
it's all happening inside the computer
how great is that so yeah I mean that
that guy is actually running a copy of
the latest backtrack I got a couple of
boon to machines on there and then a
couple of Windows machines which are fun
to throw attacks at and you know so also
running you know we've talked about home
media services and ways that you can you
know get get your likes mp3 streaming to
your cell phone or whatever it may be
you know there's no reason to dedicate
hardware for that so you know I think
that it's a great way you know if you've
got a home network you and you're
thinking about our I've already got you
know network attached storage and a
banging like untangle or pfSense or mono
wall or smooth wall router going on
maybe you might want to consider you
know playing with some new distros and
stuff on side of the inside of a virtual
home server at least that's the way I
think about it so we're going to be
using the product proxmox ve and
it's it's just a really kick-ass
virtualization suite that that some of
you guys actually turned me on to and
I've been having a lot of fun playing
with it it differs a lot from like when
we put together the Ubuntu machine
running a VirtualBox
this is really meant to be for you know
small businesses enterprises to be able
to deploy very very quickly and also to
deploy applications very quickly because
they have like like everyone has an app
store these days they have one of those
if you will a virtual appliance
marketplace where you can go and just be
like oh hey mailserver that sounds great
and click and then download straight to
the box and boom you've got a mail
server
you know just config away forward some
MX records via the DNS episode that was
a lot of acronyms but hey you know it
makes it really easy to go ahead and get
started and play with all those you know
fun technologies without having to spend
a lot of time doing installations and
all the Mucky work so that's why I'm
playing with it and I think that it's
neat that it actually supports two
different types of virtualization so I
should preface this by saying that it is
built on a foundation of Linux it's
actually based on Debian lennie it's
it's for 64-bit machines and and it
supports both openvz
and KVM so what's what are those two
openvz is container virtualization and
what that means is its OS level it's
based on the Linux kernel and it creates
these isolated zones or containers if
you will you may have seen like terms
like VPS or Virtual Private servers or
ve for virtual environments that's what
those are the trick here though is that
both your host and your guest operating
systems the OP the computers that are
going to be running inside of this
machine need to be Linux so it's great
for that though because your performance
in that case gets really close to what
it would be natively on that hardware so
while this is a a debian box now running
this proxmox ve software when i throw
like an ubuntu machine on there where i
could throw an arch linux if i wanted to
be krad ultra elite sorry gen - just
saying there you go get like near the
barre met
performance that I would if I would just
to put that operating system on solely
but you're not limited to just running
Linux on this Linux box I mean like we
talked about with putting together you
know a test network for you know testing
out hacks and stuff right well you're
going to need a couple of Windows boxes
because what else I mean that's like the
most fun to pop right so for that we're
going to need full virtualization which
is where KVM comes in and I'm not
talking about keyboard and video and
Mouse I'm actually talking about kernel
kernel carnivàle carnaval deportable
anyway kernel-based virtual machines and
in kernel-based virtual machines is just
another way to do virtualization that
that in this case is going to allow you
to run not just Linux but you know any
operating system whether it be you know
Windows XP when a server seven Vista or
no why I would do that but but the cool
thing about KVM is that it supports the
Intel VT technology or the AMD V
technology and that's some really good
stuff it's actually these extensions in
the in your CPU that allow the
virtualization tax it happen more
efficiently and it you know like I said
a lot of different variety of operating
systems I mean hell you can plot throw
OS 10 on there if you I guess if you had
a legit copy of OS 10 and one it's kind
of week round but the thing is this is
you know proxmox ve it is going to
require a bit of a machine right so
let's just go ahead and talk about the
hard way here I'm recycling this box I
get so many questions about the hardware
that I use so we'll touch on that later
in the show but suffice it to say if
you're looking to like like if you're
enticed already and you're thinking
about that machine that's like sitting
under your bed want to bring some new
life into it I got to say this product
is going to require that it's going to
be a 64-bit Intel or AMD machine with
Intel VT or AMD v that is to say if you
want to use KVM if you don't there's an
unofficial way that you can do it on a
32-bit machine and just use the openvz
technology which will allow you to
virtualize
all the Linux machines you want but
really for the best way to go you do
want to have a 64-bit machine so this
may not be great for that 486 in the
closet right
in fact donate that somewhere some
thought I don't know I don't even know
to do with 40 seconds I think at this
point the power requirements outweigh
the usefulness but a machine like this
is perfect for it's my old editing
machine right before switch to i7 so you
know that that's got that taken care of
you would like to have at least a gig of
ram preferably four or more and you
would like either a well obviously
you'll need a hard drive or you know a
raid array which is always fun because
that's that's what these guys are for
you can see that but these enclosures oh
yeah that's right we talked about the
enclosures last week I was a kind of a
strange a block last week we're not
going to get too much into that but I'm
feeling a lot better let's put it that
way so so you only either need a raid or
a hard drive and you're going to need
one or more network cards right and
basically any hardware that's supported
by Debian lennie 64-bit is really going
to work so you know if you go over to
their wiki they actually have some links
if you don't feel like you know
scratching around a machine and making
sure that the hardware is compatible and
stuff it's actually a couple of machines
I think ones from like HP or Dell or
something that you can just go ahead and
buy so you know hey I say go ahead and
have some fun with this I walk you
through the install but here's the thing
that is what this product is really kind
of famous for if you will because it you
know while you could install on top of
Debian Lenny it's so much easier to just
go ahead download the ISO burn it to a
CD boot off of it and I got to tell you
from there it's maybe eight keystrokes
you got to hit enter and then type in a
username and a password it create as
long as your network cables plugged in
and ste hcp it'll already get an address
I mean I prefer you to static it but you
know what else is there yeah you got to
tell at your timezone I know it's so
difficult so you know forget walking
through the install in fact I already
got that going on so I advise you to go
ahead
over to proxy max comm check it out and
when we get back I'm going to be walking
you through the interface how to
actually do some fun stuff with it let's
set up some virtual machines but I know
we're already a little long and we
probably you guys I know that you're
probably dying to find out what's going
on with trivia Shanon somewhere new now
and my hands are going everywhere so
we'll be right back yeah last week's
trivia question was with over five
thousand three and commercial plugins
this open source content management
system was forked from Mambo in August
of 2005 and the answer was Joomla this
week the trivia question is an Tron

want a chance to win a new phone how
about a quarter million dollars naki and
18t have launched the ten million
dollars calling all innovators North
America contest challenging app
developers and game developers to create
the next level of apps for consumers in
the US and Canada for the Nokia n8 and
Ovie Store using the new Nokia Cube SDK
the contest will have two phases and
winners will be selected by app
performance in the August or by a panel
of judges winners will receive Nike
devices cash prizes up to a quarter
million dollars and even potentially
inclusion in a 1.9 million dollar
marketing campaign for their app so over
the next few weeks we're going to be
doing a rundown of how to get started
using the Nokia q SDK the ins and outs
if you will with our old friend Jason
Applebaum and this week it's a little
bit more on building our time-lapse
camera application so over the last few
weeks we've been showing you how to
create your first cute application for
the Symbian platform we've gone over how
to get your IDE set up I've gone over
how do you you know really get your
first layout set up and we've wrapped it
up with you how to include some really
advanced beta functionality well you
know now that you've gone about
developing your application you got to
distribute it so I'm going to show you
how to package your application with the
Ovie's store it's really really simple
all you need to do is open up from your
Start menu it's the cute Symbian command
prompt it's under cute cute creator and
then Symbian per command prompt really
simple all you need to do is navigate to
you need to navigate to the directory of
your application that as soon as you
clean your directory you're going to run
Q make all right now at Q make is run
it's gone and built out of everything
out so that you know once you clean it
out it basically cleans out all your
profile settings so the Q make runs on
your profile to build out the actual
cute cute project file so then what
you're going to do to build the project
it's just make release GCC e
and that'll go through building your sis
file this will take a minute okay it's
all done let's check it out
there's the sis file all done ready to
go for the ovie store you can either
sign it yourself through certs that you
can get through the O V store by being a
registered developer or publisher
registering costs $1 at publisher Ovi
comm it's really simple process and it
allows you to go through and select you
know I'm going to create a cute
application and it allows you to submit
screenshots and all those sort of things
to get your stuff recognized to get it
published on the store it's also a
revenue stream so you can get paid for
your application you create but if
you're not going to go the Ovi route and
you're just going to distribute it
yourself and you wanted to be able to be
public to put on other phones need to
sign it yourself through the cindy and
signed comm and that will allow you to
submit the data sis file and submit all
your credentials and it will sign it for
you know it'll sign it by yourself for
for your IMEI that your unique
identifier for your phone or you can
have it signed in a way that does not
check the IV the IMEI of the phone you
can give it out to all your friends so
now that just all that's complete you're
in the store you're published let's go
back and take a look at what we could
what it took to get to this point where
it all starts is the queue creator the
queue creators kind of your Haven of you
know the start point for everything
because this is your IDE it's how you
get things going so queue creator is
available from cute Nokia comm then
you're going to need to get the TKR app
on your phone it comes with the cute
creator it's just an application that is
kind of like a staging area for new code
coming out of the cute creator that will
allow you to hit run and show up on the
phone as opposed to going through in
building sis files for every single time
and manually pushing it over to the
thumb then take a look at the UI layouts
UI layouts under the designer it's just
once you've created your new project
there's a designer tab hit designer
it's a drag-and-drop interface that
allows you to go through and create your
key
applications before you know see how
what they look like before you have to
mess around on the code so you have an
idea of what you're dealing with so
you're not like blindly assigning pixels
and it also helps with different screen
sizes so that you know you can set
ratios and set balance as opposed to
this is exactly a 50% of the screen it's
fifty pixels in well fifty pixels in on
a 300 wide screen is a lot different
than 50 pixels in on the 600 widescreen
it looks a lot different you know one's
jammed all the way in the corner and
ones you know a good bit in the halfway
senator screen and then once you've kind
of done your layout you got to play
around with more in-depth api's like I
took advantage of the camera api's and
then you know packaging it we just cover
packaging at the beginning so you go
from start to finish so you start out
with the cue creator you end up with
your smart installer all packaged up if
you guys want to see more on the subject
email me Jason at hack 5 org or if you
have any questions or you know
specifically targeted towards cute head
on over to the forum Nokia comm the
Nokia Q SDK brings the popular q creator
IDE from the desktop and embedded worlds
to mobile developers so they can build
native apps for the Symbian 3 devices
like the Nokia n8 now developers can
submit their apps by January 20th to be
involved and we just want to thank Nokia
for sponsoring today's show now like I
said the proxmox ve installation is dead
simple
seriously you boot off the CB click a
few times enter a password you're done
and it will go ahead and say hey why
don't you just reboot me and we're all
set to go you don't actually have to do
anything with this physical machine
anymore it's all done over a beautiful
web interface you'll say here's the IP
address that I've got on the network go
ahead HTTP my IP we're good to go right
so go ahead and eject that cd-rom maybe
throw in the closet or wherever you put
your servers in your home and you're all
set so let's go ahead and login from the
laptop and if you're keeping track at
home this would be the fifth laptop I
have now had on the show this is the new
one so that I can edit from the CES show
floor awesome good stuff coming from CES
and shmoocon in January by the way but I
got to give a big thumbs down to
whatever this machine is let's see it's
another
sis this is the NTA f and it's really
not the Asus that's the big problem is
the Nvidia Optimus stuff and it's where
they've got the discreet graphics Nvidia
and then they've got the integrated
Intel stuff but there's some special
software the switches in between and oh
yeah Nvidia doesn't support it on Linux
and all of their but drivers are binary
and it's a big like after you to
open-source and it's like come on you
know so here I am back in Windows like I
want to be here you know I am my boon to
virtual machine running but that's not
what we're here for anyway let's put
some windows boxes and some Linux boxes
on our new virtual machine I'll deal
with this later but so that all aside
get VirtualBox out of the way and so
I've head over to the IP address of our
new proxmox ve server and since it is a
self-signed certificate we're going to
have to go ahead and proceed through
this you can actually download the
certificate so since it is self signed
that's not an issue there so get that
hooked up so you never worried about
anything fishy on your land trust this
environment so we're all good go ahead
and log in as root you set up the
password as part of the installation and
you're greeted with this beautiful
little screen here that tells you all
about your machine and what its
resources are so speaking of machines
told you that I hate this laptop man
this editing rig has done me so well
I think that did like I don't know like
three or four seasons of hack five it's
a Intel Core 2 quad q95 50 at 2.83
overclocked as successfully as a 3.2
beautiful chip with 12 Meg's l2 yes
eight gigs of RAM and I don't have it in
a raid right now but whatever anyway
this machine is a decently spoken box
for for a virtual server and then it is
going to get a pounding too because we
are throwing some really good stuff on
it you guys will hopefully get involved
in a little later but but yeah so we can
see our stats here and if I go over to
virtual machines I can see I've got a
plethora of these already set up you
know now here's what's really neat the
appliance templates now we've talked
about virtual appliances before I think
it's a
episode 617 is a really good one to
reference for that but just like virtual
box has virtual appliances and there you
know VirtualBox marketplace wherever
they want to call it this has something
very similar we go over here to
downloads right and and like they've got
their own mail gateway you know you
could sit we've talked about xennos
before Zendesk or IT monitoring good
stuff right here it is boom hit start
download and it starts downloading the
ISO to your machine and there's nothing
more that you need to think about so we
can also you know manually ISO images
you know images of CDs of operating
systems ready to go on here by just
going over to ISO images click and
choose file selecting a file hitting
upload and I've had no problem uploading
like six seven eight hundred mega shows
right over the network no problem
under configuration you would expect to
the same basic kind of stuff under
system we can configure our networks
currently this machine only has one
network interface card it had to we
could you know add another bridge
there's also bonding where we could you
know say this network card is physically
bound to this virtual machine and then
we can also do some nifty stuff with NAT
so we're going to get into that a little
bit later but we're going to have a lot
of fun with networking here
your basic admin's stuff where you can
change the you know the dns the time
password all that storage wise like I
said not in a raid but we could add
storage here there's also a backup
scheme where we can add jobs under
administration this is oh cool ok server
right well this is just a debian server
so we can sell the service is running
but you could log in at the local
terminal here log in as root add
whatever services there you go right
this is also where we download the
certificate and then you know we can
just go ahead and check out logs and
then cluster which is really cool
because imagine this that guy running
Ubuntu and VirtualBox we could put you
know we could put proxmox ve on him and
then all of a sudden we could build
ourselves a virtual machine cluster and
my green stuff back and forth let me
show you that all right so we got a
virtual machine set up check this out
migrate tag but no cluster yet but
that'd be so cool move machines around
alright anyway so let's go ahead and
create a machine because that
like the first thing you want to do when
you get something like this set up it's
like dude let's run some machines
already right so I'm going to go ahead
and walk you through creating a new
machine let's just create a Windows box
because we're going to be having fun
with those in season 9 so we're going to
have to choose KVM in this case because
like we talked about openvz only doing
the Linux stuff and then our cd-rom
devices where we choose the ISO in our
inventory we're going to choose the
default 32 gigs name it something like
expendable 18 I'm only going to give it
to 56 of RAM because you know it's a
Windows box and here we have the option
to start at boot now if this were for
instance like a mail server and and like
I'm talking about proxmox is a great
soho solution you know if you've got a
small office if you get a small business
even if you're just a home user wanting
to test out the latest and greatest this
is a great solution and being able to
have those virtual machines start on
boot that and the quickness of the
installation and the fact that they have
those appliances makes this a great way
to get quickly set up so so this is one
of those where like if this was like a
mail server or something a file server
I would totally check this box
considering it's an expendable Windows
box it's not happening now image format
is interesting because they do have a
couple options here including VMDK so
that would make this virtual machine a
lot more portable if say we wanted to
move that physical file over to a
desktop and run it in you know VMware or
VirtualBox you know right there on their
desktop just going to leave it at raw
since it is a Windows machine going to
leave this as IDE could do it's scuzzy
if it was Linux machine and then under
network cards we've got a plethora to
choose from the defaults fine but
supposedly there is a performance
improvement if we go ahead and choose
this one here on our Windows machines
I've got it set up to our bridge there's
not much more to go so we just go ahead
and create creates the machine if I go
back over to my list I'll find it right
here at the bottom expendable 18 and
let's go ahead and start that machine
start our installation get it on the
network all that good stuff
simply hit start here now we've talked
about how VirtualBox has that awesome
RDP
ability where we can use an RDP client
to connect to any of the machines on our
virtual server using you know Remote
Desktop Protocol at whether it's a
Windows machine or Linux machine and I
think that is so cool this doesn't do
that but it uses VNC
which is also an excellent remote
desktop application so if we actually
click open VNC console this is probably
one of the better implementations of a
web VNC console that I've ever seen
it does require Java so we have to
accept that and hit run but once we've
got that going hey there we go
I got a Windows installation going right
now NTFS quick format a few minutes
later I'm going to have an XP box for
you guys to have fun with coming here
really soon so yeah that's that's just a
quick little rundown of you know what
you can do with this what the power of
it is as you can see we were able to set
this up in just minutes head over to
virtual machines I got plenty of
machines running on this you know so so
think about that box that you've got
sitting in the closet you know if you've
got some spare 64-bit machines this is a
really cool piece of software to play
with I definitely will be doing a lot
more of that here real soon getting into
more of the clustering and the
networking and stuff like that but of
course I'm interested in what you guys
think since you guys are the ones that
really turn me on to this piece of
software to begin with so feel free to
hit me up at feedback at hack 5 org with
any of your questions or suggestions of
things that you'd like to see us do with
virtualization in the future all right
well with all that said I'm going to go
ahead and we're gonna take a quick break
when we get back shins gonna be joining
us to wrap this all up hey buddy why the

clean water is one of the scarcest
resources in the world
I for one take clean water for granted
every day we need it to survive and yet
nearly a billion people around the globe
just don't have access to it we want to
get involved so we're partnering with
charity water to help make a difference
charity water is this organization that
donates a hundred percent of the money
that it raises to building wells and
bringing clean water to communities in
need they're leveraging technology in
really creative ways to mobilize people
around the cause and we want you guys
our viewers to get involved each show on
revision3 is reaching out to our viewers
to raise money to build wells it takes
five thousand dollars to build a well
that can provide clean water to an
entire village so we need your help to
make a difference go over to
revision3.com / charity water to learn
more and get involved in the cause we've
already gotten quite a few donations but
we're far from reaching our $5,000 mark
I know we can do it come on let's do it
guys now if you guys have the time no
let's like code and ninja with his evil
server cake which is so cute show your
pride by sending us photos over at
feedback at hack 5 org and remember to
