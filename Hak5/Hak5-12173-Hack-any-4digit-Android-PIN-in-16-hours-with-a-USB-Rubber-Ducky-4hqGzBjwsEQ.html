by domain.com so one of the questions
that we get over at our email feedback
at hak5 org a lot is have you checked
out so-and-so OS and this is just one of
those though Daniel worden and he said
have you heard of bakbox it's this
Ubuntu based operating system with a
focus on pen testing with an xfce
desktop but unlike backtrack it is
actually functional as a day-to-day
operating system I've been using it as
my main OS for five months now and I
truthfully believe it doesn't receive
enough attention though we decided to
give it some attention so I checked it
out now back box was created in 2010 and
it was recently updated to bakbox linux
3.0 it is oriented towards penetration
testing and security assessments and it
comes with some minimal tools used for
ethical hacking more than 70 of those
minimal tools and some of them include
Metasploit and map ettercap Wireshark
kismet John the Ripper just to name a
very few of those 70 and due to its own
software repositories it stays updated
with the most stable versions of all of
the different tools that is previously
installed in it so I wanted to go ahead
and check it out with you guys today and
it's very nice it's very smooth and it's
a simple detailed desktop so when you
get in here you can obviously tell that
it is xfce based and I pulled up Zen map
over here you can get into all their
different tools over here by auditing
services updates I like when you go into
these different subcategories that
everything is already pre arranged for
you so if you go into exploitation
database you can find SQL map for
example documents in reporting there's
magic trees so it has plenty of stuff
that is actually really useful for
security and auditing so I pulled up an
map over here or Zen map based on a map
uh-huh nice little GUI as I love my guys
and I targeted our local wireless over
here last twenty or and I did a little
kick quick scan to show you basically
that it actually works and it's really
really easy to start
off with and I already have my hosts and
my services ah so you know it works
which is very nice and I actually wanted
to get a little bit of comparisons going
on so you know that it's organized it's
got a simple design the GUI is really
nice and it's very obviously made for
pen testers fine and the big things
about it other than those is it's really
lightweight because of xfce so it's not
going to take up a whole bunch of your
resources and everything's already
previously built in so there's not a
whole lot that you have to download the
first time that you use it now let's
compare this to backtrack for a second
back box is definitely not as popular as
backtrack and pretty much anybody can
tell you that it doesn't have as much
support or as many new releases and
backtrack uses gnome as compared to back
box backtrack also started around 2006
so it has a lot more details in it and
backtrack has a few compatibility issues
with sound and video but when you first
start up back box not so many issues
pretty much everything is already
figured out for you and backtrack is
definitely a lot more popular it's
probably the top choice for most
security enthusiasts but if you just
want something to day to day back box is
probably where you want to go also let's
talk about black boon to do you guys
remember that one where is it if you
google it nothing comes up it's the
the.com name is for sale and the wiki
isn't even there there's I don't know
what happened to black boon tube but
well I can't really do a comparison
since this is no longer around
and then there's pen two which is also a
really lightweight wine it uses
enlightenment as the windows manager and
this one is based on Gen 2 it's
available as a live CD or a live USB the
nice thing about pen 2 is it's also
updated every few months and it's
customized with a whole bunch of tools
customized with a kernel so everything
is really really nice and because of
enlightenment it's also very lightweight
so I think out of all of them backtrack
is still probably the best option for
security but if you want something
that's lightweight something that's
really really good for day to day use
and to
bakbox no no I'm kind of iffy about both
of them I'm kind of leaning towards
bakbox at the moment be honest but I do
want to hear what you guys think let me
know which one is your top choice and I
know there's a whole lot of other
security and pet pentesting auditing
operating systems based on Linux and
based on gender food and whatnot out
there so let me know about those ones
because I definitely want to check out
the best ones and maybe do some more
comparisons in the future you can always
