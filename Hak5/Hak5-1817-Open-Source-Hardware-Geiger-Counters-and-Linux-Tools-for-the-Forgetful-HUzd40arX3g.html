hide wear Geiger counters and what the
frak
Darren explains all that and more this
time on hack five this episode of hack
five is brought to you by domain.com
hello welcome to hack five my name is
Darren kitchen hello everyone I'm
Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol s
welcome to this very friendly show it's
quite friendly indeed we have it we've
got a fun one today you do I know it's
hardware it's got some software you put
those things together
yes we've got a lot of weird projects
going on a lot of behind the scenes
stuff I wish that we could share some of
them with you right now a lot of yes
right we do don't have the live stream
going because we're rebuilding computers
it's fun three computers three now we're
going through a lot yes well you know
you know you start you can start getting
on that roll and you're like I wonder
what everything so we're doing a lot of
that I'll show you guys at the next open
house which will have announcements soon
enough and I can't wait to see you all
there but with that I'm excited because
Shannon will actually be able to welcome
you into our warehouse at the next open
house by detecting your radiation is
that right Shannon it's true yeah so
I've been having a lot of fun with
Geiger counters as weird as that might
be but I've learned like crapload about
how Geiger counters work what they
actually detect and what it means
whenever you're detecting different
kinds of ionizing radioactivity okay
what is ionizing radioactive cuz I think
Geiger counter and I'm just like
transported to you know 1980s sci-fi
films I'm thinking et and like the
people in the Tyvek suits I'm totally
thinking like ghost owners because they
use Geiger counters but it's totally
like soot on earth to do with research
Geiger counter yeah I'll have more
information on this in a bit but first I
wanted to explain what Geiger counters
are so they detect that
amazing radioactivity and that includes
things like gamma rays x-rays beta and
alpha radiation so there's four
different kinds that Geiger counters can
detect most of them if not all detect
gamma and x-rays and then some of them
can also detect alpha and beta depending
on the hardware depending on how it was
made so a Geiger counter these always
have this weird looking tube this part
right here so that's the thing that
actually does the detecting yes so it's
made out of this really really thin
glass and it's really easy to break them
so you have to be incredibly careful
with it yeah you should take a look at
this it's kind of it in fact isn't this
like a Soviet Arabs you know surplus
cylinder that isn't really manufactured
anywhere it's yeah well you can still
find them around but you probably have
to buy them off like eBay but locally
they do still work it's kind of called a
Geiger Muller tote tube I believe that's
how you pronounce it oh yeah I take it
that the Geiger counter was invented by
some guy named Geiger exactly so I won't
go into that whole spiel but basically
your Geiger counter we usually have a
tube some kind of audio out output like
some kind of readout and then a visual
output so the one I have here only has
an audio output so when I turn it on it
will start beeping whenever
radioactivity starts hitting it so I'll
leave it on for now and see if it
actually detects anything in here okay
and if it doesn't I might just need to
turn up the a potentiometer okay oh so
there's a way to actually adjust the
sensitivity as it were yeah exactly so
the tube or detector is the heart of the
Geiger counter it has to have some kind
of tube inside of it it counts particles
of radiation that hit it by milit milli
wrote jens or rounded jinns what is
there like a better name for that
there's those that's per hour so those
are for x-rays and gamma-rays and then
there's microsieverts per hour basically
one click equals one particle count so
every time a particle hits the tube
it'll click and then meter readouts on
counters can also be CPM or clicks per
minute so depending on which one you buy
there's it's going to be measured in
different ways and CPM is used to
measure alpha and beta radiation usually
so the tube is filled with this energy
like helium neon argon example very very
low pressure so we really don't want to
crack that tube no yeah we really don't
well that would be high pressure that
would be an issue but it's low pressure
so it's not gonna like explode in your
face or anything high voltage is applied
by turning it on
so you just power it by batteries or
plugging it in or whatever and then the
tube conducts electrical charge whenever
a particle is going to hit it the gas
inside is conductive by ionization so
the ionization sends a pulse to the
electronics in the counter and gives you
some kind of count so as ours does
counts per second so CPS also can be
construed as counts per minute and
equivalent dosage reported via the
serial port once a second so you do have
access to a serial port on this open
source hardware that I have ionization
is basically a process in which an atom
or a molecule acquires a negative or
positive charge by gaining or losing
electrons to form ions so this is often
in conjunction with other chemical
changes that might happen you may be
reminded of highschool science about it
now yeah kind of confusing won't go down
that path basically particles are
hitting it it's telling you how many
particles are happening oh that's cool
yeah yes because you know maybe maybe
you don't want to have too many x-raying
gamma right exactly
there's gamma rays and x-rays those two
that I first mentioned those are part of
the electromagnetic spectrum there's
really high frequency they're very short
wavelength both can be potentially
dangerous for example if you're in a
hospital and you're getting x-rays they
put that big coat on you when you're
getting those x-rays done that's to
protect you from the x-rays gamma rays
usually occur in naturally occurring
things like granite
for example wait a minute yeah seriously
so if you have granite countertops at
home there's something inside of them I
believe it's called radium I'll have to
look it up again sure but granite
countertops are one thing that you can
use to test Geiger counters because they
do give off a very small bit of
radiation it's not enough to harm you
but it is a very good thing to test a
little bit of trivia
I actually know from
Randolf explaining this to me in fact
I'm actually wearing this to it right
now go system that that Corningware
right it makes a lot of different ab
doing dishes and stuff back in the day
use this I think it was the radium stuff
in like some of their plates so there
are these vintage plates yes so there's
these vintage plates from the 60s that
you can probably still find on eBay that
are totes radioactive we should probably
explain that not very much obviously
there's other things in smoke detectors
americium and we did an awesome
domain.com ad with the a murder paul and
i have the duckies anyway yes americium
fun state yet basically gamma gamma
radiation that's pretty much found
everywhere because it's naturally
occurring so pretty much wherever you
are you're going to pick up like some
kind of background count on your Geiger
tube are your Geiger counter because
it's you know it's it's there alpha
radiation is the other type that's
positively charged particles emitting
from the nucleus of an atom during decay
because you know atoms decay over time
they can't get through more than an inch
of air or a piece of paper it's kind of
interesting so you can test what kind of
particles you're picking up by using a
piece of paper
same thing with beta radiation so beta
is the negatively charged particles
happening during in atoms decay so these
are a lot lighter they can penetrate
better than alpha particles but not
through more than a few millimeters of
aluminum so you can also test your
Geiger tube with aluminum oh so these
are the ways you can either get to this
if you get through that and the various
levels of it so that that could be
useful in actually calibrating this as
well exactly you know the one time I
didn't wear my half-life anyway so the
problem with Geiger counters like this
is it's very open the only thing I'm
picking up is the blinks every time a
some kind of particle hits this but the
problem is there's four different
particles this could pick up I don't
know which ones I'm picking up so I want
to do some kind of test so one thing I
can do is aim my Geiger counter at some
kind of suspect that I think is
radioactive so for example my my granite
countertop so the reading
first off if it's gamma and/or x-ray or
beta you can place one eighth inch thick
aluminum piece between the instrument
and your source so if it stops it's most
likely beta radiation Oh the most common
isotopes those are gonna be emitting
gamma and beta so beta is very common
you can also aim it at and next to your
radius radiation source and if you get
hits then no hits
then it's alpha beta or low-energy gamma
so now what you can do after that you
can place aluminum foil between your
counters you put it on your head and if
it stops then it's most likely beta so
you can make the same thing with paper
if it stops it's alpha the the paper
hats don't work the same way the
aluminum foil wants to or aluminium in
fact I should mention this is very open
so it's picking up my own radiation oh
it's kind of like an omnidirectional
tube that's why yeah it's picking up
radiation from all sorts of different
sources right now so it's not very
scientific this one but it is really fun
to build Hardware and soldering but if
you want to buy like a consumer one it
has an opening on one end so it's very
very pointed and you're not going to
contaminate it from behind while you're
pointing at what every source you think
is your radiation can I can I pop in
some fresh batteries on this guy so yeah
I did a demo video at home and I'll just
talk about it but yeah I did whoa there
it goes
battery wasn't set properly I'm gonna
set this whoa so the hard part about
this is it's hard to determine if it's
turned up too high from the
potentiometer yeah okay so now it's just
beeping a little bit sensitivity yeah
it's very very sensitive when you turn
up the potentiometer I'm gonna turn you
off because you're so loud Wow but but
the blue guy this is the potentiometer
right here so I can turn that up and as
it increases I can tell how sensitive it
is over here I have the little bell the
little teeny part the LED and then
there's a whole bunch of capacitors on
here resistors and whatnot luckily the
website well unfortunately the website
doesn't give the most amazing FAQ for
building it for somebody who's really
new to hardware but told me about the
build right because you had to assemble
this completely yourself and solder it
together and all I love that it's a kid
right it makes it so much more
entertainment it's just buying a Geiger
counter and it's rad that it's rad it's
totally rad that the Geiger counter is
open hardware so this one that I bought
is from a website called mighty ohm comm
it's called the Geiger counter they do
someone that comes in a case but your
tube is going to still be completely
open so there is no pointed Center so
it's still gonna pick up a lot of
radiation from all different sections
that you you know cause radiation but
they do have assembly instructions here
and luckily the instructions are really
good if you understand what you're doing
with hardware but if you're new this
isn't gonna make a lot of sense okay yes
that's those are their directions so
luckily they do have pictures on there
and they do explain like you know here's
10k but then you have to match up with
whatever stickers you have in your
warehouse what is 10k resistor look like
locally I already learned that so I was
able to figure it out real real quick
actually just light you know what we
should show the back of it because
that's what's nice is it's all pin
through so you can see those tiny little
you know you just put the little legs
through the the holes and just solder
him up and snip him or maybe a snip and
before you solder like I've heard flick
ting but what I prefer to do when I was
building this was put in all the
resistors first fold them over fold the
long legs over and then after that I was
able to put in the capacitors fold those
over so I tried to put in as much as I
could and then take it one piece at a
time and then you know for things that I
couldn't necessarily clip like the
double-a batteries right I would solder
those first and then move on from there
this is an excellent project too for
like you know the next thing now is I
want to build with the laser cutter an
acrylic case for El nature's yes lots of
awesome opportunities for radness in
this project definitely I mean there's
so many things in the world that have
some kind of radiation that come from
them the only problems that I would say
with this open source hardware here is
the two can't differentiate between all
those different radiation types so
that's gonna be a problem if you're
specifically looking for a certain kind
of well you just said though that I can
actually just like Oh shield it behind
paper or aluminum of those different
things - if I'm only looking for one and
then there's also this thing that I read
about called dead time with the tube so
the the it's like a zombie game so it's
an insensitive wait time period after
each count that it perceives oh oh it
has to basically charge a charge
interest yeah it's like a recharging
wait time it's not very long it doesn't
last long at all but it does happen so
that's why in-between counts you know I
could have a million counseling here but
I could only get 900,000 or whatever it
might be okay another problem that you
have is - so open you know this this is
open source hardware and there's no case
on this the case that they do sell
covers a little bit but not much it's so
there's particles hitting left and right
you know they're coming from all over
the place and it's really hard to deduct
what is causing the radiation and from
where oh you know what as you mentioned
that it just occurred to me because the
first thing I thought was you mentioned
that this has serial ports on it right
yeah yeah so similar to for instance
that Arduino project that you were doing
while back using the carbon monoxide and
all of those other detectors that could
detect benzene and things of that nature
I was thinking like how awesome would it
be to you know strap that thing to the
quadcopter right and then detect the
radiation coming from the places we
could fly it around and then oh it's
probably gonna just pick up the motors
and all of this whatever is coming off
the drone yeah you'll need a cable
anyway I'll keep considering this one
but yes yes this is really cool you can
get your own over at mighty own.com they
cost I believe around a hundred bucks
let me take a look yeah okay so they
have the kit that's what we got here and
that was about a hundred dollars and you
can also get one that comes with a case
and they do come with the Geiger tube as
well if you don't already have a Geiger
tube and they also list which kind of
tubes that they work with because
apparently there's different kinds of
tools okay so the question is do you go
with the one that's not as exact for a
hundred bucks or do you go with a Geiger
counter that's like really good and gets
amazing reviews on Amazon that cost five
hundred dollars or if you already have a
lot of the components already you may
only need the tube and since it's open
hardware you may be able to come up with
your own design and they extend upon it
so it really just depends on what you're
looking to do yeah yes right and that's
that's always the beautiful thing about
it open source so you know we're gonna
take a look at some other open source
and see how much work we have to put in
to correct some mistakes and I'm gonna
warn you this upcoming segment we drop
the f-bomb a lot so we're gonna say
frack instead whoa yes so say we all
will be back in just second if you watch
act 5 for a while you know we love
domain.com and we use them whenever we
register domains but the other day I was
thinking about all the epic projects
that we have going on at the hack 5
warehouse this summer we've got open
source distributed social networks who
get drone racing do you know we're doing
drone racing amazing things are
happening so when domain comm came to me
and was all like dude that Club I was
all about I have to say there are so
many dot Club ideas that I'm having it's
kind of sane so just expect a lot of
cool hack five.com stuff and really
because it's the perfect domain it's
universally understood right I mean
globally if you say Club like people
know what you're talking about so if
you're building a new business or you're
naming your startup or whatever have you
a dot Club is perfect and I mean really
any kind of business idea could be a
club I mean the whole internet is all
about community and collaboration and
being social and and Club it is the
perfect social domain name so this
summer get ready for a bunch of hack 5
and dot Club and in the meantime when
you're thinking about getting your next
website on a club domain so head over to
domain
komm slash club and register your dot
Club domain
they're only $9.99 a year and thousands
of amazing options are still available
and when you are over there go ahead and
make use of the coupon code hak5 hak5
that'll save you 15% off and let our
friends over at domain.com know we sent
you a matter of fact let's do this right
now
tweet a hak5 darren the dot Club domain
that you registered on domain.com and
we'll send you guys mad props so when
you think domain names think domain.com
something I recently learned that camp
is that every now and then yeah FF it's
gonna happen but when you do you should
proudly proclaim I'm awesome and that's
what today's open source software is all
about it's it's embracing the awesome
and saying when I am awesome I'm gonna
run this tool and just F it right
everything is going to be magically
better so this guy's totally calling you
out on it we got a tweet from at T
samples he said at hack 5 Darren this
might be a good tool to look at if you
forget sudo a lot github.com slash and
VB and slash the yeah you want to pull
up that github actually there we go this
is my github Pick of the Week in fact it
is an awesome piece of open-source
software and I'm just gonna walk you
guys through how to use it and how to
get started because it's probably
something that you might get some use
out of so basically I use a lot of time
here I'll switch over to this and show
you I'll do something like I don't know
what requires loads here let me do vai
sudo right and then BOOM permission
denied and I'm like oh right I'm not
rude so I'll do a sudo bang bang right
but it's more than just forgetting to do
sudo there's a lot of times where we
just screw up a command and it's a
really simple fix and if you actually
scroll to the bottom of there there's a
couple of really good examples but
essentially what it comes down to is
this program which will lovingly refer
to as either frac or awesome is a
amazing tool that can actually do kind
of I don't want to say Find and Replace
but basically it can fix a lot of
mistakes that you may make on the
command line if it's a Friday night and
you've been drinking and I probably
shouldn't be running his route anyway so
there are some examples in here about
like how you know if you're using it a
lot and you you know forget to do the
right commands you can run this and then
you go frac and then it actually puts it
in for you so let's go ahead and get
started
you're gonna need Python pip it's a
Python installer thingy you're gonna
also need Python dev so sudo apt-get
install those if you don't already have
them those dependencies look like yes
and python tac pip so you'll need those
and I'll just put pound in front of that
because I don't need to run it cuz I
already have those and then once you
have that you can do a sudo pip install
awesome there we go
and that's cleaned up and so now here
I'll clear the screen and bring this
down here and maybe even increase the
font a little so you can see this I can
actually do this and oh actually it'll
say no awesomes given but the reason for
that is because we actually need to pass
it some parameters for it to fix and so
for that we're actually gonna add an
alias I know that you've already talked
about this extensively in your if you
haven't seen already and did a great
hack tip series on bash so check that
out but essentially we're gonna edit our
bash our C files so I'm gonna come over
to here and let's see nano my bash RC
file and at the very end this is where
you you know put some aliases I've
already commented it out but I'll walk
you through it basically we alias
awesome to run this command and that's
why it's in little parentheses there and
it's going to it looks yes and then it
uses lat yep the the last command that
we did and then it passes that as a
variable to awesome
so I'm gonna have taken that pound out
and I'm gonna go ahead and save that and
I'll exit this terminal and just open a
new one I could have also just run bash
increased that font size so you guys can
see at home
so now if I do something like apt-get
install I don't know TCP dump I don't
think I already have that on here and
it's like oh you dog I like totes can't
do that because you ain't root then you
can just be like well actually what I
meant was awesome and you type awesome
and need to give him my password as root
and boom now I'm installing TCP dump and
I couldn't be happier
thank you thank you for that tip I think
we can all learn something from this and
you know what's amazing is this because
it's open source because it's all built
in Python it's extensible and there's
actually a basically smaller you can add
additional finding we've not finding
replace but basically like common
mess-ups and the appropriate fixes so
you two can be awesome that's one every
systems administrator should have yes
that was kind of hilarious yeah you know
what if you guys yeah you know if you
know so say we all frak it let's say if
you've got some ideas you want ahead I
send our away feedback at hak5 org is
the email that hits up the entire hack 5
team and then we could get our brains on
it and it is fun yes I also want to
mention that we've been doing a lot of
really cool shows over here so you if
you haven't checked out hak5 org that's
where you can find all of our social
networks under follow and you can also
find all the different shows that we've
been doing right on the main page so
that includes hack 5 hack to metal
eight-minute tech thing and threat wire
and we are doing patreon for threat wire
and technique so if you really love the
show and you want to show us your
support please do we have links on the
shows yes threat wire Metasploit minute
and hack tip and tech thing and plan up
the university in all of these amazing
things that we are so proud of
and we're gonna if we've been getting a
couple of emails cuz I guess I said last
week that we might have some I don't
want to say positions open but some
opportunities for people within the
community to help out make more cool
community stuff I know that a bunch of
people in IRC have been having fun with
that already so anyway feedback and hak5
dialog is also good I know that we will
be rolling Game Servers humor real soon
we're getting into a whole series on
building out our selves on cluster
environments so I can't wait until we
have a minecraft server hack $5 work
size followed for all the places to find
us on social networks and all of that
hockshop comm if you want to get
yourself some goodies like Wi-Fi
pineapples USB rubber duckies are the
good stuff that's coming up hey hey
we're gonna have some fun stuff for dusk
con I can't wait to see you guys in
August when we celebrate our 10 year
anniversary
can you believe that 10 years so if
you've been watching since season 1 what
did Tom Barrett say the presents for 10
year old deceptive yes yes so you're
gonna be you know Def Con you can just
go ahead and bring little toys for tots
it's totes cool actually we want to hear
from you if you've been if you've been
watching some season 1 tweet at us I'm
at hack 5 Darren with that we are
reminding you once again to trust your
tech no lust
Oh see not me it's all you it's all you
Oh oh it's the oh yeah
now you're doing you'd be doing that
thing with your face again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
