welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I'm creating
remote shells with netcat in Linux
now remote shells on Linux are pretty
similar to Windows when you begin you'll
notice no user prompt appears for you so
that is a little bit different you need
to pay attention to that you'll also
need to run netcat through sudo to do
remote shells ok super user we have
discussed that on a previous hack tip as
well now this time the listener is going
to be my Linux machine so we'll go ahead
and start there on my Linux machine with
this following command so it's spelled
out as such go sudo NC Tech LP and then
you type in your port 3 1 3 3 7 and
you'll notice the LP this time is not
capitalized and then we put tack e slash
bin slash bash so what this is going to
do is start netcat under super user
control or root and then it's going to
open up a persistent listening port on 3
1 3 3 7 while pulling up bin and bash
which is basically the equivalent of
windows of the windows command prompt so
now on your windows box we're also going
to connect to the host pc and that
opened port so this time the listener my
Linux machine will give bash to my
Windows PC if that makes sense so the
command for this over on my Windows PC
is going to be as following I type in NC
and then the IP address of my Linux box
which is going to be 10 dot 70 3.31 dot
1 4 5 and you can look that up by using
ifconfig on your Linux machine and then
you type in 3 1 3 3 7 which is the same
port as your Linux box hit both
and it should connect me okay so after
we go ahead and put in our password we
are connected now it does look a little
bit different than the Windows version
you'll notice and we'll test this out
right after the break the hack shop is
hack fives premier store for all of your
pen testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks just like a flash drive and it
types like a keyboard it can type
scripts into a computer ridiculously
fast like my new favorite from forum
user and levi's that will flip your
computer screen he shared with us today
my one and a half year old son managed
to flip the screen on my Windows 8
laptop upside-down even the mouse
movements were married thought it was a
cool one to write a simple script for
that one as an old school prank now this
is great for pranking your coworkers I
did it to Darrin it totally worked we
couldn't do the show without your
support so we would like to thank you
with something special this week you can
use the coupon code snubs for any order
for your very own signed hacked tip
stickers thank you again for supporting
the show and we're back and now we're
going to start toying around with some
features of a remote shell on Linux now
I've got both of my computer set up and
connected so now I'm going to type ls'
onto my Windows command line on my
Windows machine to see a return listing
of directories on my Linux machine so
for example if you type this in LS like
I did right here I'm going to get a
whole listing of everything on my Linux
machine so that includes my desktop
documents downloads music everything
normal net cat pictures public sparkle
share templates and videos so all my
normal folders that you would find on
the Linux box now in Windows I can also
do some fun stuff so I can use this to
make a new directory if I wanted to and
I'm just gonna use the regular Linux
commands for this so that's going to
include make directory which is mkdir
and then I'll make a new one called noob
and press Enter
so now I can also use the LS command
again to see if the directory was indeed
Korea
it so I'll type that in LS and now I see
noob right in the center now if I wanted
to I can also add a new user I can give
them root access but before I do that I
want to also take a look at my Linux
machine and make sure that these
actually appeared in my directory so I'm
gonna actually use the GUI for this just
double-click on the computer there we go
and if I choose home there's my new
folder haha
totally worked it's so much fun I love
doing stuff like this so now let's get
back into the whole story of this
concept let's add a new user and give
them root access so the command for this
one and this is back on my Windows
computer the command is going to be user
add user ad D tak G and then root and
the name of your user so for this
example I'm going to use user add tech G
root and I'm gonna name my user let's
just use Paul Paul the camera guy hahaha
so I press ENTER with this it's not
gonna say anything quite yet but now I
can use this command to make sure that
the user has been actually created I can
grep Mike user Paul and then slash etc'
slash passwd which is going to show me a
listing of all the users on my Linux
machine so I type in grep Paul slash
etc' slash passwd and there he is Paul
home Paul bin slash Sh so funny so now I
can go ahead and dump the entire passwd
file using tail the tail command so this
one is going to be as such tail slash
Etsy slash passwd
and press enter that's so cool so now I
see okay there's my username snubs and
we also have Paul down here we see how
much information I can get out of snub
so I'm pretty much the admin of this
computer and bin slash bast and then we
also have Paul down here and all of his
commands bin slash Sh
that's so fun so you can do tons of
other things with netcat including
remote shells of course but I want to
know how you guys use netcat I've been
given a lot of really interesting
examples and of course I'll be going
over there in future episodes of hack
tip so if you use it send me a comment
below or you can email us over at tips
at hack 5 org and be sure to check out
our sister show hack 5 for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
