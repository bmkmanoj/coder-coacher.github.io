Las Vegas to check out some cool video
gear this episode of hack 5 is brought
to you by goto assist express support
smarter with go to assist express domain
calm your next big idea starts at
domain.com and Netflix
hello and welcome to hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen and i'm paul tobias
that's kirby kitchen right there this a
little bit of a different episode of
hack 5 than you're probably used to
we're I'm having a little Moscato and
we're gonna go down the latest stories
on Google Buzz or Yahoo buzz and talk
about the know the user submitted is
that what we're doing no no that's kind
of that's not that's not our gig oh
right
actually I got to tell you a part of our
gig relate to be honest like over five
years ago when we got into this was
pretty much like dude let's get into
podcasting because then we can buy
really cool cameras you didn't buy cool
cameras at first no I didn't know but
the fact that we're making video is the
awesome thing yeah we're really we're
kind of I don't want to call us av geeks
cuz we hate audio but we like messing
with just kind of the whole system of
having develop a show it's kind of like
working inside of a giant computer yeah
you know there's a lot about like
engineering the podcasts and all of the
elements of the audio and video and the
whole post-production workflow all of
that stuff it's really a hack within
itself especially in the podcasting side
when you're trying to do on a shoestring
budget yeah especially it's just when
you get that awesome mod done if you end
up with an episode in this case instead
of like no cool case mom put yeah we
really should show you guys a lot more
behind the scenes because we've
engineered some ridiculous stuff that's
like a tenth or a hundredth the cost of
like what the professionals would do and
essentially gets you 90% of it so when
we got started thinking about all the
new projects that we're doing like hack
5 live which is coming back we're like -
why don't we just go to NAB
why don't you tell me a little bit about
what NAB is NAB stands for National
Association of Broadcasters it's a
conference out in Las Vegas that the
conference hall that we normally go to
see yes - so it's huge it's got like
five different areas that are like three
football fields each it's ridiculous
but there's a lot of stuff there some of
it is multimillion-dollar broadcast
studios minimize they've got these
gigantic display walls and it was really
fun going up to them being like hey we
need a box that'll you know do this this
and this and the little geeky stuff that
we need on our end right but not like
you'll also see things like antennas mm
yeah like jam radio guys and mega watt
antennas and 30-foot jibs which are
those crazy cranes that you put the
cameras on and like like blimp lights
yeah we totally want a 30-foot jib we
just don't have a place to put it like
it's not gonna work in the garage any
yeah yeah unless we anyway so this is
really just an episode of one of the
things that we are very passionate about
and geeky about and that is like all of
this fun video production stuff so it's
not your normal typical hacker kind of
material that we normally cover but
really what we say at the end of every
episode is trust your technology mean
that this is something that we trust and
this is our technology and there's quite
a number of things in here that have
some really cool technology so we hope
it fits well do the mushroom Network
stuff with the FPGAs and the like
bonding of 4G modems and crazy UDP
streams it's really cool I think you
guys are really gonna enjoy it go ahead
and let us know because I know that this
is venturing into some new areas but
we'll be back next week with your
regular hak5 and until then hit us up
feedback at hak5 org let us know what
you think
I have the pleasure of being here with
uncle product manager over at Blackmagic
Design how are ya I'm good thank you
it's exciting to see the developments
that black magic has gone through
especially with live switching before
now there was kind of a little project
there with you could get to intensity
pros and there was a software called
on-air and it was never really what I
had hoped that it would become but it
seems like you guys are killing it now
this is the talk of the show can you
tell me about these switchers that
you've got coming out now okay so well
we have a couple of switchers and the
cool thing about the switchers is that
we're selling the switch you're
independent to the panel so you can
start live production at 995 and you
have to provide your own control surface
that's what you're looking at here is
the laptop it's not a software that we
give you so we give you that software so
with the software with the switcher
they're good to go and a couple of cool
real things in there six inputs all live
multiviewer built in so portability wise
you can take one of these monitor and
your cameras and you're good to go right
so you could take a macro this guy may
be a little 10-inch HDMI because so it
gives you a multiplex view so you can
see all of your live previews and you
said this is a six source I only see
four HDMI input in there so yeah the way
that it's really cool cuz you have four
HDMI inputs oh by the way every single
input has a frame synchronizer in it
nice so there's Jen lock you don't need
to worry about you know cutting in
getting a little exactly none of that
stuff and the cool thing so the thing
with the those are SDI HD SDI so imagine
you want to run a camera further then it
what HDMI lets you do yeah in fact with
HDMI what 1.1 pretty much what is it 15
meter easy or something like that with
with the HD SDI you can go so much
further the way that I said 6 inputs
therefore HDMI and 4 HD SDI just 2 of
them are shared oh okay right right and
tell me about the way that it interfaces
with the computer because if you don't
get your you know the beautiful you know
control board well that's $5,000 add-on
say like you're just kind of a hobbyist
and you need you know something a lot
less expensive than say like a TriCaster
or something this looks like a good
start because you know you could upgrade
later right
you can start with this and what you do
is you take your Ethernet that's all
that Ethernet port there that's how the
switcher is communicating with the panel
so you take Ethernet get it into things
that's it just Ethernet communications
fairly simple it runs over IP so in
theory you could be in Chicago and
switching this here you know it's over
it's over I can do it like Oh your IP
you can do it over a VPN you could do it
over a VPN
I mean it those are possibly let's go I
mean really it's all possible but of
course like you're trying to run that
fader bar you might have a little pricey
that switch cuts it will work yeah okay
so um now if you don't want to drop the
five grand on the control board right
away if you just want to do the $9.99
and get your look cute little 1u box and
this is really thin 1u box how are you
gonna control it how does it interface
with your computer and how do you
control it over there like keyboard
hotkeys all right you know all the
settings and it exactly it's you can use
your mouse I've heard people talk about
touchscreens so you can do a touch
screen mean look at the GUI it looks
like you can use a touch screen and you
can there are hotkeys keyboard shortcuts
to access the previewing program and
there you going to do can you do like
keyboard shortcuts for you know this
input that input all all of the
different inputs are they on the like on
the QWERTY keyboard where were you
moving the mouse around clicking around
all day long you can move the mouse
around and click click but we're we're
working out the keyboard troca that's
not really finished yet so I can't say
exactly how it's gonna be
we're still trying to figure out what
the best way to do it and the interface
it's over USB 3 I see Ethernet oh it's
Ethernet oh so in it later I'm
communicating to this over Ethernet AC
ok and then how does it save the file so
that's the other cool part of it there's
an h.264 encoder built into the switcher
now your that's coding in the fly on the
fly on the fly encoding on the fly and
in what kind of resolutions are we gonna
be able to do full res you must have
like an FPGA or so what do you have
inside there's a crunch in this so
there's actually a vertex Xilinx vertex
product that's in there and basically
that's doing the
that's actually doing the switcher core
the FPGA for the for the encoder is
actually the same FPGA that we use in
our $500.00 h.264 encoder Wow
so that's built right into there I'm not
hurt essential which converts a wig
silence product will use there but we
use the silence of her my name sure if
it's a vertex reasons islands products
do that encoding as well yeah and then
it must I mean and it's got the
horsepower to also give you those live
previews on the multiple exactly what's
happening is that the audio gets
embedded in there through the AES
connector and all of that so your
finished program stream with all your
cuts your transitions all your
downstream your graphics and all that
stuff is all being put on coming out
h.264 encoded over that USB connection
and the audio will stay in sync unlike
deal with on-air audio will stay in
place all coming through here okay
now what about the interface Mac PC
Linux back in PC Linux I don't know I
don't know maybe Vinci will run on Linux
a maybe there could happen on Linux as
well I mean our our code is actually
really very common code and we just
build multiple times so very possible
all right exciting developments for live
switchers do you guys have even more
here at the show one of the other
products that were super stoked about is
a field recorder if you're looking for a
rock-solid domain registrar and web
hosting next brilliant idea look no
further than domain.com and forget
lengthy setups they've got 1-click
installs of popular open source programs
like wordpress joomla drupal and more
with com starting at just nine
ninety-five a year and web hosting for
under six bucks a month
it's no wonder domain.com is the fastest
growing domain registrar and web hosting
company on the internet but it gets even
better for you the tech savvy hack 5 pin
we've got a coupon that'll knock off
15% on the next order check out with
code hak5 and experience blistering fast
DNS and rock-solid infrastructure
without breaking the bank support the
show and get 50% off at domain.com we
check out with coupon code hak5 got a
great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
com
Wow
that's a bright idea
as you guys know I'm a huge fan of the
whole video blogging thing because it's
easy just you know you pull out your
phone you fire up your camera app to
point out yourself to talk like an idiot
and then upload it straight to YouTube
well it could be more fun well of course
if you needed a script you couldn't just
riff for something and you wanted to
write it all down well dude
prompter pros got the solution not only
will they stream your your script right
back to you but with this crazy rig I
now have two iPhones one to record with
and want to look at with script and I'm
all like doo doo doo doo make the little
recording of myself hey how cool is that
this perfect for field recording video
podcasting or live speeches yes it sure
is you could look like a freak with one
of these yeah I'm here with JA heat from
mushroom networks how you doing guy Heat
good so tell me about the teleporter am
I gonna get beamed up it is in a sense
beaming it off but it's a really a video
delivery system that we developed and
it's really providing video over cellar
data cards okay so the premise is I hook
this onto my camera i plug in a bunch of
USB dongles I guess I firewire in or
HDMI in or SDI and something like that
exactly we pretty much support any type
of video interface HDMI SD SD i HD SDI
we support the analog ones as well but
usually a CI is a standard for
broadcasting or HDMI and then it's going
to deliver the video signal from my
camera over the Internet to my broadcast
Center my content delivery network if I
want to embed a player on my website and
do like a conference live streaming
walking around how does that work with
the what is the hardware doing here it's
actually accomplishing couple of things
one is instead of a single connection we
have three connections here but you can
go as high as 4 or 6 or even 8 and what
we do is we split the packet at the
video into smaller pieces stream it over
all of the links and then in the cloud
collect them and put it into a single
stream again and can beam it back to a
website or a CDN of your choice now when
you're streaming this out and you're
chopping it up are you is this over TCP
or is this UDP and we have actually
between ours
and our receiver in the cloud we have a
proprietary transport scheme and and we
use a lot of number crunching and our
own algorithms because it really takes a
some calculation to intelligently
schedule the packets because we
constantly keep track or how the
channels are behaving and scheduling
packets accordingly now tell me about
the channel so right here you're showing
you've got like four little USB dongles
here say I've got a couple from Sprint
Verizon t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T whoever for 3G or
4G broadband what kind of bandwidth can
I actually expect to get best case
scenario actually it is going to be a
function of the underlying carriers your
coverage area and and really how crowded
that area is we have seen anecdotally
I've seen anywhere from a couple hundred
kilobits per second on the low end all
the way up to four or five megabits per
second and on the high end per card and
and with four or five megabits am I
going to be able to broadcast HD back to
the base yes if you get anywhere around
2.5 to 3 megabits per second you can
definitely push 1080 type video quality
ok so say like I'm hedging my bets
because I'm at a very you know I'm at a
popular event where everybody's got
their cell phone on everybody's trying
to do you know all of the stuff that
they do want our smart phones now and so
I've occurred from all of the major
carriers and all of a sudden AT&amp;amp;T yeah
I'm singling them all goes and takes a
dive how is that going to affect my
stream what we do is we have actually
adaptive algorithms in here so we
definitely take care of the clogging
that might happen in the network and and
actually you can be rescheduling the
packets on off different carriers to
take care of that and we do have an
algorithm which adapts the video rate
according to the available bandwidth so
if all of a sudden there is a dip in the
bandwidth our video encoder will change
its encoding rates and therefore send a
lower quality video and and not get into
a state where the video is not ongoing
okay and what kind of delay considering
the fact that these are you know
transmitting
individually on these four different
channels with your own proprietary
protocol when they get reassembled
how far am i behind what's live it's a
very good question because one of the
challenges because this is a system that
is constantly compared to a satellite
broadcast system and one of the
challenges is to achieve comparable
quality with low latency so that you can
keep the interactivity when you're doing
interviews and we have seen a couple of
second latency is definitely achievable
if you get this equality on four cards
you can of course always increase that
latency to three four five six seconds
and have a one-way live stream that's
also a possibility okay and is it for
tolerant if I say you know just pulled
one of these out in the middle of the
stream am i as a viewer just going to
get a black screen am I gonna have to
reconnect to the stream how does that
happen
for the viewer no actually we protect
against that as well
what we do is we have some level of FEC
algorithms and built into the system so
the packets that have been falling on
the floor are still gonna be delivered
at the other end and that's part of that
latency piece as well because that gives
us wiggle room so to speak to correct
what might have gone wrong in the system
so tell me how is this product evolved
I've heard that initially it was kind of
using consumer electronics and I know
that it's Linux based that's really cool
can you tell me more about the operating
system and how the hardware is evolved
sure yeah we use actually x86 based
systems and and our operating system is
also an open source system we developed
it on x86 because we wanted to be a
future-proof for embedded systems and
have have a long shelf life so to speak
so we were able to do that with the
system and actually we started as a the
product started actually evolved from a
data product so we initially optimized
the system for data delivery and you can
basically utilize this as a fat pipe if
you will in in portable locations
portable applications but then some of
our clients started pushing video over
over it and then we sat down and said
why don't we optimize the whole system
for video delivery from the ground up
and that's exactly what we've done with
teller all right so it's a little you
know debian-based Linux box that's got
an x86 processor in there but then
you've got these you know capture in
your
cheering / I see you've got videos and
composite I'm assuming some hdhd signals
in as well
what kind of CPU are you gonna have to
have in there what kind of battery life
is that gonna impact when you're doing
that live transcoding of HD video yeah
actually in terms of battery life we
both in terms of processing as well as
the transmission on the cellular cards
we we definitely need something more
powerful than a regular smaller battery
that's why we went with what's called
the anton bauer battery interface as we
can use those antibodies which powers
the device in an active mode for over
three hours so you can get a pretty good
juice out of it and we had hot swapping
capability as well so if you want to
change the battery while you're
streaming without the loss so you can
easily swap the barre
while you're running okay now I gotta
know what's this gonna cost we actually
we have different models depending on
the options and models but the entry
point is really really low especially
compared to the energy cell light truck
systems which can cause easily north of
a quarter million dollars here we're
talking about just over 10 grand for the
field unit and you can be live as
streaming to any website of your choice
now how does that stack up with some of
your competitors that have backpack
based solutions basically as a couple
say you don't comment on other systems
but of course we have some unique
features we which we believe are unique
to our technology and approach I would
say the most important piece of this
subway system is the networking side the
3G the 4G cards is usually the bottom
like everything else around it is very
well studied and understood the encoders
the transmitters receiver coming from a
networking side and our company marshal
networks we believe we have a
a very good solution which addresses the
low latency and high quality video
streaming capable with the system great
thanks so much and thanks for the 4G
card hey Paul check this out I am
getting a wicked shot here with a DSLR
and then all the sudden I'm like now you
know I got something else to do I'm
still getting my shot this is the wrist
shot and then this is pretty cool this
guy right here kind of gives me more of
a traditional you know like eyepiece
that I would find them like a video
camera and this attaches onto the cold
shooter onto the shoe here and I still
have a cold shoe for like an additional
accessory this is the cinema kit pro
it's on like a little frame here and
they kept my magnifier and I can look
through right there and oh hang
hands-free operation how about that
this guy is 150 this guy is 190 and this
is all from hood man it's pretty cool

oh that's nice we're just gonna B's with
my name on on the set that's what I need
Darrin kitchen there are a plethora of
prompters here at NAB this guy here the
smart teepee actually goes ahead and
connects to any kind of camera using a
bunch of a different kind of adapter
place these just snap off there's little
pins here and then this just ring just
kind of screws on to the front of your
lens different adapters for different
sized lenses the ones I'm looking at
right here on a just a canon DSLR I got
the nifty 50 on here and it's great
because you know you pop your they've
got an adapter to pop like a you know a
smartphone on or you can do something as
big as an iPad MSRP is 480 over at Smart
TV so I'm here with Richard at GoPro
checking out these cute little guys that
record some amazing video tell me about
the GoPro Hero series right on the GoPro
HD Hero is probably the world's most
versatile and durable camera they shoot
in 1080p 720 and 960 960 is an
interesting mode not a lot of people
might not hear like 960 by 540 yeah it
gives us what we call them that in
between whoa more knees and skis it
gives you more top and bottom so you get
to see your knees and ski it starts like
a 16 by 10 instead of a 16 by 9 right
right it's so it's great form factor for
action sports but with the HT hero as
they say the most versatile
so we we grew out of roots from surfing
and as a sports camera and then a grown
man when the HD came out also and all
these dps and these guys that are using
it for their own amusement
started going wait a second I can use a
semi-professional productions so we've
got folks like The Deadliest Catch
Top Gear all using our cameras and their
productions right now our count is we're
over 65 shows that are using our cameras
right well it's great because the price
point on these are so low that to a
production like that they're almost
disposable and I'm sure they've probably
been through the wringer now how would
they stack up against you know when
you're switching between your footage
from this and your footage from your
professional cameras are they you know
what's the center's and stuff like that
totally holds up in fact I'd be the
biggest testament that we could say is
we got to go up to meet George Lucas go
to the ranch and get to see our stuff
put up there on the big screen they're
using it in one of their upcoming films
where they need to get it inside the
cockpit of a b-52 bomber so that's
really what I mean by the probably know
what about the lens because when you're
doing something tiny like that say like
you're putting in the a-pillar and a car
or something trying to get that Jeremy
Clarkson shot what kind of lens are we
looking at here
as far as angle yes 170 degree wide
angle lens yeah so it's a nice wide
angle lens which really helps with the
stability in the moon now you guys saw
these in several different packages
whether you're a surfer motocross or or
even let's say that you name it and you
want to strap to a helmet right how does
that stack up against something like the
contour HD right so basically the HD
hero is super versatile so you can be
wearing it on your helmet one time you
can strap it to your chest another time
you can mount it onto a pole mount it on
a surfboard super versatile no other
camera out there in the market has this
many mounting and options as the GoPro
and the HD video quality holds up beyond
any other like I said major motion
pictures national TV right now like I
said you guys tell the heroes in three
different configurations and also have
these accessories can tell you about a
bit about the accessories yeah right on
so that's this is one of the new things
we just came out with which is the LCD
BacPac this LCD BacPac just snaps on to
the back of the existing HD hero
so instead of having to buy a new camera
for a new feature we just and that allow
you to frame up the shot view video and
photo playback so instead of going out
and buying a new camera for every little
new feature that's what this hero bus is
about okay snap on new add-on accessory
so aside from just a LCD what else gonna
snap on back though you can what you can
do is then you can take two GoPros and
this is what we just came out with snap
them together to shoot 1080p 3d oh okay
so since it now that sounds like it's
gonna be a pain in the butt to calibrate
I mean it's really important that your
cameras are in these exact positions
when you're shooting in 3d I'm gonna do
that that's exactly what that's exactly
what we figured out for you so download
the new firmware turns the cameras and
to excuse you plug in the orange plugged
in and knows that the cameras are gonna
be in 3d mode okay so you can still use
them as you know single is shady 2d or
if you plugged it in it just goes in 3d
mode right so you're going to take the
video take the SD cards out of each
camera put them into a computer and then
use our GoPro cineforms studio software
to make a 3d video so someone like me
who's iMovie is my level of movie
editing I can now
video and what do you get you get like a
side by side you it's up to you you can
know you have the option to side by side
you have to do the anaglyph you whatever
you want and you can wrote it you can
constantly switch back and forth and so
you can output it you know side by side
you can output it old-school that blue
whatever you want to do okay so I've got
to know before we wrap up what is kind
of the craziest configuration you've
ever seen a GoPro put any craziest
configuration I would say right now one
of the coolest things I've seen is a
company down in Texas who's building a
plasma rocket that will go from the
International Space Station and Mars is
using our GoPros in the thermal vacuum
chamber to test and analyze their jet
propulsion systems so they had to make
sure that our cameras could make it to
the moon and back so that was pretty
cool that is pretty neat thank you so
much right thank you very much Paul
check this out we have got to get one of
these it's called the DC slider and not
only is it like a mini jib here but it's
a slider which means this guy can just
like go back and forth on this rail and
it's even more wicked about this guy
here like and put this up for a second
you got to come over here and check this
out we've got a motorized version it's
not get this wicked shot right here just
sliding up and down this rig
and what's the best is there talking
about writing an iPhone app something
like that because their motorized
version can learn and then you could set
up your shot and then repeat it over and
over and over like they've got one over
here that's demonstrating the
motorisation Oh would you look at that
the motorized slider and its natural
habitat it's got a DSLR programmed to
the panning and the tilting and the

I got the pleasure of being here with
Jeremy from Adam how are you Jeremy very
well thank you
hi so what is the ninja okay well the
ninja and we announced the samurai which
is shipping in a few months with a
needed shipping now and Ninja is a HDMI
recorder playback device and monitor all
in one so it's a reporter but it's got
all of the aspects so like I was over at
Blackmagic looking at their new field
yes there's
is they've got HDMI out so you can't
have a secondary display yours is
integrated correct now is that new to
display on there yes that's a night a
web where's displaying HD footage on a
480 by 272 and you get what's called a
pixel picked a pixel pitch angle
basically effect that when you like when
you on your computer and you take a big
video yet you make it smaller and it
looks looks higher resolution so what
basically this is definitely a
confidence monitor so you can have a
look you can zoom in on people and make
sure that you've you've got the shot
correctly and I can take you through
that and make sure that everyone's so
what is the what is the standard use for
this how are you imagine consumers to
use this well basically it bypasses the
compression of the camera gets your
beautiful images for the lens and sensor
straight out the HDMI or SDI of your
camera but the ninjas targeting the HDMI
market which is obviously all cameras
under like five thousand dollars and and
the beauty of the ninja is it not only
does it take these pristine quality
images and record directly to Apple
ProRes the reason Apple ProRes is really
important is that it's perfect for
today's computers for today's hard discs
so you can record to affordable media
I'm gonna show you here well what we
record to this is we record to Intel
SSDs as well but they're also expensive
just like compact flash p2 or it's there
they can be so you I'm just looking at a
regular two and a half inch laptop drive
indigenous Western Digital 250 gig drive
that I bought from Fry's two days ago so
with a 250 gig
how much recording time are you gonna
get on that drive there in the Pro res
well that's what the ninja tells us so
let me plug it in so you can see what's
going on basically the drive will spin
up you'll see it activate there we go
we've got record play monitor and menu
and down the bottom here you see I've
got a 1080i 659 94 so it's telling you
what you're feeding into the camera and
then in the bottom right side telling me
how much I have left on the desk correct
so there's three there's three elements
to the calculation there's the obviously
the format coming in there's what format
you're going to and then there's the the
size of the disc and how much time is
left so if I go to pro res 4 to 2 which
is 150 megabits a second HQ is 220 then
I get 3 hours 26 minutes
if I go to ProRes Lt I've got four hours
56 minutes that on on this disk and
that's still gonna look in that that
might even look a lot better than maybe
the AVCHD that your camera would
naturally record it not maybe most
definitely so we're taking four to two
eight or ten bit from the camera
this is the fs100 that we're recording
from now I'll show you the images coming
out of that
that's our monitor confidence monitor
right there so I can zoom in and out get
the focus right I can take the overlay
off by touching the screen so this is
the only touchscreen device that that's
available in this in this type of
product not only that when we go back as
you see as I flick through the pro
razors as the time changes I can
calculate do I have enough time to
record do I have enough is this going to
really do for my shoot and what one of
the most important things when you're
recording for long periods of time is
the battery it's about to ask so what
kind of battery is gonna use this with
my existing Panasonic batteries I'm
gonna have to use JVC Sony do you have
your own proprietary so basically we use
Sony batteries mp5 70 that were on all
the DV cameras they're on all the in
these are on the old st style so you
should be able to find these a plethora
of them for in expect correct and what
we've done is we include two in the box
and the reason we do is so you don't
have to go out and buy different
accessories but the main point here is
that we've got a dual battery system and
so you can hot swap you can high swap
let me grab another battery
so this is this is the main one of the
main features you can't record for long
periods of time without having good
battery technology all right so if I
flick here you can see I've got half
half full battery here and a 3/4 full
battery there it when this battery gets
to very low and about to run out of
power it flicks across to the other side
I can then pull off right pop that on a
charger to swap in a new one yeah while
you're recording that's great now tell
me what about the input resolutions what
resolutions is it going to support n am
i limited to only like a camera that's
going to do a 720p or 1080i 1080p or can
I use any HDMI input basically you can
use any HDMI input the only limitation
is the recording speed of the hard disk
or the SSD so as soon as you go above
that recording speed then obviously you
can't record on a single disc and you
have to go to a rated solution so if say
I were to put it in Lt mode and say I
was giving it like a computer display
over HD HDMI would it be able to support
it VA at a resolution of 1024 by 768
oh definitely definitely as long as it's
a standard HDMI format and I'm not sure
if actually 1024 is a standard video
format but it has to be a standard HDMI
video format and most computers when the
output will detect that it's a video
device on the other side and adjust
their resolution and frame rate to
output to to the device now is there a
software component that goes along with
this well yes it's called the Adam OS so
the Adam Hoss operating system and we
designed that from scratch which is why
we can be so responsive on the touch
screen and touch device what I can do is
come in change the batteries very
quickly and I can hit record I can
monitor while I'm recording you can see
the timecode flicking over there take
that off and on so it's a very robust
easy to use ok so since it's your own OS
I'm assuming we'll see firmware updates
new features stuff like that fermer is
really as you download it put onto the
disk in from the master Kellie that we
give you and the docking station that
you connect to your computer and then
you pop it in the ninja turn the ninja
on 30 seconds later you've got all the
new things so what's the price point on
this guy nice point is 9 9 5 and what it
includes is the case
docking station charges to batteries to
empty master caddies so that you can
fill it with wit drives from whatever
you want to buy them from all right
thank you so much Jeremy that just about
wraps up this week's episode of hack 5
but before we get going
know Shanna's not here to go through the
