by hack 5 and viewers like you
support us directly at H a k shop comm
hello and welcome to pineapple
university i'm darren kitchen and today
we're going to be setting up the Wi-Fi
pineapple mark 5 in linux we're gonna
set up internet connection sharing over
our hard wired Ethernet connection
that's actually very simple there's
actually a script that makes it pretty
much automated so let's go ahead and get
started i'm actually here in a very
generic installation of Ubuntu and I'm
going to go ahead and let me increase
that for you I'm going to download the
connection script so W get over at Wi-Fi
pineapple comm slash WP 5sh this script
here is going to allow us to connect to
the pineapple very easily I just need to
make it executable so chmod plus x WP v
Sh and with that we'll go ahead and run
sudo dot slash WP v sh and turn in our
password and we're asked a couple of
questions for most of this is just going
to be the default the only time that
we'll have to change anything here is if
say for instance right now it's asking
us what the interface is between the
computer and our lopped laptop and
actually if I open up another window
here and do if config you'll see that I
have two interfaces I have f0 that's my
Ethernet interface and I have wlan0
that's my wireless interface that I'm
connected to the internet through so
simply go with the defaults here at 0
which is and then my W land 0 and none
of the Gateway or any of that changes
for me and so now I should be able to
ping the pineapple at 172 1642 one I've
got my ping replies and I see here I've
got this address so I just browse to
that and I'll open the link here and
it'll pop up Firefox and I can just go
ahead and
log into my pineapple and from the
network tile here I can click show IP
and I know that I'm connected to the
Internet because it routes through my
machine here which is great because now
if say I wanted to go ahead and set up
wireshark or other network analyzing
tools I can do that right here from my
machine and a client that connects to
the Wi-Fi pineapple as an access point
is going to now go through this Ethernet
cable to my machine and then out my
internet connection which happens to be
wlan0 connected to the Wi-Fi here so
that's it that's setting up internet
connection sharing in Linux it couldn't
be easier with that connection script
and now any client that connects to the
Wi-Fi pineapple as an access point is
going to go through this hard wired
Ethernet connection to your laptop do
whatever have you there with that
connection and and it's that simple
so I highly encourage you to go over to
uni Wi-Fi pineapple comm to find more
lessons and videos like these as well as
links to the forums and the chat and
I'll see you there but until then class
