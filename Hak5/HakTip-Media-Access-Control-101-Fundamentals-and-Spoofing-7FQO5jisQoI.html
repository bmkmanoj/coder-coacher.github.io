threads welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down the concepts tools
and techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Aaron kitchen and
today we're continuing the fundamental
series with more than you ever needed to
know about mac addresses now this was
actually inspired by doe Raimi's comment
on YouTube last week about the packet
sniffing in here oh hey Darrin you
forgot to do a mac change that's not
safe
well thanks for the comment we read them
all and that is what's bringing us this
week to the terms now every computer on
a network needs an interface with a
unique identifier else how would Alice
know the difference between Bob and
Charlie that'd be awkward
anyway so for that we've got media
access control addresses otherwise known
as MAC addresses sometimes physical
addresses or Hardware dresses and
they're the identifier is unique to
every Nick on the planet MAC addresses
come in several schemes three mainly
mac-48 eui-48 and eui-64 now UI is just
short for extended unique identifiers
and covers well other devices and
software so not just necessarily network
hardware for example firewire xlviii
enta fires have an address space
containing about 281 trillion possible
addresses and aren't expected to run out
until year 2100 well UI sixty-four
dresses should be with us until we
colonize Eden prime or Raisa or New
Caprica your pick now I mentioned Nick
so what are those network interface
controllers also known as a network or
LAN adapter or simply a network
interface card since they're typically
an add-on card that plugs right into the
motherboard and well how did Nick's get
max OEE or I Triple E the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers
kind of a pretty hip group geeks
dedicated to advancing technology and
innovations and stuff and since the
1960's this nonprofit professional
associations been
standards for stuff that we love like
Ethernet which goes by I Triple E 802 3
or Wi-Fi which I know you've seen as I
Triple E 802 11 well with these things
the cool cat they just stole out these
nifty things called oh you eyes or
organizationally unique identifiers to
companies who manufacture networking
products the O UI is actually the first
three octet to the MAC address and as
the name implies its unique to every
every manufacturer so for example the
Linksys group has an O UI of zero zero
zero four five a and hex among ever a
bunch of others I mean they're a big
manufacturer now gear on the other hand
they've got an O you I of zero zero zero
nine five B let's go on a tangent for a
second here's a fun little piece of
trivia the MAC addresses were actually
born out of the Xerox Ethernet
addressing scheme which is why the OE
wipe or the Xerox Corporation starts
with zero zero zero zero zero zero
through zero nine anyway back on track
now this is pretty cool because MAC
addresses are burned into the NIC
meaning it's stored in the cards
Hardware well I mean sometimes it's
read-only memory or sometimes it's the
rewritable firmware but suffice it to
say if you run across a MAC address that
starts with Netgear zero you I the
device was probably manufactured by
Netgear or was it well in just a bit
we're gonna fire up our favorite Linux
security distro and get to modifying
your MAC address for good or for evil
take your pick
but first let's thank our excellent
sponsor now we all know that most guys
hate shopping for clothes luckily
there's Jack threads Jack threads is a
members only online shopping club that
does the dirty work for you and saves
you a boatload of cash every day Jack
thread serves up the hottest brands up
to eighty percent off what you'd pay in
a store now Jack threads is a private
club but luckily hack five has the
hookup oh and did we mention it's free
to join yeah
hit up jack threads.com slash hak5 and
you'll instantly
saving without having to leave the house
alright let's get to the practical stuff
here I'm going to begin in backtrack
Linux by issuing the if config command
which is going to tell me everything I
ever wanted to know about my network
interfaces here and using what we
learned the other week I'm going to pipe
the output of it into the input of grep
which is only going to show me what I
want to know which in this case is
anything on the same line as HW addr I
can see here that I have two interfaces
here I've got F 0 as well as W LAN 0 at
0 being my Ethernet adapter W LAN 0
being my wireless adapter now W LAN 0 is
Hardware address starts with the first 3
octets are 0 0 C 0 C a which if I go
ahead and look up I can find out that
that is the O UI of alpha incorporated
now I can actually change my MAC address
and there's probably a few ways are a
few reasons why I might want to for
example if I were a network
administrator I might want to set up
what's known as locally administrated
addresses rather than the universally
administrated addresses that come out of
the box seen from the factory say if I
were running a large organization and I
wanted to make some restrictions based
on MAC addresses
whereas on the other side of the coin if
I wanted to bypass those restrictions
imposed by administrators or maybe even
conceal my next true identity when
performing attacks and a whole bunch of
other fun stuff that we are so getting
into but I'll give you a real world
example I was at the San Francisco
Airport and they have complimentary
Wi-Fi there for up to 40 minutes and
then after 40 minutes the system kicks
you off and if you change your MAC
address it welcomes you right back on
for another 40 minutes I know this
because my flight was delayed and the 3G
sucks anyway so back in Linux I'm gonna
go ahead and change my address and
really to do this I only have to perform
3 commands first of all it's
ifconfig wlan0 which is my interface and
then down so I bring the interface down
our cards now office if config and then
the interface again W LAN 0 and this
time I want to say HW ether
and then an address so it can come up
with any six octet so long as the text
and it will become that I'm going to go
with the e ad e EF C 0 FP there we go
yeah that looks like fun and now I can
type if config W lands 0 up all right
and running if config on wlan0 now
reports the hardware address dead beef
copy guys that's fun now there is a lot
more to this that we're going to be
covering on future hack tips such as
multicast vs unicast and basically a
whole lot more in these fundamentals
series but first I'm gonna hear your
feedback what programs or commands are
rockin your world what technologies are
tickling your Technol us at me up tips

stuff just like this I'll be there
