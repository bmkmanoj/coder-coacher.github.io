monton from math club productions and
he's here to talk to us a little bit
about his online hacker drama lee chris
thanks so much for being here first of
all what is math club productions math
club productions is a home-brewed vid
casting production company that is
trying to provide entertainment through
the internets the internets the webs and
what we try we're trying to really
provide is a way of showing people that
they don't have to go for content just
from the regular broadcasting you know
your TV your TiVo you can get the stuff
out on the internet download it and
watch it at your leisure most of the
time math club productions came from
actually a social group that we have a
long time ago we were brought together
as a group of friends the producer and I
and we used to go to a bar and for some
reason we got labeled as the math club
or the geek squad or the spectacle squad
not mean I don't have blasted but the
other four did I was the bouncer of the
group I guess and they started calling
us the math club and we started calling
ourselves math club and next thing you
know we have 40 or 50 people in our
social group that started showing up and
we go see movies together we hang out
and we started networking not only
socially a business wise you know
someone who's in real estate would sell
a house to somebody in our group or find
someone we were really arguing over what
our name of our film was going to be and
or a production company and after
struggling with about seven names that
were already copyrighted or like you
know we already use half the people math
club the social group why not call it
math club productions so exactly what is
lete lete is a hacker term or online
term for being elite or a hacker explore
whatever you want to say and we came
about that name because one of the
things we were trying to do is while it
doesn't have found totally our shows a
dramatic show we wanted to be able to
tell people basically what the show was
going to kind of be about which is about
for hackers coming together they think
for hacking for good you know throughout
the season things kind of change and
take a downward spiral from there
so where'd the idea for an online hacker
drama come from uh you know the producer
now John we're sitting around we're
talking about podcast at that point and
this was back in August June and August
of last year and then one day the
bombings over an England happened and I
was just you know I woke up one that day
we had a meeting about doing a podcast
and I was just kind of like you know
wouldn't have been great if hackers
could have hacked as cell phones and
stop that whole thing and John was like
man we need to do something like that
and I said no I got an idea we just
started rolling with it next thing he
did is I'm very a DD so he's like start
writing this down Chris because that's
why I have him around he makes me write
things down makes me write things down I
say right now makes mean things right
down so i started doing we've got the
whole things written down within like
two hours so that's where it came from
so why take all this money in time to do
this production I just think this is
really the direction that that you know
this type of entertainment is going and
it's important to show people that in
the end you can do whatever you want to
set your mind to we hope to you know
kind of foster a sense that if you have
an idea with some production value and a
little bit of money you can do something
on your own and you know I just that's
one of the reasons why i think we draw
people into our production as because
everybody sees us doing things instead
of just talking about doing something so
what's been the biggest challenge doing
lead coordinating everybody I mean you
know you just don't know how big of a
task it is to edit and try to control
everybody and get people there on time
and also get the scenes you know you
think it seemed that would just kind of
come out being 30 seconds takes four
hours to shoot and people just don't see
that and I think that's one of the
biggest thing is managing time and being
able to do this when most of us have
second and third jobs what would you say
to any aspiring filmmakers that really
want to get into like online
broadcasting i would say instead of
saying that you need to like find a
company to work with or anything like
that i'd say look for people that you
can network with find someone who has a
camera find someone who does sound tell
them about your production and you'll
find people i mean that's really how we
were
you know I think we found our camel we
did find our camera and editor because
we were just talking about one day and
he was I'd love to do a project like
that and then the sum of our actors came
on that way and our latest director came
on and you know wow you guys are doing I
want to be part of something that's
being done instead of talked about so
where would you like to see Lee in about
a year from now we already have three
seasons roughly outlined we'd like to
have be on second our second season and
we'd like to start becoming a kind of a
mobile production company such as it
just instead of being stuck in Richmond
become more mobile with our production
and moving around and getting more you
know exotic locations like Washington DC
or something i knows where do you see
IPTV going in the next one to three
years it's incredible two or three years
ago I started seeing this trend of you
know alternative broadcast alternatives
to broadcasting and as far as this trend
goes I you know I hope it does take over
broadcasting because this is so much
more directed towards somebody who's
looking for specific content and it for
me it allows me to find what I want
watch it when I want and really if i
don't like it i just don't watch it
again you know or i'm not a slave to my
tivo or my TV of when it's coming on the
IPTV i think is going to split and
hopefully will grow into what more than
what they're talking about now i know
many companies are talking about it as a
backbone for a new way of developing and
distributing but i think if you also
incorporate these types of homebrew you
know shows in tues IPTV you could open
up a whole new floodgate of technologies
and ways it is forgetting to
entertainment and how can our viewers
find out more about math club
productions and about lead we are on the
WM at club I NC com is our main web page
you can also go on itunes where you can
learn search through 1 through 37 and
you'll find our production company off
of there and then we're also on pod
lounge out of australia
fire ant is another one that we're
listed on so Chris thanks so much for
joining us and I suggest everybody head
over to math club productions and check
out Lee it's a really awesome online
hacker drama vidcast that I think you
will all enjoy
look don't fool yourself maybe the petty
 that you've dealt with can be
forgotten
rationalize all you want the point is
your son needs you that should be your
focus his life always that simple for
you pots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
