Metasploit minute Metasploit minute is

hello and welcome to Metasploit minute
the breakdown on breaking in I'm your
host Rob fuller but you can call me
movies today we're gonna be talking
about something a little close to my
heart because I wrote it so kind of
disclaimer
it's the RSS feed plug-in now this RSS
feed plug-in what it does is right on
the tin it creates an RSS feed of what
this shells that you get so sessions
meterpreter sessions shall sessions
anything that you get coming in its
gonna add to an RSS feed now you might
be asking what so like why would I want
an RSS feed I can already look at what
sessions I have died you typing sessions
you taught me that well what if you're
out to lunch or sleeping or somewhere
else in the world other than at your box
looking at your shells
well I created this because I wanted a
way to be able to see alerts whenever I
got a session come in no matter where I
was so we're gonna start off by editing
this file just because of where the file
exists so let's look at what it what it
shows and we'll see what I mean so in
Metasploit framework depending on where
you have this set it can be in user
share on on Kali inside of the plugins
directory there is the I can type
correctly the RSS feed plugin so we if
we look in here we can see that this
plug-in is a class of event RSS which is
basically an MSF plug in the session
events basically says add event generate
the feed and then you can edit these
scripts however you wish so it says
whatever you want so MSF console you can
make it says say Rubik is RSS feed of
Awesomeness or or shell shell shells or
however you want to make it say and then
down here is what I
want to get to so this RSS feed says
feed RSS which is pretty generic
most of the times you want RSS XML or
atom XML or how everyone but most feed
readers can handle any file type or any
file name so let's reddit this just to
make it easy we're gonna put it in temp
and share and we'll leave it feed RSS
the reason I'm changing the directory is
because by default it sends it to the
Metasploit directory or whatever the
current working directory of wherever
you are so unless you want to share out
the rest of your Metasploit directory I
highly recommend changing this directory
so it goes in somewhere that you can
share out without giving away your rest
of the stuff so nginx web server however
you want to share it out we're going to
be using the Ruby web server we've been
using the season but it's up to you so
let's go in and that's the only file
change that we really need to do then we
go into our temp share so we need to
load our RSS feed reader alright so we
loaded our suite and that's it you
really don't have to do any editing or
anything else than that if you want the
RSS feed to go into the Metasploit
directory that's fine there's no options
right now we're actually gonna make
changes to that later on but that's not
really where we're starting with so
waiting for a shell we're gonna check
our handler just because the last take
we did on this I didn't have her handler
running and we don't again yay
why did X late you know what set exit on
session let's see what it's it ISIF Oh
hopefully our handler will actually stay
running this time because it seems to
not be who's keeping running every time
we tell you would take on this no go
back over got our share stand up our
Ruby let's just watch for the RSS feed
oh it's already there so let's see
what's in there by default it just tells
you that the plug-in is loaded it will
also segment Metasploit one session open
door - wait - or mature procession one
two three open and we're gonna see that
by giving us a show now if you're
watching our last episode you know how
we're gonna do this by turning on our
stupid VM that keeps turning off not not
angry at all so we're gonna get our
shell because we actually have our
stupid VM up and running again and of
course we typed it wrong are ya fine
work this time not angry at all there we
go
save that no visible problems let's see
if we got our show we switch over to our
attacker alright so we hit we see our
session created
there's the updated date and we have our
session so all we have to do from here
is set up our web server or have it copy
automatically over or however you want
to set this up go to something like if
then then else if then than that I'm
sorry and have it go to your watch so
have a push notification go directly to
your phone as soon as a new RSS feed or
item goes in and then you have updates
and alerts about your shells wherever
you are so you can do your root dance at
the airport or in a restaurant or
whatever you want let me know what you
think email me at MSF at hack 5 org and
