intense scrutiny the US charges nine
Iranians and university hacks and was
goose' 42.0 really working for the
Russian government all that coming up
now on threat wires greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for March 27 2018 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom our patreon is over at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that
is always the best way to support the
show and will help us reach our next
goal so if you want access to exclusives
check out the patreon link in the show
notes below and now onto the news
and guess what we're talking about this
week that's right Facebook again a lot
of news has surfaced regarding Facebook
and Cambridge analytic a since we last
discussed it on the show due to the
concerns over security I would also like
to mention again that you can check out
my 30-day security challenge that I
wrote on my personal site which is sinem
see calm which walks through security
settings on Facebook this week has
surfaced some new information as well as
Zucker bird's response to the outrage
according to Mark Zuckerberg who spoke
publicly about the misuse data last week
Facebook would be taking several steps
to ensure better privacy of its users
this includes an app audit for any
applications that had access to data
before 2014 including a potential banned
for any developers who don't agree to
the audit developers will have
restricted access to data and the app
will lose access to that data if the
user has not used the app in three
months lastly Facebook is also
introducing a new tool in the newsfeed
so users can view and revoke data access
more easily than going to the security
settings but it is not all sunshine and
rainbows in Facebook land in an
interview with motherboard Cogan the app
developer whose app was used for data
collection by Cambridge analytic I felt
that he was a scapegoat
and was stunned to find himself at the
middle of this crazy scandal the money
that his company did bring in was used
to pay survey respondents according to
him now Cambridge analytic 'since it is
based in the UK
also being confronted with possible
legal repercussions as one Facebook user
decided to pursue legal action against
the company after going through the
European Union and English law which
allows for anyone to request data from
Cambridge analytical
he discovered that his American voter
files were not being exclusively stored
in the US but rather with this company
so the American citizen sued for full
transparency from Cambridge analytical
on top of that Cambridge analytical or
CA for short their offices in London
were also rated in a seven-hour search
on Friday evening by the Information
Commissioner's Office assessment and
analysis of the data will be required
before the I cos next steps are
published this news broke soon after the
CEO of the company
Alexander Nicks was suspended and an
Acting CEO Aleksandr Taylor was
appointed CA also stated that Wylie who
originally leaked the information to new
sources was not actually a founder of
the company and was a part-time
contractor for one year now here in the
u.s. Facebook is taking heat from
attorney generals in New York and
Massachusetts who are demanding that
they undergo an investigation and
handover more details about its data
handling users started a campaign called
hashtag delete Facebook which Facebook
said has not had much impact Facebook
security chief Alex Stamos is planning
to step down from the company in August
of this year now with all of this
unsettling information about Facebook
arising it should kind of come at no
surprise that news surfaced about the
incoming national security adviser and
his ties to Cambridge analytic a John
Bolton super PAC used CA in 2014 to
build micro targeting messaging to users
from Facebook user data it should be
said though that using data in general
by political figures to create targeted
messaging is definitely not out of the
ordinary
the FTC in a statement late last week
also said that it is investigating the
social network based on a 2011
settlement that forced Facebook to
undergo privacy screenings for the next
20 years this case was about the site's
opt-in by default settings in which a
change to
security settings of the site
automatically made previously private
data from users suddenly public instead
Facebook did not claim guilt though they
did agree to these privacy screenings
till twenty thirty one media outlets
also started reporting on the Facebook
app permissions which have been widely
known and scrutinized in the security
industry honestly for quite some time
Facebook has the ability to collect
metadata about calls and texts made or
received on Android phones now I should
mention that same data cannot be
collected via the app on iOS devices so
take note as of Android 6.0 this can be
turned off by going into the settings on
your phone
choosing apps then choosing permissions
and turning off whatever settings you
don't want Facebook to have access to or
you could do what I did a while back and
just delete the app entirely off your
phone that totally works - on Friday the
US Department of Justice announced that
they would be charging nine Iranians
with multiple cases from conspiracy to
commit computer intrusions wire fraud
and Computer Fraud to aggravated
identity theft each of the hackers were
affiliated or associated with the madnes
Institute of Iran a company that has
been behind many infiltrations of US
universities foreign universities
private companies government agencies
and even the United Nations Children's
Fund the madnes Institute and the
defendants involved stole 31 terabytes
of intellectual property and academic
data from universities and used email
accounts of employees this makes about
15 billion pages of data including
academic journals dissertations
electronic books and a lot more the
university's targeted by the group pavéd
3.4 billion USD for the research that
was stolen and eight thousand accounts
were compromised with more than one
hundred thousand professor inboxes
targeted across the globe many of these
hacks were on behalf of the exec
Republic of Iran's Revolutionary Guard
corpse the Department of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control also
sanctioned mamta and the defendants for
the activities now during the
announcement the Treasury Department
also announced sanctions again
behzod Mussoorie who was charged for the
hacking of HBO and the leaking of Game
of Thrones last summer
the men are all on FBI's most wanted
list and they face arrest or extradition
in more than 100 countries the
announcement comes just a week after the
US government announced sanctions
against Russia as well for alleged
online propaganda during the election
cycle as well as attacks against US
companies and electrical grids remember
that hack of the Democratic National
Committee or the DNC for short which
happened back in 2016 during the u.s.
presidential campaign yeah I remember
that too the individual behind the hack
who goes by the name gusoff ur 2.0
slipped up and is now being tied to the
Russian military intelligence called the
GRU back in 2016 this hacker took full
credit for releasing DNC documents to
Wikileaks including stolen emails now
while his or her identity is still not
certain one thing has become quite clear
the person behind goose' 42.0 was
allegedly Russian that's been the theory
for quite some time but nothing tied
them to being a state-sponsored hacker
gusoff ur 2.0 hid themselves behind a
VPN and they denied ties to Russia but
according to a post by The Daily Beast
which includes no technical information
I might add gusoff ur once forgot to
turn on their VPN exposing their IP
address and location during social media
use US investigators were able to find
the IP address at the GRU headquarters
in Moscow linking goose' 42.0 to the
state-sponsored intelligence agency now
if this is found to be true and the
hacker is indeed tied to Russian
intelligence then the link could have
serious implications for the Republican
President Donald Trump if you are a
