resources in Linux and this hack tip is
brought to you by Eero welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Shannon Morse and today we are
talking about monitoring system
resources in the terminal now I have
already talked previously on hack tip
about PS kill and top commands those
videos are really great primers but
there is a lot more to monitoring system
resources than just those commands so in
the next two episodes I'm going to delve
farther into how you can use these let's
talk about some new commands that can be
very useful so to start let's go ahead
and review PS with some new options PS
so PS by itself lists your current
processes if I bring this up in my
computer and hit PS you'll see that I'm
running bash and PS and that is it so
this by itself can be very useful if you
just want to see what's running on your
machine that's currently open taking it
a step further you can type in PS ox
like so and this brings up a slew of
information so this list processes for
all users which is the a the ulis user
oriented processes in the X list
processes that don't have a controlling
terminal screen so you're pretty much
gonna get everything from your computer
now once you get your list I'm not gonna
cover which each and every column means
because I already did that previously
now since this lists all of those
different processes it is gonna be a
very long list I can look for a specific
process itself by grouping it so we have
already talked about grep as well so I
could type in PS ox pipe to grep and
I'll specifically look for Chrome and it
looks like I have one process running
Chrome right now that's good but if I
open Chrome
I'll just restore anything that I had on
here like hack 5 and I'll just minimize
that so we can come back here I will
open that up again this time we see that
Chrome is running a lot of processes
when you actually open it as you
user so this is going to show me the
data for each chrome process if you want
to make the big list more organized but
you still want to see all processes you
can add the F option so I'll hit up a
couple of times add an F and then hit
enter so if I look through here you will
find that certain processes have a lot
of additional processes with them key
base is a great example up here and if I
scroll down a little bit you'll see that
chrome is pretty much the same way so
that's interesting that could be useful
for us in the future
spoiler alert next thing I could type in
is PS uppercase you snubs and that is
going to show me every single process
that is running under my user account
and obviously it doesn't have to list
that they're all snubs because they
obviously are because that's what I
searched for then if you find something
that you don't want running you can
always use kill again to kill the
process so for example if I want to kill
key base I'll just scroll up and find
key base real quick let's see the main
command is two one five eight so I will
use kill two one five eight and then
that will kill key base but it does
leave the other key based processes
under different pits so I could instead
use kill all key base hit enter and then
that will kill all the processes with
the name key base in it now there are a
few options available for kill so make
sure that you check out the man page for
kill as well because they can be very
very useful and I will mention more
about that in just a moment but we are
going to take a quick break and thank
our sponsor when you are looking to
improve your wireless network making
sure your entire home has a strong
signal is a must and that is where Iiro
comes in they are launching their very
first second generation mesh Wi-Fi
system that comes with one arrow and one
to two beacons and these are mesh access
points they are not extenders they are
smaller they also plug into an outlet
they have an ambient nightlight and they
are more powerful than the originals but
of course if you already have the
original arrow has you covered as well
these babies are backwards compatible
and they can be purchased separately
systems start at 399 for all three
components together but if you want to
just buy one beacon you can totally do
that as well you can
and they're cheaper than the originals
at 149 each we've gotten a chance to
test these out in the warehouse where
our Wireless usually does not reach from
one end to another the Ebro mesh does a
really great job of fixing that headache
and it gives me the speeds that I pay
for from my ISP plus it was really easy
to set up and it's also very reliable so
arrow is also announcing the ero plus
subscription which includes advanced
network security monitoring
supplementing the features that are
already built in that you get for free
with the device and they also include
content filtering which is really great
for houses with kids and with any system
you get automatic updates two-factor
authentication for the admin access and
eros backing with a bug bounty program
and third party audits we've got a
coupon code for you two for free

hack tip to make it free check it out
and learn more at eurocom we are now
back with monitoring system resources so
I have mentioned it before but it is
definitely worth a ream ention you can
type top to run a dynamically updating
list of processes and see how much CPU
each of your different processes is
running so if I type in top you will see
all these different processes now if I
do something in Chrome like I will load
up let's see
I'll load up my YouTube account and then
watch the processes as I should pause
that that was really loud okay so if I
look at top then it will show me that
the processes are taking up a whole
bunch of CPU the ones with the most CPU
usage are at the top so you can easily
look at that and kill the process that
are taking up the most area on your CPU
I've already gone over all the details
about what everything up here at the top
of top needs so check my previous hack
tip episode along with my terrible
presenting skills from five years ago in
the show notes below but something that
is really cool the top is you can simply
press K like that and then you see this
additional line show up right here and
if I want to kill Chrome I'll type in
three four eight three
hit enter it asks me this weird thing
about 15 sig term whatever hit enter and
then it kills chrome cool so I should
probably mention what that 15 meant so
it's basically a signal identification
number for kill so some common ones that
you might run into are TAC 1 which hangs
up controlling processes that have died
tack 15 terminates processes gracefully
by killing any stray files or processes
along with that pit and tack 9 stops all
the things and just kills everything it
out out there for that process so that's
kind of like the blue screen of death
version I guess it just ends everything
even if you haven't saved it so I will
end with a very simple command that can
just list open files on a system
everything on a Linux file system is
considered a file so while I just have
this text file opened up on in the
background on my my username for example
there's actually a whole bunch of other
stuff open too so the command LS o F
will list all the files open which kind
of makes sense given the the terminology
there on your machine but much of it
requires root access so if I quit
outta top and I did that with Q and then
type in LS Oh F and it's going to list a
slew of stuff here and again that means
root access
where else each of the files will say
permission denied no worries there
though we are just giving you an example
here you can also add the attack you
option to that and then snubs to see all
the files that are open just first snubs
particularly and that's about it for now
