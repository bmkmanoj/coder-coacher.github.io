by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is Darren kitchen it's your
weekly dose of technolo so welcome to
the show very excited yeah because
you're about to disappear my cousin's
gonna take your place well I guess
that's all we need that'll work we'll go
with that actually my elbow just
switched the camera kill Mike all right
so I'm gonna fire up our FCAT and use my
yardstick one now one of the things I
like to do I could have done this in the
first place is use the spectrum analyzer
that's built into RF cat ooh you know
what I don't think we've demoed the
spectrum analyzer that's built into RF
so yeah this is a great time for those
all you do is type d dot spec again in
the interactive Python show and Dada
spectrum analyzer what is 8 but what
frequency are we looking at oh we're
looking at 900 megahertz okay so it
defaults tonight it defaults to going
from 902 to 9 28 which is there's 900
megahertz I am banned in the u.s. lots
of fun stuff so if I close the window
and then I just say deed us back in 300
million or 300 t6 sure then I get
something that goes from 300 to 320 so
just like before we would so we wouldn't
even need a software-defined radio
technically except we just wanted to see
what was there right it doesn't seem as
good-looking as the FFT that we were the
osmocon FFT no because it's a crude or
implementation but it's super useful
especially if you don't have SDR at your
at your fingertips this is one way I
should be able to pick up a signal Oh
big huge spike around wow t megahertz
but notice this looks like it's just
above 315 megahertz the hack RF told us
it was just below 315 you know not quite
a few bigger swing friends right right
there are there's a distinct step size
it's it's tuning the radio to one
frequency measuring the
power than tuning the radio to the next
week I'm saying very very I the that's
why it doesn't seem as fast exactly it's
not as fast it's not as precise but it's
still useful that is actually I'm gonna
increase the length of my telescopic
antenna here to be closer to 315
megahertz but yeah if I punch in numbers
and then hit my things yeah it goes
there it is I probably didn't even need
my antenna tuned very precisely since my
close range but it's a quick and easy
way to just sort of verify that the the
yardstick one is receiving the same
signal nice that I was getting on my car
f1 so let's take a look at what we can
do and one of the things I love about RF
cat is that it gives you this
interactive Python shell yes if people
aren't familiar with ipython that's what
this is based on ipython and it gives
you things like help you can do help on
this object D and say like oh these are
all the different things I can do with D
it's amazing I mean you can it's cool
explore the help system and you can also
import files so I have a little text
file oh so if you've already written
like a function or something you can
just pull it right in and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do if I where is it it's
somewhere around here I start I have
this little program called SL dot Pi and
here it is and one of the things I like
to do is flip back and forth between a
text editor and an interactive Python
shell so if I have something like this
interactive Python shell I can just load
it in to Python hmm but let's do
something just a little but since it's a
little bit interactive it yeah or I get
to that let me do a couple things I see
where this is going
let me just set the frequency what is it
set freak completion is awesome 314 980
I'll do which is the precise frequency
that I got out of in spectrum and then
I'll set the modulation what is it Maju
I think it's MDM oh right right modem
modulation remember this is a digital
modem on a chip and I'll set it to the
what is it mod
there we go love the tab-completion and
then I need to set the data rate which
is set modem date D rate right yep d
rate
oops there I can't type but here we go
20 450 that's what I got so you're
talking 2450 we've been doing it as a
fraction of a second okay
well sirs so this is this is two this is
two thousand four hundred and fifty time
units per second right okay that makes
sense right so it's the it's the rate in
symbols person baud that's exactly it's
a pod rate that's exactly what since
it's a modem it that makes more sense
now yeah
so now this is where we could just start
doing like d dot R listen okay and start
caption and if we are capturing stuff
and we start getting garbage and if I
type in a code and try to transmit
something like this nothing seems to be
happening the little LED on this goes on
like it's transmitting but I don't get
anything and the reason we're listening
on the frequency in a modulation and at
the right data rate so if it sent
something you should receive it you
would think so but this modem has a
couple of features that need to be set
up hour for it to correctly identify
that a packet is happened one of the
things that it looks for we have to tell
it the preamble or something we have to
tell it about the preamble and we have
to tell it about a sync word or a
synchronization word or sometimes that's
called an access code some kind of a
predictable sequence of bits that it
should look for at the beginning of a
packet Oh cuz otherwise we might just
get a bunch of garbage because of
ionosphere or something right hmm so
here's what I like to do I like to say
now we the type of preamble that it
looks for is one zero one zero one zero
one zero which is what we've been
finding a lot of and most of these
consumer devices but remember on this
device it started out with something
that looks like one one zero it's like
one zero one one zero
right right this thing is waltzing not
to steppings so we need to actually turn
off the preamble detection function and
the way we do that okay I was about to
say can't we just go into raw mode or
something yeah something like that
we could just have it like continuously
demodulate for us but we do want it to
actually like give us chunks yeah yeah
it would be nice to kind of use the
features than the modem the best we can
I'm gonna refer to my little cheat sheet
here set packet PQ t which d dot set
packet PQ t that is preamble quality
threshold and I'm going to tell it to
use a preamble quality threshold of zero
nice so now when you rerun that well I
have one more thing to do and that is I
need to give it a sync word I need to
tell it what pattern of bits to look for
and what I want to give it is something
that's like one one zero one one zero
one one zero
now if you look we're just gonna guess
who's like I'm gonna use a hex value or
here's what I here's what I did in my
little script I use this this value Oh 6
dB
but if you look at 6 dB if you do a bin
0 6 dB OOP I don't know how to type
there you can see that this is the
pattern 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
yeah so if I want if I wanted to take
like a 16-bit router and that's that's
what I'm looking for that would be it in
fact you could go D dot set modem sync
word and just type it in finer if you
want like 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 so if
you have to make sure that you give it
16 bits did I do that right looks like 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8
that's totally wrong oh oh you know what
because I had some zeros at the
beginning but that's ok anyway that's
one way you could do it is just by
binary or you give it a hex number but
either way is looking for 16 bits it
wants to try to do a pattern match and
find 16 bits at the beginning of the
package so now it's set with the right
frequency and the right modulation and
the right
data rate and it's set with the right
sink word so hopefully this time and
it's ignoring the preamble okay so if we
do an RF listen again now let's try
chants mitting a packet and we also
didn't get a bunch of garbage okay hey
now do you see how there's a bunch of
stuff here where you see like 6 DB C 60
B ZB and in this next chunk 60 there we
see like a amble we're seeing a lot of
repetition yes right that's good and
that is a very good indication that
during those periods of times we're
seeing things that we're seeing actual
information let's try this again okay if
I'd entering a different code and hit
the lock button there we go we get some
more junk on the screen now what are we
gonna do with this junk I don't know
okay gonna process it somehow we are I
turn it into I mean is there a way to
systematically just type that into the I
mean you've written a function obviously
I have okay but what here's what here's
what we're gonna do I'm gonna go take
I'm gonna go look at this text file that
I started which gives me this rx SL
function which sets up my radio in the
same way that I just did and it also
gives me the a little routine that's
similar to that RF listen mm-hmm and
allows me to do it like this so here's
here's what I do here's the cool thing
is in Python yeah you just go percent
run SL dot py mmm and it just imported
that nice and so now I - are using I
have that rxs cell function and oops
wait I have to give it a parameter then
now now here's what happens you see how
it looks very similar except I've
trimmed it down because I've given it a
packet length right I saw that right
over to that divider that was the nice
thing 3f Len
so I'm only taking 30 bytes at a time
because because it what does it is just
more hidden freedom bactrim we didn't we
didn't really look at this but in
spectrum there was this repeated pattern
you would see the same packet of
information repeated several times
what's the reason for that oh well there
are multiple reasons for that most but
most likely is reliability they're not
really sure that the that the receiver
is going to receive any one packet and
so one super easy cheap way to increase
reliability is just the same the same to
send the same thing several times and
trust that the receiver will get at
least one of them so you just start
screaming yeah
Open Sesame it's Open Sesame it's over
yes right okay go exactly just like when
you hold down the button on our on a
garage door open it generates a code and
then it starts transmitting that same
code over and over and over and over and
over until you release the button right
and they also know that you know the
angry user given just a one button
device he's gonna keep jamming the
buttons so at least right yeah so what I
do here is I is I pretty much set things
the way that I that I did before but
notably I set this packet length and so
what happens is whereas up here I was
getting like one long transmission kind
of arbitrarily carved up into three big
chunks and now I'm carving it up into
smaller chunks but notice that some of
them are aligned with each other very
precise you see these last five yeah
it's like a they all looked identical
what might that be
that's probably means that I'm actually
aligning to the beginning of the packet
properly nice and then with these other
ones I wasn't quite aligned to the
beginning of the packet and so they're
all kind of offset in some way because
it's just in the time domain matters
like when you're actually listening is
that a is that something in the
yardstick so this is the reason why it's
not always aligned correctly is because
we're not using preamble detection which
would normally help the clock recovery
and
get synchronized correctly and because
our sync word is not a labeled that well
we are using a sync okay but but we're
using a very non distinct sync word
we're using a sync where I'm saying I
don't know how to know that matters in
many different places right Norma so
this is the one where you just guessed
some binary saying like well when you
see binary yeah kind of
so like nor normally in a more
sophisticated not much more
sophisticated but a little bit more
sophisticated radio system you'll see a
preamble followed by a sync word right
which is what we've been seeing and so
we see the one zero one zero one zero
and we're like okay well that's our
clock we're not we don't care about that
we care about the good stuff that comes
right after so yeah we had one of those
then we would have gotten in step with
it right the preamble helps you get in
step the sync word then identifies
exactly which step is the start of the
packet gotcha
so in this case though since it's
sending it over and over and over I
don't care that some of these are out of
sync yeah enough of them are in sync
that I could see the patterns there and
I could ignore the rest so here's what I
did I wrote this little function that I
will just import into my program here
called valid here packet valid oops and
the packet valid function all it's doing
is just checking to see a few bit values
it's doing a sanity or byte values it's
doing a sanity check just to make sure
that this packet is aligned the way I
think it should be right so we've
already determined it's 30 bits right
but this is going to make sure that it's
also so here's what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna go into here and say I a packet
from my RF receive function I'm going to
say if packet valid and hand it my
packet then I will print out that packet
that's all I'm doing is having a little
sanity check now I go back to our F cat
and I'm just going to re-import that
oops
Oh since it's live sweet look at that
guess what I forgot to do yeah you know
of course why would you close that there
we go yeah okay so now if I run the same
command the same function and I type a
code and hit the lock or unlock look at
those oh nice housing will you try it
again a different code I'll hit the lock
look at that
check that out we're totally seeing each
time I hit so I've hit the I've hit the
lock or unlock button three times and
you can see three different patterns of
codes that were transmitted so we see
that these different sequences of bits
are being transmitted and if you do
something like like this let me take
this 4:9 tube this section in the middle
here and if I were to do that's this is
hexadecimal encoded right if I wanted to
look at the actual just turns in symbols
that would be transmitted I could turn
that into binary I like like so and I
can see oh it was one zero zero one zero
zero see this is a short short short
short short short short short long long
long long short right I can I can read
it right there
but these aren't the actual bits that
were transmitted these are the symbols
that were transmitted and we don't know
what symbol is one right what do you do
you might you might call it a chip that
was you have to transmit four digits I
have to here's one annual of this thing
tells you you have to go four to eight
digits okay so you can send a lock or
one one one one
send that to to do you send that and
then start to create your own little
rosetta stone of what those should be
yes but to get started what I'd like to
do is to take every group of three bits
and turn it into a every group of three
symbols or little units of time and turn
it into one bit alright I only have a
little different pattern light because
this is actually both with modulated so
I have two three bits is going to be one
bit and then from there we'll actually
get our bites
exactly nice okay I have another little
form
that I prepared I'm going to bring this
in and what is it called eco no that
would be bad too right yes I have this
PWM decode function okay now this is a
little bit complicated probably because
I like wrote it in my hotel room late at
night or it might have been the hotel
bar and but all it's doing it's probably
not the cleanest implementation here but
what it's doing is bitwise manipulation
to just take a group of three bits and
then spit out one bit it's either it's
either going to get all it's going to
detect that it was a long pulse or a
short short pulse and then spit out
either a 1 1 or a 0 and the way I do
that actually is just by looking at the
middle of those 3 bits if you think
about it because it's either yes right
the first point is always high the last
one is always low it's just that middle
bit that changes so all I have to do is
even easier than mention whether 1 out
of every 3 bits and then and then
collapse those together that's all this
function is too cool so then I'm gonna
take the way that the way that I do this
is I pull it out and I'm just encoding
it as hexadecimal so I'm going to do I'm
going to now instead of printing out the
hex that I have before now I'm going to
actually decode that hex into into this
decoded hex version and pray until it's
expecting right right so I'm say I'm
turning symbols into bits got it that's
the plan so there's a little bit of
trickiness
in terms of that bitwise manipulation
and a little tricky nough sin terms of
getting aligned correctly but but some
spammed itself long enough we've got
what we think haven't yet - we have wave
having enough information right now it's
interesting that you grab the center bit
because the repeating pattern at the
beginning in the end it's probably just
saying hi I'm this manufacturer or I'm
this device right and of setting it up
it's the middle stuff that's the good
stuff or exactly yeah so so now if I run
this
and run this function have to give it my
dongle no oh so this is gonna happen
live now so you can just type it in
again no I just hit five five five five
I think
or maybe I hit five five five by five
anyway here let me do zero zero zero
zero oh yeah a one two three four four
zeros block there we go
how about eight zeros one two three four
five six seven eight block look at that
Oh what if I do ones one two three four
five six seven hey I just did eight ones
oh look at that
haha when we had zeros we had yeah we
have ones resulted in YZ which is a good
indication that were bit we're flipped
right like we're always zeros where
interpreting services I'm gonna end of
the day who cares right so we go in here
and we say when we're when we're
interpreting these bits we're just going
to XOR them with one and that is that
Zaire again flips them so let me run
this again and try again I'm gonna do a
zero zero zero zero so I'll get YZ
instead of F's now I do one one one one
lakh now I do one two three four five
six seven eight block look at that okay
so we have the bit the byte order is or
the nibble order isn't quite correct but
it's easy to see now right if I if I do
like nine nine nine nine lakh
okay so so this is like the first the
first digit then the second digit and
the third fourth and the fifth and the
sixth and the same rolled over so if
there are unused ones it encodes those
with it with apps yeah so this is kind
of an interesting encoding it never uses
an a a B a C or a deal yeah it only uses
them so it actually uses the numerals in
the Hat yes yeah which is kind of weird
but but it works and it's then it's like
a nibble
why's function some engine or somewhere
feels like well how am I gonna transmit
a bunch of digits all right well I know
hex does digits now let me show you
something
nein nein nein nein unlock so you see
the difference between nine nine nine
versus two one versus two so so this
this digit here so basically I've got
all my byte reversed but I'm not gonna
bother fixing that because it's obvious
but it's obvious that okay so one is
unlock a two is lock or I can't reverse
the other way around I don't but it lets
you you can very easily see that the
unused digit positions are apps and then
these these eight positions are where
the numerals are coded this byte here is
always a 1 or a 2 and then this byte
here at the beginning notice how it
changes every single time we have
everybody's what do you think that might
be I think that's a checksum I actually
have my oh I have the bid you have
another to do this lately reversed here
oh that's just because it's the timing
so the checksum is actually pretty easy
to figure out in this case and check
sums are typically fairly easy to
reverse engineer something it is like
what would just since you're just got a
head throw something at the wall and see
if it sticks like what would you guess
the first thing I would check the first
thing I would try especially in a case
where it's only an 8-bit checksum right
right sometimes you see 16 or 32-bit CRC
s or something and there's a more
complicated algorithm but they're common
enough that you can use brute force
tools to determine what they are we
probably don't need to do that when it's
only an 8-bit checksum it's probably
something simple like like a nibble wise
or a bite wise probably buy twice as
eight bits adding up all the previous
bytes right something like that and you
can kind of figure that out like if I
make all the previous bytes 2 3 4 5 6 7
if I go out 0 0 0 0 all those all 8
zeros and you get happy look at that
what's F EE plus 1 I don't know what is
that field plus 1 that would be F at F F
okay
two three four five six seven eight
unlock all right so lock is a one unlock
is it - oh I got like one of a spurious
guys that are going to ignore but but
notice that when I had a one there you
had a fee when I had a fee a little
saline add up to fi I do idealizes
various one and five six one followed by
seven right zeroes now things and now I
get an EE but notice that that one is in
that is an imposition
so before right anyway yes we can figure
this out fairly quickly you do have to
be a little careful sometimes sometimes
if you just get a couple of test cases
and you say oh I know what the outer
make an assumption and then right yeah
and then it turns out that your
assumption doesn't work for every case
so you have to try a bunch of different
things to do verify how that checksum
works this is this is probably one of
the reasons why we started out with
replay attacks because it's kind of dumb
simple and like you don't have to
understand the protocol you just have to
send the packet again right what we can
do this is nice though because we could
make the assumption that you don't know
the pass code
you only have physical access to the key
fob and not that and so by doing exactly
what you're doing now I imagine the next
step could be to try all the
combinations it could be right and and
this is the reason that reversing the
checksum is so important is because it
it shows it provides a path to other
types of other avenues of attack like
brute force you can't do a brute force
easily I mean you can do a brute force
by just trying all the codes but that
takes forever but right you just try you
know I'd be landfill of tiling all the
phone numbers in your area code or
exchange who would do that I would do
that 13900 weird well most people who
did that use an automated tool to do
that a word dialer yes
if and if we wanted to make a war dialer
for this particular lock we would want
to have our automated tool be able to
produce those checksums properly and so
now at this point I think we really
fully reverse-engineered there's no
factly it was on this thing yeah
everything that this thing can transmit
we know how to interpret we know how to
retransmit ourselves sweet so with that
you could I mean since you're in the
interactive Python environment here
actually at this point you don't even
need to decode anything you could write
a program that just spams all 10,000
possibilities right there's a Python
program that you can always use against
this one particular lock and get to the
liquor in your parents house or whatever
is behind this lock I mean this is
motivation where as hackers we have to
have a reason to be hacking right you
know the song okay well anyway either
way no there's still really cool it I
love that as an example of of using both
the SDR side of it and the modem side
that is the RF cat or RF cat with the
yardstick one right
that is fantastic where would you go
from here not like we're going to but
well from here you know there are kind
of two different avenues one one is to
do stuff with the yardstick one and some
one is to use do stuff with a girl both
are capable of doing everything that
we've done today it's just that some are
more convenient for different parts of
the probably know one of the other is
more convenient for different parts of
the process of reverse engineering but
if we wanted to transmit signals if we
wanted to do a replay attack we can do
it either way we can replay the raw IQ
data that we restore that we stored from
Osmo common fft we could replay that
with hack RF or we can rotate enough to
touch any Python right it's super easy
we what goes in code goes out you can't
explain it you wouldn't even need to
understand what the modulation is but if
you want to do more sophisticated things
like a brute force attack then you have
to understand what the modulation is you
have to decode it you have to reverse
the CRC that we've done and once we do
that we could actually transmit bits
using the yardstick one solution but we
would need a few more functions in
Python if we want to take say like the
the sequence of of interpreted data bits
or at a two bytes that we have and turn
that back into 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 etc
those symbols right we would need to
write a couple more functions in Python
to do that in the other direction and
then we can transmit those it's
transmitting with our FCAT is just as
easy as receiving with our FCAT and so
once you've got it set up that makes so
much sense if you haven't been doing
that and I love just seeing how like wow
that makes it so much easier than
dealing with clock recovery just put
that out there maybe next time we have
you on maybe yes
we get out the word or tune into Mike's
just wonderful videos I really can't
speak highly enough about these because
I I can personally vouch to somebody
who's taken Mike's class Mike goes
around teaching SDR at conferences and
such and the way that you describe the
theory is such that like even a noob
like myself could understand it and walk
away like oh so if you want that go and
watch your videos yeah even if you're
just starting out with an RTL SDR
although you know although caveat yeah I
still haven't gotten the clock recovery
in my videos I will yeah well nobody
goes in and I haven't gotten to it yet
but it's coming up fairly soon ok rad
well hey thanks so much is there
anything that we haven't touched on
regarding this that we should have
telescopic antennas ok yeah you know
actually I'm gonna throw you for a loop
yeah because because that's what you get
with the yardstick and so you just leave
it like this because it's more
convenient or no no you put all the way
out because then you look more hacker
cool right right but you might have
noticed that I set these up to be about
the same length because generally
speaking you want a telescopic antenna
to perform the best you want it to be
about 1/4 of the wavelength what what
wavelength is
well you / see and then you're done
right so you take seed which is 300
million meters per second just so
happens to be a constant yeah and you
divide that by your frequency so 300
million meters per second mm-hmm divided
by our frequency which is about 300
million is about 1 meter right so we're
dealing with Roly but we're not doing
without doing full wavelength though
exactly we want to go to a quarter
wavelength so 300 so we have a water of
one meter is about this tall yeah so I
just set these to be about a quarter of
a meter tall and so anytime you have a
telescopic antenna you have the power to
tune your antenna to whatever wavelength
you want and with certain antennas like
this you can maybe rotate it I returned
them in different directions right the
most important feature is that it can it
can change that can change lengths and
so you want to kind of tune it as closes
it don't have to be perfect but you want
to write as close as you can to about a
quarter wavelength and these things can
be a little bit fragile and so just a
tip like can it collapse um one segment
at a time like so instead of going just
because you will you will bend your
antenna that way okay especially when
it's all the way out so just collapse it
one at a time and they say I don't know
if this is absolutely essential but they
say like if you want it to be like at
this length you do it like so you extend
it all the way and then push it and
collapse it into this top segment
instead of just oh instead of pulling up
like the top part I'm not sure actually
if the performance is any different but
the durability is different yes well
that's that's one thing there you go
another little RF tip fun facts about
telescopic antenna mic is full of those
oh man
Mike - like you've been just on a roll
lately between hack RF and yardstick 1
and I know you've got other fun things
coming do want to talk about either of
those or let people know where they can
find all of that fun stuff when it comes
well everything that I do is usually
found on great Scot gadgets comm and
that's where my SDR video series is of
course
so anybody who's interested in going
through that it's all open content and
available for everyone and any new
exciting things that we're working on
either get posted to the blog there or
mentioned on our mailing list that you
can sign up for at gryska kaijus calm
alright hey Mike thank you so much a
pleasure as always and yes really go
check that out is all the videos are on
the archive board they're fantastic
thanks for having me
yeah likewise that's just about wraps up
this week's episode of hack 5 but before
we get going a couple of fun
announcements hope you guys have been
joining enjoying even the SDR series
Chinon you did a little playlist about
that huh yes I did
I was like did I do that playlist I did
it's on youtube.com slash hack 5 and you
can go into playlists and you can watch
like all 60 episodes that we've done
about SDR I'll be including the ones
from Mike Osman as well in that lineup
too right so it might be useful if
you've been using our SDR ones in
classrooms or it cetera cetera
you're just really bored and you want to
watch all of them or figure out why the
speed of light matters which it does it
turns out pretty important yeah good
stuff also very thankful for the
ionosphere and the molten core yeah
electromagnetism is one of my favorite
things in the universe have I ever told
you that you know what else is one of my
favorite things when all the cool hack
five fans in the berry area get to come
by the hack 5 warehouse we have a little
barbecue are we having another one we
are having another one December 5th this
one is special because we're having a
garage sale that's right we are so we've
been cleaning out our warehouse of all
the old things that we no longer use or
we graded from we've got robots and 3d
printers and just crazy stuff that needs
to find it new homes if you feel like
checking out our gear I believe we're
gonna be donating part of the proceeds
as well to the e FF which I've already
contacted them about and asked them if
we can do that so they said yes I'm very
excited to support the e FF yeah so yeah
come by check out our warehouse garage
sale it'll be lots of fun December 5th
and
times and everything will be updated on
the hak5 website high fived org slash
open house you have to sign up and then
you get an email from us in turn what
follow us on the social networks twitter
and everything for updates on that as
well twit brothers twitter ours
there we go that that was by the way a
great idea having this open house i
agree
no one else is a great idea getting
yourself a domain name from domain.com i
know we told you guys before we're huge
fans of them and there's good reason for
it's because we love them and they love
us and it's a symbiotic relationship
we're fast and easy and affordable web
hosting and domain names and going
drinking and your websites online like
that it's amazing
i've told you guys time and time again
how much it's just a snap if you're
looking for your commie or hosting but
right now right now is the most epic
time have you heard about the sale hack
jumbo ends at the end of the month so
you really need to get in on this right
now because it saves you 35% off new
domain registrations that's huge so act
now november 30th is when it ends so get
in on that go over to domain com use the
coupon code
HHH EMBO and you know what tweet some
love at domain comm thank them for
supporting hack 5 for so many years and
remember when you think domain names
think domain.com and with that I believe
we are out I think thank you for for
watching thank you for commenting and we
will see you on the internet next week
until then i'm darren kitchen
trust you
so before we actually get into the setup
in the demo I do want to talk real quick
about some of the differences between
the yardstick one and the other c c11
and angles so most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
