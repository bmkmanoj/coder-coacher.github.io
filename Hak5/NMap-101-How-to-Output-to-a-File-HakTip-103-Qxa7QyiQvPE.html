5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and it's time that we
talked about some of the output options
that you have an nmap since we've pretty
much seen all of the different output
for all of our commands just in the
terminal so for example you can output
your info into an XML file a text file
or even a grep a bull file this may be
really helpful if you need to scan a
network with like thousands of systems
on it and you don't want to just have
everything in the terminal it would be
great if you would be able to search or
review your file later on and you would
be able to close your terminal so you
could save that information in the
process so we'll go ahead and start with
the first command option which is tak o
n so to do this one you'll type and it
looks pretty familiar to what other
commands tak is o capital N and then
you'll type in whatever you want your
text document to be called so this is
for text documents so I'm going to call
it a scan dot text txt and I'm going to
scan my entire network 1/2 4 then you
just hit enter and you let it go ahead
and scan now once it is completed I can
type in cat scan txt and I can see the
entire scan again and you'll if I scroll
up a little bit you can see that is
where I entered it up at the top also if
you wanted to just look at this through
your directory you can also go into your
file explorer like if you're on Windows
and you can see it that way as well it's
just a simple text document now make
sure if you do want to use the same name
for a file you change the first name
that scan txt to a different text file
name because it will end up overwriting
whatever ones that you do in the process
if you want to do this command over and
over again if you want to you can change
the name of the text file or you can use
the command option tack tack a pen tack
output I'm not going to go over that one
too much because it's just tech tech
upend tech output now you can also do
the same thing with an XML file and this
one is also pretty quick and easy it's
very similar to the last one you type
nmap tak o capital X and I'll do scan
dot XML and then whatever thing you're
scanning so I'll do my whole network
again / to you for and hit enter and
then it'll scan like normal and you'll
be able to cat test dot X or scan XML
and I'll show you that in just a moment
okay now that it is finished I can type
in scan or cat scan XML and you'll see
what I get back is an entire XML file
and of course you can also look at this
in your file directory too now last one
that we can do is a grep a bull file so
this is pretty much the same thing again
the same kind of option that you're
going to have except this time it's
going to be tack o capital G so to type
in this one for a grep bubble file
you'll type nmap tack o capital g and
then the name of your file so I'll call
it scan to scantron haha txt 10.7 3.1 /
- 4 hit enter and go ahead and let it
scan whatever network or whatever
systems that you want to put into this
grep bubble file ok so now that we're
doing a grep LeBeau file i want to look
specifically for hosts that are running
a microsoft des open port so i'm going
to type in for this since it is a grep
file I can grep Microsoft under the
scantron txt file hit enter and it'll
pull back for me each host the ports
that are open as well as which exact
host is actually running that Microsoft
DES open port on it so pretty cool
definitely very very handy if you need
this kind of information and there are a
couple more really really cool outputs
that I want to share with you so I'll be
right back with a few more file output
techniques but first let's thank our
sponsor right now do it do it right now
the hack shop is hack 5s premier store
for all of your pen testing needs
including one of my favorites the USB
rubber ducky which looks like a flash
drive and it kind of taps like a
keyboard it types in scripts crazy crazy
fast into a computer and one of my
favorite scripts this week is from
plasmas over in the hack 5 forums
he created a script that will convert
ducky script into Arduino for use with
the teensy if you wanted to that's
pretty cool now of course we couldn't do
the show without your support so we
would like to thank you with something
special you can use the coupon code
snubz with any order for your very own
signed hacked tip stickers just like
this one on the back of my computer so
cool and thank you so much for
supporting the show of course again we
couldn't do it without you
we're back now what if you wanted to
output the skins of all of those
different commands into all the
different formats you not only want it
XML but you want text and you want
groupable well that's pretty easy as
well this one is pretty cool you just
type in nmap text o capital a and then
whatever you want your files to be
called so I'll call them all scan to and
then whatever network or system that you
wanted to scan so I'll do the entire
network again and then it's going to
scan as usual now once that's completed
if I use LS tack L and I'm going to use
the scan to dot wild card and hit enter
I'll see all of the newly created files
so not only do I see GN map and map and
I also see XML so the difference is with
these is GN map is grep XML is obviously
XML and nmap is the text file and there
are also a couple other pretty cool and
useful different output types for
example if you want to see the status of
your actual scan like every 5 seconds or
so or 1 second or whatever you want it
to be you can type in this pretty easy
little command you type nmap tack tack
stats
if I can spell right every so tak-tek
stats tat every I'm going to do every
two seconds to s s per seconds and then
my network so 1/2 4 now when I hit enter
you'll notice every 2 seconds it's going
to give me information on that so
connect scan timing eight point seven
percent done fifteen point five percent
done and it'll continue on until the
very end and then it'll automatically
stop when I'm done you can use this you
can use s for seconds you can also use M
for minutes or H for hours if it's a
really really big Network and you know
it's going to take a really long time
and you don't want to just stand there
looking at nothing you want to see at
least a percentage of how much is done
so once it completes it just completes
we'll go ahead and wait till that is
finished ok and now that it gigs
complete it's you notice that it
obviously just quits out by itself and
lastly we have a pretty fun one I
actually think this one is kind of cute
it's called a script Kitty or elite
output and this is used with TAC o
capital s so this is just kind of a cute
little easter egg that you can find an
end map that you can pretty much just
play around with or you could fool your
friends with it if you want to so to do
this one you type in n map and then tack
o capital s the name of your text file
if you want to output this into text
files so I'll call it K dot txt and then
10.7 3 1/2 4 hit enter and go ahead and
let it run through the entire scan so
now once it is completed I can type in
cat Kitty txt and you'll notice in my
output instead of having everything
written in you know proper actual
English we get this sort of leet speak
because that's how all the kids seem to
type these days I don't understand all
of it even though I should because I do
this kind of stuff all the time but oh
my goodness look there's capital letters
in the middle of the words and there's
dollar signs instead of s's how cute
alright that's about it for this week as
far as nmap goes but you can always send
me a comment below or you can email us
over at tips at hack 5 org and make sure
to check out our sister show hack 5 or
over at hack 5 org for more great stuff
awesome stuff just like everything that
we've been doing here
except even better and I'll be over
there reminding you to trust your Tecna
list see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
