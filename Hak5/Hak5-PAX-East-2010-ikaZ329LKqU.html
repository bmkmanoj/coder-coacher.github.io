Triton's new gaming headphones the open
source and guitar controller and much
much more all in this episode of hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by Squarespace domain com got a great
idea it all starts with a great domain
and go to assist express hi welcome to
this episode of hak5 I'm Jason Applebaum
i'm paul de buys and so what are you
gonna do days so i just got back from
pax pax what like pecs from firefly or
surrendered it hacks penny arcade expo
up in Boston oh why'd ya there because I
was you know doing the whole heck five
expedition collecting cool information
so i actually found some what he didn't
happen so nothing yeah I didn't episode
up there oh that's easy so so what I got
coming up on the episode we've got a
guitar that is really a guitar
controller so it's guitar you mod into
the guitar controller for testing the
ten button guitar before they were ten
button guitar yes the guitar that is
also a game controller this one but but
this is actually a guitar that is a
guitar controller yeah that is modded
with open source hardware and actually
have to strum with strings and open so
it's not like just something like guitar
manufacturer was some guy no just some
guy that brought out friends of the guy
with the TT brought out this open-source
hardware kit that you slaughter outfits
like 35 bucks anyway more on that and
then we've got a new take on D&amp;amp;D
somebody took DD and Anjali dragged onto
the dragons and do it on a Microsoft
Surface who lights really like what I
was doing element flavors yeah ok so
mean you got a little dice little
elements oh so you got the the surface
with the little things anyway um and
then we got Jen cutter is joining us to
talk about gaming headphones oh really
yep I'm sitting here a long time this
should be good yeah she's doing good
how do we wrap this you just say let's
check it out let's check it out there
you go
hey we're here at the penny arcade expo
and we found something really
interesting hi I'm Alan Chatham with
open chord organ we're building open
source controllers to our kits to turn
your guitars into real guitar hero
controllers tell me a little bit of how
that works so basically right now we're
just selling kits but we've got these
kits that let you take your regular
guitar I'm a little bit of soldering you
saw her you started the kit to the frets
and the strings and then you it just
plugs right into guitar hero for the PC
the Wii or the PlayStation 3 is it open
source from my flight I mean absolutely
hundred percent open source there's even
a what's called a bootloader on the chip
so you can just hold down a button when
you plug it in and then it just lets you
copy code right onto the chip and do
whatever you want with it okay so where
is it available right now we're it's
available right here at facts and you
can also check out our website at open
court org we're selling it online

it all starts with a great domain domain
com so I'm here with the ala from
surface escapes and they got a really
cool new way to do dandy tell us a
little bit about it
so we've basically been using the
Microsoft Surface table to kind of
enhance D&amp;amp;D we're not exactly making a
video game out of it or kind of
replacing any other core aspects we just
want to augment enhance a lot of it you
know we can use pitchers on the surface
we can track everything and streamlined
a lot of the complex complexities of the
game so you know tracking if you were
set on fire five turns ago the table
will remind you a lot of actually do
line of sight and movement calculations
and all of that so replacing the pen and
paper of the pen and paper game right
but you still have a dungeon master
telling the story it's still a very
narrative and social game we're not
replacing that we're not making a video
game out of that so much excellent so
how is it going about doing all this
different tracking and how many pieces
can you track so they use these tags
that we can put on any kind of object
they can detect 256 of these of course
we don't use that many we tend to have
about four NP sorry player character
pieces miniatures as well as each one is
associated with a control object which
is how they access the user interface
and interact with the digital and
narrative sorry digital world so Whitney
what platform is this based off of what
you know what framework should use so
everything that you see running on the
table is in XNA and everything on the DM
screen is in WPF so the code behind that
is where we're writing in c-sharp about
how long does that take you we've been
working on the project for about 27
weeks now that's all the previous
semester and about 12 weeks into the
current semester at school sure so what
is your favorite part of this what part
of doing this you know what part what
real role did you play in this I'm one
of the programmers on the team and we
assigned tasks out just to the three of
us however it seems right at the time
basically we're all kind of working
nonstop on everything for me the best
part sort of I guess is now right like
this is what we're working toward right
being able to show the project off to
the fans so this is fantastic Raju and
where can we find out more about this so
we have a website it
is I don't know what it is over third
right here so right in this general
region that's website ok we have a kind
of the overall goals for our project
there as well as a forum where we can
like to communicate with the community
and we've also been putting out some
demo videos which are going to continue
to do up until the end of our semester
in May so this project gonna go open
source maybe or turn into something
bigger or maybe not so most likely not
um the majority of our team is
graduating in May and you know
dispersing finding jobs everywhere um
and our continuing members who are in
their first year are going on a
different projects so this is not going
to be continuing past the end of the
semester all right ok well it's a really
cool product what you guys created it
it's a very cool experience well thank
you very much for your time this week's
trivia is with the 1985 US launch this

alright I'm Jen cutter here and why
don't you introduce yourself and your
team position yeah I'm Fred swear I'm
the sales manager at Trident
technologies
alright it's nice to meet you so I am
here looking for the best cross console
headset what can you tell us about what
you have what's great about Triton is
all of our headsets are cross-platform
compatible meaning they work with Xbox
Playstation and PC so no matter what you
buy from Triton it's going to work on on
any system you have so we're pretty
excited about our entire line here we're
showing off the PAX East all right so
what would you say are the top features
from your top headsets here yeah
absolutely well I'll quickly run through
our all three of them are ax 180 is our
entry-level headset at $69 it is our
it's a stereo headset cross platform
compatible it has a full voice
communication chat communication it has
an inline volume control here that is
its unique that allows you to chat
volume separate from the game volume so
when you're playing with somebody online
and they're either yelling at you or
they're there you're too soft and you
can kind of adjust that separately from
the from the game which is nice and then
from there we go to our our top two
which are the ax 720 and the x pro the x
720 actually uses dolby headphone
technology which is a sense that dobies
processing of the 5.1 surround sound
into a stereo headset so we have a high
powered stereo headset that process that
surround sound you get that virtual 3d
experience we're really nice for
first-person shooters where you need
that kind of directional audio going on
so we got that on the x 720 then from
the pro the pro is really unique no one
else has this technology is cross
platform compatible we're the only ones
to do it with Dolby Digital true w
digital 5.1 which is the ability to send
that signal out into each sound field
independently those four speakers in
each earcup eight total speakers on your
head give a front center rear and sub
which allows you to adjust those sound
fields independently the inline volume
control here you can see that it has
four different sound fields and so your
ears and my ears are different it allows
us to basically adjust that as we like
to hear it kind of like you were on your
your home theater system
so you have a front center rear and
subchannel you can adjust independently
really being able to dial in those
directional audio cues that you get on
every game very nice now so you would
put these up against people who do have
the home theater system yeah absolutely
it's it's amazing how the way that we've
set this headset up and the way that
you're getting the directional cues I
mean you're getting really precise
details stuff that you've never heard
before in the games all these games now
are made with you know 40 to 50 layers
of sound on every scene I mean you have
all these the ambient noises you have
footsteps you can hear stuff coming
across the map a fire a fire shot from
across a certain angle and you're able
to see things before we're here things
before you can see them so i would
definitely i would put this ax pro or
the 720 up against any any home theater
system as far as gaming and movies go
it's really an advantage to have a
product like this excellent now comfort
covers going to be very important for
those marathon session yes absolutely
with these two headsets these are
full-size over the ear headset swear
that the cans are actually full-sized
over the area has a lot of travel you'll
be able to completely be comfortable
nice we have the faux leather or we have
the suede your caps which allow you to
have whatever kind of feel you like and
then as well it's a full-size headset
that allows you to have some noise
cancellation because it's kind of
blocking out that out and exterior noise
plus it has some a lot of travel the key
a real important factor is that you have
the speaker has room to move and it has
room to you know do its thing so we've
kind of designed these with sound
quality in mind you know Triton's sound
quality and comfort are two of the top
things that we're very known for
regarding the headset itself but of
course the cross-platform compatibility
the inline volume control the removable
microphone that allows you to chat with
your friends or whoever you're playing
with on every platform is super unique
and very important to us alright thank
you very much for your time
let's face it when you need a file
absolutely positively gone from your
system never to recover from the grave
again you need to secure delete utility
this week Shannon investigates just that
on the snubs report brought to you by go
to assist express so whether it's RM on
UNIX or delete on Windows you always
have to delete files it's necessary to
free up to space or remove unwanted
files or delete would be sensitive
information and make advantage with no
trace but does it really vanish with no
trace that's the problem that's why they
say we're all human we all make mistakes
we're flawed creatures we accidentally
delete files all the time that's why
your modern technology like Windows
makes user friendly programs such as
their recycling bin it's basically a
bucket that stores all your deleted
files but it's not secure it collects
disk space dust all the contents are
still there and then when you empty the
contents of a recycling bin it typically
doesn't delete your files either zero
right now magnetic pics on a hard drive
or the cells on a stock solid-state
drive it takes a moment to process and
that's why we never get around to
actually defragging our computer why do
something today if you could always do
it tomorrow because you know what it's
nice outside today the link may be
removed but the content is still there
on your hard drive and anybody can find
it it's just not listed so until you get
around to that defrag and you need that
space and it eventually gets overwritten
I'm still able to read that let's see
Knight Rider yaoi with David
Hasselhoff yeah so let's find out how we
can actually get rid of that fanfiction
before i put it up on the internet for
everybody else to read Darren who's got
your back whenever you're trying to rig
your hard drive of all those unpure fan
fictions that you've written
surprisingly Microsoft does the first
time I'm going to tell you about is
called s delete it's a command line
utility that uses switches and arguments
to basically turn any file into dust it
even mixes all those tricky little ntfs
compressed files using Windows
defragmentation API so right now I've
gone head and connected to the hak5
cloud lab to show you exactly what I
mean the tech p option specifies how
many times you would like to override
the file for should be sufficient but of
course the sky's the limit tak s enables
recursive sub directories meaning all
the files and folders that are nested
within your target and then tech you
actually makes it quiet so it's easy to
run from the commune craft it is prime
for batch files but what if I want
something a little bit more graphical
and user-friendly inferred oh yeah
that's right it's an athlete name user
friendly program called inferno it's not
very pretty and it requires visual basic
runtime but it's functional and that's
what we're looking for it quickly
overrides any file with random data and
you can pull out the big guns and
perform a US Department of Defense spec
wipe it even sports in debt mandaleet
which is a strong and secure method that
uses complex patterns to render software
and hardware based recovery tools
useless of magnetic and solid state
disks so what are your thoughts tax day
is around the corner and either of these
programs could turn your browser cache
completely into data mush or do you have
an alternate program that you like to
use email me at feedback at hak5 org and
