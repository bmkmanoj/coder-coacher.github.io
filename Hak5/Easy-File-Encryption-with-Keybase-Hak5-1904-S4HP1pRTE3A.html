simple online encryption this time on
hack five this episode of hack five is
brought to you by domain.com
hello Kanak five my name is darren
kitchen my name is Shannon Morse
if you weekly does have technolo welcome
everybody to this show we are getting
into some fun public key cryptography
PKI that I stands for infrastructure not
cryptography but you know it's the fun
thing where it can send you the messages
and then anybody intercepting will be
like what's up probably good that is
correct so in the past we have talked
about PGP itself we've talked about key
base which is a website key based I Oh
which lets you do social networking type
sign up and we saw well we've also
talked about malevolent so basically
public key cryptography talked about it
a bunch in the past this is from GPG all
the way to mail below up to key base
which was the newest one and we're
always looking for the most convenient
way to do this because ultimately like
we should all be using strong encryption
but it is you're not gonna do it if it's
it's if it's too hard nobody's gonna do
it yeah or either to uninformed like the
people at the bank's where I'm like yeah
I'd love to say these that totally a
sensitive form what's your public key
and they're all like they literally said
it's okay because by the time because
when we get the email it's encrypted on
our end and I'm like that's anyone I was
legit rolling on the floor laughing when
he told me this I was just like really
yeah really
so today we are taking another look at
one of our favorite social encryption
platforms key base if you're looking for
a primer on that Shannon did a great
feature on it on episode 17 15 but TLDR
is basically social networking meets
public key cryptography and all the best
ways and it's easy and I think we should
probably just do an example of like the
easy way and then show you how to get
the most out of it with all of the apps
and stuff like that okay so first off
we're going to do an example using the
most basic encryption and decryption
services right from the website because
you can actually do it in the browser
and then we'll actually dive into
getting the most from key base using a
command line interface app which is also
very easy
to use once you know how to do it right
let's just say that the cool thing about
encryption with key base is that
everything is done in your browser using
javascript specifically we're talking
about Kb PGP that's the key based
implementation of the industry-standard
a public key cryptography system
developed by Phil Zimmermann back in
1991 that's right our beloved PGP pretty
good privacy yeah it stands for pretty
good privacy because it's pretty good
and I mean it's lasted the test of the
time almost a quarter of a century Wow
so that's 17 millenniums and internet
time I thought I think that's the
calculation you guys can let us know
let's go ahead and dive in so Shannon
you want to send me a message yeah sure
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go directly over to key based
IO and I logged in with my Shannon Morse
account so you can always track me if
you want to on here which is basically
like friending you can go to key base do
/ san Shannon Morse and choose track
which will show up as a button down at
the bottom there we go so now I'm going
to go up here to my different buttons or
I can go down here to encrypt so I'm
going to encrypt a message to Darrin so
the recipient is going to be up Darrin
kitchen who has also signed up for an
account on key base so I'll choose
Darrin kitchen and I'm gonna send him a
message that says Kirby likes other cats
I'm gonna sign the message with my key
Bay style passphrase which by the way I
do use 2fa on LastPass just FYI so I
sign in encrypt it and it gives me this
PGP message so now I can copy this
message go ahead and nuke the plaintext
and you can then send that to me over
any medium and that's kind of the fun
thing about PGP is now that we actually
have the the encrypted message it
doesn't matter what the medium may be
whether it's email or in this case you
gonna send me an email or a I did so I
went over to my gmail account and I just
sent it over to your Darren at hack 5
email so I just copied and pasted it
into the subject and or into the body of
the text and I hit Send so you should
receive my encrypted
Marinette hak5 I'm waiting for the Gmail
to refresh let's play at the Gmail
refresh game there it is
that was quick okay alright so here we
are and I have my message over here in
Gmail and I'm actually still using I
love milk isn't helpful out I love mail
blub it's really convenient so this is
what it looks like when you get an
encrypted email in mail Volokh and so I
can just go ahead and unlock this by the
way malval open secure as long as your
computer is secure the same can be said
pretty much for any encryption system
it's only a secure speaks link so
protect your computer and be all good
Melville op' very convenient I love it
and as you can see it was just decrypted
and I can see Kirby likes other cats I
think what's also important to emphasize
here is that we're using two different
services you're using my days I'm using
Melville op' but since we're just using
our standard PGP public user privacy we
keep PGP keys that we're using back and
forth between all these different
basically interfaces to share that PGP
encrypted message right so I could
actually go right back into here and do
a little reply action and with mail the
love it looks like this you get this
little edit icon up here and I can say
no actually Kirby doesn't like other
cats and then hit encrypt and then I
choose the recipient and in this case I
have not added you so I need to add you
hang on a second I can show you out it
is actually this is one of the cool
things about key base is I need your
public key I know you're a cubist at i/o
slash Shannon Morse right so you can go
to my profile and you can click on my
public key simply copy that and in
malevolent the reason I don't is because
malevolent store the keys in the clouds
and I haven't done this on this laptop
so I'll import the key on this laptop
and say import and successfully added
that key cool so now when I go to
encrypt that message and say Kirby
thinks you smell funny
and hitting graphics youth notes buddy
and then there she is as the recipient
and I click
and I hit okay and it can transfer that
message and send it cool and there we go
all right saved now you play I should be
able to receive it in my email now don't
go over to my email cuz I have a lot of
things in my inbox right now but I'm
gonna go ahead I did receive the email
and it's simply an encrypted message so
I'm gonna copy it okay and now you can
go over to my toolbox okay so now this
time I click on decrypt so even though
he sent this to me in May of Allah I can
still open it in Cubase because it's
using the same public key to send me
messages so I copy and paste it in there
I go ahead and verify my identity with
my passphrase and I decrypt it and I
should receive the message Kirby thinks
you smell funny so yeah it worked and
then I can write it yes voila we're all
of those other fun words and this means
that we have successfully shown the demo
of basically using the web service but
what if we want to do some more advanced
stuff what if we're willing to like
encrypt files and studs I want to learn
how to encrypt files well we're gonna do
that in just a minute but first we're
gonna take a quick break and thank
whatever awesome sponsors domain.com and
doc club came to hack five with a great
idea build a club all about learning
stuff making things and having fun so
we've been hosting open houses at the
hack 5 warehouse through hack House Club
and with the help of domain.com and dot
Club we've taken it to the next level
with a quadcopter arena of doom from LAN
parties drone racing and battle arenas
to 3d printing software-defined radios
and let's not forget barbecue hacking is
just plain better when it's social doc
club gets it and they are the perfect
social domain whether it's IRC or clubs
in RL it's all about coming together and
having fun so what better domain to do
it than a doc club it's perfect because
a doc club is universally and globally
understood so if you're looking for the
ultimate social domain consider a dark
Club so join us this summer in the San
Francisco Bay Area and bring your mini
quadcopter to the arena for drone battle
club we're setting up the leaderboard so
show us what you've got
and what's your dock club let us know
and we'll share it with the hak5
audiences help spread
word get yours over at domain.com slash
club they're only $9.99 a year and there
are thousands of great domains available
and be sure to use the coupon code hak5
to get 15% off and let them know we sent
you so when you think domain names think
domain.com all right
I am ready let's install the key based
app are you ready yes to do that
basically it's command line program for
Linux it's an alpha right now but you
know what it works pretty well firstly
we need to install the prerequisites
namely GnuPG that's the open-source
version of PGP as well as nodejs and npm
the package manager for node.js among
other things and if you're using a
Debian based system like my Ubuntu boxes
then you can do this with a nice little
one-liner so do not get in stop sudo all
the things all the time so let's go
ahead and do sudo apt-get install G and
u PG what you probably already have on
the system node J s tak legacy as well
as NPM something like that all right and
now we can actually install the key base
installer so sudo npm install tak g key
base - installer whoa it's got a cute
little ascii thing going and there we go
that's it I mean it's pretty simple and
now we just run the key base installer
that's complete that guy you know key
base tech installer yes - get a couple
of warnings because I haven't set up my
GPG conf yet but no worries all should
be good and now gives us a little help
text but we're going to go ahead and
verify that we have this up and running
by running the key base command which is
new array with version and we can see
well okay so it's gonna complain because
I haven't set up the configuration yet
I'll show you why that is in a second
but we have the key based IOC live
version 0.8 point 18 cool so it's
installed so it's
and we can go ahead and start doing
stuff with this something useful
something useful you can't do anything
useful until you log in which is why
we're getting complaints about the
configuration so let's go ahead and log
in so for that key base and we'll do log
in and I am Daren at hack 5 org dun dun
dun and it makes the directory and
updates the key base styles the config
JSON that it was complaining about and
booyah oh yeah
okay yes and that was practically
totally just blanked out okay so Ariel
now that you finally got logged in and
it's using the same login info that you
use for the browser version of key base
we can actually encrypt a file so let's
choose let's say it kirby jpg yes and
that's why not in fact I have just such
a thing right here Kirby jpg and you can
imagine in fact let's let's get a little
Kirby up on the screen come on which PS
is short for carbo's yes which if you've
been watching the show for a while you
know that Kerberos is an awesome
authentication protocol and a cute
little cat okay so that said let's
encrypt all the cats okay to do that you
know what but just one key base I should
get the commands here or tactic help
what I want to see is I can actually
search for you if I do a search it'll
search all the users of a new key base
search Shannon Morse
there we go and I can see oh there's
yeah verifies my squid fingerprint and I
got your github is snubs and your
Twitter is snubs so it also gives you
the data that I use to verify my key
base account yeah my social networks so
that's one of the real cool things about
key bases you can use it to verify
tweets and things of that nature but I'm
going to use it to send Shannon a
encrypted copy of this Kirby JPEG so
that she can enjoy it for her selves and
yeah it's it's keeping the cat's away
from the man that's right get your hands
off okay it's me
so let's do the thing so for that we
will go ahead and do a key base encrypt
Shannon Morse because that was the
usuals we wanted yep
Kirby dot so it's kind of like Kirby
JPEG which is right there and I'm gonna
go ahead and do at actio you can also do
a waka just redress hat all right I'm
sorry
attack oh thank you - Kirby JPEG so I'm
giving away that it's a JPEG I'm giving
away the file name which is fine the ASC
an ASC is basically a encrypted file
format yes and so it's here we go I've
got your public key fingerprint I see
you on Twitter and github is this the
Shannon Morse we wanted by default if I
hit enter it's no see the capitalized
and there that's kind of a cool feature
so I actually say yes ok permantly track
the user and write proof to the server
yeah sure why not
and there we are if I go ahead an LS
star dot a SC I can see the grainy JPEG
a SC file okay so how i decrypt it
though okay so if you now were to take
that same file and actually this isn't
going to work because they encrypted it
for you and not me and I'm logged in as
me and not you but I could log out and
then log in as you but anyway suffice it
to say it's really simple all we have to
do head back over here and do a key base
and then decrypt again that file would
be Kirby JPEG ASC and in that case you
just walk it over cuz otherwise it'll
just spill the contents into your
command line and that's not going to be
as much fun or attack Oh to output -
Kirby - unencrypted jpg and in that case
since it's been encrypted for you I
would need to do it for you right so I'm
gonna give you an error word but this
will work or you yes or I could have
encrypted it for myself and actually
that's a very valid point like there's
no reason why you couldn't use this to
encrypt things for yourself and then
delete the original and always have an
encrypted copy so if your laptop gets
seized at the border on your way into
the UK you're still going to jail
because the UK Oh anyway this is very
very useful especially because there's
so many companies nowadays that are like
hey just send me your you know your tax
forms over the emails yeah let's do it
over fax yes oh that's more secure no
that's just esoteric and I know people
are gonna say well it is you know it is
compliant but who knows who's standing
on the other side of the fax machine
that's my fax you know you know the
patent for the fax machine dates back to
1905 yep good stuff okay so anyway we
are encouraging you to check out these
services I find them very useful it's
one of the most friendly ways to do a
public encryption that I have seen and
so definitely dive into the key base app
it is great for things not just
encrypting like we showed you but
signing verifying tracking all the other
cool things you can do with cube ASIO
it is just like any other Linux app I
can now use it to like type things into
it and you know turn it as part of my
other script or whatever I'm doing so
you know like all those backup files
you've got on a cron job like why not I
don't know I thought it was gonna be so
much ease there so much harder
kirsta file and beaker loads okay so I
still love the standard GPG I should
mention yeah you know I find it as a
nice alternative it's more friendly yeah
of course let us know what you think you
can always email us feedback at hak5 org
or you can leave a comment below if
you're watching this over on the tubes
over on the Thames until they change
everything in the comments over there
over here we're just going to
future-proof ourselves all over the
place
so that about wraps up this episode of
hak5 first we have a couple of different
announcements yes citing our next pen
test with hak5 class is coming up this
weekend so if you're nearby the bay area

InfoSec training checkout pen test with
hak5 calm that's the 18th 19th and 20th
so it's three day course you're very
excited about that
also we're gonna be doing another open
house on September 26th so if you want
to come by the hak5 warehouse I know
this time we're gonna be sitting oh yeah

California really hope you guys can join
us down there it's gonna be a blast we
love torque on yes of course if you like
what you're seeing and you want to help
us out directly you can do so and get
some awesome pen test gear in the
process over at our very own shop H a
