myself in the eye
hmm wonder if the guys know just say
something no wait are you recording
I shoot live that okay this time I'm
hack vibe Paul shows us a free emulator
for the powerpc Macintosh and Darren
helps me hack my Nintendo DS with the
homebrew friendly matcha Aaron J enjoins
us to talk about a geeks worst enemy
repetitive stress injuries and Wes gives
his mouse and LAN party bling with a
black light LED mod all that alone juice
there are
Nessun smack when Intel everybody's been
ranting and raving about swinging both
ways with parallels and bootcamp
and running all sorts of Windows on
their max it's so confusing but what if
you're stuck with the PowerPC Macs well
here to show us just how to get around
that is Paul to talk about cue and we're
not talking about Star Trek here are we
no we're not talking about beings of
higher evolution higher than the things
of existence now level now continuum
going on here I wanted to go ten anyway
so what is Q q q is the Mac import of Q
mu which is an emulator for processors
so if you're familiar with like game
emulators like name exactly we're like a
Playstation emulator your SNES emulator
where you can play a little kernel cross
right furniture it's emulating the SNES
hardware so what hardware is it's
emulating well this is emulating more of
the processors for like x86 it does a
couple the PowerPC processors it as the
sparks it does an arms you could run
Solaris with this yep you can run
Slayers native to the sparks processor
on it well what are the limitations of
what OS is you can put on there
well since it's emulating the processor
the limitations are not as say heavy is
like a virtualization so when you talk
about virtualization there's some other
products out there like Microsoft
Virtual PC there's VMware there's
parallels those are virtualization you
say this is emulation what's the
difference well the difference is that
emulation is able to make up the
processor it runs it as software kind of
deal while virtualization just kind of
passes stuff through the processor
because it's still its native processor
for the OS so we're trying to like with
Virtual PC on the Windows platform you
can only emulate or not emulate at all
you can say yeah you can only run x86 so
you couldn't do this mark now you
couldn't do spark so what's involved in
getting it set up well on the Mac it's
like an eMac application you download
then you open it up and then drag
draw from the application not even next
next finish is noting up no no no
agreeing selling your soul for whatever
so that sounds pretty simple but what
about after that what about getting an
operating system say like I want to want
to use this to run Ubuntu on my Mac as
well well with Q you can do it two ways
you can either run it through the
PowerPC processor emulator or you can do
the x86 version depending on how you
want to do it okay let's say I'm trying
to run Windows because I know that when
it comes to Linux there are some Linux
bills that will run on PowerPC yeah
let's talk about Windows say like I want
to play
say if you saw its hair solitaire
yeah and minesweeper yeah so how would I
go about doing that alright nor do that
you create your guest a PC and you tell
it the name and then what operating
system list yeah if you're going to go
with like minesweeper needs one be 95
Oakland is 95 95 discs out you pop it in
and you hit create and it will
essentially configure things correctly
so that it can best one 95 on your
computer and from there the installation
process is any different than ever you
guys natively doing that on a piece of
hardware that supports it right yep it's
the same format it's like if you're
doing it like virtual machine style or
experience that but where does it
actually install that to I mean is this
a file a partition do you hit mess with
that kind of stuff it's essentially an
image kind of quality like you'd find an
image for Linux distro it's just a kind
of virtual hard drive so you have a
thing
big old file on your hard drive for that
machine yep this sounds really cool but
what operating systems we have running
right here now well we got running is
free das windows 2000 DSL my failed
attempt at Vista and Arch Linux because
I've been hearing a lot about that but
so the Linux or I'm sorry so Vista not
so much with um PC actually I'm pretty
sure if you had a much stronger Mac than
mine it can do it pretty effectively but
only have 512 RAM just listen cut it
now the
question the burning question on
everybody's mind is this a real hack can
we use this to play Doom absolutely I've
got a free dose goin just downloaded the
image loaded that up on the queue for
the bootable CD ROM and it just played
off of that didn't need to like burn a
disc or anything and just started the
whole installation process like you're
doing any other computer it went through
all that and right there and doom free
emulator free dass and a free copy of
doom yep I think you can get any better
than that to find out more about Q
definitely head over to the show notes
and take a look at Paul's excellent
article in the wiki hack 5.0 or slash
wiki and impress your friends with all
the latest and wonderful graphics that
the 1990s had to offer without spending
a penny so let's head over to Allie and
see what's coming up next
engage okay so that was Q for mac OS x
now coming up next we've got a mod for
the Nintendo DS but first let's go to
Ilana to see what the trivia is trivia
USA well last month trivia question was
firewire 400 a competing standard for
USB high-speed is rated at how many
megabits per second this was an obscure
correctly by Brian who wrote 393 point 2
1 6 megabits congratulations Brian
alright so good job Brian
way to go buddy now this month's trivia
question would you like to know can't
know unless I tell you well you're at my
beck and call please I'm anxious with
the quickness here Jules that's all you
want less card this is a cool trivia
which i think is actually pretty cool
the largest game of tetris played on a
two hundred eighty eight foot tall
building in the netherlands was built by
what association in 1995 do you say 288
feet 288 feet worth of Tetris
oh dude oh no no no what I really want
to know is is the 40-foot statue of
Optimus Prime playing that I'm not gonna
get that image out of my head now so
anyway coming up next we have mod ship
with Ally
so until then we will be right back
get reliable secure web hosting without
the long term contract
GoDaddy's hosting plans are bigger and

name for just 695 a year get your piece
of the Internet at godaddy.com
today we're taking a look at the D s
extreme a modchip the Nintendo DS that
has some pretty unique features and
potential hack ability yes I really like
this mod chip because it's it's got some
unique features compared to some of the
other mod ships on the market right now
and specifically what we're looking at
is ways to use this and a Nintendo DS or
a Nintendo DS Lite and do some pretty
interesting homebrew and hacker ish
stuff so I guess first of all we should
mention this is the DS x raid you guys
for sending this to us yeah that's a lot
it's been really great working with it
yeah it's fun little chip well whatever
one ask is what makes it so special
one little chip what makes it so well it
has the power to save the universe but
we're gonna use it for games and 3d
effects fans out there but with some of
the other DS mod chips what there are is
you'll have a bootloader chip that goes
into the DS slot I know Dan this is my
dear and then we'll have a a mod chip
that'll go into the advanced slot and
that takes of you know two chips and
then to transfer the games you've got
like SD cards or compact flash cards so
this does all the that work on one chip
and has like a little USB connector
right here so that you just plug it into
your PC yeah the box just came with the
disc and the cable in it that's all it
had weight in fact there's no drivers
necessary whatsoever yeah I've plugged
it in it started right up a since you
like start playing with it yeah that's
the neatest thing is you don't have to
modify your firmware with some of the
other mod ships you actually have to
overwrite the firmware that's on your
Nintendo this way you're not believing
in authorities all righty
yeah the other cool thing is it's
cross-platform since it just shows up as
a thumb drive when you plug it into a PC
or a Mac or Linux you know that way it's
it's cross-compatible in that sense so
if it shows up just a thumb drive I saw
there you could put music on there
exactly it's got a music player built-in
as well as you know an application
launcher to play any homebrew games
which were usually like dot NDS files
and all you have to do is just drag them
over like you would onto any other you
know supportable storage device
basically this thing is idiot-proof
pretty much it is pretty much way to get
this to mess up your DS as if you are
really trying yeah what's also really
cool
this as opposed to some of the other
chips is that it's compatible with all
of the homebrew applications out there
so rather than having to get a you know
a homebrew application for the blue D s
of the black D F so the white D S or the
pink D s you can just any of them will
just work and it does the transcoding
on-the-fly on the chip so that's another
thing that makes it pretty idiot
yeah so running rice
it's the MSRP is about 125 dollars which
is about $40 premium over some of the
other much of combos when you figure in
all the chips yeah I need to get but I
figure you know on one yeah
so it's pretty spiffy I mean I don't
know if it's for everybody but I think
the hacker aspect it's my personal
favorite
no you weren't playing a lot with it so
what was your favorite little to do okay
my favorite homebrew application is
called DS Lite and it's a little
wardriving application that or it's
actually a ton of little applications in
one and it's a little bit buggy but I
think there's a lot of development that
may go into it to make it even better
first of all it's got wardriving
capability so you power it on and since
the DS has Wi-Fi you can see all the
access points in area it also has the
ability to do packet sniffing and what
it does is it'll just show you all the
raw packets that are going through the
air and unfortunately it doesn't have
any recording capabilities so it's not
going to really replace your favorite at
the really window-shopping
yeah window shopping for packets there's
one way to put it but it's not exact
right yeah it's not gonna replace any of
your any of your packet sniffing tools
but it's good to turn it on real quick
you know you may be out around town like
I wonder if there's Wi-Fi around here
you boot up your DS launch that
application and then you can see you
know the access points you can see do
some packet sniffing and then you can
even do some port scanning but again
it's not going to really replace nmap
but you know at least to do some maybe
some reconnaissance and see what's
around I figured that's worth it for
that at least for me you know my
favorite little thing was what doom oh
definitely dare one of my DS it's not a
hack until you can play Doom I figured
out how I can save your game you can do
pretty much anything you can do
well damn what about um he said
something walking up to a PC and yeah
the doom version that's available des
tomb actually has a server-side
application that you run on your PC and
then with multiple DS's that are
wireless you can all connect to that and
then do a deathmatch I mean that's just
like I don't think it gave you a
deathmatch on des let's try and view
that iPod come on Paul what are you
doing man
so and of course I guess we should
mention the backup aspect because it's
always good to backup your media just in
case you accidentally step on your
cartridge or lend it to Wes and it comes
back with LEDs so it you know like any
other mod chip has the ability to play
backed up games which of course we
always need to stress only legitimately
backed up games and not the ones that
you're finding on the web borrowing from
that staff runs yeah shame yes seriously
oh but this does have little LEDs in
here if you haven't noticed yeah what
does light up and you can change the
colors and it's gonna it's it's named
LED because it's like a three color LED
in one you can change it to green red
purple and again yeah yeah that gave me
a headache
so to learn more about this nifty little
chip head on over to DSX calm thanks
again thanks again guys this is really
awesome working with this and if you
wanted to find out a detailed list of
our favorite apps head on over to the
hack 5 website so next up we've got
Aaron Shahan hack 5s favorite massage
therapist to talk about RSI or stress
injury not to be confused with the
stress that worth poses but first it's
time for this month's poll Ali this
month Paul well last month poll first
was Mario one two or three which one has
your green mushroom the results is Mario
3 for the win was 50 percents yeah Mario
1 actually came in with 38% and Mario 2
came was 10 no dude it's all about the
Mario 3 man with like the raccoon suit
and the frog suit and like like a
million other suits he was like yeah I'm
sorry I got one word for you what one
toon fear did you do to do DVD
yeah those of you who participated in
the polls thank you very much we love
you and those of you didn't we know who
you are
we've got your IP address hey with this
month's trivia is who's your favorite
boned those of you who love
double-oh-seven
Sean Connery Roger Moore or Pierce
Brosnan sorry Dalton and that other dude
Lazenby
but everybody's in here wait yeah
exactly there's only one bond yeah
you're right
Roger Moore's Sean Connery please you
can't go wrong in Buick he'll I had to
ranch ran doing the the music for that
yeah okay sure because I based my
favorite Bond actor on it was a good
movie and Roger Moore was a good bond
okay guys this is a discussion from for
later whatever yeah so you know what
let's have a quick break and then we'll
be right back I'm gonna pound in for the
West
I was asleep in my really really fast
Wesley we have to do something
okay so here we are with our resident
feel-good guru and certified massage
therapist Erin hi and you are here to
talk to us about RSI RSI repetitive
stress injury yes okay so first of all
what is a repetitive stress injury well
repetitive stress injury the name kind
of says it all
you're putting your joint in a stressful
position or forcing it to make a
stressful motion over and over and over
again every single day okay so we're
talking about stress and injury to
joints so I'm going to assume that this
isn't going to be limited to any
particular part of our body but anywhere
that there's a joint we can suffer in
our side exactly our size actually more
related to different tissues tenderness
tissue nervous tissue Bursa which are
like little fluid-filled sacs that kind
of cushion between tendons and bones
yeah they just kind of little natural
shock absorbers in there yes exactly
okay so you said that it has to be from
repetitive motion constant repetitive
motion or one static like long term
stressful position yes now say that I
you know somebody spends all day doing
one particular motion or one particular
job are they going to suffer an RSI say
Darrin is on his knees all day for you
know classic work day 8-hours
mm-hmm the next day his knees are gonna
be sore but really what makes an RSI
what it is is the fact that that initial
injury never really gets the chance to
heal itself because you're performing
that same motion that same activity
every single day so you're read a mijung
the tissue when it just started to heal
okay so carpal tunnel is something that
I hear a lot of people talk about oh my
wrist hurts I've got carpal tunnel I
have a guy carpal tunnel bla bla bla bla
bla I know it's an RSI because people
talk about you know you get it from this
you get it from that but I mean what
what makes carpal tunnel corporal
as much as you hear about it it's
actually not the most common RSI the
most common RSI is Dirk Evans
Tendo synovitis gesundheit thank you but
not quite the problem is people
associate carpal tunnel with their
wrists which technically is right your
carpal tunnel is where your carpal bones
go over a ligament goes under the hole
in the Middle's the tunnel and
everything that makes your hand work
goes through it right carpal tunnel
syndrome is nerve damage to your median
nerve which innervates your pinky ring
and sometimes middle finger innervating
mean connecting exactly okay so people
who have nerve damage they're usually
going to experience tingling or even
numbness in those fingers now tendeth
synovitis is in your thumb you'll feel
pain in your wrist in some more advanced
stages so people think oh my wrist hurts
I must have carpal tunnel syndrome aside
from going to a doctor because obviously
only your doctor can say you have carpal
tunnel
you have tenosynovitis yes very good
very good
yay is there any way that I can kind of
you know give myself an idea of I might
have a problem here there are two simple
tests one for each disorder carpal
tunnel and tenosynovitis the first for
tenosynovitis you're going to put your
hands out in front of you so that your
palms face each other okay so I'm gonna
go ahead and stick my hands out here
just like you okay and you're gonna fold
your thumbs into your palm alright so
just like that okay and then wrap you
the rest of your fingers around your
thumb all right like the really bad way
to throw a punch
exactly now pretend that your thumb is
now a string and you have to pull that
string towards your feet without moving
your elbow or your shoulder okay okay so
we're talking about only in action at
the wrist so go ahead and pull that
string down towards your feet all right
now in this position if you experience
pain along the top of your thumb mm-hmm
the back of your hand or even halfway up
your forearm you're showing signs of
Tendo Center vitus right it's an
inflammation of the synovial lining of
the tendon that
next to your thumb the way I'm guessing
is it's it's a lining that goes around
the tendon yes okay so just a quick
analogy be like the brake cable on a
bicycle goes through the little plastic
tube the cable being the tendon the to
being the synovial tissue exactly okay
so the damage there you're gonna feel
pain that's what you're looking for now
doing any stretched you're gonna feel a
little bit of discomfort if you're a
little bit uncomfortable you're okay
you're just stretching if you feel very
sharp pain in very concentrated areas
you're probably having a problem like
you go oh yeah you can't hold this
position if you're having a problem
right now with carpal tunnel syndrome
the best way to test it for yourself
without a doctor is to take the backs of
your hands okay
you're gonna put them together all right
and then you're just gonna kind of press
we're not talking about a lot of
pressure just enough so that a
half-decent stretch
yeah now you're gonna hold this for
about a minute we're not gonna do today
and then when you release you relax your
hands and if you feel numbness in your
pinky ring your middle finger mm-hmm
that's a sign of nerve damage and then
you probably should go to your doctor
and have them run a couple of electronic
tests where they actually look at the
nerve and tell you what's wrong right
they'll do like the little electrical
impulse stuff yeah everything else now
I'm assuming that if they just want to
you know save the dime from going to the
doctor and the you know I'm not saying
this is any way to diagnose the problem
specifically but if they're showing
signs of wear and tear or something with
these tests simply like a lot of times
simple changes in how we do things would
help out of course people are always
worried about carpal tunnel with heavy
computer use when you say heavy computer
use that means sitting at your chair
with your hands on your keyboard for
over seven hours a day so like a data
entry operator that all they do is work
a keyboard exactly day out so unless
you're doing those straight 7 8 9 10
hour days at a keyboard you're probably
okay you know say you do 3 or 4 hours
even give you 3 or 4 hours straight
you're gonna be ok if you're gonna do
those long hours you're gonna want to
you know get up walk around every half
hour so even if you just lean back
in your chair do a couple of stretches
give your joints a chance to kind of
like relieve themselves okay so
basically what we're looking at is you
know they've spent the long hours and
they just wanted to like the college
saying you know just shake them out
after every so often yeah believe it or
not it helps because they're gonna bring
that fluid back in there and make
everything all happy yes exactly
synovial fluid is like your body's
natural ky so as silly as it sounds
that's really what it is it's
water-based it's full of nutrients and
oxygen if you get that fluid deer joints
it's gonna repair any damage you've done
and help prevent any new damage from
occurring well thank you so much Aaron
thank you so much for letting me weasel
my way on the show no problem I hope to
have you back sometime so more
information shownotes alley
what's up next okay so thank you so much
again Aaron for coming on the show and
teaching us about RSI yeah and I just
love having Aaron down because she's our
favorite therapist yeah definitely so
let's go over to Allie and find out what
happened with the land party well last
month land party was called nice source
but the party was cancelled because of
some technical difficulties as well as
Darin being sick and Wes having other
plans but this month's mine party's go
figure go on that source what you're
gonna give it another go with an
alternate war so what is that about guys
or so is a open source game just like
you know it's mod from quake three just
like Goldeneye is for half-life 2 and
it's you know it's free runs on Linux
and Windows and I think it's pretty
solid I liked it pretty solid I'm
physics the graphics are kind of cool
cuz it's all like cell shading so it's
it's something different it takes a
little bit for your eyes to get used to
it at least it does for me working on
people find this war so dotnet so if
Goldeneye sources and out by the time we
play it we don't have a firm date so
what we're gonna do is say keep your
eyes on the hak5 website and we will
have an announcement there when we know
when we're gonna play that game track 5
org slash line party so next up Wes
you're going to be
having some fun with some more LEDs and
some mice and that sounds like fun it's
all about the bling baby oh yeah I'm
down with that
but the nice the nice just like the bus
and the bees but a word from our
sponsors
that's what you need warning all right
so imagine this you're at a LAN party
may be playing some first-person
shooters maybe some realtime strategy
either way what's gonna complete your
micro more then a tricked-out case and
to go with it a bling and mouse and here
to show us just how to bling out our
mice less with the Meese who else yes so
I hear you've taken a mouse and made it
way more bling in with some who do you
thought LEDs gee yes any but I'm on my
LED kick I like my LED kick I think
they're fun because the amount of
something fleetness
is directly proportional to how many
LEDs it has right how many lights in
general yeah but here is the tricked-out
LED mouse so what do we have on this
because I'm not just regular LEDs well
these are two ultra bright blue LEDs
right here and now on each side we have
ultra bright UV LEDs otherwise commonly
known as black lights like that so if we
were to take a mousepad and and use what
are they called highlighters
highlighters and write some secret masks
are blacklight responsive inks yes oh
yeah dude did show it showed up clear as
day with these so you'd be the coolest
dude at the land party no doubt so
where'd you get inspired to do something
like this well the inspiration
originally came from we have a an
acquaintance if you will a good fellow
but his web site before yes Alan Perec I
believe is how you pronounce it
or corporate something like that I'm
sorry sir but he runs a really nice
online store which is where I get a lot
of my supplies from my LEDs a lot of
resistors come to come from their stuff
like that he also has a lot of projects
that he gives out to people and he gives
out you know you can buy kits from them
and stuff like that all of his projects
are very well documented so if you're
ever interested please check it out just
visit his website right and he sent us a
care package recently with this
particular project so what is this more
than enough supplies for this particular
project this is an LED flashlight
leftover from an optical mouse okay this
one was dead this one saw the magic
smoke and it died it happens it does but
it's very very simple it's just a 9-volt
battery a small resistor and an LED now
the thing is with mice or nice-nice
you ride the bus and we take the beasts
the beasts anyway so what's up with the
switches of this the switches with these
are what's known as a normally open
switch no so good to me yeah I mean
which makes sense because when you click
a button on a mouse it's all in is off
mm-hmm right well we applied the same
principle and there it is okay
so when you put this all back together
and say like you leave this on
somebody's desk that sounds like it
could be a fun little office prank oh
it's a great little office prank because
people think that it's an early
generation optical mouse because once
your wireless mouse excuse me yes but
when you put it back together there it
is
so it's uh it's all about these why
isn't it clicking hmm
but it's actually I mean we've gotten
some pretty good use out of it like
right after you made it we're like
where's your flashlight and he's like
here you know it's like I like there's
where my PCI card went mm-hmm good stuff
yeah it's great so you've taken it a
step further what's the difference
between this mouse led project and your
mouse led project well first of all this
mouse still works
oh it still Mouse's still Mouse's and it
doesn't affect your micro whatsoever now
for the fact that it's got the bling
it's got the bling second all this Mouse
these lights are getting
it's power from the five volts mmm USB
so there's not an extra battery in here
so when the mouse is on the lights are
on when the mouse is off lights are off
simple enough okay what about the the
blue LEDs on the back here they're not
like the black light LEDs here they're
they're flush with the with the case how
does that work oh that's really easy
contrary to popular belief you can
modify the LED itself by cutting the top
off as long as you don't hurt the
emitter inside the plastic I see you can
shave it down within you know a couple
of thousandth of that as long as you
don't hurt the emitter you're gonna be
okay
sweet but other than the power source
and the fact that this mouse still works
how's the wiring is that that's almost
the exact same thing it's really almost
exact take a look inside and yeah and
pop it up in here in just a second there
it is but to look inside of here it
looks like a fairly tangled mess yeah
like any good hack is but it's not as
ugly as it actually so we've got the the
power source coming here then where do
you solder in to steal that power well
so here's the power over here now this
mouse isn't just a little el cheapo ten
dollar mouse and they didn't follow
standard USB color coding Oh bummer so
the easiest thing to do was to plug it
in get my multimeter and figure out
which two were plus and minus 5 volt
just by right you know trial and error
and once you've got that it's just a
matter of figuring out what the
resistance is mm-hmm
and I've got links on the website or in
the show notes on the wiki for
resistance like it tells you how much
resistance you need how to set up the
array you know all that fun stuff
I mean LED / resistance calculator with
the balls yeah even even one that'll
tell you the color code oh sweet in case
you don't know that but other than that
this wiring is almost exactly like the
wiring in this one where it's the same
thing over and over
and I just had to tie it all together so
here's the negative right here and this
is the positive right here and all I did
was tie them all together so if anybody
would be interested in doing a similar
mod what would you suggest that they had
over for resources and places to find
info on us
obviously the wiki that's where my show
notes are gonna be I've got a very well
documented photographs they'll be listed
details all that fun stuff if you want
to try the flashlight go over to Alan's
website that'll also be in the show
notes and if you're interested in doing
any of his kits please do pick one of
those up so for more information about
blinging out your clicker head over to
the website hak5 org otherwise let's go
back to the main set and wrap this thing
up thank you so much guys over at the
mod set Wes it is so good to be here

DreamHost
let's talk about DreamHost coupon code
hak5 for an additional $25 off of your
services if you decide to go with them
and here's a good reason why to use them
two terabytes of transfer a month and
200 gigabytes of storage if it wasn't
before it should be now and if you've
already signed up with the coupon code
hak5 you've got automatically upgraded
anyway so good stuff all around also the
Photoshop competition it's kind of one
of those things if you're like what
Photoshop composition mm-hmm you know
during the the month where we're not
doing the show we're doing fun stuff on
the wiki and the forms and IRC so I was
finding two other ways to get involved
in the community and we decided to go
with a Photoshop competition on the wiki
where we took a single frame out of
episode of diggnation and put you know a
little like comic book bubbles in there
and just gave out the Photoshop file and
said here have fun and we decided the
winner was blaze definitely who won with
his Sin City esque
cell very very nice very well done and
we'll probably do another Photoshop
competition here in the not-too-distant
future so keep an eye on hak5 dot orgs
nice wiki for that
speaking of wiki that's one of the small
parts of our very active community we've
got the wiki at hack by org slash wiki
we have an IRC channel IRC hak5 org the
community there's very supportive you
can ask questions they'll be more than
happy to help you out you find Testament
from Seattle Washington they're fine
chest med from Seattle Washington there
we've got the forms the forms are very
very active as well you can find a lot
of good information in there development
on switchblades and other fun stuff in
between the forms of the wiki yes
feedback feedback noise tell us how much
we suck just uh feedback at hak5 org or
email us directly i'm darren hack 5 org
my said hack 5 org at Sally at hack 5
guard in case you didn't catch it
