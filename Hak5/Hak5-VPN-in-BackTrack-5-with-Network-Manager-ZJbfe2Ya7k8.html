and BBC iPlayer everywhere with a little
VPN action to bypass new IP filters
we'll be setting up network manager in
backtrack 5 plus Linux inside of Windows
graph trace routes and terminals and a
whole lot more this time on hack 5 this
segment of hack 5 is brought to you by
goto assist express hello and welcome to
hack 5 my name is Gerren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse
this is of course your weekly dose of
technology and it's amazing it's
educational and it's fun learning it's
trying to be entertaining that's true
and we want to thank you guys for
watching it thanks if you because a lot
of people get this and I'm so glad that
you guys get what we're trying to do
here sometimes I don't get it really
my mom doesn't get it either and that's
ok we're not making the job your mom but
you know for ourselves and I think we
get so much great feedback I love you
guys are along for the ride we don't
only get feedback oh we also had a fan
to send us a book I don't know we get
stuff sent into the minute I should have
like this I know where it's been 48
Market Street number three nine three
seven one seven it's called using Pro
com+
so here you go Darren I think you'll uh
I think you'll enjoy that very much who
sues banana calm ok so this is from
Brian he says dear Darren I work for a
major publishing company every month we
get free books and I saw this one
sitting right on top with your recent
segment on telephones I thought this
book might be of interest maybe you can
do a follow-up on modems 56k ISDN
satellite or cable protocols I think it
can play nicely with Steve Gibson's how
the internet works awesome this 83 key
keyboard it doesn't really know know
that's what num locks for because the
number keys are actually used as your
arrow keys and your copyright on this
1989 okay I was living in Alaska you go
oh uploading files via ASCII and Kermit
who didn't love Kermit
Lync which I'm not familiar with is that
what they use like on submarines or
something x-mode my modem the modem who
couldn't forget that good stuff when we
get our shelf of Ikea s it will
acuteness yes where we will put all of
our awesome goodies that you can collect
museum-going it's so cool thank you so
much Brian yes thank you so much
so what's it stored okay well a lot of
Linux is show that's right and I figured
remember last week Linux Linux oh okay
right right this is hack tip we must
stay on track well we know attack v we
don't have to stay on target we can take
off our targeting computer and only 100
like yeah right so um what I was
figuring is we got that email last week
from the German national that's here in
the States and he wants to watch
football or foosball or VL camera over
in Germany right but he's over here yeah
so no yeah exactly I mean we said it
right there like dude you just got a SSH
tunnel or VPN tunnel or anything like
that our friend Jenn cutter has been
just like she's really excited about
this one VPN service so I'm trying it
out and today I figured let's get it
going in backtrack 5 switched over from
1/2 to backtrack which well battery 5
space a little bit you can put up my 4
so it's got gnome instead of unity
anyway okay your track 5 thing get some
more caffeine adjust to I'm going to
play with analytics oh okay give me this
yeah okay all right
now put the question out there on the
Google+ and Twitter and Facebook and
everywhere asking what are your favorite
network managers for connecting to VPN
servers and a resounding response across
the board for Linux was the aptly named
network manager and unfortunately though
backtrack 5 does not have network
manager it has wireless interface
control Damon or WI CD which is great
because it's it's a very versatile and
specific tool for managing wired and
wireless connections in Linux but I
really like and have played with network
connection before our network manager
and one too
before and I like the way that it does
VPN so I figured this time what we're
gonna do is show you how to set that up
in backtrack five so if you're an Ubuntu
you already have this but this isn't
just a segment on how to run apt-get
we're also gonna get into some other fun
shell stuff much like we did in the
previous week with the uber tooth stuff
I like whenever we're diving into Linux
like to learn by example if you're new
to this completely or if maybe you just
didn't know about a couple of these
commands it's good stuff
so of course the very first thing
probably the easiest thing is just
running apt-get install network manager
no or no more genome or however you want
to pronounce it all right so we have it
installed and now it's really just a
matter of configuring this file in here
called in Etsy slash network called
interfaces so if I cat that file right
here we can see that this says Auto on
ello ello being our loopback interface
as well as Auto on f0 f1 f2 a th0 wlan0
all of the possible interfaces that I'm
going to have on this machine is set to
automatically bring those up and
automatically set those for DHCP and
that is not what we want especially in
backtrack we don't want to turn this
machine this pen testing machine on on
say somebody's corporate network where
we're trying to be I don't know quiet
and let's start asking for a DHCP lease
that would be so good so what we're
going to need to do is we're gonna have
to change this file but I like to back
it up and there's a really easy way to
do that and one command is to just copy
at CP / Etsy slash network slash
interfaces and typically I just do you
know / Etsy / network and everybody's
done this / interfaces - or interfaces
dot backup you know there's actually a
faster way to do that with curly
brackets though and it's what's called
doing a little bit of brace expansion is
what it's called it's very similar to
how we use the tilde key in Linux that's
a shortcut to our home folder we can
create these kind of shortcuts with
curly braces inside of Linux so so we're
going to CP this file and then we're
going to put
the curly brace where that is on here
and then comma dot back up and run that
and again if we LS / Etsy slashing
Network / interfere
yeah inter phases star we can see now
that we have two files I've successfully
backed it up but how did that work well
let's take a look at just using echo how
we can use curly braces to append and
prepend different strings on a lot of
different it's kind of like an array if
you will so I'm going to echo quote
wanna by quote and then we're gonna put
curly braces for dock pig cow close the
curly braces and I'll put a question
mark at the end there so if I were to go
ahead and just echo this we can see it
says want to buy a duck want to buy a
pig one buy a quick cow to which I would
ask does a quack does it link and does
it Moo anyway that could go on forever
if you know the joke but that is kind of
a practical example there of how you can
use brace expansions and to just kind of
define your what's called your preamble
and your PostScript so now if I cat
slash Etsy slash Network slash
interfaces again I can see it is what I
had before I backed it up so now we can
actually start rewriting that file and
of course I could just go ahead and use
bi or GK or G edit or Emacs if you're
really leaked but I like to just do it
all in the command line with echo and
I'm going to the first line of it is
going to be Auto low so just like in our
previous one we do actually want our
lower our local or a loopback interface
to be automatic and I'm just going to
use one Waka here which is pac-man speak
for a greater than sign into slash Etsy
slash network slash interfaces okay so
when I do that and let's cat that file
again since I've only used one wakka you
can see that have completely replaced
all of this with just this so now
there's another line that I want to add
here just like before I need to do this
up
the I face low inet loopback so will
once again echo I face low I net looped
back and then this time we're gonna go
to Walker's to slash at see network
interfaces so would cat that again you
can see that we have actually added that
to the file and that's what the two
walkers are for that means append it to
the end of the file rather than
completely overwrite the file and it's
important that you make sure that you're
using to when you don't want to use one
or else your shell scripts gonna be
quite destructive you can find that out
the hard way - I'm just saying all right
so now it's really just a matter of
bringing up the service network manager
so for that just service network manager
start alright it started with process 54
79 so that's how I know I can find it if
I ran topic you know Chrome through here
and find it and as far as getting the
applet is concerned we can do is nm TAC
applet for network manager applets and
there it goes it starts up in the upper
right and now much like Ubuntu does
right out of the box we have the network
manager in backtrack 5 so after I reboot
though this is always going to be there
I can go ahead and take a look at my
system startup functions and make sure
that it's always going to be there and I
can use that instead of WI CD hell I can
still go to the command line and do it
all from hand if I want to use the WPS
applicant to do y5 I want to use
ifconfig to do my Ethernet whatever it
may be it's nice to know that we have
those kinds of choices now stay tuned
because in just a bit Shannon is gonna
be demonstrating and Linux but first
let's take a quick break and check in
with Kirby for the meow of the week
