and BBC iplayer everywhere with a little
VPN action to bypass uip filters will be
setting up network manager in backtrack
5 plus linux inside of windows graph
trace routes and terminals in a whole
lot more this time on hak5 this segment
of hak5 is brought to you by go to
assist express hello and welcome to hack
five my name is darren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse is of course your weekly
dose of technol looks and it's amazing
it's educational and it's fun learning
it's trying to be entertaining that's
true and we want to thank you guys for
watching it thanks if you cuz a lot of
people get this and I'm so glad that you
guys get what we're trying to do here
sometimes I don't get it really my mom
doesn't get it either well that's okay
we're not making the joy of your mom but
you know we think I show for ourselves
and I think we get so much great
feedback i love you guys are along for
the ride we don't only get feedback oh
we also had a fan sent us a book when we
get stuff sent into the map i should've
like this i don't know where it's been
48 market street number 39 3717 system
before it's called using procomp plus so
here you go Darren I think Trula I think
you'll enjoy that very much Lucy's
banana com banana come yet okay so this
is from Brian he says dear Darren I work
for a major publishing company every
month we get free ebooks and I saw this
one sitting right on top with your
recent segments on telephones I thought
this book might be of interest maybe you
can do a follow-up on modems 56k ISDN
satellite or cable protocols I think it
can play nicely with Steve Gibson's how
the internet works awesome take this 83
key keyboard it doesn't really animals
said no no that's what num locks for
because the number keys are actually
used as your arrow keys and Utah going
on Wendy's work the copyright on this is
1989 ok I've got 40 106 i was living in
Alaska you go uh-oh snow uploading files
via a ski and Kermit who didn't love
Kermit see link which I'm not familiar
is that what they use like on submarines
or something xmodem why modems e modem
who couldn't forget that good stuff to
thank you so much when we get our shelf
of ikea ness it will ikea nest yes where
we will put all of our awesome goodies i
even gotten it look like a museum going
oh it's so cool thank you so much Brian
yes thank you so much so what's in store
okay well a lot of Linux is show um
that's right and I figured remember last
week linux and linux look this way you
just end like senna do analytics usually
go up yep and it oh ok thanks right
right this is hot chick we must stay on
track we know attack five we don't have
to stay on target we can take off our
targeting computer and obi-wan yoloka
having a run so um what I was figuring
is we got that email last week from the
German national the tear out of states
and he wants to watch football or
foosball or V I'll kimmer over in
Germany right but because the computer
knows that he's over here yeah so no
figured out how to fix that yeah exactly
i mean we said it right there like dude
you just got a ssh tunnel or VPN tunnel
or anything like that our friend jen
cutter has been just like she's really
excited about this one VPN service so
i'm trying it out and today i figured
let's get it going in backtrack 5 which
dover from 12 to backtrack which well
backtrack 5 space on ubuntu but right
yeah well you can point to point for so
it's got no min said a unity anyway okay
you need your backtrack 5 thing get some
more caffeine if you me too i'm going to
play with an linux a little bit more
okay i'll meet you the next block you
need this yeah okay all right now put
the question out there on the Google+
and Twitter and Facebook and everywhere
asking what are your favorite network
managers for connecting to VPN servers
and a resounding response across the
board for linux was the aptly named
network manager and unfortunately though
backtrack 5 does not have network
manager it has wireless interface
control Damon or wicd which is great
because it's it's a very versatile and
specific tool for managing wired and
wireless connections in Linux but I
really liked Anna played with network
connection before or network manager and
12 before and I like the way that it
does VPN so
I figured this time what we're going to
do is show you how to set that up in
backtrack 5 so if you're an ubuntu you
already have this but this isn't just a
segment on how to run apt-get we're also
going to get into some other fun shell
stuff much like we did in the previous
week with the uber tooth stuff i like
whenever we're diving into linux like to
learn by example if you're new to this
completely or if maybe you just didn't
know about a couple of these commands
it's good stuff so of course the very
first thing probably the easiest thing
is just running apt-get install network
manager no or no more genome or however
you want to pronounce it alright so we
have it installed and now it's really
just a matter of configuring this file
in here called in etsy / network called
interfaces so if I cat that file right
here we can see that this says auto on
LOL oh being our loopback interface as
well as auto on f0 f1 f2 80 h0w land 0
all of the possible interfaces that I'm
going to have on this machine is set to
automatically bring those up and
automatically set those for DHCP and
that is not what we went especially in
backtrack we don't want to turn this
machine this pen testing machine on say
somebody's corporate network where we're
trying to be I don't know quiet and then
start asking for a dhcp lease that would
be so good so what we're going to need
to do is we're going to have to change
this file but I like to back it up and
there's a really easy way to do that in
one command is to just copy it CP / ette
c / network / interfaces and typically I
just do you know / ed / network and
everybody has done this / interfaces to
or interfaces dot backup you know
there's actually a faster way to do that
with curly brackets though and it's
what's called doing a little bit of a
brace expansion is what it's called it's
very similar to how we use the tilde key
in Linux that's a shortcut to our home
folder we can create these kind of
shortcuts with curly braces inside of
Linux so so we're going to CP this file
and then we're going to put the curly
brace
where that is on here and then comma dot
back up and run that and again if we LS
/ etsy / network / interfere yeah inter
phases star we can see now that we have
two files I've successfully backed it up
but how did that work well let's take a
look at just using echo how we can use
curly braces to append and prepend
different strings on a lot of different
it's kind of like an array if you will
so I'm going to echo quote wanna buy a
quote and then we're going to put curly
braces for doc pig-cow close the curly
braces and I'll put a question mark at
the end there so if I were to go ahead
and just echo this we can see it says
wanna buy a duck want to buy a pig won
by a quick cow to which I would ask does
a quack does it link and does it move
anyway that could go on forever if you
know the joke but that is kind of a
practical example there of how you can
use brace expansions and to just kind of
define your what's called your preamble
and your post script so now if I cat /
etsy / network / interfaces again I can
see it is what I had before I backed it
up so now we can actually start
rewriting that file and of course I
could just go ahead and use by or g KR g
edit or emacs if you're really leet but
i like to just do it all in the command
line with echo and i'm going to the
first line of it is going to be auto low
so just like in our previous one we do
actually want our lower our local or a
loopback interface to be automatic and
i'm just going to use one Waka here
which is pac-man speak for a greater
than sign in to slash etsy / network /
interfaces okay so when i do that and
let's cat that file again since i've
only used one Waka you can see that have
completely replaced all of this with
just this so now there's another line
that i want to add here just like before
I need to do this up here the I face low
I net loop
back so will once again echo I face low
I net loop back and then this time we're
going to go to Walker's to slash etsy
network interfaces so weak at that again
you can see that we have actually added
that to the file and that's what the two
walkers are for that means append it to
the end of the file rather than
completely over right to file and it's
important that you make sure that you're
using to when you don't want to use one
or else your sales scripts going to be
quite destructive you can find that out
the hard way too I'm just saying alright
so now it's really just a matter of
bringing up the service network manager
so for that just service network manager
start alright it started with process 54
79 so that's how I know I can find it if
Iran topic you know chrome through here
and find it and as far as getting the
applet is concerned we can do is NM tak
applet for a network manager applet and
there it goes it starts up in the upper
right and now much like Ubuntu does
right out of the box we have the network
manager in backtrack 5 so after i reboot
though this is always going to be there
i can go ahead and take a look at my
system startup functions and make sure
that it's always going to be there and i
can use that instead of wicd how i could
still go to the command line and do it
all from hand if i want to use the wpa
supplicant to do y5 i want to use
ifconfig to do my ethernet whatever it
may be it's nice to know that we have
those kinds of choices now stay tuned
because in just a bit Shanna is going to
be demonstrating and Linux but first
let's take a quick break and check in
with Kirby for the meow of the week
