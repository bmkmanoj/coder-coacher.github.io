by godaddy Netflix Squarespace and laser
kittens
hey everybody welcome this week's
episode of hak5 i am at less stock
Darren kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse we
are your squishy plushie IT
administrators your hackers bringing
your your weekly dose of technol lust
wait squishy squishy you jerk hey
where's my truth hurts oh oh God well
anyway we have a special guest with us
today as you could clearly see mr.
Christopher girling is here Christian
Christian barely knew that come on I
know that I know that he joins us from
Washington DC at the sands security
convention Chris how's it going buddy
ready to go out actually after this and
uh but odds the cyber defense initiative
is kind of I think it's one of their
it's up above the stands in throw but is
about 550 some people here don't tell um
I'm doing the forensics track and
learning all sorts of goodness that I
didn't know before it off or anything in
fact I should have done a lot of it
touch you looks until I went through
this okay here i'll follow up segment
coming about other things of this i can
if i can make a whole series of all
those stuff so i'm glad the really cool
things that i learned yesterday actually
was that the whole electron members you
might have heard about this that you can
recover data off a hard drive english
from horoscope well that's not the case
hard drives are so dense nowadays that
the electron microscope just you just
can't see you know that resolution and
you can't do anything with it so maybe
10 years ago but definitely not today so
why is that so crazy people in these
some of these an 80s and stuff with you
know hard disks first coast
but they create all these standards this
kind of leads into my next thing but am
I happening with all the limitations
that they had when they start doing
stuff and basically as hard drives got
larger and larger and others with the
perpendicular drives you have to put
more and more you know space i could to
baltimore more yeah bits on the platter
yeah that's in the platter and it got so
good the resolution of electron
microscope cannot actually pick up
letter which is you know true 021 which
is okay you know when you clean it over
what's going on you need to do that if
you determine you know how power call
anyone how close it was this or one then
you make an educated guess and they
right yeah so um sometimes instead of
one where it's not even worth the time
to try doing cool so it's it's been like
that for about five to eight years
actually oh wow so people like yeah they
can recover anything yeah what are you
recovered you just recovered a master
boot record from scratch didn't you
partitions and extended partitions we uh
we took an image file you know speeding
image hard drive image and uh without
having anything like I said they taught
us how to figure out okay this is where
the master boot record belies is you're
getting the first king of the 512 bytes
and then after that you just do some
math with some standard numbers that see
people creating in I don't know why
those numbers or the way they are and
out of 72 it's just already up stuck in
the you know
had harboured restrictions and just
arbitrarily declared hey 406 will be
where you you know look for the first
you know first partition cool so then
you just take that you can calculate and
actually you know basically DD out all
different partitions on a hard drive and
melba just form some raw data you can
turn them into their own image files mom
in latex and actually but see the intro
and middle implement that is awesome
interesting right so I'm definitely
gonna have some stuff with that the
difference whether I good luck man have
fun got it looks like a little kid in a
candy factory so the top you guys well
thanks for calling in man yeah trust me
check my list oh alright that's a
weekend in the show right and the show's
done say yes thanks dude alright so that
was Chris girly oh we're not we're gonna
keep going yeah oh that case the shows
not over some PHP stuff with pink dot FM
and updating blogs and some wordpress
and you been working on that for a while
I mean I use it is so it's kind of easy
to talk about okay um what's you've
you've been like I dude I am late
fascinated with the IBM model m
keyboards no WestEd the the you know the
das keyboard back you know in first
season there but I stumbled across this
site and they're not sponsoring the show
but it's clicky keyboard com so kkkkkk
kick clicky keyboards calm and you can
actually buy used IBM because obviously
they don't make them anymore but you
could buy used IBM model and keyboards
look at this sexy and and and like for
example if we want to go you know to a
straight model m we can come over here
and see oh well I could buy one for 55
bucks and got a pricey well for a model
M for a tank yeah I mean okay I mean
you've got your little you know what do
you call it on oh boy your little hot
wheels there
there you go and I've got and you've got
your Sherman tank all right yeah so
obviously a tank is gonna be a little
bit more expensive than a hot way all
right you don't have to convince me man
i grew up on it actually before I had
the model m I did the 83 key keyboard
that had the f keys on the side and only
went up to f10 I that on my pc XO that's
wrong qbasic on so yeah there those are
great keyboards me when I'm on yes one
of those lucky board oh my god arrow
keys I had to constantly switch the num
lock I love that keyboard yeah so I mean
you could really like do some damage you
know if I really they've got a solid
steel back playing on if you want to
send yourself if you're if you're in
office cube monkey that's definitely the
way to go I meant like a zombie uprising
you're gonna want something like that oh
yes you know key embedded and I ran off
yeah so if not for the clicky keys at
least for your protection but I mean so
I and to be honest with you I don't know
how I ended up here yeah I'm really like
i was browsing around it work to him
like yeah I meant to bars as von you
woke up at some weird website you don't
know what happened I mean it's an epic
model em and I'm fascinating now I'm
like you know what even though I would
probably not use it on my primary rig oh
you ought to work out robbery wins
annually you know it's the company
taking how I mean what do you buddy how
you develop you mate nobody would ever
be if you'd have the entire floor to
yourself nobody would ever be your key
exactly i'm working click like click
like you know screw you man I'm chi chi
ching ching ching I mean so cliquey
keyboards com that has been my
fascination for the entire day um what
about You Shannon ah my fascination for
the week has been logmein how the hell
did I live without log man for so long I
know I told you we had before then we
had set up what we've done VNC stuff
we've done for you p stuff but man is
there something to say about the
simplicity of that stuff yes the free
ones so symptom they don't give us money
yeah that would be that would be hot Oh
dad you kiss money oh but I mean
speaking of Wang me and I use it you
know here at the house and my parents
recently called me up and said oh by the
way
we've been infected with us to antivirus
2009 virus oh oh yeah that's right this
is that time of year where everybody
goes home for the holidays to fix their
parents computers I mean I guess I guess
it's good enough that it's that it
happens now because now i'm actually
going I I was scheduled to go and yeah
fix it you know it's July that's not in
the summer I have to make a separate
trip out there trying to walk them over
windows and hesitation alive around

wait wait just one no no we're not we're
not
we're gonna move on okay like that yes
okay so we're gonna take a quick break
and when we get back Matt you're going
to be telling about how to tunnel stuff
over ssh insecure yeah because oh but
Michael we do you want to we want to
thank one of our sponsors Shannon you
want to tell us about that long duration
sorry your complete completely
forgetting about netflix netflix i am so
sorry that was so not my fault dude they
were completely skipping over me I don't

hak5 and please don't forget the www now
we're gonna take a break
alright guys so I'm here today with
Darren who is one of the creators of the
internet famous the tester I'm not the
cool person beyond well okay so you did
a lot to it I put it inside of a
pineapple and then stuck a unicorn on it
cool yeah i mean that's hacking we the
reason he's here is because you love me
no not so much but that's okay because
you actually serve a purpose this time
so he's here because of the pineapple
and what I'm gonna show you how to do is
we've been getting a lot of emails there
about how people can actually protect
themselves from yoskar sure I love where
are you going but real quick can I go
off script here and show you something I
think I gave you your URL okay so it
wouldn't be completely off script the
well there you go um there is actually a
way that you can protect yourself before
you even you no need to worry about this
stuff there is the whole idea of knowing
if there is a Yas occur or yeah sager
around you and that is to in say like
you're running Windows you want to go
ahead and add into your wireless
connection profile a SSID called
pineapple detected right now when your
ad about if you find it since it's
probing for pineapple detected if it
replies back saying yes that's me how
many SSID is do you really think our
name that pineapple detected okay
probably not a lot yeah or don't make it
that because then we'll just add a
definition to not reply to it but but
just put something funky your know yeah
it shouldn't be there yeah ryan AKA
post-break has a guest article up on
room 362 our friend move vixx's site
links to the show notes all that fun
stuff ways to protect yourself so now
say like you did say you know what I
don't care I'll take the packets I need
some packets writing packets sometimes
you just gotta check some email yeah you
know so what we're gonna do is because
those so many people have been asking us
how on earth do I protect myself and my
internet you know from being jacked by
yo Sager I'm actually going to show you
a very quick and easy way and to tunnel
your traffic whether it be SSH or excuse
me we're going to use an ssh tunnel to
filter traffic HTTP bit torrent and
you bit torn anything that can do I map
we could do them anything that can stop
or a proxy a socks5 proxy connection
okay that's allow you to do vertical
tunnel right over this there's two
things you're going to need yeah yeah an
ssh server all right okay if you're
running windows like probably most of
our audience is there is a really easy
way to set up a ssh server that's that's
my pic dude which is free sshd it's got
a great you know user interface telnet
as a sage blah blah blah blah uses up
yeah exactly you're on linux drop their
openssh all those fun ones i mean yeah
exactly i mean if you wanted to get you
know technical and stuff like that and
just run you know a console app you know
in Windows you can you know install
cygwin don't even need to get that that
crazy here we have a smooth wall running
as our firewall / router here the hack
house and we can tunnel into an SSH on
222 yeah and we could do the same thing
if we wanted to change the rules a
little to do it from the outside and
then tamil or traffic through the hack
house anything out in the public you
know anything that allows you to connect
in via SSH right what I'm going to show
you right here he's gonna work so what
does this age server are using what do
you I'm going to use my production web
hosting box located in Texas sir it's
got 100 megabits up by Hunter megabits
down it's what hak5 is hosted on so what
we're going to do is I'm going to
actually tunnel in and the command is
exceedingly simple so what you're going
to need is obviously to have a user with
ssh ability not turned on okay so or
shell outside what software do we need
clients on client side if you're on
linux or mac ssh clients are already
built in in the command line okay
windows windows mm-hmm you can go to the
putty page everybody knows putty it's
not in the Senate exactly i mean if you
are using a different you know
application I i recommend console
applications because it's just one less
thing that I have to don't worry about
accidentally closed so what console I
mean you're using like some I'm just
using terminal in OS 10 okay but do you
have a windows vm for this demo I do
yeah but I mean it's yeah sure it's the
same thing well you
you added some special sauce to to the
windows vm to make it happier right no
no okay basically what we're going to do
is we're just going to go and i don't
know why i'm in this mode oh that's not
what I want okay so we're going to go to
the putty download site we're going to
download putty and what we're actually
in download is we're not going to
download putty we're going to download
plink which is the command line version
of putty nice so will download plank
it's less than 200 k actually it's 275
and then single executable single
executable pop it on them awesome sauce
so go ahead and save plank okay there it
is so now what we can do is actually
come up here and we'll close Internet
Explorer and we will launch command line
and start plink now the command lines
options that we're going to use is tack
n mmm that will not give you an
interactive prompt we're going to do
space tech d which is going to be the
listen port on this local machine
because we're going to run a local
products we're going to run a local
proxy on here that will then tunnel the
traffic so we're going to take our ssh
connection that we have between your
server in texas and here and then we're
going to put make a local proxy that
when you hit it on our loop back on our
Ethernet or whatever it may be it will
just run through that tunnel end it
doesn't need to know anything more than
that it just thinks that it's hitting
the proxy that's locally exactly ok so
attack d the port number that you want
to listen on this machine here ok ok and
then we're going to do my user all right
ok at the end at the domain and because
i run a non-standard port you're going
to do i think it's this one right
because normally it would be port 22 for
ssh but since you're a little funky
right so here we've got a warning
because it's the first time that i've
done it on this windows machine and just
like in the last episode when we're
talking about finger
prints and ssh so we want to make sure
that that matches up exactly does will
say it does so now I need might enter my
password and of course if it doesn't
when you're on the pineapple they'll
then then you got a little bit more so
we're going to wait make sure i entered
it correctly for you know five or ten
seconds otherwise it'll come back and
say if it doesn't come back and say
incorrect password that's it this golden
just minimizes we had we now have a
local proxy and set up and running that
should in the event that we open
Internet Explorer again what Firefox are
up or Firefox or you know anything like
that was good opera 10 I'm totally beta
just released of course you are that's
cool so we're gonna go into internet
options and before we do anything we're
gonna go to IP chicken okay or what is
my IP com what is my IP you know
whatever you guys use so that's our
current IP right now okay okay so we'll
go into tools internet options
connections land settings and we're
going to use a proxy server and we're
going to bypass proxy for local
addresses sure but we're going to come
down here not type anything in for these
know and we're going to use just the
sausages let's just the socks and your
location is going to be local host and
port 99 and 99 set up in the exactly so
we've got local host okay okay okay now
if we refresh it should Hey look at that
and there we go pee address and that it
is because everything cuz cuz if I were
run wireshark here I'm seeing all the
happy fun stuff and next thing you know
I'm just seeing garb League ook yep
garba League ook yeah result I mean it's
it's it's literally what a five minute
set up you could you can make it even
you could script that yeah it doesn't
have to be interactive mode you can
create a you know a bat file yeah that
has the command for to run your thing
you enter your password and then cut
inside of a truecrypt line because they
don't want to have your plaintext
passwords sitting on a batch file right
anyway exactly i digress so now that
we're actually tunneling through here we
can go to will say my internet provider
you know and because my is the server
that's in texas
fast hmm the tunnel even though it's
encrypting everything over ssh fast
enough for you to want vast enough to
watch you know clap your brains off if
we wanted to I think here so yeah so
there we go we are now watching a
YouTube video over an ssh tunnel now
obviously coming from your home
connection it might not be fast enough
we've got 3 megabits here in the house
that's not so it's probably enough for
us but I mean like I said even with the
encryption that's going on it's still
fast enough to watch you know and do
whatever you need and this is the same
thing in Linux or in Mac OS 10 it's the
same thing one of the commands for if
you're using a non-standard port might
be a little different as far as you know
on your your source SSH server but
beyond that it's your command TAC and
tak d and you know what you need to do
and this will then prevent any prying
eyes from looking at your packets I love
this this is good stuff okay so you've
got to write up on that last calm about
so because we just kind of mentioned
what the linux stuff is you've got I'll
have all I have every single one I'll
have windows with putty OS no Mac os10
as well as you know your favorite flavor
of linux which obviously is probably
most of you using you bunt to oh come on
dude there's a slackware kid in the back
of the audience it's just like screaming
at you right now maybe i'll throw in us
and then and then the gentoo kid that
compiled from source that guy's lead no
ya don't really know the amiga kid dude
gotta give someone I gotta ask moonlit
for an ssh commit yes absolutely if
anybody's gonna know minute with no
amiga ssh minutes anyway very cool um so
that's that wraps up tunneling one of
the ways to do it i love this let's head
over to Shannon and see what's going on
with trivia all right so last week we
had kind of a hard one for you guys I
know it was a little tough
hi hey I'm gonna do trivia with you is
that cool oh yeah sure okay well let me
tell you guys what last week's trivia
was stiletto trident polaris which of
these man-made objects do not belong and
why the person that got that right was
my dear Vicki want another then yes none
other than and blah there's there rumors
that she is actually involved in the
missile guidance system yes yeah but we
don't the way you know I know we're just
kidding mad props to Vicki in Hong Kong
um yes sending her a documentary we were
sending her yeah the the Hackensack
useless congratulations that I'm a
stiletto well it was okay and then I
would have accepted a few but she was on
the right track she got it right um was
that stiletto was the Soviet ICBM
whereas Polaris and trident were USA
ICBMs so too many acronyms there but you
know they go boom we're changing it up
this week yes we're totally doing it a
lot more fair a lot different it reminds
me of NES days collecting and Yoshi
coins maybe a little bit like up there
yeah so if you've noticed the if you've
noticed little evil servers with the
letters up there on your screen
throughout the episode um that has to do
with trivia now so what you need to do
when you're watching hak5 if you want to
enter into the whole trivia contest
daily is you need to watch for those
evil servers and put together those
letters to form the password then you go
over to how I scrambled yeah yeah well
then they're gonna be sequential order
so you gotta watch the episode
sequentially to get get all the evil
server letters sorry and then head over
to hack org slash trivia and then and
turn the password and then you will get
the trivia question and there will be a
forum there where you can submit your
answer it goes into a little database
and then 24 hours after episode release
so probably around noon on Thursday our
time we will go ahead and randomly
select the winner and
yeah go make sure to fill in your email
address so we can email you and say hey
you won and I get your mailing address
that we can send you some cool schwag I
think it's a combination of our crazy
evil server letter idea and that's idea
of why don't we just do a random
selection so that they don't know maybe
the kids in Australia have a fighting
chance yes exactly we feel kind of bad
for not giving everybody a chance to win
it yeah so thank you becky for like
totally sniping and getting the trivia
answer right there like Boop six minutes
afterwards she knew exactly where to
skip to anyway then you gotta what's all
episode yeah so we can't tell you what
this week's trivia question is but we
will next week tell you what it wasn't
who won that over to hack five dot org
slash trivia enter in that password and
winter for your chance to win awesome a
printer buzzer secretly oh is that what
it is booyakasha yeah nice yeah you know

take a break and then I think I'm going
to talk about some video games
so here we are back on the China set
with snobs talking about video games I
think the last time we did this it was
like one of the very first episodes you
just a little bit tense a little bit
then again here we are what it was it 16
I know it's 15 bucks 16 yeah the full
the first time I was talking about
audiosurf right which kind of has to do
with what we're talking about now yeah
kind of does it was actually 8 2008
winner of what of IGF ok which games
were the independent games forgettable
dependent games festival which is going
on in march in san francisco yes i want
to go the Moscow Center jinx oh wait
yeah just saying ok anyone weird beard
all right it's all yours so I continued
hang on what's going on with the IGF now
um well basically it's coming up really
soon they just closed the entries for
anybody who wants to submit their own or
ok so any of the entries that are coming
in for the 2009 ones so for all those
independent game developers out there
that you didn't go ahead and give a hug
to yes and students this is the place
where they feature like all of the the
really interesting ones and then there's
really really for guises and stuff
there's like fifty thousand dollars
worth of prizes they give out thousands
of bucks to these students into these
independent game makers for them to the
research of their games and make them
even better than they are now you can
find some real gems to me and think
about right counter-strike started as a
mod for half-life and now with cs i mean
i don't look where it is now i know in
we're like what do you study in school
uh CSI your computer science major no i
just played a lot of strike anyway so i
was checking out the website and there
are hundreds upon hundreds of entries
for this year so you've been going
through a couple of these what would
area we're focusing on i'm focusing on
well the first page of the students so
just the student category yes just the
student cattery i'm doing 40 some odd
ones of those there's the 200 and
something odd of psych teenage 2200 of
of the independent game developers and
then so there's like three hundred and
seventy some web games for you to go and
check out well what's the first one
we're looking at um so there's only so
many that you can download from the IGF
web page because a lot of them you
no they have their own websites but they
only show you screen captures or videos
well a lot of them are absolutely done
exactly so the ones that I checked out
were the ones that you can download and
you can play yourself because that's
what I'm interested in is playing the
games so what's this first one this
first one is called City rain it's kind
of like a one of those sims type games
where you have to build your own little
city and you have to pay attention to
everything from your money which is down
in the corner to what kind of buildings
that you're building of course mm-hmm
and how happier people are this reminds
me a little bit of SimCity like the
classic like not even some City 2000 the
original but you've also got things
falling from the sky and you've got to
build like schools and and police
stations and parks and stuff so a little
bit of a Tetris element here yeah you
have to kill you have to do all sorts of
things you have to build a landfill
eventually trash will start falling from
the sky you know regular afternoon days
in the city of course so oh that's
falling from the sky but it's a very
cool you got to put that in the landfill
and you gotta worry about your power and
your okay yes I do it learn how to play
this um they had a tutorial whenever you
go to you a quick play and yeah it's
it's tons of fun going through the
tutorial well it's a Portuguese game
it's by Portuguese students it's dubbed
in English it's it's it's really funny
listening to it actually hey look it was
so cute how are you gentlemen she says
you have to fill the landfill with the
trash the trash that fog your movie
anyway and it just says great or no you
did that wrong I don't like it like that
it wrong so that's the first game that's
City rain all right the second one I
wanted to show you was one of their
online games this one's called blazer or
blazer blazer basically you have this
wormhole or you're a big black hole sure
and your coat is in there you're in
charge of the ship and you either have
to bounce away large objects like this
one down here from going into the black
hole or else it'll destroy the black
hole you want to feed the black hole
these little
green things because those are good for
the black hole the whole point of this
game is making this black hole grow okay
so you've got a spaceship here you
bounce things and you want your your
black hole to get very big and powerful
and evil yes I love it he's a lot of
goals for the week and destroy these big
comments and I'll just let all those
green things feet into I don't know if
it's a blockbuster but definitely
something that's like you know arcade
action fun yes its arcade action fun and
that's why I like it alright so what
else we got going on alright so i'll
show you my third pick let's see i was
going to show you a crazy but that one
does take a little while to up to load
onto my computer system whenever I open
it up okay so i think i'm gonna skip it
but i really like the idea of this game
because there's a lot of educational
games oh come on igf com a lot of them
have really good ethics and them and
things like that like there's one on
there that talks about carbon emissions
in your household and it teaches you
about what kind of things you can turn
on that create carbon emissions and how
much it's going to cost your energy bill
all sorts of things like that it's kind
of cool for like a yes I kids like the
oregon trail for today's generation it's
so one get on that put that on every
apple 2e in every elementary school I
like my upgraded I liked crazy because
the point of this game is showing you
what a drug addict has to go through to
basically get rid of those drugs in
their life thanks crazy one words like
psychedelic yes it's psychedelic and
it's it's really fine I didn't actually
read the description the first time so I
was just chasing around all these drugs
and I was chasing around this cute
little puppy dog and then as soon as you
touch this puppy drug which is this
puppy dog hug which is basically like
getting to the highest point of your eye
you you start getting your fall from it
and the puppy dog turns into this evil
creature that starts chasing you you
know into a corner like you're getting
away from your high it's it's a really
good game to give you an idea like this
continuous cycle that that a drug addict
would have to go through it's really
interesting um the last one I wanted to
show you oh oh I had two more forget
about the froggies yes frog ille it's
very fun let me wait till it loads up
it's kind of like Frogger right but it's
it's
not too d and no it's 3d bit this one's
cool because it's basically you have to
learn how to keep keep your frog like
you have to teach him how to how to move
around with his tongue ok so you spit
out your tongue you grab stuff you
flinger yourself already you fling
around the first stage of this game is
you're going through this license ma
chart okay I'm gonna go to the single
player version right all right ok so
here i am i'm in the basically the
licensing department for little frogs
that have expired licenses what yes you
can't have an expired license as a fraud
no I had no idea that you needed a
license to be a Fraggle and there is no
way in hell that I'm gonna save through
this entire line with all these little
froggies Oh chili frog easy i'll show
you the point of the game real quick
it's basically 20 I love that it's like
pitfall but with the frog tongue yeah so
I I go up here and the guys like wow
what worried next like yeah sure I was
and then he's gonna take me through all
the different tests that I have to go
through to be king to become a licensed
like license prodigal yes I love this it
so that's this game and I definitely
suggest you guys check this one out cuz
it's a lot of fun it sounds very cute ok
we're very last line is anything but
cute it's a little bit remember when
we're talking about the drug one before
this one might work with those a little
bit yeah yeah it's kind of a
first-person shooter on crack on crack
if moving rooms that turn into waves and
it's weird no I let's check but it's so
standard WASD shooter walking around we
got some crazy guns here its wave number
one let's take up I'm in a big square uh
everything is yeah those guys are bad
guys I'm gonna try to kill him pm got
him
they're like little thai fighter duties
BAM so you can see the first wave okay
so then the level starts changing yes
and you have to continually you know
kill your enemies and then we get
different weapons here you get different
one at weapons every time that you kill
your enemies um you go through a series
of stages they're called waves i think
there's about 25 first ones is pretty
much just teaching you the different
enemies yeah pretty much and it also
tells you like when you start getting
into the groove and you start hitting
enemies in a row you get really cool
really cool combos are things like that
and of course you've got the trippy
techno to go along with it oh yeah way
cool techno yeah it's kind of hard
because the room will start moving and
things like that once you get into the
higher waves it's very very weird but I
like it and the boss is kind of hard to
nice yeah it's pretty cool this is
definitely my favorite that we've seen
so far highly encourage you guys to go
ahead and check out the entries of the
IGF because you know everybody needs to
be hugging a independent game developer
oh god the floors are moving and I'm
gonna go ahead and leave you two to play
with your thank you very much trippy
stuff here I think we're gonna take a
quick break and when we get back I'm
going to be telling you guys about how
you can use paint at FM with some custom
URLs and some PHP code to update all
sorts of blogs including WordPress so
stick around for that we will be right
back let's go ahead and check out one of
those wallpapers of the week hell yeah
alright guys so Darren is here he's been
working on this segment for a while on
and off actually because he's been
talking about it on and off for weeks
now showing us how to post multiple
things to multiple places or one thing
to multiple places so you're here to
show us ping FM which pretty much
already does that right but what do we
need to do to make this work with you
know well something we've already got
installed okay yeah that's the thing
pinged at FM if you if you're not aware
of it right now you can just head over
to ping FM right now and grab yourself
an account and basically what it allows
you to do is uh it's is manage all of
those social media went goes for your
stuff that so your Twitter your your
pleura core identical all this stuff so
I've got a like a lot of these accounts
and I use it because I'll get a lot of
great feedback from like you know the
Internet's writes a lot of fun but it's
just so difficult to like you get logins
and do stuff and then sign out log in
today it's just likes too much right so
ping got FM you can just send a quick
little email to and then there's ways to
make that a little bit easier on
yourself and whatever and there they've
got this great feature that I want to
talk about called custom URLs because if
say like we just take a look at what
they have the social networks that they
actually like integrate with right now
your Linkedin your tumblr your
FriendFeed or xango my gosh your flickr
delicious wordpress.com pretty much any
social all the new stuff yeah thing that
has a login they've kind of got but what
about what about your things like I've
got a post jurist account I've got a
tumblr account I've got a blog over at
Darren kitchenette and since i started
using this little thing I've I've
actually started posting a lot more just
because for me like the I could never
keep a blog updated I don't know how
many times I've tried like all right now
I'm going to like try to post like once
a week and now I'm like posting like
crazy because it's so super simple I get
a little widget and I'm going to show
you how to do the same thing and post
your multiple blogs so basically what we
want to do is use the feature in here
called custom URLs you can see I've got
one right here in ping FM that I post to
ok
and I set it up so that I can post blogs
to my custom URL and I think it's under
settings there it is custom URL i can
hit edit here and i can tell it what URL
i want to send my messages to so I've
got it heading to a special PHP page on
Darren kitchenette that allows me to
update logs okay so this isn't something
that's out of the box now this is not
easy now and and if you need help
there's a lot of crazy cool stuff that
you can do with it you want to go ahead
and check out the pink dot FM
development community over at Google
Groups because there are a lot of great
resources here and sample code that you
can use to put together your on PHP file
the one that I'm going to basically show
you right now is going to take so I show
you the example here I mean my pink dot
FM dashboard and i'm going to say i want
to post a new blog and we're gonna call
it i'm shooting episode like it spell at
416 hello yeah whatever alright so um
when i go ahead and hit ping that's
going to go to my custom URL and then
it's going to rebroadcast to not just my
tumblr and my posters account but my
wordpress installed on Darren
kitchenette and that's a really cool
thing because a lot of people use I mean
if you're using wordpress com for your
wordpress blog it's easy yeah that's
their own hosted thing if you've got a
wordpress blog installed on your own
domain i mean hell hack I've org runs on
WordPress version 3 com does as well no
way very cool so you could actually
update this from your cell phone from a
command line prompt I'll go into that
later but basically all you need to do
is set up this little PHP file I got
going here and and this is basically
just a modified version of one of the
examples that you can find over at the
development community but what I want to
do here is is first you got to say what
your emails from and then you basically
take the subject and body which are
those variables that were passing it
when we're tight you know typing out on
our blackberry whatever blog post and
then from there I will go ahead and just
do
the PHP male command function to send it
to my post posterous and if you've got a
tumblr account you've got a funky email
address that you can have to post to
your tumblr so you just go ahead and
post it to tumblr and the same thing for
my blog at Darren kitchenette I've got a
funky email address that if I if I send
a message to it makes it a blog post
okay but WordPress doesn't really have
like out-of-the-box WordPress does
support email to post it's not really
the greatest it's kind of craptacular to
be honest with you so there is a plugin
that i highly recommend it's called
postie you can get it over here economy
sized geek okay it's really easy to
install easy to configure plug-in and
i'll show you what it does right here
once you've got it on your wordpress
blog just go ahead and go over to
plugins i'm sorry as good as plugins and
activated after you've uploaded it go to
settings and configure postie and down
here really all you have to do is is you
can configure like the different roles
that you can have when you send an email
to your wordpress site you can configure
custom CSS for the blog's that you send
to it via email you can make it remove
the signature so like if you're posting
from your cell phone and adds that like
sent from my blackberry because oh why
can't a wank you know you can go ahead
and tell it there's three dashes right
before that clicker everything after
those yeah and then you can also do an
authorized list so right here I've made
sure that I have only my Darren secret
email at hak5 that org is allowed to
send emails to this guy your word yeah
so all you really need to do is
customize this PHP script and put in the
special email addresses that you would
normally use to post it all of those and
now you can just use ping FM to upload
update often in my case the poster is
the tumbler and my own wordpress blog
all three at once and all I need to do
is send an email to my super secret pink
dot mmm email and it does the rest it
sends it to that PHP that PHP takes care
of the rest and it out to the other
three services and then and this pole's
it my wordpress one pulls it every
minute for a new email when it says it
and I can even like put attachments in
there and it'll take the image and like
you know WordPress will take care of
that so that it's added in the post yeah
so it's great like I've been able to
like the past couple of posts that I've
done on my blog have all just been done
on just just on picking at them I mean
this is great check this out right if
you even got like I'll have this in my
senators a little ping FM widget here
that you can use where it's right in
your browser and you just like you know
instead of doing a status update on to
my blog you do your title you pop in
your post you don't even have to think
about it and now you've uploaded updated
three services I mean you can use your
you can do this for your Twitter your
identica right whatever but then take it
a step further use the custom URLs and
then get creative because now you're
just sending great stuff to PHP anytime
you want to do a post you can do this
from your cell phone yeah you can SMS an
email address right ones out so and I
even have a little kind of a funky batch
file I'll have that in the show notes
it's not worth going into but I got a
batch file that you can use if you want
to do it from the command line and you
just hit start run and you're like you
know ping FM I'm eating i'm watching
Matt be a noob and and then the whole
world would know right really easy
besides from the new part well I mean
I'll pay for that later whatever yeah
yeah but yeah so I mean and that's the
biggest problem we all have is trying to
update you know the three dozen
different services that will all signed
up to nowadays and you know obviously
making it easy it so that you can go and
because I mean I even have trouble
logging into my Twitter yeah cuz I mean
it's like or like I mean like I have so
many times like oh I got a great time I
want to make a blog post that means I
gotta go to my site go to the wordpress
of Man Thing login and I gotta type out
and it's like really I just want to like
post this link you know and like you
said you know you're out you're doing
something you see something you know
your you know your remedies a mess it
and you could end up esta exactly it
would seriously work awesome yeah
alright so I want to see what kind of
creative stuff that people can come up
with because it's just a custom URL to
go into a PHP file you could do
wasn't just use the PHP male command you
crazy stuff yeah he could build a blog
based on it yeah so there's that and got
to give mad props to Sean in
irc.freenode.net impound ping FM he's
actually the developer of ping FM and
you can use it to update all your social
crap oh crap in the wine co sphere so
give him that props okay alright so now
that we've got social networking you
know kind of taken care of we have some
very very hot news to announce for
people who like playing land games yes
with us mom so Squarespace once again is
sponsoring the episode and you've gone
ahead and you've done a bunch of
different work with the guys over at at
Squarespace getting us a custom land
page going and you want to talk about
your experiences guess that okay yeah
before we get to the viewer questions
gotta talk about the hak5 land party
page you can get to it over at hak5 LAN
squarespace com and this is our new
portal for all of the land party
developments that we are doing and Dane
helped me set it up and get it going
with this beautiful theme and then it's
just like I took that ball and I start
to roll them down crazy I gotta say
having like really gotten deep into
Squarespace I want to move hack house to
it I want to move like everything like
I'm talking to my corporation that I
better do like sysadmin work for and
they're doing like another Rev on the oh
god you know the email like we're doing
a rover on the websites like listen you
know what let's just get some
Squarespace action up in here and then
you don't have to send me copy and I'm
sitting there all day updating HTML
because that's just not fun right and I
don't want to develop a CMS and I don't
want to hack some stuff I just want to
put something together and let me tell
you working with this is like so organic
okay so um I'm used to like you're
working in some code and save it and
upload to the ftp and then you're
refreshing like a and this constant but
even if you've got a nice back end like
wordpress yep you're still going back
and forth right when you're good right
this is like all right there in it and
you just like change stuff
see the way they like so it's a very
powerful blogging engine its got like
everything I mean on the on the hak5 LAN
party page alone I put together an
Events Calendar a tournament sign up
where you can like go ahead and enter in
data so that you can like sign up for
like we'll be doing a smash brothers

going to have like tears and a
single-elimination d li mei here we've
got victory gallery yeah you can upload
images we've got a gallery going on
there are like like tons and tons of
features it's super easy to set up you
don't have to do any code like seriously
putting together the signup page which
just goes ahead knees emails it to a
special address and then saves it to an
excel sheet on there so that we can
actually do something useful with this
was like I didn't have to think about it
and have to do any Kota just drag and
drop stuff that I like that's always the
biggest pain in the ass yeah I was about
doing so he's like creating forms yeah
oh I hate that I mean I just did that
recently for the segment submission
thing for our internal back end
production crappity crap that we do here
just trying to make the show for you
guys and it's no fun because I was like
I had the episode number showing up as
your name and it finally dawned on me
that I when I copied and pasted the code
from name I had said type equals name
and I chain tour i typed change these
texts I change our type equals tacky we
can I do about it now I know it's just
AIT's who wants to do HTML come on 2008
right so there's that and then it's got
some really not like there's these
niceties that you're like okay you know
what the people that put this together
are people that have been through the
trenches okay and head to deal with
every yes there's things like quick post
so that there's like a little JavaScript
like doodly blob like I showed you with
the pink dot F mu click the thing in
your Firefox and bam you get that you
know right to your post they've got that
they've got the email options so you
could tie it in with the thing I just
talked about it go email to they got
microblogging stuff so I mean so now
it's a word your own press microblogging
a Twitter what do you want to make right
so and then if you want to get if you
want to get nitty-gritty you've got
access to do all the CSS you can get
advanced and you can drill down you can
do some really neat stuff I'm addicted
to it that's that's the thing I got to
say is I started making the the land
party page and then
couldn't stop so I'm totally stoked that
we finally have something beautiful and
I didn't even like really i only spent
like an hour or something oh yes but now

Google Dover it but it's very it's as
cool as I told you head over to
squarespace com got to thank them
sponsoring us and thank them for like
letting me know they exist because now
i'm getting my corporate people oh yeah
and plus they basically i mean they
basically created the shell and they
were like oh so here you go yeah now see
how easy yeah and at first i was like
okay this is and then i was like I
wysiwyg and then I got into the powerful
backend stuff and I was like you know
all right so thank Squarespace and
you've just you know made Darren's life
a lot easier I wanted for every website
we do even packed house com well you
know maybe anyway you made me that so we
can get through these questions sure so
let's say we have some questions this
week Shannon what's going on just one
just one yes hamer pad gamer what's up
man he asked a very simple question he
just wants to know if there is a way
that we can password protect our
applications um there is and it's funny
that he asked this because i was
browsing around and i actually found it
just just check in one of the multitude
of sites we all checked during i right i
don't remember which one it was your RSS
feed exactly so the application is
called empathy don't exactly know why
it's called empathy it really has
nothing to do with pastor protecting
things uh-huh you'd think like lock box
or something for passing protecting your
files password protecting applications
ok so if I've got like quick in on my
family computer but I don't want like my
son why else and I have a son anyway he
you know uses like I'm just now I me
baby stuff yeah and you use the computer
to play like neopets or whatever and I
don't want him going into my quicken I
should use this to lock it down yes damn
plea a PhD no the the application that
you download is actually a zip file
there's not even an installer great i
love that we go ahead and we copy it to
a directory on our you know windows
computer sorry it only works on windows
won't want one and basically you go
ahead and you double-click empathy and
here you are the file that we're going
to input is going to be vmware converter
ok ok so i'm a system in and i don't
want people converting VMS there you go
there you go alright so i'm going to go
ahead and select converter we're gonna
click open and we're going to do a
password of a single character because
that's secure yeah exactly and when i
hit protect it will be I you know what I
honestly don't know how it does it's
magic special backing super skills with
whatever awesomesauce so obviously for
the hardcores of the hardcore that want
to get into something they're gonna get
in ok but it's just making life a little
harder for people alright so basically
now that we've gone ahead and we've this
is good ass really out of Quicken yes
Wow we're gonna we're going to go ahead
and pass we've already clicked protect
and now when I come over here and I run
my shortcut so before you even launch
the application it's so it it didn't
like put it didn't change to the
shortcut to it actually matched the
executable yes put it in a wrapper the
same way that we would if we were trying
to pack an executable can get it past
the antivirus same kind of idea yes
vmware converter is not even running yet
yeah so the application hasn't loaded
into memory love that so there's some
magic going on so the password that we
eventually entered was l and now that
i've actually entered my password it
will load the application now it is easy
as now when you when you create a
password-protected file you have the
option to create a backup because it's
patching the executable yeah I could see
there's some potential here for Bork ISM
you know yeah so you create a backup
delete the backup if you want or move it
to a secure location or we can go ahead
and we can unprotect the file by just
selecting it and clicking unprotect oh
we got an NFS or yeah and undo our
changes will unprotect and now now
vmware converter should load without
problems without problems without a
password so there you go answer yes it
is possible empathy i went to the dudes
website it was down unfortunately
probably that's done it's something like
that so go to download.com and type in
empathy 2.1 and you can actually
download it it is a free application
however there is a caveat to using this
and what's that the dude wants you to
send him a postcard with a picture of
you to his to him to like his ice cave
that he has like I'm in Scandinavia
there we go and the only way the only
way to use a password longer than a
single digit is to send him a postcard
with your email address and he will send
you a registration code I know trust me
it blew my mind too but apparently he's
got postcards of everybody that has used
or requested his software hanging in his
house so like the next episode of act 5
but we need Makai large or whatever the
hell your new is dominate 8 um mikail us
drapskii he gets mad props just for the
uniqueness of that that I was like I was
like well alright let's do it you're
snobs let's let's send it in now see if
we get I had a center at the post Wow
okay I'm good with one passerby or one
character okay yeah i mean actually you
can use it with one care tricks i guess
for these did something like that so you
can use it with one character and unless
you send up a postcard so there you go
if you'd like to send us a postcard so
yeah Happy Holidays Happy Holidays is
that it i mean it feels like we've been
doing this show for the last four years
uh we have we have left four hours is
