welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morrison today we are checking
out the Zen Maps output now last week I
showed you how to create your own
profile in Zen map and how to do some
skins but we haven't really covered what
all the bells and whistles are inside of
Zen maps so let's go ahead and do that
now now after you're running your own
skin you'll see your targets IP address
under the hosts you can click on
services as well and click on any known
open port for a service now all this
information is over on the left side so
if I click on hosts I see that I just
scan point 7 4 and also if I change this
to 0 / 2 4 and we all know that that
will run a scan on the entire network
I'll see every single target IP address
listed under hosts and if I click on
services I can see exactly what services
are open and available for me to scan on
that known target it'll bring you over
to the ports and host window so this
ports and host window that's pretty cool
- this is going to show you the target
address the port the protocol and the
state that it is in so if it's open or
if it is closed if you ended up getting
any kind of output about any closed ones
now if you go back to the host window so
I can click over here and choose hosts
when I double click on that I get every
single listing of a port available now
take a look at this one this is pretty
cool this is called topology but to do
that we're going to scan the entire
network so let's give that a second to
go ahead and scan the entire network
okay so now that my scan is done I just
did a regular scan of all the services
that are on my network I can go over to
topology so down here you're going to
see a nice little mapping of everything
that is on your network it's a graphic
map of pretty much your entire network
I'm going to click on fisheye because I
prefer that view and I'm going to come
down to controls I'm going to zoom in a
bit so you can see what's going on on
here there we go
okay so clicking on controls is going to
give you more options to look at
everything that shows up on this on the
skin so this is the controls everything
on this side that you can see down here
I have different actions that I can take
I can show some more information group
children whatever that means I can even
fill regions interpolation lets me
change frames layout lets me choose
whether it's weighted or symmetric so a
couple of different views and then view
down at the bottom lets me turn on or
off the address I can change the
navigation so I can move up and down
change those views I can zoom in a
little bit more so I can do that and
then I can change the ring gap which
will give me a little bit more spacing
same thing with lowering your ring cap
also if I move this up just a little bit
you can see down here at the bottom
there we go the thing down at the bottom
the fish ion ring if I think I can
change this let's see if I can change
this doop enter okay and well let me
change that one but I can change this
one over here interest factor so all of
these basically just give you different
views and then I could click on one of
the items of interest so let's say I
want to look at one for for a little bit
more so I can change that to make it the
center of interest and then I can right
click and look at more information about
that specific target that I had on here
and if I wanted to I could also close
out of this and I can save my graphic as
a PDF as well so I can go back to it at
a later time and I would be able to do
some
our research about this it's pretty cool
I really like the topology graph and I
think it's pretty interesting that you
can see everything mapped out like that
now after the break we'll quickly go
over the rest of your Zen mapping
options so that you can beat a Zen map
Overlord stay tuned the hack shop is
hacked five premiers store for all your
pen testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and it types
like keyboard it can quickly type
scripts into a computer crazy fast like
this week's favorite from TV stunts I
believe that's how you say his name this
simple script will run a scheduled task
on login so his example was an HTML
script now of course we couldn't do the
show without your support so we would
like to thank you with something special
use the coupon code snugs with any order
for your very own sign tak tip stickers
thank you so so much for supporting the
show and we're back with more Zen map
and next up after the topology is the
host details so this is the next tab in
all of our different output options I
could click on host details and let's
choose a host I can go over to my hosts
column over here and pick out any
specific host so this is going to give
me a user-friendly view of more
information about a specific host you
can also look at previous scans in the
scans tab so if I click on scans and say
I had a whole bunch of different scans
that I've done since I've had Zen map
open I can scroll through all of those
different ones and see every single one
that I've actually done so pretty cool
very easy to use now back up at the top
there's just a couple of other options
that I wanted to share with you first
off if you click tools one of the
options up at the top and then click
compare results you can do that and then
you can choose a couple of different
scans so say I wanted to do a regular
scan of the entire network and then I
wanted to do an nmap scan of 7330 1.74
and just seven for when you hit enter
you'll end up with a couple of different
scan outputs for each one and down at
the bottom you'll get a comparison of
the two different scans that you've done
so one will end up being
Green and one will end up being red and
you can also search your scan results
for target words - or you can filter the
hosts now lastly you can also save your
scans from the scan menu so I'll close
out of here and that's over at the top
this is just like pretty much every
other program on the internets
everywhere so you can do new window open
up a scan that you've saved previously
or you can save a skin that you've
already done so you can go back and
research it's more if you have a lot of
work to do with different and map prop
problems or something that you run into
on your network so all of this is very
simple I really like Zen map it makes
life very easy and since we already
understand all the different commands
and all the different options makes it a
lot easier to just write out commands
really quick press ENTER and then just
let it scan now of course if there's
anything that you want me to check out
regarding nmap before we end our series
