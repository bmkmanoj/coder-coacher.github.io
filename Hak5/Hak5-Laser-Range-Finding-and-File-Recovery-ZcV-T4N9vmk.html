forget the ww next we're gonna take a
break in we're going to throw it over to
you guys after that
alright guys so Jason Applebaum is here
from Georgia helping us out you are the
creator of the very world famous miss la
missile applications for the striker to
which has an integrated laser beanie
thingy on it with a webcam with the
webcam and why not use the best of both
worlds and let's do ladies arrange
funding yeah ladies range friday well
what we got here is just like i said
your basic striker to with a webcam
attached except for this time we're
running a little bit of different
software on my laptop here okay we got a
little bit of as I can't control this
it's alright yeah okay there we go there
we go alright so as you can see right
here it's says the range negative 72
centimeters or not it's not behind us
it's not inside of us it's that's
obviously wrong the thing inside of us
that would be kind of nasty it'd be
painful oh but like well as bad
teleporter I love to try that later on
next project when we won't feel anything
yes we're gonna be hammered hopefully so
what it's doing right now is it's
tracking as you can see you got a little
bit of a red line right here okay and a
red line right here so we it's tracking
it just has the wrong distance right so
what I'm proposing is we rewrite this
using the same sort of concepts except
we're better and working this
application is very very old he said it
was like three years old or some three
years old it's probably older than that
because it's using an SDK that's
actually stopped working into top being
developed in 2004 so basically Jason and
I SAT and we were like okay I suck at
math he doesn't really but I know I know
enough to be a little dangerous I had a
calculator okay so there you go which
eat it's cool it was a good calculator
to exactly what what what we're gonna do
is actually you not me I'm not help oops
f that you're on your own nerve a kid uh
he's actually going to rewrite it and
make it work Oh imagine that well I was
really thinking we could just tie it in
to the RT
esting application okay so what we got
here is how this works so the you got
the ccd is a X amount of pixels in
length so the laser hits the the ccd
coming off the wall as you can see this
red line is the laser reflecting off the
wall and the higher it is on the wall
the taller the more it adds to the
height so the actual equation is the
distance equals the height over the
tangent of the angle which it hits the
ccd I know it's a lot to take in all
being the show notes so what you have is
a guest who does show notes I i figure i
can at least write him do half the
battle here so you have like I said you
have plus or minus so you've got your
two planes and all this is basic
trigonometry you know eight Wow basic
trigonometry I can't even remember a
squared plus B squared equals C squared
right and you're trying to find the D
distance here but the problem becomes is
once the CCD it once the lazer reflects
at a certain point at the CCD once it
reaches the max it can't go above that
or tell the distance so on one point we
did some math and we came up with a 1.3
megapixel ccd at 100 ppi which is pixels
per square inch and that comes out to
being what was it it was 3 33
centimeters which is just yet yes 33
centimeters animators so anything past
anything within 33 centimeters and the
wall are the laser and 33 centimeters
that's not going to pick up because it's
at the edge of the CCD and it's just
going to register all funky so to
compensate for that I had this really
cool idea of adding a second camera at a
higher angle so you just basically
change the angles right so we're an end
up with a two camera set up hopefully
it'll pick up a little bit of the
clothes ranging bring us into you know a
good foot the other problem with this is
there's a quite a bit of math involved
yes so what we actually figured out is
we're actually going to create a
calibration button yeah definitely which
would be a whole lot easier okay cuz
what you can do is just you know kind of
put your hand up and go okay this isn't
15 fee or 5 feet and you see calibrating
there you go I like it Locsin is real
simple so do you have a website I do a
website and checking out
Jason Applebaum calm all right well
Jason uh it looks cool I mean it the
application that you know that this
three-year-old application it's like I
got a crosshair but it just worked so I
want to fire some missiles and let's get
that work definitely all right cool well
we are going to kick it over to Darren
and Shannon for trivia we don't have any
trivia this week time warp that time
warp hey that's okay it says trivia on
my paper you don't forget the paper
forget the proof is actually doing
something different this week all right
no yeah yeah we're not doing the trophy
is sorry guys we decided to pick it up
again in the new year since it's
December 31st we're gonna just start
again next week so this week we're going

going to be talking about
not matin baron it's gonna be christened
Darren Criss is back hey Chris and
Darren are going to be talking about
some data recovery tools for you
so Chris back in action ready to do some
data recovery yes not back from sands
yeah was that oh it was great i learned
a lot like i told you at the intro yes I
should have been I'll slap bass no I'm
just kidding come on no I mean you know
it's all you're always a constant
learning experience and everything so I
mean you know I can't ever knew every
back five yeah so myself and technology
so the first thing I want to kind of
show people is this awesome new
wallpaper fake one in there I am no but
anyway what's so so if you accidentally
deleted that wallpaper maybe we could
recover it right we could so i'm going
to show you i actually would do it and
did this outside of the vm because it
was easier but what i did is you'll see
in my forensics folder here i have a
whole lot of stuff here but i made to
USB key images okay all right and one
and i just use DCF LED it's it's like DD
it's just better it's recompile it's got
some better stuff in it and there's
actually one now that i'm going to talk
about in the next step excitement in the
next episode once i actually use it
called d3 CDD which is even a better
version of BB so i don't know i guess i
guess he just keeps getting better and
better for you so yeah basically it just
makes a raw image of so what are these
two USB key image ok it's i took this
USB key right here and i made i think
it's got some random files on it and
from what i'ma go cuz this is bad your
house fell off so who knows maybe it's
got some maybe I shouldn't plug it in I
just too worried about the sandisk oh
yeah that's the one that I want to be
with whatever so um so I made two images
the first image is when I is just static
stuck it in image didn't do anything to
it and the second one I deleted files
off of it and then imaged it great so
we've got two before and after and if
you look here the file sizes are the
same cuz you know the DD just does the
whole entire thing oh right space and
all so how big is this actually let's
see i'm not i don't read kilobytes that
well a 1.86 gig both of them both o is a
two gig drive basically so what what a
Bibble now is um so we first of all we
want to see okay what's going on with
this Drive and one of the tools we can
use
duty used to do this mm-hmm is uh we
just scroll up here a little bit oops I
made this a little too uh to beg a
little too big that's what happens when
you make your command windows big so I
want to do this program as a little
program part of the window sleuth kit
called fls and I'm kind of skipping
forward as to some of the stuff because
now let's see it in action and so can go
back in theory later so this is what fls
will do fls and if I exile run it on the
normal key first so I'm the normal key
everything's there okay you know we've
got some week and I didn't this password
file was in there yet because I created
as eatables okay random stuff so then we
do this second one and we see these
stars what are the stars mean the stars
mean it's unallocated means the file was
deleted okay unallocated as in we can
override that yes oh that's just so so
that space that these style took up
could be taken by something else now
right um and if from file says new file
so it still be show up as unallocated if
it was overwritten the cool part is see
that number 12 right there number 12 16
and 19 yeah those are called inodes what
29 had and I know it is basically a
pointer okay it says this is the cluster
sector forgive me i'm sure it's with the
area on the desk the area on the disk
where that file resided or rejects so
and i know'd can be reused but what
happens is it usually takes a number of
rights before that i know it gets
reusing so you can theoretical to
something but the content of you can
change so the stuff so verify so what
this helps you do is once you take that
I know and what I did here is a I did an
ISTAT on it just without any options and
I want 19 is I want that passwords ok so
we specify 19 and what is it what is
that I step program do ok I stat goes
through and tells you what sector that
that I know it starts at on the hard
disk oh it says you know it'll say not
allocated it gives you some file
attributes when it was written you know
accessed in and created and it'll also
give you the 8 by 3 83 finally sure with
the split
windows since this is a fat32 your age
of course obviously with NTFS and
everything it's a little different yeah
so that tells me okay I started a
sexpert 8320 right what is it okay so
that's where it starts that's where the
file starts so great so let's go recover
a sector 8320 okay then we're done right
no we have to figure out how much the
file spans okay so how big is H sector
each sector well we actually go through
and we do FS staff on this and this is
going to let me do it more sped out more
I wanted so what this does it tells you
everything about the file system tells
you it's fat32 the OEM name all that
stuff what we're really looking for here
is the sector size in the cluster size
ok so it's exercise 5 5 12 cluster size
4 so 4 4 kilobytes per per cluster ok so
that so what that means is since there's
since we're looking for 80 8320 mm-hmm
we want it to fall so here it says
closer range is 22 4049 2010 huh so
that's all the available space you could
have because the roots directory takes
up the first couple and will actually
have your you know you're so so we know
that they're very least four bytes you
know we know that this because it can't
be any smaller that's the file is at
least four bytes okay so what we do is
we run a program when we just quit out
of this we run a program called the
ISTEP program again and this time and I
stat you can specify blocks so you guys
said there's nothing like be yep and
what I did is I started with just one
and that's just a size 11 block is is
that that's one block two blocks I get
any 321 so I hope they always sequential
yeah once you find the file it's it's
going to oh i thought well actually it
doesn't always it's not always
sequential over the drives fragmented
you know that makes Sen find fragments
and other spaces and after that and I'll
make putting it back together even more
difficult it's a little difficult so
eventually in all the king's men yes
eventually we go up to the number eight
and we find that those are our eight
blocks that put this file together what
led you to believe it was eight
just kept going up there is actually a
way to do this if you have a spreadsheet
it's a little bit of time in your hands
in a calculator and a hex editor but you
know I'm so based on the size of the
file you can figure out how many yeah
waist based on the side based on the
sector size the cluster size and the
actual i know'd got links to that yes
there's gonna be links to the first wiki
sleuth kit and in the next part we're
gonna actually show you how to how you
to make this stuff you don't even need
to do this I just run a program called
for most any case we just had a run a
program all right over on the part but
it's nice to know how this early because
that's so uh so next time are we good
you're gonna show us how to extract this
using Linux yeah i'm gonna have a linux
am set up and we're gonna use for most
because for most is a is mainly linux
cool there are i think there are some
windows binary zout there but i didn't
see them some but um we're going to set
up for most and linux and we're going to
actually carve out some data and use a
couple other programs to to show you how
they're looking forward or how to
recover do next week for that okay cool
well i'm going to go wrap this up with
matt and see you next week
alright guys so we are here with d money
yeah and we are getting ready to wrap
this but what we want to do is we
want to thank the guys over square space
for creating an awesome web publishing
system so if you're using WordPress and
you're like us I can paint in the ass
constantly update and do all this crap
with Darren's going to show you some
nifty Squarespace foo right d yeah yeah
let me show you right here Squarespace
it's super simple because when you're
editing your site it's just like you're
on your site so here it is what you guys
see for the hak5 LAN party but if I just
click the little button up at the top
here after a log in I see like all these
new entries set up here what I want to
show you is how simple it is to create a
forum so basically you go into
navigation mode and you add a page and
you don't have to go into backend blame
you get this little here's all of your
options so you can add a picture gallery
you can add amazon which list it's all
pre populated by Squarespace yeah yeah
you just you just fill in the blanks you
can add you know links file storage like
a like a Google Maps type dealy
discussion guestbooks file drop I've got
like I've used like a lot of these one I
want to show you how super simple is to
set up is discussion so I'm going to
create a new discussion page over at the
hak5 land site okay so I choose this and
I'm going to call it exchange friend
codes see so now we have a special place
right there on the site so you can
exchange you're like you know friend
codes whether you're on like we hack
five around your xbox 360 gamertag no
ps3 whatever right so then I just choose
discussion options do I want to you know
how do i want to sort it I'm gonna with
the go with the default I'm spree age 25
that sounds good I mean really what else
do I need to do right I can go in here
and do an advanced manual override on
the style sheet if when i get thank you
but you know what I'm just going to
click create page I give it a name I
told it I wanted it to be a form and now
when I come over here and see what it
looks like for you guys I click right in
there BAM got a form off and create post
there's no worrying about you know your
PHP version is off or you're my sequel
you know chmod and stuff
basically click and go yeah so now I'm
drink Darren's we code which that isn't
it but you know a lots of badass we coax
the really long one and then I just
click enable the page it's enabled so
everybody can go and play with it so
hook us up with your friend codes so
that we can hit you up on xbox live
people have been asking about that and
you know a little place I can play some
wii bowling with some people okay and
maybe some smash brothers brawl let's
hook it up smash brothers let's go so
anyway thank Squarespace for that
because that's where you can go and get
your own pages that are that easy to
create it is just simply squarespace com

problem and you got the solution the
solution is basically something bondage
to wit solution bondage s solution you
can do it that way if you want you
should mix it all together I like it
alright so we want to let you guys know
feedback at hak5 org hit the forums and
forums out hak5 org check out the shirts
and other revision3 schwag over at
revision 3.com store we've got a bunch
of sticker designs that are coming hi
and Darren is Ashley doing some packaged
food for you guys he's got a really
great set up coming no announcement if
I'm Tara them I'm not announcing
anything I'm just saying if you're if
you're into the treasure technologic
five stickers and stuff like that you'll
be blown away by what parents put
together for you it's actually doing
some work during regular hours of the
day instead of no you cannot has no I
will seriously destroy this alright so
with all that said reminding you to
trust your technical end up
