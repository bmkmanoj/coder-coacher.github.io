Jerrica see I'll give you one guess
where I am I'll give you three into the
first two don't count but you already
know I'm in Jakarta right now heading
over to Bangkok I'll be there for almost
a week and then it's back down to
Australia for all certain to hang out
with Sebastian and Shannon's going to be
there and oddly enough I'm recording
this before if you even finish the
previous episode which I still don't
know what it's about nor do I know what
this one's about so it's just going to
like start now and figure it out along
the way thanks for joining me
hashtag knock across America WTF why do
I keep saying hack across America I
haven't been to America in like three
months
the world it's the world
not gonna lie when I started on act
across the planet the novelty of flying
around visit the class under 787 was
quite high and not to sound ungrateful
or anything I mean don't get me wrong
this amazing opportunity with Lillian
has been fantastic but there are another
12 flights ahead of me and I'm racking
my brain to say something insightful
about a Boeing 787
they have nice laboratorians don't drink
out of that you're going to regret it
and that it's me and that me and then me
and then me it
okay guys I'm seriously going crazy
and checkpoint Bangkok on this 787 in
here I was trying to show you some
esoteric detail like fact that right
over there there's a little staircase
that will take you to some bunk beds
overhead for flight crew to rest well
these are doing long haul stuff not this
little short three and half hour what
we're doing out this way which is over
there you can't do that yet
now you can
or 50s good thank you
okay thank you
gone by and I don't even know where I am
anymore
well there DejaVu I get the feeling that
I've done this exact episode like before
except the view is a lot better
I mean you know what I'm about to say
anyway so why don't we just yes wow this
is a really weird place to start an
episode but I just figured I'd update
you guys since last week I was talking
about being all stressed out and stuff
and I just got off the phone with one of
the core stakeholders from the
engagement that I'm on and everything is
working out so there's that but also a
life tip if you are jet-lagged and in a
new city and you haven't had the
opportunity to get real food and the
only thing that they have on the menu
for room service that the vegan is
french fries don't don't don't don't eat
french fries before bed because this is
not good
you're going to feel like crap I have to
wash my hands cuz I touched it oh I have
a french fry regret so also the middle
of the night and I just landed here in
Australia and I don't know where I am
but that's okay because in the morning
the Sun comes up I'll see tomorrow is
going to be a better day

is Surfers Paradise
