Metasploit minute is brought to you by
viewers like you
if you get value from this show and can
spare even a dollar please consider
contributing at Metasploit minute com
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on break in I'm and host Rob
fuller but you can call me movies today
we're actually talking about Python yes
you heard me
Python Python has been integrated into
Metasploit meterpreter
as an interpreter on the victims side
the cool thing about this is now well
while railgun was awesome
and we've talked about railgun in the
past Windows API calls are tough the
cool thing about Python is it's a little
simpler except for the spaces and tabs
and I'm going to get hate mail msf at
hak5 org go ahead I understand it's a
horrible language you can cut that out
maybe not whatever alright so
interpreter now has a Python extension
inside of but inside of it so so all you
have to do is load Python it on here on
our session we have or in its loading
Python hopefully it won't take forever
it's Python there we go finally it works
alright the cool thing about this is now
that I can run Python code on the
session now while it doesn't have all
the libraries and I can't just you know
load arbitrary libraries into it it does
have a lot of the basic ones that are
there already so I can do stuff like
port scanning or stuff like that which
is a lot faster to do on hosts instead
of through meterpreter so let's look at
what we have now using a question mark
as always we can see the added commands
that we now have we have Python execute
so if I did Python Python execute - H so
we're going to say
print or how about quotes print hello
and that will print hello pretty simple
we can do a lot more than that though
the cool thing about this is that we can
import modules or files after we do that
so if we import if we import a Python
file or a module we can actually import
libraries one at a time so as we get
further down and make sure that these
these are tested we can have an entire
suite of tools import it into our
current working session now I've tried
to get in packet working which is one of
my favorite Python libraries but it's
too huge and I've only gotten certain
pieces to work and but while that's
useful it is tough so you have to work
through the different libraries and
figure out how what works for you but
we're going to show you just a demo of
some of the things you can use with C
types c types is the c library for
python allowing you to do windows api
calls directly from python so no more
fiddling around with railgun and
breaking stuff you get to just write a
little bit of python with your stupid
spaces and tabs i'm going to get so much
hate mail and you're going to be able to
get it running inside on the victim side
so let's do something very simple let's
click over here and we can see that i've
already written a script called from c
types import star copy file and i'm
going to copy calc c just directly to
the desktop not that complicated
i just want to show you how this thing
works alright so python import h4 to
figure out how what i'm doing and then
the file now there are other options
like name of the module you want to use
for single files or are for the variable
that's going to come out form it and I
don't have any output and also all it's
going to do is do the copy and be done
so I don't have to send anything else so
example dot pi
I've already named it something that it
should be able to do it importing
example pie and it's done and if you can
see in the background Kalka XE is now on
a desktop that simple there is so much
that is unexplored with the python
extension onto meterpreter that i just
want you guys to try it out learn he can
do so much everything from like I said
port scanning to making your own you
know persistence module in it that it
does a bunch of things for you without
having to call back temperature prayer
every time it's really great I look
forward to seeing what you guys make out
of it alright so that's it email MSF at
hack 5 org tell us all about your Python
woes and how much you love Python vs.
Ruby I'll take it I understand and stay
tuned and Metasploit minute comm for
more shows like these more Ruby actually
huge thanks to everyone who supports the
show you support it you can support us
directly by donating at patreon.com
slash Novak's i'm sure i'm going to lose
patrons just because of this episode and
every dollar helps makes these shows
more for you and then for that i'm
internally grateful until next time i'll
move expand i'll be hacking to the cows
come home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
