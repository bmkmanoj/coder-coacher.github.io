and FBI case ransomware watch out of
vigilante has appeared and bad luck
actually sad luck all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for April
13 2016 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom now I first off want to say
thank you to our patrons of course if
you want to support the show you can go
over to patreon com we're on to the news
now in a slightly unsurprising change of
events at least one person has come
forth explaining that cellebrite
actually had nothing to do at all with
breaking into the infamous San
Bernardino iPhone it was really one or
more grey hat hackers who helped the FBI
and return for a lump sum payment it is
unsurprising because zero day exploits
are oftentimes kept secret until a
payday occurs for the holder and many
companies such as Z rhodium which we
have mentioned before advertises the
selling of these zero days the concern
that many hold here is whether the FBI
will disclose this vulnerability that
they ended up using to crack that iphone
to apples so that apple can fix
consumers devices in the future and give
their consumers more security now since
the FBI has commonly con to hacker
conventions they've even done convention
keynotes and they've done talks and they
have explained how info SEC and
government agencies really need to work
together to disclose this kind of
information to each other I would find
it rather hypocritical if the FBI chose
to keep this under lock and key albeit
digital locks can be exploited as well
given that they've had such a friendly
attitude towards the infosec community
along with this news came a new bill
drafted by Senator Dianne Feinstein of
California and the Senate Intelligence
Committee Chairman Richard burr of North
Carolina which would force companies to
decrypt and or unlock devices under
government court order as well as as
well as provide technical assistance so
obviously this is a reaction to the
Apple versus FBI iphone case
given that many companies are working on
or already have an encryption technique
in place for their devices or software
this bill is being criticized for its
and i quote clear threat to everyone's
privacy and security as quoted from nima
Giuliani the legislative counselor for
the ACLU now currently this bill is
under draft and is fairly new and many
critics believe that it has little
chance of passing so this is kind of
cool ransomware you know of it it's that
nightmare that can encrypt an entire
hard drive of contents on a victim's
computer normally a victim has to pay
some kind of fee like a Bitcoin or two
which ends up being a few hundred bucks
to a hacker to get the decryption
password and then get their data back
which they already owned but end up
having to pay for well in a positive
turn of events a group of researchers
have put together a tool that can
decrypt the petia ransomware in a mere
10 seconds or less allowing the victim
to get their data back without sending
bitcoins to the thief so the tool was
created and posted on github by a
Twitter user name at Leo and stone and
was later turned into an easy executable
by security researcher Fabian woes are
and now a whole tutorial blog has been
posted to help victims through the
process now while this is a really
awesome story of the internet pulling
together to help victims of ransomware
and I think that's really great I do
need to say this beware of downloads
don't open random attachments from
random stranger people's emails and
always be skeptical about software that
you choose to download make sure it's
coming from a legit site use logical
security practices so that you won't
fall prey to ransomware and chances are
you'll never have to worry about
something like this happening to you you
guys probably remember this the huge
hype surrounding a pretty serious
announcement about a server
vulnerability a couple of weeks ago well
it turns out bad lock discovered by sir
net and advertised really heavily to
spur awareness and possibly obviously
Free Press for sir net is actually
hashtag sad lock the hype put a really
bad taste in a lot of critics mouse in
the most basic of descriptions the bug
allows a hacker to gain remote access to
a server via a man-in-the-middle attack
and it allows for denial of service
attacks as well this
CVE or the common vulnerability and
exposure number is CVE 2016 21 18 and 20
16 01 28 and it does affect several
different verses of samba systems for
example the bug is not as serious as
heartbleed which a lot of people were
assuming it would be but it is still
important to patch patches were released
this week and including on patch tuesday
of course and anyone who runs systems
listed at bad luck org are advised very
importantly to update our featured
comment today comes from well several
folks are our last episode who bought at
the whatsapp encryption and our positive
remarks now while I fully understand and
appreciate that whatsapp is owned by
Facebook which is a company that pretty
much runs its beating heart on the data
of its users that's why I don't have it
installed on my phones that in itself
makes me kind of critical of any kind of
Facebook entity and this is still a
positive story about what's whatsapp so
given that web sep has a user base of 1
billion people it's partnered with open
whisper systems in november of 2014 and
that is the company that Moxie
Marlinspike is known for also the
company that made signal which is one of
the leading encryption messaging apps
available and what's up announced that
the encryption for all of its users not
just one iowa not just iOS over android
for example all of its users are using
the same protocols as signal i would say
that's a really good thing for its users
now while i prefer a platform not owned
by Facebook one that is preferably open
source like signal or textsecure many
users don't care or they are not willing
to move to another secure messaging
service which is highly unfortunate and
if the company is willing to add
encryption to their platform and still
offer the same consumer convenience
because a lot of people don't want to
take convenience over security or
security over convenience good for them
I say good for that company the eff has
given them a 6 out of 7 on their secure
messaging scorecard which is great
they're only losing a point for not
being open source which I consider quite
important now if only they would add a
warrant canary to so we would all know
that they've never been under a court
order to give up any kind of information
about their users then I'd say good onya
whatsapp but I think that they are
heading in the right direction so thank
you everyone for your comments of course
if you have any thoughts on today's
stories you can leave them below and we
might feature them next week now before
I go I want to give a huge thanks to
everyone who has supported the show so
far in patreon did you watch this entire
episode if you did you must have enjoyed
it so please consider becoming a patron
at patreon.com / threat wire and we may
even feature you're adorable fur babies
just like these ones in our next episode
because they are super super cute and we
want to give back to our community
because we appreciate you and you are
the reason why we're able to keep the

have you guys out there that are
supporting us and we really appreciate
it our next milestone goal is to add
another episode each week an RSS feed
and our patrons will still get
behind-the-scenes updates early access
and a monthly security video by Darren
kitchen of hak5 now if you are new here
I'm going to be over in Tokyo in May so
if you're going to be hanging out over
in Tokyo just happened to be there in
may hit up snubs ecomme / blog I'll have
a meet-up RSVP link over there and you
can sign up if you want to join me and
of course you can find all the
information about our episodes links to
our social networks and other ways to
contribute over at threat wire net and
with that I am Shannon Morse and i will
see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
