drive that plugs into your PCMCIA port

if you remember
so one of the consequences of shooting
this hack across the planet blog the way
that it's naturally evolved is such that
I'm running out of space is actually
here check that out on a single for or a
13 to 13 and 14 degree magazine then get
to a mall
be the place to go alright my mission is
to find an external hard drive because I
did not bring enough disk space for this
trip and I'm kicking myself for not oh
well and figure out a wide-angle lens
situation for this and a little
Bluetooth adapter and some other odds
and ends I ever mentioned that the Wi-Fi
pineapples featured in that game I may
have mentioned that like once or twice
and if we can't recall the last time I
saw simek's software in person the
topical media weather cd-rom drive
well at least they did a good photo
shelf job on the Photoshop okay
I sort of went to pick up coffee of
Adobe Photoshop 7 just running through
some malware analysis hey Shannon do we
need any talk a video to the show this
is hours and hours and only a hundred
thousand goofy act took like seven
dollars
how about vector graphics I mean that's
like three thousand and eight hundred
dollars worth of savings right there
I don't need a 7 inch dual SIM phablet
putter Wang one hashtag techni left if
you have a great idea bring it to the
web the way Shannon I do and head over
to domain comm with an awesome domain
discovery service and a quick media
checkout process you'll have the perfect
site up and running in no time my guys
over at domain.com are soon tax five
bands which is why hak5 will save you an
extra 20% at domain.com or just send the
tweet and say thanks to support in hack
5 all these years so when you think
domain names think domain.com
have I mentioned how I want a 7-inch
phone but don't need one whatsoever
I phone

Asian electronic flea market experience
and I receive just that
that's a good ask for a lot of selfies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
