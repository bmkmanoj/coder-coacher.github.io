by domain.com
so you're looking around you're looking
around and then some ATM machine in
Idaho disconnects your SSH session
because you weren't using this cool tool
ATM machine
not joke what's going on let's do some
persistence and women is wanting this
yes sometimes I get a DD and decide to
watch TV for like five minutes and then
the stupid thing disconnects cuz I'm not
doing anything
what the heck oh yeah this is no fun
when it comes to like streaming videos
right okay I know right okay step down
all right so first all we need to cover
plink
it's short for putty link and the plink
utility is the command-line equivalent
to putty
I love gooeys we're gonna put a GUI in
front of this command line aren't you so
we'll be using this along with another
tool in order to keep an SSH tunnel
persistent Road hey persistence it's my
favorite editing in the world okay maybe
not the favorite thing but anyway so
here's an example of a plink SSH tunnel
we start by launch launching pageant and
entering our pass phrase which I have
already done over here and we already
did in an episode previous to this as
well 11:09
yes I'm one of those yeah one of those I
don't know look up private and public
keys now that our private key is in
memory we can use plink to start an SSH
tunnel from the command line this is a
fun part so first off open up the
command line and navigate to where your
plank utility is for me that's by
running CD backslash putties so I go in
here and in here there should be a
plinky XE yes there is okay cool so I
type in dot and I get this nice long
list of all sorts of commands that I can
use inside planks so to start a simple
dynamic socks proxy I'll enter plank
tack D D for dynamic mm-hmm so just like
SSH on Linux side where it's all command
line based yes exactly so I do have to
use a little bit of Commun line
phoo you like that boom oh yeah tacky l
snub Z and the L is for my username mmm
space Tech agent for pageant so agent
stands for opening up pageant basically
okay so the plank utility when you do
tack agent it will no use your private
key in memory yes
and then I type in the server that I
want to connect to all right press Enter
using username snub Z and it basically
tells me okay you're good you're
connected and there we go a command to
start our Sox prostate proxy for all of
our tunneling enjoyment awesome of
course if the ssh connection is dropped
we'll all be you know sad face and stuff
especially if we're using the tunnel to
watch the BBC or something like you said
earlier that would seriously suck and
while Otto ssh is available for windows
kinda it isn't exactly the easiest to
set up auto ssh the linux program that
you showed up it can be run in Windows
using cygwin which is a linux
environment for windows if that kind of
suits your fancy you can have at it
there's a decent tutorial for setting
that up over here I'll link that in the
show notes so you guys have that
information it's super easy yeah I'm not
a fan of cygwin to be honest you aren't
no you're gonna run Linux from Linux you
know yeah what do you have to use
windows yeah well I'd rather go with a
native Windows app every time mm-hmm you
know then have to use so well yeah you
know I'm kind of I'm kind of the same
way so I'm more interested in using that
native Windows program can you know
sometimes thankfully there is a similar
set up to auto SSH that can be achieved
using clink with the help of a kind of
little utility called my and tunnel now
to get my own tunnel it's available over
at this website in the show notes
awesome it's this need of Windows 8 a
total of you that lives in the system
tray or it can be run as an an NT
service in the background that kind of
quietly watches plink sessions and it
restarts them as necessary
now I've already gotten my end tunnel
downloaded over here and I've started it
up and it's a portable app too right yes
it is that's awesome about it so what do
you you just put in the same
plink yes you have to put it over
wherever your putti folder is okay so I
put it in here with the plate Exe of how
do you see all those no under SSH server
this is where you put whatever your SSH
server is called obviously mine is
called let's see what is it the real a
Wi-Fi pineapple comm which is totally
different from the last one we used
username is MZ and then down here we
want to change a couple of the things in
the settings down here you don't want to
leave them all unchecked let's see
reconnect on failure obviously this is
what we want to do so we want to change
that use private key I really like the
fact that my in tunnel allows you to use
private and public keys as well so wait
if you don't check that what does it do
it'll ask you for your password listen
up see anyone type in my password yeah
yeah and it also saves the information
over here but it is salted so it's st.
where it does the same of the
information it saves a dot txt file and
dot ini over in the putty folder with
the my entitled exe so I guess that's
because it's portable yeah that makes
complete sense because it's not touching
your Windows registry but still I don't
like having passwords in ini files and
if they are salted just cuz you know it
could still be voiced or something
anyway so yeah that's pretty cool though
that it's able to use the I'm assuming
your peer pagent or your agent agent
well that's I call it pageant I don't
know let me know but it sounds right
because it's spelled the same way as
those tap-dance pageants that I used to
belong in for real yeah I totally tap
danced when I was little anyway off
topic there are pictures my mom has it
happen so you also want to check enable
dynamic Sox books okay there's our proxy
and so it has to do 70 70 I see and then
you want to change that to 80 80 because
I've already got my switchy program on
Chrome already set to 80 80 or
go ahead and change all those settings
too so I'm just gonna change this to
8080 was it's so much easier so you hit
save and then you'll see over here it
just created my dot txt and my dots I
and I and also a remote ports txt down
here so that is where you'll find all of
those configuration files now you can go
to the status tab and click connect so I
go over here oh then hit connect and you
can just hit OK right here because it's
going to go to pageant anyway anyways
it's asking for your passphrase for your
key right you haven't told you where
your key is I haven't but I told it to
use pageant and I already have pageant
open okay so you just say okay so here's
password so click OK mmm loud bang pass
pass break leak yes
launching executable oh and so it's just
passing the tach agent command in plank
and then yes link already knows ok cool
use the pageant exactly cool and then
all right connection is stable so
apparently it worked so now I can go to
the internet and make sure that this
correctly works so I'll go over here hi
IRC how's it going and I'll go to IP
chicken and that's kind of my place now
that is the office exactly now if I turn
on switch II mm-hmm I go to IP chicken
again there you go there we go you're
routing through the the relay at Wi-Fi
pineapple combo awesome that's awesome
now I can also do something else that
it's pretty cool so I control shift
escaped it into my task manager mm-hmm
and then oh here we go
and where is plank
I'm looking for plank right you just hit
P until it shows up there it is okay so
there's plank right there and another
thing I can do is click end process and
I can watch it disconnect inside my in
tunnel this is just like when I did kill
-9 yeah yeah basically I know it should
disconnect over here as well oh you have
to you have two planks actually running
cuz the first one you started in the
command prompt so you probably have
another one though she listed in here
yeah probably right
Oh yep there it is so then that one in
process and there we go oh okay so it's
gonna try again in 10 seconds I'll turn
that off and then it's going to restart
in 10 seconds launching executable and
it should say connection is stable again
because it's going to restart the
process and there it goes
hi max in this table that's awesome so I
love the fact that I have persistence
now in Windows and it's it's free its
native yes I'd like today you know I
think it's a cool utility I like the
idea that it's like portable you know
you can probably also use it with the
portable versions of putty porta potti
alright for the putty and and and of
things like that I'd like to hear if you
guys have any other suggestions for
maintaining persistence in Windows of
course you guys know feedback at hak5
org is where you can do that you can
send us that now stay tuned because in
just a bit we're gonna get to the trivia

favorite part we're gonna take a quick
