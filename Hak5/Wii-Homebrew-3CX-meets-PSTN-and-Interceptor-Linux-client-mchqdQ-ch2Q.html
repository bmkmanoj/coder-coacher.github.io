weed Twilight hack follow-up questions
about voice and and that word monkey all
that and more on this episode of hak5
this week's episode of hak5 is brought
to you by godaddy Netflix Squarespace
and viewers like you everybody welcome
this week's episode of hak5 I'm Matt
less knock I'm Shannon Morse I'm Darren
kitchen we've got a great show for you
guys lined up today but I am very happy
to actually be back in the studio ah
then you haven't left the studio oh the
studio left either the hak5 left the
studio yeah you left me thanks listen
well listen me and Paul the noob school
bus was like honking its horn you guys
just didn't board that's what it comes
down we got a bromance going on oh thats
related some bro time they were bawling
on their dates probably shouldn't
mention it sticky but the hack house
viewer is probably know all about it
considering they watch 24 hours yes so
don't forget to go to hack house calm
and you can watch hard boring-ass life
before hours a day in seven days a week
or broadcast yours but we'll talk about
that at the end of the show yes what we
call in the industry at ease I I do want
to make mention of this fabulous monkey
that you guys know what is it that's the
monkey everybody's raving about right
now yeah with the network ports and this
is his retarded cousin that Darren
purchased this is the retarded one this
is jeremy well that would real Tina and
it was cheap his head is solely on hag
way well but sideways so he's like 90 90
degrees Rick now i'm looking at you now
i'm not he loves you like that's what
you get for 5 by in five dollar monkeys
all right that's what it is you're just
terrible Julie so what do we have coming
up on the show guys i have a wii
homebrew heck nice it's finally good to
get to the wii and the best console
woman i am excited because I'm doing
something with that $300 console that I
have had sitting in my back my time
that's my problem my-my $300 console has
been sitting up there on the shelf
collecting dust no I put a sticker on it
I'll be the first to say that it's been
collecting dust oh wait i should i
should say day
in plays wad dim dim on it yeah if the
Wemo I probably play more doom on the
way that I do my actual wii games that
oppressed but that's that's the problem
I have it's not an everyday council it
was if we would hook it up but your 360
seems to have taken over the
entertainment center over there oh my
gosh do something about that you know
Paul backs me I know I only I got so
many component inputs on the mixer but
let's just just make some room no ok so
i will be answering your questions and
showing you a little bit of details
about interceptor I know you've got some
ipv6 I'd no ipv6 I think own IP I'm
doing we follow up to we had a bunch of
questions after the segment aired and I
just wanted to get to him real quick and
we're also going to show you guys how
easy it is to actually once the setup
that we did the three weeks ago is
complete how easy it is just to actually
make outside calls dude nice i am taking
your show notes word for word and
submitting it to my boss has a proposal
for how i'm going to save the company
tons of money i do want to make mention
of the fact that Nick gala who is the
CEO 3cx posted our show on the corporate
blog for three CX enjoyed it that's
pretty sweet second time in a row you've
gotten some CEO action upon your
somebody's got to get some publicity out
there well hey oh yeah I really just
skill me a hacker kids yeah it's just
yeah it's cool i understand i still love
you i'm gonna start my own PR wire
touche okay oh I got some new board in
from the PGA RC guy some news some new
buy a new boards it's a board plus plus
do you guys remember when I was talking
about the TNC USB development board hear
us on for its awesome wish that it had
analog input well it turns out that it
now does this is the teen c++ as you can
see it is slightly smaller than the
original teensy but it has it has dude
63 k yeah 63 k of memory instead of 60 s
instead of 16 instead of 15 and a half
whatever and 46 digital ins and outs and
the best part 8 analog input 6 yep
digital good digital and
aight analog input so now i can hook up
a photocell to that and take some
readings off of it so anyway i'm going
to be doing some more fun stuff with a
teensy USB development board and maybe
some other fun arduino stuff later on
i'm kind of re-engineering how i'm doing
the tank but that's what i wanted to
show you yeah real quick okay check that
out don't homie blackberry what is he
using our do we know oh that's cool all
ready to do something like that yeah
okay the doctor boots like toss that to
me in the middle of a block are you
kidding me he really good okay okay well
those secretaries no I just yeah I find
it amazing you know I mean real quick
when did the Arduino thangs kick off
what's not a fad because it's still
going your eyes but right when did it
really start mom okay uh I remember I
saw one about a year and half over prone
two bozos place he had that like oh
that's really or whatever yeah now he's
your son of the bug things from bug labs
oh those are interesting to they seem a
little bit more expensive see the whole
idea between Arduino behind Arduino and
and I should clarify that technically
the USB teensy board while they will
interface with the Arduino interfaith
not in Arduino it is technically not
because Arduino requires that the board
schematics actually be open it's like
the epitome of open source it's like
that open source beer you've heard of
where the ingredients are laid out it's
free as in beer no I'm sorry freezing
speech it's freezing speech beer I'm not
sure anyway Stallman give me a call let
me know what's going on but it's that
kind of idea where you know so this
doesn't technically meet its
requirements but you can make it work
with the stuff and it's not all day in
tenaya whatever sorry so yeah it's cool
all right yo so let's start this show
 yeah yeah Shannon you're up alright
cool let's see some new stuff um sure
Tara Mae yeah all right hey just steal
that from Becky yes I do that gonna have
to talk about kick your ass stuff worked
out for you well you know I'm still
working on that so maybe by the show I
give you a progress well whistle penguin
just go ahead and make your way thank
you all right
so if your wii is like ours just kind of
collecting dust on a shelf somewhere and
not to say that it's not a fun console
but maybe i just don't have the time to
give it the proper play it deserves and
you want to kind of bring some new life
into it shannon has just the thing what
is this we homebrew all about wii
homebrew it's actually a homebrew
channel that a bunch of homebrew
developers got together and made apps
and video games for but you need this
thing called the Twilight hack to
actually get the thing on your week okay
so we're going to mod are we we're going
to install some unsanctioned code I love
it I kind of yeah alright it's pretty
cool i really like the well i guess
you'll see it cool and then we can get
some apps and some games and other fun
stuff from life and third crazy i'm even
going to tell you guys about the
homebrew browser which makes you be able
to download apps and video games
straight from your we instead of having
to take a SD card and put it into your
computer and then stick it back in your
week it's like an app store but free it
love it cool well how do we get this
going on are we here alright well
there's a couple of things that you need
first of all you need your wii your
wiimote controller your computer
internet access for both year we and
your computer an SD card formatted as
fat and zelda twilight princess for your
wii sweet so once we have all that how
do we actually get the tack on our wii
system here alright so there's a couple
of things you gotta download first of
all there's a couple of zip files that
you gotta download the first one is the
twilight hag beta 1 or beta 2 dot zip
and this kind of depends on which
version of the wii u actually have i
have one that's 3.3 or less are you
talking about the system menu yeah this
is right so so i'm gonna want 3.3 if you
have 3.4 or higher which I think 3.4 is
the only one out right now cool to be
wrong then you'll download the beta 2
i'm always I don't try to stay a version
behind because I know that's just how it
is with the homebrew it's like I do you
want to update I'm like no let's see
what hacks are available to take
advantage of code yeah I have I have the
same work and I'm like my way so I don't
want to change it now excellent I'm not
updating the section once we have those
files what do we do with them
do we make this work there's one more
thing you need you need the Homer
channel zip file yes and that's the fun
thing where you pop the bubbles great oh
that's amazing okay so where can we get
that kind of stuff all right so there's
a couple of websites websites you go to
the first ones we brew org and the
second one is hack me com also if you
want go ahead and down those maps and
some video games from either the hackney
website or the wiki I definitely suggest
checking out the homebrew browser
because that way you don't have to copy
apps and games to your SD card from your
computer and put it in your wii every
single time you want to get something
new you can just get stuff straight from
the homebrew channel through the
homebrew browser excellent so let's go
ahead and load up that how do we do it
alright so here's your SD card it has to
be two gigs or smaller and you have to
format it as fat that's really easy to
do you just right click on it go to I
think it's format press ok there you go
you're done after that you put it into
your week and then you go go ahead and
boot it up go into your we options menu
data management save data and the wii
section of the menu going to find your
zelda twilight princess saved file and
you're going to cop that copy that over
to your SD card if you haven't played
zelda twilight princess yet on your wii
you might want to do that just so you
have a save file so i don't know go run
around and slap some grass or for some
chicken zapiro some chickens and collect
some rupees rubles rupees these it is
rupees all of mp3 all right after you
get that save file onto your SD card put
your SD card into your computer and copy
the private folder which is what's going
to be copied over onto your computer
because you might need it later great so
what do we do those files alright so
those files that i mentioned extracting
earlier so you're going to move that
homebrew executable that you extracted
from the zip file to your SD card root
directory and save it as boot DOL or
boot elf also you do want to save the
Twilight hack private folder from the
extracted zip folder to your SD card as
well so essentially we're taking the
save game file that we got from the
twilight princess hack and replacing our
save game file with it replacing with
the hacked version would it be wrong for
me to
assume that now we're going to pop that
card back in are we and copy the bag
over maybe but first you do want to
check out your CD all right so on your
CD there's going to be some serial
numbers which are etched into the really
small inner circle right here and
usually they start with like RG day rgj
something anyway it doesn't really
matter what matters is that at the very
end it says zero jpn for japan or zero
or two for USA this gives you whichever
kind of save slot you need to open up on
Zelda when you start up the game inside
the private we title folder are three
different folders with letters
corresponding to the serials delete the
two that don't match your CD then you
put your SD card back into the we go to
we options data management save data we
and erase the Zelda save and then open
the SD card menu and choose the twilight
hack copy that to the wii after you do
that you want to stick your result of
twilight princess disk back into your
week and boot it up this is the fun part
you choose the save slot that
corresponds with your cereal mine was
twilight hack 0 go ahead and skip the
intro it doesn't hurt the heck if you
feel like watching lincoln Epona run
around in hyrule that's okay I don't
really care just get to the part where
link is actually a playable character in
either walk backwards or talk to the guy
in front of you this will start up the
hack install process so just choose
agree to everything and you're done you
now have the homebrew channel weird eh
well you gotta boot up first but yeah it
shows up for you just click into it
excellent whoo exciting it's very ocean
yes water you can pop the bubbles
actually it's kind of cool nice so now
that we have this loaded hopefully there
we go what do we have here you're gonna
have video games you got quake you can
even download like gamecube video games
and 64 emulator those emulators
legally tetris Doom is one of the fun
ones that you can play I definitely
suggest if you go back to the first menu
on here get the homebrew browser first
of all it's really easy to do you just
got to go over to the the wiki and
download the homebrew browser file and
then stick your SD card into your
computer create an apps folder just to
stick all of your apps into and then
drag that file over onto your SD card
and pop it back into your weight into
your wii so that's how we put
applications on here if you want or you
can use the homebrew browser and just
download things right there oh that's
right because yeah we just connected to
the internet so now i can go into like
see what emulators right so i already
looted quake from here you can get
anything here it's pretty sweet
excellent well I love the prospect of
running atari 2600 games on a wii yeah
it's pretty cool yeah excellent so where
can we find that it's a lot of
information which I easily digest this
you've obviously done a lot of legwork
I'm gonna have the complete steps in my
show notes at snaps ecomme or on the
revision3 side in the hak5 org website
you can also go to the wiki and the what
is it called ho hackme website mmm and
also if you guys have any questions for
me if you've created yourself a homebrew
app or video game for the Wii or if you
have some ideas for games that I should
check out that you checked out on the
homebrew page tell me about it I want to
hear about it and I think that's it
excellent so what do we got coming up
next oh right so let's check in every
welcome playing video games over here
and coming up we are going to be hearing
about the open source pbi now open
source but the freepbx c3x that's got
some more information on that it's going
to be thinking up some some actual
telephone lands to the PSTN and stuff
like that but first let's see what's
going on with this week's land party so
this month's LAN party is insurgency

switching back over to Matt and
finishing up his segment well 3cx ip-pbx
alright guys so we're back here in the
IP pbx zone I guess you can call it that
I really wasn't expecting the amount of
feedback nor questions that I received
after the three CX segments I was just
anticipating it being another you know
kind of thing that we show off and
people say oh I was really cool but
there were really two me a surprising
number of people who are looking to do
this either it at their home or in their
workplace so what i thought i would do
is respond to a couple questions as well
as show you guys in you know really
quickly how easy it is to add a external
number that you can dial out or Dow into
now the solution that I use is one that
Paul actually recommended to me was tele
axe it's tlia XCOM and they have a pops
pretty much all throughout the country
their main ones are in Colorado but they
have one in New York so Layton sees is
really nice there so you go to tell the
axe and they have a bunch of different
plans you could sign up for you no
unlimited pay-as-you-go I with the
pay-as-you-go plan because I rarely get
phone calls and there was no sense and
be paying a monthly fee now the nice
thing is is once you go ahead and sign
up you get these nifty support options
now the support options are going to be
you know what's your proxy what's your
username and what's the password that
we're actually going to use to connect
tele acts to our 3cx PBX software they
have a really good support department in
forums and stuff like that so you guys
can check that out so what we're going
to do is I left our three CX server up
and running I actually forgot about it
and it is the exact same way as it was
after we finished our install three
weeks ago so we're going to do is we're
going to log in to our three CX
management console we're actually going
to go over here to VoIP providers and we
are going to add a provider it's as
simple as this we're going to name it
tell the x1
now you guys might have multiple you
know accounts with the same provider so
i always like to suffix the name with a
numeral we're going to select a generic
VoIP provider click Next the server IP
is VoIP NYC tele XCOM and void alright
so we're going to come over here ahead
next our external number is something
that you cannot see
alright and we've got one actually on
the page you go plan I believe that you
can have up to ten simultaneous calls I
could be wrong in that so double check
before you XD land purchase it but for
this for all intents purposes we're
going to have one and click next and
we're going to connect it to an
extension when somebody calls in we're
going to connect it to the phone that i
actually have registered here which is
grandstream BTW two hundred and rule for
tell the x1 now this is your outbound
rule so you have say you have multiple
departments that you want to have tied
to a certain sip provider or sip trunk
for your sales department they could
need to dial nine for your support
department they could need to dial eight
what we're going to do is we're going to
do the standard of nine before you
actually enter the phone number to get
an outside line and we're going to enter
nine in the calls to numbers starting
with prefix now calls from extensions
you can go even further in limit okay
calls starting with nine but only coming
from extensions 100 to 110 go through
this system and then starting with nine
going from 111 to 120 go through the
other VoIP provider really really
powerful tools that allow you to you
know for what you're doing and separate
different departments and stuff like
that and you can also specify called
length so if you have an international
based sip provider you have a certain
call number length that you can actually
divvy out to different providers so on
and so forth so the route is the that
we're going to choose is there's only
one so it's the single route and we're
going to strip one digit which is going
to be the nine from the number string
that we actually sent to three CX from
the phone and we're going to hit finish
and it should be done now one easy way
to check this is to actually go into
your port trunk status now here we could
actually see that the port for tele acts
has a 10,000 number for its virtual
extension that's just an unidentified
for the system it's a provider and we've
named it tele acts and it's registered
which should mean
I should be able to pick up this phone
and dial 91 and let's see if movie magic
happens that would be my cell phone
ringing so now that that quick we
actually are now able to make and
receive calls on the telly Xcal that we
just set up with 3cx so like I said you
guys can use multiple connections you
can do multiple different voyeur voyeurs
if you want redundancy or things like
that it's a really really easy system to
set up a couple quick questions that I
had a lot of people had questions about
the SP a 962 phone I missed a call from
me the SP a 962 phones that I was
actually using here for the segment
three weeks ago I do not have an echo
problem they are some of the most
cost-effective six line phones that you
could possibly buy i would highly
recommend them in a solution and very
easy to set up the other thing is people
ask me you know how many different
companies can I run with this with this
software well as of right now the system
is really built around a single company
however 3cx is working on a product that
will allow you to basically be a call
center and have multiple different
companies utilizing the same server as
of right now you use the same voice mail
server you know the same you know
conferencing extensions things like that
so just go ahead and take a look I do
know that they're going to be coming out
with version 8 by the end of the year
they've already released 7.1 beta which
is actually working really nice but
check it out if you have any questions
feel free to hit me up at the forums
forums hak5 org or a lot of questions
and answering going on I have my blog
Matt letstalk.com so right now we're
going to kick it over to Shannon for
this week's trivia last week
trivia question was what two monkeys had
the pleasure of being shot into space
atop an am 18 missile in 1959 scoob's
got that right he answered with able and
miss Baker and we are going to send him
some nifty pc dogs and for this week our
trivia question is what console was
tested by a US state lottery as a means
for ticket purchase if you feel like
answering this question you can go over
to hack 5 org slash trivia enter for
your chance to win this week's giveaway
and maybe we'll pick you and last but
not least I would like to thank our

check it out at WWF let's calm / hak5
and please don't forget the www all
right I'm gonna bring it over to Darren
now for some interceptor
alright thanks so much guys for all of
the response that have gotten thus far
on the Interceptor the network monkey if
you will up and getting a lot of great
feedback I hope you guys enjoy this
project because we're going to be
continuing it on for a while just like
yeah saga oh my god I actually set it
right there and I thought that maybe I
would answer one of your questions and
that is can you actually show me this in
RL rather than an animation so let's go
ahead and do that I actually have the
original Network monkey here and I guess
i'll go ahead and answer the first
question how does it power well Becky
you didn't see when she did it she acts
to plug them into the DC power we have a
DC power jack right there so that takes
care of me gets power through the foot
and his arms are connected to ethernet
so we got a cat5 Jack here and in here
complete with oh look at that flat right
flat rounded and flat cable oh yeah and
maybe I'll just go ahead and dissect a
little you want you want to see what's
inside let's take a look alright so this
particular monkey is nice because look
at his back if we can get up in here you
can see that if you could see this there
we go Oh perfect yeah right so the
monkeys back just opens right up he's
velcro and we get a little zipper dealy
so pull that out and he's full of stuff
and like any monk you would expect to be
full of right but he's also full of you
can barely see it down there there is a
fawn router inside of a well it's inside
of a pink anti-static bag and we got
some Wi-Fi antenna all that fun stuff so
that's the that's the gist there now let
me go ahead and show you I actually
haven't connected to Paul's new lenovo
this is the the s10 that i believe
tomorrow is becoming a hackintosh right
now we get it shown in windows 7 and i'm
just going to give some fingerprints up
on there for Paul okay and i'm running a
constant ping hak5 door just to generate
some traffic let me go over to my ubuntu
machine and i'll show you here how we
can connect to it in linux
if you're doing this in ubuntu one of
the first things you want to do is
disable this wireless here because the
wireless network manager is just going
to take over the world and make things
not so much interesting so we just set
this manual it's gonna be fun so we just
bring the interface up okay and connect
to it or associate with it this is
interceptor d for Darren on channel 6
and verify that that's up okay cool so
we're associated with it now the
important part here is that we need to
join we need to the static assign
ourselves an IP address I usually go
with 10 to 5 52 to 55 dot 253
interceptors running on 254 that's one
of the things we're just kind of tries
to like mask itself a bit on the network
and we'll talk about ways to you know
find these with max cannons and other
fun stuff like that but for right now
let's go ahead and assign ourselves an
IP address so if config i think i need
suitor for that if config at 0 10 to 10
whoops 10 to 25 to 45 253 and we're
going to ping 10 255 255 255 we're happy
we're in a little hack van a little
black Dealey with you know my monkey my
pineapple leave so we'll just chilling
and we're going to get some don't get
some packet sniffing on so in order to
connect to it now we need to i mean we
could just ssh over to root at 10 225
225 225 for yes monkey business and
hooray but what we really want to do is
start up this script we can see that
everything is running over there but
but we take a look at the startup script
what we do is we're actually telling it
to start the openvpn server right here
the second file and then we sleep for a
few seconds give it a chance to come up
with the services start and whatnot and
then we issue the command in /
interceptor bins start out that Sh if we
actually look and then we're passing it
the date that's kind of important
because the thing is if we don't put a
battery pack in here or something like
that it's going to forget what time what
year everything that the monkey is
living in and whatnot probably defaults
of the year of the monkey or something
and and we need those to be correct so
that we can initiate a VPN connection so
so we look at the startup script over on
the monkey we can see that's what it
does it you know just sets up the
openvpn now it's our server is running
on its kind of weird because our servers
running are not client the laptop that
we connect to the monkey over the
wireless wit will run the openvpn server
and then we connect to it and then we
initiate that starter script which tells
it to become a client to our ssh server
so so we'll go ahead and just run
startup now the startup script there
oops I'm sorry cancelled again let's
sudo run that and it initiates that
there we go we've got a tunnel going
that's exciting and monkey business like
a type right hooray and in just a moment
here it's going to pause well let me
think next and
there we go demon logger is fired up so
now still on our client here or laptop
we're going to take a look at tap 0 and
how exciting we have a tap 0 interface
that's the important part we're not
using the ton 0 we're using the tap 0
and we're going to i'm just going to GK
pseudo Wireshark and just as we normally
would pick our interface and there we go
we've got tap 0 going to start that and
since we have some traffic already
running over on our target we should
instantly start seeing some packets and
there you go we can actually see our
ping replies are pink sands and all that
fun stuff and we're monitoring all the
traffic in between listen we have a
bunch of other fun exciting developments
happening with interceptor with the
network monkey I would love to hear your
feedback as you have been giving you
these questions and compiling some
follow-up segments and there is some
activity going on already in the
Interceptor formed hak5 org such forms
so give us a shout out there less than
what you think and yeah get your monkey
business on so I think at this point
we're just going to go ahead and get the
rest of the cast together wrap this bad
boy up so Matt Shannon what's going on

up this week's episode of hak5 hope you

controversy as to whether you stole the
monkey I wouldn't call it country so no
actually it's a runner man if you guys
don't know render man you can find him
over at render labs I believe that's
what it is yes it is Magic Mukono dude

or if you're just looking at any major
hacker con just just look for the you

black with that glasses and yeah they

Wi-Fi Trojan and I got some pictures of
the right here I had actually not seen
