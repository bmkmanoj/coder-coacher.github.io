by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is Gerren kitchen and I'm Shannon
Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us and
there is no antidote so let's get right
really no there isn't
OC well I've been Extreme Couponing and
I can get those anecdotes for almost
free
hooray
it's true I've been saving so much money
on shampoo and conditioner I'm very
proud of myself I did see this is why
you tune into act 5 also you should tune
into Shannon's other show where you just
did a fantastic netcat segment I did yes
a hack tip that's over at hack 5 org as
well if you haven't checked it out I
just finished a 10 episode series on
netcat basically just the 101
beginner level elimination got pretty
advanced there at the end because you
were able to tie in Zork one of the
coolest text adventure video games that
wasn't doing that cat so I love that
yeah so good like sword skin and banana
die hack five dot organ wheels orc it up
but I mean so what are we doing today we
are we are getting into more about
electromagnetic radiation yeah you spoke
about that last week yeah I know we're
gonna inverse tachyon pulse and just
send it right through the main deflector
array but first first I hear we got
something in the mail
oh we got some goodies I heard we did we
is it true yes yes yep from a fan so
thank you fan doesn't it so fine yep
15501 something something hak5 gorg has
it it's on hack shop oh okay here's this
oh it's a car what is a car this is DS
visible how did I miss that up
this is enclosed a joystick retro
connector OOP oh that's a choice your
games and it's from a guy named Charles
and he says Darren and the high five
crew please enjoy this little blast from
the past updated for 2014 you may not be
able to dial up your favorite BBS and
100 pod these days but through the magic
of emulators you can still play
choplifter oh my god this is fantastic
look at this little microcontroller is
that a teensy yeah that looks believe it
is teensy uh-huh oh man this is
fantastic machine see on a the
vga is that a VGA forward or is that for
this
it looks hang on oh that's okay I see so
this is a serial adapter ah that makes
sense in fact it is the retro connector
joystick adapter here so that guy's
going into the GPIO here we've got a
mini USB cable plug it into our computer
and now this blast from the past
oh man this is fantastic it's actually
just doing a bunch of reading on the
what is it Atari controller the 7800
because they had it was like this except
it had like a dial pad at the bottom and
stuff that's brilliant
it's kinda like on your it's great there
which one oh this one Oh see I thought
that was a Starbucks cup no guitar
actually here you've got right there see
oh yeah yeah then sorry huh you can just
wear that on your shirt yeah I'll just
I'll just super glue it on there yeah so
good with superglue there you go BAM
super snow now you can play it with the
joystick that might be a little awkward
since a vo yeah sure oh my god we have
to wait wait wait for the x-acto I've
made up what we need is like a Bluetooth
controller and then like can we make it
my nut now what I'm saying is like we're
a white t-shirt but then mount an LCD
screen behind it and then I have like
Mario Brothers going or something Oh a
fantastical Oh that'd be fine play play
Mario on your shirt okay okay sorry
getting off on a tangent thank you so
much for the gift this is fantastic I
can't wait to play and we can find out
more about setting this up to
demonstration video at Mental Hygiene
comm slash retcon or ET steel charles
thank you fantastic witty goodies all
right to the onto today's episode yes
because electromagnetic radiation is
radiating your soul in the universe and
it is emitting from anything and
everything because we're gonna die no
well yes eventually and eventually every
particle and and whatever the smallest
unit of measurement of matter will be
equally displaced through the universe
in all vertices and will be still for
ever and ever and ever until one
particle will call him
Bob is just sitting there silent and
decides you know what I was born to
breakdance
oh it's gonna happen and then the big
thing can happen all over again right
that's just my belief but anyway we've
been talking about radio and so we're
gonna get into a little bit more theory
stuff because really fun and yesterday
yesterday last week we talked about
spectrum I mean we've talked about
spectrum in terms of like radio
frequencies we know that like for
instance Wi-Fi is on 2.4 gigahertz and
other fun stuff is on 900 megahertz and
there's cool stuff over at 9 for 33
megahertz still having some troubles
picking some of those up with my little
teeny tiny antenna over here well this
is because this antenna is not made for
certain frequencies like you what were
you listening to you're on today on band
one four five point eight nine zero
point zero zero so the this measure this
is not made for 147 megahertz
we're gonna get into that because this
is while a nice conductor it's not
necessarily for that wavelength Oh me
and so these frequencies which we
typically talk about as far as radio you
know it also encompass other things for
example microwaves and even visible
light I mean we're really just in fact
all of this we're talking about light
we're talking about energy that is you
know moving at different frequencies and
so all wavelengths yes and we actually
have an example here of our
electromagnetic wave yes and there's a
lot of ways that we can actually define
our wave here and so the first thing
that we can do is actually see how many
cycles of oscillation there are per
second okay what does that mean well
okay so a cycle in this instance would
be say you know from right through here
I'll draw a box around our cycle so the
peak of one and the valley of another so
there we go well is that what's actually
it's actually two peaks it really just
depends on the way that you're looking
operation but essentially this right
here is a cycle okay
and we can actually measure in the
course of one second how many cycles we
can observe and so what we've
Illustrated right here and there's a big
dot dot dot here because this is just
going to it
is straight that over time this is time
we're going to say that this right here
is one second so here we go we've got
one second and we're actually going to
say that we can see in this example one
hundred million cycles Wow now obviously
see one two three four five six seven
eight nine hundred million because we're
just going to illustrate that right
there and though we haven't drawn them
all we can actually say that in this
case what we have is a frequency of this
wave and that frequency would be 100
mega Hertz whereas a hurt is one cycle
per second so like 1 1 1 I'll see la is
one out cycle every second I'll you hurt
me yeah and there's also an awesome man
and we'll get into that later but a mega
hurt you ready for a mega hurt that
would be a million hour now a million
cycles per second just stay over there I
know right so your mega Hertz so this
right here is going to be an example of
a hundred million cycles per second and
we can also measure the length of our
wave from one peak to the next peak and
we can measure that in meters
you know kilometers or kilometers
millimeters centimeters you know the
metric system okay so hooray for SI and
we're just going to go ahead and say
that from this peak right here to this
peak right here that right there is
going to be equal to I'm going to put a
tilde 3 I can't write sideways good 3
meters it's actually that's so if I
could physically see this in the world
around me and I could see this this
wavelength right here would be really
big so it would take 3 meters you take
almost the length of this table here for
it to go up
down and back up again alright got it
and in that case it's actually for our
example we're not going to use I put a
tilde there because it's not actually
three it's actually two my pen is dead
we're going to use green it is two point
nine nine seven nine two meters
we're just between these two points
that's pretty cool that number looks
familiar
I don't know why yet you're seeing just
a second so we've actually measured the
frequency here we've actually measured
the wavelengths of our electromagnetic
wave and this is pretty cool because the
wavelength for instance this two point
nine nine seven nine two is actually
telling us what type of light this is at
what type of energy it is and in this
case we can say you can look it up on a
table week say hey that is radio as
opposed to it being that's cool a
microwave or visible light ultraviolet
ultraviolet infrared gamma-ray x-ray all
of those different types of light and we
can actually look these up and say hey
well at nearly three meters that is
radio and that's pretty cool and okay
also really cool now that we know that
we're talking about 100 megahertz M H Z
so a hundred million times per second
that we see this yeah right and it's
that long we can actually take those two
figures okay okay and in our case we're
going to remember MHz for a million
times per second now and so it's really
cool here is if we actually take these
two figures and we multiply them
together what we're going to get is two
hundred and ninety nine thousand seven
hundred and ninety two kilometers per
second so that is that my farts going to
go per second yes and what's awesome
about that figure is that is in fact the
speed of light that's why it looks so
familiar or okay see I'm just going to
call it C because C equals three times
one Oh
eight or one to ten to the eighth meters
per second
now speed of light never changes correct
I sure hope it doesn't change because if
it does we're gonna start having some
problems but yeah I mean essentially
another way to put this here is that our
wavelength is equal to the speed of
light divided by our frequency and
likewise our frequency is Beautiful
Lengths divided the speed of light
divided by the wavelength okay and so as
long as we have one of these figures we
can always figure out the other that's
cool as long as this speed of light
doesn't change yeah which is cool
science yes it's happening now and this
is actually gonna be really useful when
we start building our own antennas
because we're going to need to know what
that wavelength is when we start making
you know quarter wavelength and such
antennas so of course though we actually
like to do something useful with this
wave so let's actually see what kind of
other things that we can measure so so
far we know the frequency we know the
wavelength but how about the intensity
intensity the okay and City how intense
how do you get that wave
well I mean it's either in a teepee a
wigwam or a tent that's horrible the
intensity is actually measured by
amplitude right platooned okay yes and
amplitude is essentially the maximum
extent of the oscillation so we've got
this oscillation here and what we're
actually looking at every time it goes
up here know down there and up here and
which is all just a matter of
perspective though those are the extents
of our oscillation in fact you could
actually just draw a straight line right
through the center of this and you could
measure you know we could actually put
say I don't know we could met put a
number here we could put a 3 and a 2 and
a 1 an A or a 1 and would call this zero
and then we could put a negative 1 and a
negative 2 I can't write sideways and a
negative 3 right so one way of thinking
about this would be like the height of
the wave yeah I mean the way that we're
putting it on the table and looking
you could say it's kind of the height I
mean but essentially what we're talking
about is the intensity like the
intensity of light and so we can
actually measure the center it's all
relative but essentially if we look at
this this wave here and say that this is
for instance our carrier wave or a
carrier signal we can turn this waveform
into something that will actually carry
or convey information if we're able to
modify it so another way to say modify
actually would be to say the word
modulate we could modulate the signal or
change it in some way over time that we
can actually perceive and and then we
could do cool things like assign values
to it and come up with you know what it
may be perceived as right right okay so
there's a few common modulation
techniques and mind you we're only going
to talk about some basic analog ones
here but we were definitely going to be
getting into some fun digital modulation
techniques and stuff but for instance in
fact this is what you were listening to
earlier on 147 megahertz was amplitude
modulation oh I am yeah I am okay right
and so first of all we can modulate the
amplitude of our carrier to convey for
instance ones and zeros so if I were to
say I'm going to go ahead and put
another line of equilibrium here right
and I'm going to go ahead and draw
another another wave where we're going
to say and I'm going to cheat yeah
that's going to help me okay
and so here's our amplitude oh changes
and then a high one and then we could
keep going with this right okay and so
what you'll notice is that this if this
were a if this were a you know a 3 &amp;amp; a 2
&amp;amp; a 1 and a 0 and a negative 1 and a
negative 2 and a negative 3 we could
actually vary this amplitude in such a
way over time that we could for instance
assign different values to it so we
could actually say
that you know when we have like a high
amplitude of that wave we could go ahead
and use that to represent I don't know a
1 and when we've got a low wave we can
go ahead and represent a zero oh you can
represent that as a zero one and zeros
and represent that as a one and so on
and so forth and then we could actually
use it to convey some information so
this would then become a carrier wave
right interesting okay whereas another
way to do it would actually be to
modulate the frequency so likewise we
can leave the amplitude the same over
each cycle and rather actually modulate
the frequency so for example we could
have like you know a low frequency we
could represent one thing and a high
frequency could represent another but
leave the amplitude the same thread at
all so again I'll just draw another one
here all right and for this one I'm
going to cheat a different way I'm going
to I'm just going to put a couple of
dots across here to help me okay and so
for this one red we're gonna go ahead
and say they're so big oh oh I see what
you did there
right and so our amplitude actually
hasn't changed it's always the same
amount of power right and so on this
scale here we've got our 0 and our 3 and
our you know negative 3 this is always
the same however over time what we can
see is this right here is a longer
frequency this goes so again if we're
measuring this based on seconds right
this is in how many seconds versus you
know this and how many seconds and so we
take that same measurement of units
right we can actually say well this one
thing happened per I don't know sequence
maybe this is a mil
second right and then you know one but
hey one two three right we could
actually say that for instance whenever
we see this this is equal to a zero
whereas this is always equal to a one
you know you can come up with whatever
the various techniques are but
essentially what we're doing was we're
just changing these things and there's a
way to look at it is to say that
amplitude modulation up here is where
the frequency is always the same right
it always happens the same amount of
times per second D cycles but we just
change the intensity or the amplitude
that's what changes and you know the
same thing about where in frequency
modulation it would be the amplitude is
always the same but it's actually the
frequency that changes over time and
this is all pretty cool because we can
start assigning you know these are
actually digital values and then this
will actually lead into you know digital
radio and all of that other fun stuff
but I just don't know can i potentially
change like can i edit wavelengths
myself yeah it's that a thing I could do
yeah sure when we start transmitting and
fun stuff like that we can choose
anybody well with within reason we're
not we're not talking about the
practicality stuff here we're just
talking about the theory but yes
absolutely
and what's cool about this is you can
choose any wavelength you want as long
as this figure right here doesn't change
as long as as C is always the same we
can then figure out your free is the
constant well huh maybe that's why it's
C I'm not really sure it's cool I am NOT
a math so that's the big difference
between am amplitude modulation and FM
frequency modulate right and I mean you
can see it plain as day right there I
mean this right here is just a boring
you know wave this is just electric
magnetic radiation but the difference
here is is we can actually modify that
wave and here's two distinct different
ways we can modify it to convey
something well now I want to look at AM
and FM modulations on my SD are sharp
and try to see the differences yeah I
mean we're actually just listening to
some people in like Hayward or something
talking about what they're gonna let the
what the weather's go whether weather
again yeah and what
the antenna than their backyard their
cool stuff there's just so much fun
stuff going around in the airwaves but I
hope that kind of illustrates some of
the stuff and this is going to help us
win next week we've got an antenna on
order I know I didn't make our first
antenna we are going to soon and we're
going to take a antenna that is
specifically designed for a certain
wavelength and then that is going to
allow us to most best leave pick up
certain frequencies that we will then
take the module eight you know
demodulate them yeah and figure out the
ones and zeros that they mean and
actually turn that into something
practical that will allow us to spy on
our neighbors which is oh yay fun so
look forward to getting that antenna in
the mail and drive around town verse
well I mean there if they didn't want
that information to be spread out
everywhere maybe they shouldn't be
transmitting it or maybe their utility
shouldn't be but that's neither here nor
there stay tuned for next week with that
feedback at hak5 org the best place to
let us know what you think about this as
well as the comments at the bottom and
don't forget the forum's forms to hak5
org lots of cool stuff happening in the
SDR sub forum let's take a quick break
and when we get back more shenanigans
it doesn't matter whether you're a
wavelength divided by the speed of light
or a frequency divided by the speed of
light when that killer idea hits you
need to snag yourself a domain name and
web hosting vast like the speed of light
fast and with domain coms quick
discovery system and they're easy
checkout process you can have your
website up and running in no time in
like the speed of light but not quite
but this is very similar in fact indeed
I love domain comm I think I've told you
this before have I told you I told you
how reliable how affordable how easy to
use they are it's the reason why Shannon
I love them and the guys over at
domain.com
they love us they love us on social
media you can tweet them at domain comm
be like yo you guys are the best thanks
for loving hak5 and loving us and in
regards to the coupon code that I'm
about to tell you about let you know
about the coupon code attack 5 I know I
know you were probably expecting
something else but it's hak5 it's so
cool though because you use that coupon
code guess what you get 15% off that's
right they're already affordable domain
names and web hosting are even better
when you use hak5 a check out to get
yourself an extra 15% off when you think
domain names think domain.com we're back
and now it's time for the trivia
question of the week so last week's
trivia question involves video games the
glyphs and web video game are directly
translatable to English and the answer
was The Legend of Zelda and I totally
look this up and I figured it out and
the games have different kind of
hieroglyphs in them but they all are
translatable to English kind of cool to
check out very very fun now this week's
trivia question is who was the first
woman in space you can answer that
question over at hack 5 org slash trivia
for your chance to win some awesome hack
5 goodies
hey Darren mmm hey Darren hey Darren hey
that's too many times per second uh a
million so by the way speaking of SDR
and things of that manner we have a
tetanus photo of the week this week and
this one is from Jane's a case medics he
sent this one in and he said I really
loved your episode on rtl-sdr it made me
go out and get mine out of storage as I
was scanning I found a local taxi firms
broadcast what I did notice was date of
births either to either side of it after
some research I found a taxi data signal
decoder and decoded the Dames data
stream using taxi MDT
the data seen in the screen shop is
coming from their base so its next jobs
its other little bits of information
where they're going when they get back
c30 interest isn't the same kind of
stuff that like for instance if someone
were to actually set up a couple of
nodes to actually record this stuff to
modulate it and publish it yeah I mean
we're talking about something that is in
the clear people would be like our
privacy is being violated people know
when our team taxi cab and your company
is doing it already what then what
that's the thing though I'm saying
though is it's all just in the clear
anyway yes that's like so funny but yes
thank you again James for sending that
in that's a great picture I love it
thank you honey you know of course you
can send those to feedback at hak5 org
if you have photos to share you know the
email address don't tell me you need to
know I but I already know you know so
what else do we have going on we have
the hat shop we have the hat shop we are
planning some Sunday brunches in the Bay
Area so if you are a very area brunch er
or just a hacker that likes to eat
brunch stay tuned next week we should
have all the details lined up for we're
going to give some seminars we're gonna
do some workshops we're gonna have some
rotating panel of Justices so second
base I got a midday thing like around
noon yeah it's one of those like Sunday
like I think brunch technically starts
at noon yeah whenever you roll I have to
like get up early do my Extreme
Couponing because that's always on
Sundays this one the coupons to you and
then
I see so much money I'm serious I posted
a picture on my facebook it's crazy I'm
happy for you don't laugh at me I'm not
laughing
you don't be laughing when the zombie
apocalypse comes around and I have super
nice smelling hair this is true you can
oil paper you can stockpile all of the
toilet paper and hair product you need
and I will be at my bunker outside of
Portland just off to a-1 oh nice doesn't
either of those make sense okay and a
bombshell for us you can go over to H a
cake shop calm that's where you can find
all of our fun goodies like the Wi-Fi
pineapple the USB rubber ducky and these
radios this yours
yay mine has a pigtail oh that's cute
wink wink
Oh mine does not have a pigtail but it
still works
okay okay cool well with all of that I
am Darren kitchen
I'm Shannon Morse we're reminding you to
trust your tech no lost I'm gonna go
play for you
hello welcome to hack five my name live
upon my name is Shannon Morris okay some
kids my dogs will go is either like okay
well that's a left takes forever to get
Renee then I have to wait on hey put on
as shiny I will pull this podcast over
over there yet
no you never will be
yep it's an occupational hazard so if
you'd like to apply for the position of
co-host of hack live all you need to do
is send in a video of yourself gun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
