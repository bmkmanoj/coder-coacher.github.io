going to be doing a huge meetup in
Portland Oregon with our friends over at
domain.com I can't wait to see everybody
there so if you're in the area
definitely get in on this one on the
25th and then from there it's Seattle
and who knows so if you haven't already
sign up a hack across America calm you
don't have to be a hackerspace to get in
on this you just want to have to have
techno Austin your heart and want to be
able to get in on this so let me know
and find all the details over there at
hack across America calm I'll see you
guys on the road lately there's been so
much talk about getting all your stuff
hacked and passwords getting out into
the wild from people like LivingSocial
and whatnot and there has also been a
lot of talk about things like cookies
and what advertisers are collecting your
information and all sorts of different
you know target markets that are trying
to look up whatever is going on while
you're surfing the Internet's in the
background well I got a lot of questions
about Chrome privacy extensions like
which ones do I choose and which ones do
what and why don't I use this one well
because of that I just decided to give
you those a little bit of a roundup so
each of these extensions that I'm going
to talk about today does something
special whether it's blocking ads or
just blocking java scripts or maybe it's
just blocking all sorts of third-party
software you'll you'll know what exactly
is going on in your browser while you're
surfing so let's go ahead and get right
down to it so first off is not script
this is the first one it increases your
security by blocking scripts on a domain
by domain basis
so instead of just blocking all
JavaScript's throughout the entire
Chrome browser you can block them
depending on a certain website so it's
incredibly customizable and it's very
very detailed oriented so it may be a
little bit frustrating us when you first
begin with it now if I pull it up on
here and I'm gonna go ahead and enable
it and I'll tell you why I have some of
these disabled at the end of the show so
I'm going to enable this and I'm gonna
refresh hak5 org and I get this little
triangle up here you may be wondering
what the heck is that thing
now when you first get into not scripts
it's going to ask you for something
specific it's going to say that you need
to add in a password password is set not
scripts is working enjoy your browser
now for the first step you'll need to
come down here and either copy this into
your directory so that you can change
the password following their directions
it's pretty easy once you get the hang
of it after you have set your password
you're ready to go now the reason they
have this password to begin your use is
because it protects your privacy by
blocking any websites from collecting
the not script white lists so as you use
this you're going to create an white
whitelist for yourself so that anything
that you do will continue every time you
close your browser and continue on with
a new one now if I pull up ak5 right
here you'll see everything looks like
it's working well but look there's
nothing under share that's strange and
if I go down here I still have all my
normal ads from a hack shop and
everything down there and it's showing
up a little weird because I have my
resolution changed for the show now not
scripts is going to give you this nice
little directory of whatever you want to
change it's going to say if you want to
block YouTube no cookie com YouTube
image calm which you probably don't want
to block for hack 5 and there's also
some other ones down here hack 5 org
Twitter if you want to block that in
Google Analytics I can block Twitter
because I don't really want to share to
Twitter right now I just want to watch
the show and it'll refresh each time so
you don't have to go and close your
browser every time you want to change
something now you will notice
when you first begin to use this it's
going to block everything from your use
so you're going to notice that maybe
YouTube doesn't show up or maybe you're
having issues accessing a site nothing
is showing up all you have to do in that
case is go up here and just change
whatever needs to be changed and most of
them are pretty obvious if it's an
advertiser it's gonna say something like
you know advertise calm YouTube you
don't want to block because you know you
got to watch our show because it's
awesome so that's basically how you use
not scripts you can tell it's pretty
customizable and it's it might be a
little irritating because you do have to
change all those settings at first
now the next one you want to check out
is adblock plus this 1 blocks all those
really annoying pop-ups those banners
etc that you might see from day to day
now you can create your own filters here
too and here's an example of how you
would do that so I'm gonna go ahead and
go into my extensions and disable that
one for now I had block plus and I'll
refresh hak5
so adblock plus gives you this little
icon up in your search toolbar if you
click on this you can enable for this
site by hit disable it's just going to
disable adblock so it's going to show
you all the ads for that site I'll click
it on again and I also want to do this
thing called easy create filter when you
click on this it's going to refresh the
page again for you and it's gonna create
all these weird little yellow markings
like what's going on with that what this
does is create a very easy way for you
to target a certain ad and choose to
have it removed adblock plus gives you
this nice little pop-up it says add
filters you can have a filter for that
specific image or for that you know
tracker what-have-you click Add and it
disappears never to be seen again
and it makes your website and move a
little bit faster now say you
accidentally remove something that you
actually want to put back that's really
easy to fix you just right-click go to
options click on add your own filters
and you can remove selected so I'm gonna
pick bring back that picture of me
wearing a tool because I like the gook
and if you refresh it'll appear right
back where it's supposed to so if I
scroll down and there it is
hak5 to and the USB rubber ducky add how
cool is that so easy to use the next one
is ghostery go straight blocks
third-party elements just like social
network widgets and ads and trackers all
those things and it's going to notify
you and you can choose to okay or block
them on a case-by-case basis now this is
how this one works so I'll go back into
my extensions disable adblock plus and
enable ghostery and on this one I think
I'm going to use and gadget as an
example so I'm going to refresh and
gadget and what's this I get all these
little advertisers in this purple box up
here which is kind of weird at first
it's a good ok it's a purple bubble
that's cute so if I click on this it
disappears but what I can do is go into
ghostery and it's going to show me a
list of all those targeted advertisers
who are trying to advertise to me on
engadget.com
now what I can do is click on a certain
one choose more info and it'll give me
all sorts of information about that
specific advertiser and I can also close
it and go back into it again I can
choose to pause ghostery so it'll pause
blocking and I can see all the ads again
and I can edit my blocking options so if
I want to go ahead and block all of them
I can choose that I can choose don't
block if I wanted to pause or start
again and close refresh and now it shows
he shows me and the little purple bubble
that everything is blocked so it's all
striked through and you can tell that
everything is gone and you can just
click that away if you ever get kind of
bored of that little purple bubble now
another thing about ghostery is that's
not necessary if you're already using
not script it's not to mention if you're
running both at the same time it can get
kind of hairy whenever you're trying to
find an ad if you for some reason wanted
to see it and you can't figure out which
different extension is blocking it at
that moment
it's kind of annoying next up vanilla
cookie manager now this lets you
whitelist cookies from certain sites in
case you need them for authentication or
for site preferences which is kind of
useful in some cases or other reasons
now since cookies can also be used to
track you what you do on other sites you
can also block those as well now for an
example I'll use hak5 org again so I'll
go over here I'm gonna refresh the site
again disable that vanilla cookies which
makes me super hungry okay so once hack
five has refreshed I notice up here I
have this little cookie that someone
bitten through and it gives me the
options to add hak5
to a whitelist clear unwanted cookies or
show more options if I click on show
more options I do get those more options
I can do the same things here whitelist
hak5 I can choose when to delete
unwanted cookies which you can do
anything on here it doesn't really
matter I'd probably choose the least
amount five ten minutes maybe and you
can also add feedback and use diagnostic
tools to see exactly what's going on
with the cookies now this can be really
really useful if your machine is getting
extremely bogged down and you always
forget to delete cookies very important
so if you don't do it already
make sure to get on that and last but
not least is HTTPS Everywhere and this
one does exactly what it says it does it
sets many unsecure sites to
automatically connect to HTTPS instead
of HTTP now while this isn't necessarily
new and it's not something you'll
remember to do every time just use this
extension if you've never used it before
because it's extremely useful and I
definitely support it it's very very
important to use HTTP s wherever you go
so I'll go ahead and enable this one so
I'm gonna open up a new tab here and I'm
gonna go to Facebook now you can see
here HTTP WWF ASP com so it's it's not
very secure whenever you want to first
log into it
but as soon as you click into your
bookmark or if you just choose
facebook.com type it up here it's
automatically going to switch you over
to HTTPS and you also get this cute
little icon over here that tells you if
it's working or if it's not
it forces encrypted connections to these
websites beautiful it's very simple to
use and it takes up no memory what
whatsoever so I definitely support and
recommend that one to everybody now I
did mention at first I had a reason for
disabling and enabling them at different
times you really don't want to use all
of these at once if you're on an i3
processor like I am right now on my
little laptop or it's gonna completely
kill and freeze your computer no matter
what operating system you're using it
was kind of bad so I had to restart and
any disable everything before I was able
to do this segment now I hope that these
different extension just helped you I
know there's quite a few other ones out
there there's like a JavaScript killer
and a couple of other ones there's
disconnect too but you got to pay for
that so let me know which ones you
really like if you prefer one of these
the most because I haven't really chosen
one or the other
although I do really like NoScript that
one's pretty cool anyway let me know in
the feedback or the comments below
because we do read those and we'll be
right back after the break
