untangle it's Saturday morning it's hack
across your up day I don't even know now
at 30 or something and I am in The Hague
I've been in Amsterdam and I just took
the train for an hour to then hi
anyway I'm here now and I'm going to see
the launch of a balloon satellite Deeley
from a hacking space here I'm very
excited about
if only I could figure out the transit
they have a pretty cool like transit app
99 to something and it works great you
speak Dutch place is kind of a mess and
I can't figure out where the hell are we
going but you know what there are two
things that are universal everywhere you
travel and that is one gin and tonic to
a taxi I think it's only like ten
kilometers anyway
so is that what you will use to track it
yes this is a DVT Domo
this is what DB 50 English is right
there yes this piece is it decodes
digital television yes the DVD I have
seen is much larger yeah this is the
mini one it's a 2 by 2 centimeters and
with software-defined radio we can just
tune to any frequency we want basically
between 22 and about 1.8 diggers what's
the bandwidth of that about 2 megahertz
at time okay and the nasty spikes the
bigger ones head it tends to get a look
but basically it has a good chip set for
GRC yeah and so fine so do you use a new
radio or what do you use that's the
program I use from the only next
inclination with fldd it's basically
just so very fine radio for dummies and
I like very much it's pretty stable so
it's going to attract the room for us so
what is the spike here I think that's
one of our transmitters here I can tune
to it with upper sideband and various
yeah it's kind of hard because it's a
very narrow senior how many mega Hertz
or kilohertz we're currently at 43 4.65
and it's climbing because it's heating
up but I think this is 50 bucks or 100
bucks 100 baht yep about tonight and we
can when we thank you there - okay so I
select our and it should wow it's going
okay this is it supposed to move that
much nope the this mini one has one
large disbanded it heats up quite
quickly so the first time you use it
it's everything a lot because it is one
of the factors that very much impacts
the performance of this kind of sofa
define radio sticks or now you have to
wait for it to heat up and then try to
tune again well basically you could
clean it out and just give it a little
zing you're always in view because this
software will were
yeah moot Obama this one here yeah I
know when I touch it it moves it's kind
of iffy because it's just a cheap USB
cable so I will just plug it into my
laptop directly how long does it usually
take the heat up now it's over here a
few minutes and that will stabilize
because this should what should this
should stay in one place that's like
within between these two red line no yes
- two freezes it's shifting free PCP oh
yeah yeah and it's just oh there goes
he's going back Turner yeah it's it's no
idea what's happening
I normally don't do this test
oh I think they turned it off oh yes but
yeah that that's the main go fit to get
it stable and keep it correctly how do
you see the packet is it is it this
stuff here it sends out hi free endless
name for blue okay and then the
information is sent and it's sending
this which is the GPS coordinates these
numbers mean may I - if she needed in
vari never quit it goes
okay very peaceful well partita or see
Sir Stephen Starr parents the RDCs and
Francis they loved it in there and we
soaked cashews were still good
yeah okay so it just Waits and then
sends again it's callsign and the
coordinates some of their numbers in the
lab checksum there stood did this is the
number of the Fluke she did time with
seconds in it GPS location
I think altitudes and some other maybe
the ultra temperature inside temperature
effect but this one is she working on a
Priya and now we're gonna tune to work
this one this one is
right there today 50 yeah so this is one
transmitter and that's the other and
they're both in different frequencies to
prevent them colliding and I will now
select a vanilla that's with all this
configuration garbage this and that goes
twice as fast okay so you can even see
this one types faster twice about yes
the thing is is that of course the C
that will have more problems with
interference or fading but because
you're sending data twice as fast you
have a higher chance from getting a new
packet so so between the two then she'll
be able to at least get some of them yep
and they're already been test with steam
about 300 about and I think they're
going to move up a bit six format is the
next step and this is this is in 400
megahertz is unbanned it's the do you
need a license for this according to I
through the live stream of he's hearing
on the is recording the the tones and
actually one of the main artists why
it's a very robust to all kinds of
fading or interest or even yeah over the
last year ice cream makes it it's made
for telephone lines very often phone I
said have a lot of clicks and maybe even
someone talking through it or something
and it can make next to cookie codes but
this is very very nice
and so what kind of range will you get
with this at this frequency and what
kind of power are using it in the
transmitters it's it's about 10
milliwatts it's required for free free
pens for using and so you don't need a
license here in the Netherlands
no and I think everybody says is
reserved for car remote and home
automation and water stations you have
us outside the transmitter there they
towards inside home and because the bill
is so high you get a very good line of
sight so it means that a balloon in the
UK someone in Germany will still have a
great senior because there you can
actually see the balloon there's nothing
in between
is that why you have the Auggie yes when
it's on the ground it's very hard to
locate it because maybe this form or
something so we use it to when there's a
very strong senior around you you still
can get the GPS but it may not be
adequate and even if it's in a tree it
will be very hard to find it everywhere
so you're saying that once it so the
yogi is not to track it the yogi is for
when it crashed lands and it's in a tree
and you know you're close to it but you
don't know what direction it is so you
can point that over to location where
you just move it around and then you get
a very some thing you move towards and
do another
well you just track it again and
you'll just keep doing that until you
find it is this kite line I think so how
much do you need 10 meters
this is the loop that goes on the end of
the balloon I have to make sure it
doesn't cut into the balloon put a
little extra thingy on it
yeah and I'm part of it that's the worst
part so you're away because if there's
too little let me if there's not enough
water in there so you actually calibrate
where it's going to burst based on how
much weight that you put on the balloon
oh the altitude okay someone else which
didn't burst where did it go yeah it was
over Russia I guess was launched in the
UK but they think we'll go changing
train or something but it was on purpose
oh oh so they just have to now ask a
hackerspace in Ukraine and say can you
find her balloon okay
or not how far but at what altitude will
it burst
to recalculate a little bit it would be
like 100 but it could go to 125,000 feet
I think Wow 35 kilometers times I got a
converter for you so the entire payload
rests on this map tell me what is there
what is the reason for the straws so
there's just protect the antenna

no power
this is so cool yeah that's no fun
three degrees so to our American
audience three degrees is balls cold
we'll go with that thing and that's the
chase vehicle so yeah did you go 35
kilometers up first and they have a they
have a trajectory website where they can
kind of predict about where it will be
but it's beaming back GPS coordinates
every few seconds from two different
radios one at 100 bought and another at
50 bond and they've got CRC checks so
they can know that it's so yeah that's
the balloon and then there's 10 meters
of cable and a parachute and then there
are the payloads over there what's the
point at a little blend you don't want
to so you just go to the website and it
just it puts it on a Google map also
shows
how does it how does it predict based on
where you specify this mobile say right
here on my phone allows me to actually
watch track in real time
pretty cool huh so the string basically
goes this payload 10 meters that payload
10 meters and then the parachute 10
meters and then balloon and what happens
is this balloon here when it gets to
altitude which is 35 kilometers up over
and I forget what that is 120,000 feet
something this will be seven times the
size it is now and then it'll burst and
then it'll spend 45 minutes falling to
the ground say that I 500 Stella
oh it just took off yep it it and now
we're gonna see if it oh it still it
stabilizes very quickly in these
conditions and so how do you have you
seen it actually move any on the tracker
yeah we still have to get some decodes
the first a cabinet if struck a mo yeah
like so is this some of the garbage you
expect to see yeah yes my receiver
heating up or some other stuff but I
think this one I hope is going to be a
safe home the back seat meters alright
and we have successfully coats super so
how does this plot into the tracker it
just sends up its information of GG and
well there's a 3G modem in it in my
let's go okay so so you receive it here
and then from hearing I send it towards
the database and they have to get blood
from a map can you show me or it will be
around here yes
low Blues are being tracked
so is that blue line and the red line
there's two different chief and we
already you've moved yes and someone
from Delft is already picking it up new
zoomin
Wow and I can even tell it to okay so
here it is and it's almost a kilometer
height until to follow its path so it
automatically moves when the blue moves
so it gives you a trajectory based on
where it is and what every new new
position it recalculates it so even the
last few seconds you really have
detailed information about where it's
going to land and it's prohee and the
the green line is poison remind is what
the division well the the blue line is
focusing so that means everyone within
the blue line should be able to receive
it and the Green Line is moving
someplace five degrees that means you
should be able to receive and if you've
done something wrong with your setup so
if if the balloon now if you go outside
of this circle
the blue circle then you can't track it
anymore
that's right all right this blue circle
is big so you know it's already big
because it's so high right now it's one
income of vascular metal one an hour
kilometres off high kilometers yep and
when it gets to 35 kilometers blue
circle will be bigger I think these
people from Poland will be able to
receive it so you'll be able to get it
in the UK and Ireland everyone is ready
and so people with their base stations
are ready to receive this signal yep and
there she launches today so three
launches today were the other launches
here we can see in UK in West Yorkshire
a UK professional and some rum
somewhere around Poland today's also
going to lunch
that is fascinating if it says still
climbing
of course so how long should it take to
get to 35 kilometers before birth about
1/2 hours and then it's 45 minutes until
it's in the ground ok I wish you a safe
flight
and is this the signal coming from them
yeah and so are you picking that but the
to the transceiver on the antenna on the
roof yes drifting a lot this is the
signal is getting in from the from the
radio train so that is one of the
transponders so this is the 50 baht and
that's the 100 baht the other one is now
out of you really okay so this is only
the 50 baht and how do you know if it's
this signal or that signal you can hate
it yeah I really so this is somebody
else yeah I think so yeah but it sounds
like
a very expensive interesting okay no but
that's your signal yeah and so how do
you get the ASCII from that we have a
different application for this
listen student and record audio and now
yeah it's wrecked these two frequencies
but what you're getting is does not look
like the right oh no you're getting no
it's not working so do you think this is
encoding or are you just not getting all
of the signal I'm not getting office I
think you can see you some some new part
of the folders something you need
artists to have a narrow name it's not
not working so well now
who
it's exciting to watch this because I'm
not really sure where these two are
gonna be they keep kind of shifting
around this city and so they're coming
up on this Fork and it's like are they
gonna go right or are they gonna go left
I'd go left and then make another
decision here
based on where these two are otherwise
you've got to go through the city but of
course all of this could change just
based on the wind and we're at now an
altitude of 5000 metres oh I'm pretty
sure that means they went left this is a
Bowman yeah
hey Manny
I can based on full house and it's down
okay guys it's down we're going to go
look for it
the Google Maps or guy Oh found it by
the school the Lisi whatever yeah I'm
oka laughter Biden ha and we're here in
- hooray for nice super 500 to kill
America right after all I said no dude
now the GoPro dutiful man Amir now among
us s photos right it's missing some
ground plane well and this one is also
slightly bent cool alright well back to
the car yeah cool slightly bent there Oh
guys this has got to be really easy to
cover it almost fell on top of our heads
I hope you guys saw it on the live
stream it was bit difficult the
resolution was pretty 3G here but I hope
you guys enjoyed it I'm gonna throw off

and we're back with the techno last
photo of the week and this week it comes
from Pico Cole he says hey guys here is
an awesome picture of my desk with two
router boards running open wrt 10.1 rc6
both have a port of the ostagar 2.0 UI
but have been set up to use air base ng
instead of karma the cool thing about
these boards is that they have
interchangeable Wi-Fi cards own ABG and
then switch to n that's pretty cool
you'll also notice that the small
ereader on the right this is a literati
e-reader it's 50 buck immune or found
last Christmas that has been hacked to
run Debian and sports and RT 3600 for
those mobile pin tests and that's very
cool thank you so much for sending that
in to us B Coco and if you guys have
photos you can always send them to
feedback at hack 5 org now it's time for
the trivia last week's question was
scanning is performed in which phase of
a pen test and the answer is pre attack
this week's question is what will an
open port return from an ax scan an ACK
scan and you can answer that over at
hack 5 org slash trivia for your chance
to win some awesome hack 5 swag straight
from the heart shop and from all the
conventions that we go to because we get
lots of swag from those and sometimes we
don't want to keep it all because it's
like a ton of duplicates pens and
notepads and little place sharks and
toys anyway alright we value your
feedback so email us feedback at hack 5
org let us know what you think of the
show what you like and don't like if you
want to see Darrin come back into the
set or you just don't want to I'm gonna
come back tell him to stay over there in
Europe I'm just kidding I would probably
be kind of mean I guess we could have
him back here I wonder if he would like
cook some food and bring them into the
office now pretty sweet alright anyway
and don't forget you guys can always
follow everything that we do over a hack

bye
hello and welcome to this week god I
never do the intro last week's question
was this the tiny bridges of Amsterdam
or actually no I'm not an M stand there
or where am I
I have no idea sorry follow-on but blow
my nose you're gonna have to cut this
out like my Hello Kitty tissue oh yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
