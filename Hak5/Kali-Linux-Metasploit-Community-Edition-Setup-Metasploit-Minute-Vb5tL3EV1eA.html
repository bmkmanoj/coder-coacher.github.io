Community Edition on Kali Linux this
time on Metasploit minute this
Metasploit minute is brought to you by
hack 5 and viewers like you
support us directly at h a case on calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me mu bik's
in this minute we're going to be setting
up Metasploit Community Edition on Kali
Linux the great thing about Kali Linux
is it's already there so I'm going to
show you just exactly how to just start
it up get registered just like we did
with Debian and windows 8 and move on
from there so let me show you the screen
so in here all we do is do a service
start PostgreSQL so we start up the
database i'm swear i know how to do this
start that's it so next up we start
Metasploit starts up the services we
should be good to go after that we go to
the 30 70 90 and in a few seconds it
should be live so let's just check real
quick way to check how far it's gone
through setting up is we go through and
just do an LS of tech n P I grep for
listen so the 3790 port isn't up yet
we're just going to wait a few seconds
and as soon as it comes up we'll come
back to you alright as you can see in my
watch screen and I'll show you how to do
that in a few seconds
37 90 is up watch is basically a command
in Linux world where you can say run
this command every few seconds and tell
me what changed in the results so I use
it to watch for listening ports or
connections coming in we just piped in
the listen like we did before and now
it's good to go so we go over to our our
web interface again we say yes
we accept the 30 70 90 self-signed cert
it is now starting up we wait for this
to finish and we should be good to go
alright so we come back in the Ruby
process we used use top to find out when
this thing was kind of scaling down what
happens when you first start up
Metasploit and this happens on every
install of Metasploit is Winnick and
only ones are connected to database I
should clarify that is that it caches
all of the modules and everything inside
of the database so that when you start
up Metasploit again it'll be a lot
quicker a lot faster a lot more
responsive so you'll just have to do
this one time it'll get all the cash
inside cached modules inside of the
database and you should be fine so we
watch top and waited for it to kind of
scale back from 99% of our CPU and now
we're at our well-known first user
prompt so we do our standard first user
we put it in our password user MSF at
hak5 org ak5 we will switch it to
Pacific time because we are on the
beautiful San Francisco coast hit create
account as we did with our debian
install we've already got our key
downloaded we're going to copy that over
paste activate and that's it again we
are completed with our Metasploit
installation we're going to go into a
lot more detail in other segments so
tell me what you think hit me up at MSF
at hack 5 org and stay tuned to
Metasploit minute comm for more shows
like these until then I'll move expand
I'll be hacking til the cows come home
