assist Express are you sick of using
Lane backup and recovery programs that
just cost way too much or perhaps you're
just not a fan of the new Terms of
Service with Dropbox I know I'm not well
I found one that might just float your
boat SpiderOak
is a tool made specifically for backing
up sinking and recovering your files
through Windows Mac and Linux SpiderOak
was made by geeks for geeks especially
for the hacker minded like Darin it's
more customizable the storage is cheaper
and the privacy is much better than
certain backup programs out there
because they take a zero knowledge
approach to all of the data with that
said though you're kind of screwed if
you forget your password there are a lot
of features to be had first off there's
this thing called storage redundancy
savings SpiderOak will detect redundant
copies of the same file and the extra
copies won't take up any kind of space
for example if you have the same song
uploaded to spider up from your home
computer and your work computer the
second one won't take up any space at
all multi-platform synchronization this
lets you sync files and data through
several different types of computers and
mobile devices so iPhone iPad my Android
device my computer it doesn't matter
everything works and it'll save
historical fire versions just in case
you save over something really important
which Darin would probably like as well
in place of FTP to share and upload all
your files to family and friends
SpiderOak lets you make anything you
want public and you can create a thing
called a share room to be accessed via a
web URL kind of nifty and you can
retrieve files from any device that's
connected to the internets in my
favorite the comprehensive zero
knowledge data encryption most of those
online storage systems only encrypt your
data during transmission meaning anyone
with physical access to the servers that
your data is stored on such as like the
company staff mmm-hmm they could have
access to it or even if your data is
encrypted during storage your password
or your set of encryption keys is often
stored along with your data thus making
it easily decoded by anyone with local
access to those servers now with spider
you can create a password on your PC not
the actual webform and the password is
encrypted so even physical access does
nothing this is why if you lose your
password you're kind of screwed with
your account now pricing isn't too bad
it's less than other backup programs out
there two gigs are obviously free and
then you can get a hundred gigs for like
ten bucks a month and it increases per
every hundred gigs thereafter on to
playing with the program okay so there
are several different versions including
a 64-bit one and a 32-bit for Windows
which is great for me so you're just
gonna need to download the one that
corresponds to your computer from the
SpiderOak website and the SpiderOak
website is SpiderOak com I'm going to be
playing with SpiderOak in this nice
little Ubuntu VM that I have on my
computer and it works in Linux so it
works perfectly so I'm gonna go over
here to my VM and it's now time to
download
taskbar yay
so right now I'm going to download the
32-bit version for Ubuntu and go through
the installation process
yeah it's done cool it's done all right
so I'm gonna close out all this stuff
and now I should be able to find
SpiderOak under applications internet
SpiderOak backup so I'll open that now
you'll need to create your new username
and password the first time that you
open this up they'll send you a
verification code to your email and
it'll also be on the website so you can
just copy it over into the program
itself I already create in mine now I'll
need to add the device to my Spyder
oaken Network which just has one device
on it currently
and congratulation I have successfully
added a new device to my SpiderOak
network so I click finish and it'll go
ahead and go through the installation
process so as you can see the whole
installation of SpiderOak is pretty darn
easy it's plain and simple you just have
to follow the on-screen instructions
when you first open it you'll need to
hop over to the website create your new
account it may take a few seconds for it
to completely let you log in because
during this time in this process your
information is actually being encrypted
now I've finally gotten to login and I
got my new Linux VM all set up so when
you first log in you'll get this nice
little listing that basically divides
all of your files into different
categories desktop documents movies
music and pictures and you can
immediately start a new back up if you
want to now I prefer Advanced Mode click
over here where it says advanced and it
gives you a nice huge tree of everything
that's on your computer so I can go up
and down I can see every single document
that's on my machine right now so once I
get into Advanced Mode I'm going to find
a certain file that I really want to
backup I don't want it to disappear
don't want those two files so I'll check
those I just want the picture so I
choose that and then I click on save
and that will save my new file - my
backup listing now if I go back into
basic I can also choose desktop where my
photo is and click start backup and
it'll automatically take you over to
this nice over your overview tab under
status where you can watch your backup
as it takes up all the bits and the
pieces now under the View tab you can
view all of your backups as well as any
ongoing downloads with the Downloads
manager tool so I'll go over to view and
I can see all my different machines that
I currently have and I if I go under the
download tool if I was downloading
anything at this moment I could check
those out as well the sync tab will let
you synchronize file types of your
choice across various folders this would
be a really good thing to use if you
have a photo folder on your Linux
computer in your Windows machine and you
want to sync up both of the folders to
match so you don't have to go from one
computer to the other so the last tab
over here on the right side is the share
option first you create a name for your
new share folder and then you choose new
to create the share link so I'll do that
I'm I made mine Shannan share and I
created a room key and if you're
creating a new one for example I'll do
Shannon's share too and my room key will
be one two three four oh four five
description is optional so I'll just
leave that blank and I can choose a
share folder so for example if I want
this one to be the desktop so they can
view my my photo that I added
I'll choose select click next and it
brings me to this nice little URL that I
can copy over
so I'll click Start share now if I click
on that one I can go over here and I can
copy the link and bring it up into my
browser where I can put in the link and
it should let me access my photo
and I can open with the archive manager
see my desktop and will it open
oops there it is my nice Gears of War
photo from Comic Con kind of awesome I
gotta say so you can really tell that I
like SpiderOak
there they're not an advertiser for hak5
or anything like that I just really love
the program because it's very easy to
use and it's extremely secure and it has
all those nice little goodies that us
geeks and hackers need whenever you're
uploading and syncing files so I really
like it
do you guys email me at feedback at hack
5 org and let me know what you think
coming up soon we'll be answering your
viewer questions but first let's take a
break and check in with Darin for the
nibble being an IT and not using the
right tool to get the best results for
your client it's like a surgeon not
using the best most reliable medical
equipment how can you expect your
clients to work with you that's why I
use go to assist Express by Citrix the
best remote support tool available go to
assist Express is designed with speed
and usability in mind which makes it
easy to get in diagnose and resolve
problems fast and with unlimited use you
can support all you want for one flat
beat hack five viewers can try go to
assist Express free for 30-days for this
special offer go to go to assist com
slash hack 5 again let's go to assist
com /h ak5 for a free trial his nipple
was sent in by Robin he writes you can
use the shortcut Bank dollar to access
the last used argument for any command
for example if the command is LS slash
USR slash s RC followed by CD to that
you can just use CD bang dollar and that
would change the directory to slash USR
slash s RC or the command cat techno st
XE followed by VY bang dollar would load
technology XT in fight thank you so much
Robin for sending in your four bits you
can do the same thing over a hack 5 org
slash nibble
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
