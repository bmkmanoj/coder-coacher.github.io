alternatives to Zen Center all that and
more this time on hacks live this
episode of hack five is brought to you
by domain.com hello welcome to hack five
my name is Danny kitchen
we're having a good time here at the
hack 5 warehouse we are very excited to
be back from our 4th of July celebration
I hope everyone around the world had an
amazing 4th of July
I had a rootin tootin good time where
you go I ended up on this horribly crazy
street called 6th Street in Austin I'm
never going back
never oh it's so terrible I did not have
a good let's see them come on what let's
see them yeah I got them there we go
because that's what you do when you're
stomping yeah I got them from Allens
boots pretty cool place there we go
smells like leather mm-hmm so we are
having an open house this weekend which
is really exciting so that's coming up
in like 4 days from time of release of
this episode Saturday the 11th if you
want to check it out go over to hack 5
org slash open house RSVP there and we
will send you an email with the address
and the details for Saturday also let us
know if you're vegan yes oh we're having
a barbecue yes it's gonna be even better
than barbecue in Austin we're gonna fly
dragons guarantee yo you know I highly
doubt I'll be better at whatever I'm
gonna try this is the drone yeah it's
the latest from immersion RC it feels
really weird to just get one out of the
box it's all ready to go but they've
done a lot of good work on this and I
can't wait to take it to the skies so
we're gonna be playing with this it's it
definitely doesn't fold down as much as
the carbon-fiber spider I was showing
off the boobs back well I couldn't fit
that in my purse see there you go you
could I mean it's real thin I can't wait
to I can't wait to drone on about this
with you guys no in fact we're gonna
have a bunch of nano quads here for
obstacle courses and racing so another
fun times warehouse cool that'll be very
fun yeah also I guess we should mention
a pentose with AK 5 that was other fun
good times at the hi-5 warehouse we had
an epic good time I want to thank
everybody who came out and let us test
on them in fact we Penn tested on the
students and I just wanted to point out
that you know we're gonna continue this
just talk to mu bik's and sebastian and
we're like all right you know now that
we like did all that work to do like one
let's maybe do some more so training at
hak5 org is the email if you say happen
to be in a user group or a hackerspace
and you got a bunch of people that are
like hey we'd really love it if you come
out to XYZ we'd love to come out to XYZ
let us know we're gonna probably do a
few more here at home base before we say
branch out but so anyway by the way my
segment today is kind of an inside joke
for you guys that we're at the pen
testing you'll know what I'm talking
about yeah
what happens at pen test with act five
is similar to what happens in Vegas
actually you know what's happening in
Vegas Def Con and yes Sebastian and I
from the Wi-Fi pineapple we're gonna be
doing a talk at the wireless village at
both of those conferences so stay tuned
for that good stuff and it will also be
our 10 year anniversary of hack 5 I am
so thrilled oh my god so exciting oh
you're old I stopped aging yeah don't
just don't go back and watch season 1
don't want season 4 either so it's
really bad yes you know let's talk about
the new shows not the old ones ok so one
of our new shows well it's kind of a
comeback it's threat wire of course
threat wire dot what is it net threat
wire net is where you can find the show
it's been a pretty busy week already and
it's still early on
so apparently Plex Trump hotels Harvard
and an Italian firm called hacking team
have all been allegedly breached it
seemed kind of crazy oh by the way
upgrade your Mozilla yeah so Mozilla
Firefox was also just updated they fixed
a whole bunch of different security bugs
so if you're on Firefox definitely
update that and check out the rat wire
where you're at it over at the hack 5
YouTube channel it's your source of
security privacy and Internet freedom
you know some good times speaking of
updates we have been diving into how to
build your home lab server right using
say
Zen which is right now kind of the one
that we're jamming on as far as
virtualization hypervisors are concerned
there's been a lot of options though
right we've talked about ESXi in the
past the VMware we've talked about Sox
approximate another good alternative you
can of course roll all of these by hand
if you want to get dirty with QEMU or
KVM or openvz all amazing technologies
and if you've been following a long last
couple of weeks we're doing Zen because
it's it's a super simple project it's
super like out of the box I click it and
click and it's all good and golden some
of the problems though are that the Zen
Center the manager here this little guy
to actually create your virtual machines
and to manage them you know it's nice
because I can like hey check it out and
go to the console and I think I know the
password for Kali yes it is tor so you
know you can looks easy enough it is it
is but it's not it's not squatter
oh it's yeah you're right it's a Windows
only correct is Windows only and that's
where it breaks my heart a little bit
but thankfully there are open source
alternatives we took a look at one last
week I want to take a look at another
called Zen orchestra today and I think
on the update front it's got the pants
of open Zen management oh my god beat
the pen there they lost their pants we
don't know where the pants are but then
orchestra might have stolen them so
let's find out how to put some pants on
this virtual machine okay well first off
can I ask you is this open source as
well yes
it is in fact let me pull it up because
you may not notice that it's open source
at first because you go you know they've
got a really nice professional-looking
website oh yeah look look at the charts
and graphs pretty charts and graphs yes
it's good stuff right if you actually go
to about which is buried under more at
the very end you will find out that it
is in fact right here open source it's a
GPL version 3 all right that's cool so
you can find the main repo over at
github and you know if you just want to
like fork that get it rolling otherwise
they have underpricing
a bunch of different plans and this is
kind of crazy because
you're like yeah three nope it's ours
but hey support and all these other
features for different monthly setups I
will say though for 200 bucks a month I
mean that's a lot for an open-source
project but when you consider that we've
been doing Zen like oh you know this is
the perfect like in your home lab to set
up yeah well you were just setting up a
bunch of Windows VMs right because we're
about to own them yeah and then we
that's what we do and then we can just
snapshot back to before we learn them
and do it again but if you were like you
know working at a larger company and you
had to run run something for your
business and you needed that kind of
support
200 bucks would not be a off-the-wall
option I really don't think so 200 bucks
a month it's actually not that steep I
know because I've done enterprise level
sysadmin stuff and the fact that this
has LDAP integration and you guys know
how much I love LDAP which means you can
tie it in with your Active Directory if
you're a Windows shop this is kind of
perfect so it so for 200 bucks a month
you get the ACLS you get the stats you
get the backup so you get the CLI and
all the other good stuff but for us in
the home lab we don't need any of that
and there's a free trial yeah yeah yeah
wait is it a free trial or okay it's the
free version free version I love the
enterprise yes yes so for 15 days it
nags you about upgrading and then after
that you should be okay I don't think
there's really a need to in fact I'm
gonna show you how if you just get the
download you'll be fine otherwise it may
want you to sign up but big deal yeah
okay the installation I I have to hand
it to Zen Center again the easiest way
to get this thing up and running is if
you have a Windows machine first you can
do it without a Windows machine
physically at the box because again all
of this this virtual machine the server
here it's just running it's just running
Linux with the Zen on top of it they've
just prepackaged it and made it all nice
and easy for you right so if you wanted
to just SSH into the box if you wanted
to just from the local terminal with
monitor and a keyboard attached to it
you could go ahead and set it up that
way
there's installation instructions over
at the github it's mainly running a
couple of commands like ve vm import
yada yada yada
have to do it that way if you can just
spin up a Windows box by just doing file
import and browse and I'm going to go to
there we go and this is the download
that you get from Zen Orchestra EXO a
free and then the latest version dot xva
for zen virtual appliance cool so just
hit next I'll choose which of the
servers do I want to install this to we
only have one in our pool right now we
can add later more later if we want to
do like live migration which is kind of
rad and we're working on getting the 3d
printer up and going again steadily
stack all of the nuke servers all pretty
like I'll show you that here soon
hopefully next and then so you just says
next about a gazillion times and
eventually it installs exactly okay yeah
should be pretty straightforward in fact
it's just like rolling another VM it is
in fact rolling another VM because the
funny thing here is Zen Orchestra is a
virtual machine like virtual appliance
right so it's actually a little Linux
box that's already been set up with
their software already running figured
so that red of the box all you do is
import it as a new virtual machine and
then run it on the system that you may
in fact be using to manage so it's like
it's so weird it's like one of the
children became the adult right so
you're putting it on here as opposed to
putting it somewhere externally to
manage it I could put it on a different
server I wanted but you want yeah or I
could roll my own server and install
their whole system you know it's on
github okay so it's however you want to
do it this is the easiest and it's kind
of like letting the inmates run the
asylum so you are running this from
inside Zen Center right now right I have
and if you look in the bottom left it
says preparing to import VM I've got a
little progress bar let's let that guy
go and there we go
the machine is imported I can go over to
the console and as you can see aha I can
log in his routes I think yes the
password in fact the default password is
x 0a so the very very first thing that
we want to do is run past WD let me get
scaled for you so you can see that
better and come up with a better
password than XO a right like God sex
lab secret there you go of course and
now we know hey hey never I'll tell you
about a later I heard so with that now
let me run an if config and we can see
since we have this bridged on our
Ethernet it's ten dot 73 to thirty one
two three four if you can head over
there right now on your laptop Shannon
you should actually get something that
looks very similar to the Zen Center on
Windows so it's just got a web server
running two forty four dot two three
four come on dun Inanna here we go name
is admin at admin dotnet I don't know if
admin dotnet is a real place okay
password is admin we knew it like again
you're gonna want to change these okay
so now says welcome to Zen orchestra and
I could add servers right because it's
just running as a virtual machine on our
XenServer but it doesn't actually know
who is its host so in this case we're
gonna play it back at that host and we
can add all of the different hosts if we
have for instance a giant pool with a
bunch of Zen centers okay so what is our
address it's 110 273 231 one five two
five two okay root password of course
it's password oh and then I save it save
it and go ahead and continue alright
well there's a check mark
okay it's connected cool so now if I go
over to servers that's what I see is
these and actually you can check all of
those boxes like if you wanted to
migrate these you can actually just put
a checkmark next to the ones that you
want to move and then I could migrate
them to another server which would show
up down here right awesome similarly if
you just click on where it says the name
of the yeah right there you can actually
find out all the information about this
virtual machine how much RAM that we
have how much the heck is this patches
yeah yeah you need to patch I go ahead
and go ahead and install that last patch
the one at the bottom
yeah you just click on seriously okay
fails run owner reasons actually you
have to do them in order so click on the
top one
oh now it's applied aha there we go
that's weird
okay yeah so the first one at the top of
the row applied this one has not you
know this has actually been my
experience with this just in the bit
that we've been playing around with it's
literally just a math and header of
clicking patch server it does the thing
and then says you're good to go which is
kind of like mind-blowing because that
used to be like a real huge headache and
frustration with some other advertiser's
so I do like it for that I also like the
way that you can manage and create new
VM yeah my browser it just has a button
up here at the top that says add VM so I
can click on that and I can choose you
can choose a template like say Windows
that's gonna be too bit yeah okay and
then create a new Windows box what Evers
description don't care yeah we can just
leave all that crap the same ISO
directory just like we'd set up two
weeks ago with CIFS and then on the
right you can set up the network and go
ahead and set it up to use the same one
as at zero that's awesome perfect and
then we make the drive bootable gonna
need that and then how big is it
um 24 gigs I should be enough we're
having too much with this machine okay
that's weird because you think that you
want to hit mats that you don't you know
cream em great VM done I saw something
change on your screen yeah that was very
Tammy 9 oh it just popped up cuz it's
mirror wall so when you create a virtual
machine over there I'm going to see it
over here cuz I'm on Zen Center and your
play on opens and manager no oh look
it's doing the same hey it's working
yeah that's awesome
you can get console right from within
the web browser that's easy
I like that I do too I think this is a
really slick setup some of the things
aren't as intuitive as I might want them
to be yeah the basic features that you
get right out of the box are still I
think a little bit better than open Zen
manager in that you can do patches right
from the web interface which is kind of
cool and it's nice knowing that you can
move up to something that does support
say LDAP if that's what you're looking
for in your enterprise deployment and it
frees you from the windows oh one of the
other things I noticed when we were
playing with this is I could still like
move around one of my VMs even though
it's live yes that's called live
migration that's which is pretty cool
because well right now we have a cluster
of one but as we add more and more to
this we can add them to a pool and then
say that we're running out of resources
on one machine and or we need to take a
different machine down for maintenance
so we'll actually and we have a machine
that's live that needs to stay up we can
move it from one physical host to the
other while it's still running that's so
you can change the amount of RAM that a
machine has why well it's running just
one okay I thoroughly enjoy that it's
very easy yes so check that out that is
Zen Orchestra you can find it as n tach
orchestra comm let us know what you guys
think and we're gonna continue with all
the other because there's a bunch of
epic open source alternatives and
add-ons and things that just make it
super simple with all that we're gonna
take a quick break and when we get back
I heard that some packet sniffing I was
going to happen
if you've been watching act 5 for a
while you know how much we love the guys
over at domain.com in fact I was just
over at domain.com the other day setting
up epic totally stuff but listen I got
me thinking about all the networking and
the nano quadcopters flying around the
warehouse and the open houses we're
having here and all the good stuff that
we're doing in it made me consider you
know what it is the perfect opportunity
for a dot Clubman you know it's the
perfect top-level domain is globally
understood like everyone not just here
in the United States everyone knows that
it's a club right that's what the
internet is all about so if you're doing
a start-up if you're thinking about a
name for your business
consider yourself a top club it's
perfect for really anything I mean the
Internet is all about community and
collaboration and so a doc club is
perfect for that it is the ultimate
social domain so this summer think club
and if you're building yourself your
next website consider yourself a doc
club domain head over to domain comm
slash club and register your club domain
they're starting at $9.99 a year there
is still a bajillion amazing options
available and make sure you use the
coupon code hak5 that saves you 15%
unless the domain.com guys know that we
sent you in fact while you're at it go
ahead and tweet us at hack 5 Darren let
me know your new club like if you mad
props even promote it so when you think
domain names think domain.com we're back
and it's time to sniff androids androids
are this is your founders kind of do you
know how much is on phones I'm just
saying my phone is totally clean cuz I'm
not like that I don't sit on the toilet
rainbows and unicorns that is a
gentleman that's what statistically
that's what they say I feel awesome now
I'm totally serious right now so I you
know I'm really into like packet
capturing yes and doing analysis you've
been doing an amazing series on hack tip
Wireshark in fact I do it spent a check
a five-dollar good I don't know a lot
about like the OSI layers and all about
packet capturing and how to read what is
going on in Wireshark so it was very
very informative and then one of our
friends one of our viewers they sent us
a feedback email and they were like you
should check out this thing called tea
packet capture it's a Google Play Store
application totally free and it
basically lets you packet capture what's
going on on your phone through all the
different applications that connect to
the Internet's so you can see well you
can't see through the application until
you actually put it on your computer
with Wireshark but you can actually
capture what's happening in the packets
they do have a expensive version as well
the pro version it's 1071 to buy it and
the really nice perk about this is it
lets you choose which applications you
want to filter so you're only able to
capture the packets from the ones that
you turn on so when I think about this I
was like that would be really good for
if you're an application developer and
you want to make sure that your I think
your stuff secure and make it kind of
important a security auditor maybe they
might want to use this for that specific
reason to make sure that applications
are secure and it kind of reminded me of
you know well this is really interesting
because you could do the same exact
thing by just for instance and not not
just to plug the pineapple but any Wi-Fi
router yeah that you have the ability to
say put a machine in between and do
yourself a little TCP dump or a little
you know tea shark man a little right or
a little just Wireshark on that network
you could for instance connect that
phone like putting into airplane mode so
it's not connected to any LTE network or
something like that and just use the
Wi-Fi and do whatever it is you want to
do on that phone and collect the packets
that way and then analyze them very
similarly exactly I think the benefit in
this case is the application specific
yeah application specific is awesome I
don't necessarily need application
specific so
I didn't pay the ten bucks for the pro
version well what I want to see though
is like you're like oh it's the free
weather app cool why is it making weird
connections to China yeah everything is
DNS yeah they're like 50 exact DNS
queries like what that doesn't make any
sense so the the application doesn't
require you to be boot routed at all so
you can run this on any androids anybody
can run it just fine when you do capture
packets though you can't see anything
happening because it's all just
happening in the background when you
close out of the application you should
just open up your browser open up the
applications that connect to the
internets and do what you usually do
after you're done you just go back over
to the application and it looks kind of
like what I have up here on the on the
computer and you basically just hit stop
and then you can transfer that file over
to your PC so and this is what the file
looks like it's just a regular pcap file
so I opened up one of my phone and this
was from the 19th of June I was just
playing on all my different applications
that I'm usually on and I was able to
look on here and see a different get
requests I could see whenever I was like
encrypted cryptographically logging into
my my different applications
oh well networks so you didn't see like
playing tags it's cool right so you're
not like seeing plaintext goes that's
good but I was able to get let's see I
was able to see what images I was
looking at on Instagram which was kind
of cool so when I look over here I have
this simple HTTP protocol packet it's
just a get request for a simple JPEG
picture I believe so if I scroll down
into the details I can double click on
that and then I have the Instagram
picture that I like on the application
so it's very easy to see what people are
doing whenever you know you have this
open on their phones this is why it's so
much fun to run driftnet but that's a
different story
right this was really cool I really got
into it just because it's so easy to
track cuz I download so many
applications on here that for you know
reviews or whatever I don't know how
secure they are so I was like I could
totally run this in the background while
I'm messing with these applications and
make sure they're actually secure yay
yay fun hey you know what we couldn't
so mention Android and packet capturing
without also pointing out the great work
of our good friend drag Warren yeah Mike
has done some amazing things with kismet
and he actually has a Android peak app
so you should probably check that out as
well
it this is totally a different kind of
use case though this is actually using a
USB wireless devices so for example if
you've got a Wi-Fi with a real tech 81
87 chipset you can go ahead and plug it
into your Android over OTG in some cases
some models this works that's cool
yes I want to do that too yep it's over
on the Play Store as well yeah check
that out Wi-Fi P capture hey what about
you guys what Android apps for capturing
packets and scanning networks and doing
all sorts of fun stuff are you
interested in you can email us feedback
at hack 5 org yay
and we should also mention check out the
shop hack shop.com that's where you can
go to support us and check out all the
different cool new very new tools that
we've been doing good stuff
in fact you'll come into you you will
see them if you're at Def Con head over
you will see a giant palatable pineapple
I hope and then that will be the main
know that we are there otherwise just
find us we'll be around the con it will
be so much fun
celebrating ten years of hack 5 10 years
of technolo
spring ham 10 year old gifts don't bring
me ten year olds that'd be weird not ten
year old don't bring him gifts for 10
year olds yeah instead of giving them to
hey I'll just think in in 11 years hack
cloud will be old enough to drink just
man I'm so glad that were hak5 dot o-r-g
flash following facts is where you can
find out the social networks in the play
ways that you can interact with us on
social media it's good fun times thank
you for watching thank you for
contributing and keeping this
a great pleasure I feel like punching
something she's gonna get punches I'm
gonna leave punching alright and with
all of this a time during kitchen my
name is Jana Morris trust your Technol
lust she said gargle gargle gargle upper
caramello
with bill now yeah
Android packet sniffing sniffing packets
on Android it could not be easier on
Android did I already see pirates
parents no ninjas no just
yes no unicorns ninja Paris you can
check that out over at hack 5 we're
having a root and guten to the book nope
can't do it try it gonna do it good rude
rootin tootin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
