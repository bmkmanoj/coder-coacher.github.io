setting up the Wi-Fi pineapple tetra
using Android now the first step is to
power on the Wi-Fi pineapple tetra using
a source capable of providing at least
10 watts such as a wall adapter or the
included USB power cables we can tell
that the device is fully booted when the
LED is solid blue and the next step is
to install the Wi-Fi pineapple connector
from Google Play
while that installs I'll go ahead and
plug in the USB cable between the two
devices and open the app now we'll be
prompted to configure and from here we
need to check USB tethering keep in mind
that this option isn't available on all
Android devices and some carriers may
charge for the option now tapping back
we'll wait for connection from the Wi-Fi
pineapple and launch the setup window so
from here we tap continue and will be
prompted to press the button on the
bottom of the device located on the far
left so we press that once and then tap
continue next we'll need to download the
latest software from Wi-Fi pineapple
comm / tetra so tap the link to open the
browser and download the latest firmware
with the firmware downloaded we'll go
back to the setup page click Choose file
and from documents and recent documents
I'll choose the upgrade bin and tap
upgrade from here we'll be notified that
since we are USB tethering and part of
the firmware upgrade process is to
reboot the Wi-Fi pineapple we will need
to replug the USB cable and re-enable
the USB tethering this process takes
only a couple of minutes so please be
patient while the device installs and
reboots you'll know it's complete when
the LED stops blinking and goes solid
from here the Wi-Fi pineapple is fully
booted so we'll tap ok and unplug the
USB cable plug that back in and relaunch
the Wi-Fi pineapple connector app tap
configure enable USB tethering tap back
and from here we're prompted to get
started and complete the setup by
pressing the button once more for
security and complete the setup form log
in and there we are we've completed the
setup of the Wi-Fi pineapple tetra with
Android and with that I'll see you on
the Wi-Fi pineapple forums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
