net neutrality rules tor browser had a
bug but onion services are getting
updated and the big tech companies
testify in court all that coming up now

let's talk about ISPs and the FCC on
October 30th Comcast execs senior VP
Frank boo Ono met with FCC chief of
staff Matthew berry and senior counsel
Nicholas Dagon II to discuss net
neutrality rulings during the meeting
Comcast reiterated their request to be
classified as a broadband Internet
access service or be IAS or bias for
short and Declassified as a title 2
telecommunication service this would
Knoll the FCC's ability to enforce a net
neutrality rulings on ISPs such as
Comcast and allow them to throttle or
block sites or companies as they see fit
including Comcast competitors the
meeting also included Comcast requests
that a ruling should be put in place
that prohibits states or local
jurisdictions from trying to regulate
bias companies in respect to them being
an interstate information service
this could potentially block states from
creating their own net neutrality rules
for consumers because the federal ruling
would overrule them net neutrality has
been an ongoing battle as we all know
because we've been reporting on it and
Comcast has repeatedly said that they
support a free and open Internet with
that said they have been adamant to
strike down any net neutrality rules
imposed upon them to quote a 2014
hearing between the FCC versus Verizon
the circuit judge explained quote we are
confronted with a Federal Communications
Commission effort to compel broadband
providers to treat all Internet traffic
the same regardless of source or to
require as it is popularly known net
neutrality in this hearing previous
complaints of Comcast blocking or
degrading peer-to-peer applications was
acknowledged but the 2014 ruling was
struck down in court because the FCC did
not properly justify anti-discrimination
or anti blocking rules according to ARS
technica now laws were also rolled back
in early 2017 in which the FCC had
required ISPs to gain permission before
gathering or selling customer
information as well we probably aren't
surprised at this point to hear that
Verizon - sent the FCC a letter against
the idea of state level net neutrality
rules should they be worried as ISPs yes
they should to states already have
implemented privacy laws that being
nevada in minnesota with around 30 more
states to follow according to the e FF
now comcast has also been working
against local municipal broadband
efforts by donating thousands upon
thousands of dollars towards campaigns
in Seattle Washington and Fort Collins
in Colorado they are hoping to keep
their monopoly hold on these cities for
broadband while the cities are hoping to
build their own infrastructure Comcast
argument is that they will lose twenty
to thirty percent market share and
suffer a drop in revenue per user
technically that would be correct if
competition was allowed in the city
supporters of a municipal broadband
argue that the price to build would be
paid for by signing up 43 percent of
customers at seventy-five dollars per
month which would also mean that your
taxes would not increase they also argue
that much of the money Comcast would
usually see would now flow
to salaries of local employees working
for the new municipal broadband access
now while neither of these city's
outcomes has yet to be determined the
effect of having a municipal broadband
can already be seen in Chattanooga
Tennessee where the new city broadband
turned a profit off of their fiber lines
and Comcast reacted by building their
own fiber lines in the city which is a
positive for consumers no matter which
is P they chose tor is now recommending
that it's tor browser Mac and Linux
users update their software as soon as
possible to version 7.5 a7 due to a
vulnerability called turmoil which could
directly connect a computer to a remote
host by bypassing the tor browser the
vulnerability was found in tor browser
version 7.0 point 8 by we are segment
who responsibly disclosed the problem to
tour the issue happens when a user
clicks on a link that starts with file
colon slash slash instead of HTTP slash
less or HTTP the underlying cause is a
Firefox bug in the handling of file
slash slash URL request the remote host
vulnerability could leak the users real
IP address to a third party without
their knowledge it was reported on
October 26th and a temporary update was
released on October 31st with a new
browser version being made available as
of Monday the other versions of tor like
the Windows version tales and sandbox
tor browser are not affected so don't
worry you're safe so far it does not
seem to have been used in the wild tor
recently also launched its bug bounty
program for security researchers and has
also been in the middle of the news due
to zero diem paying out big cash for
zero day tour vulnerabilities
now Tor project has also released its
next generation of onion services with
the legacy onion system being ten years
old and Counting yeah it's it's a little
aged the new one will include new
cryptography and encryption updates a
cleaner code base for engineers and a
lot more they intend to include in the
near future better authorization offline
service keys blockchain support and much
more as well now since the code has been
cleaned up behind the scenes tour
project is making
positive improvements to the
infrastructure behind onion services
with a lot more to follow
these improvements are a really big deal
given that the Tor project is a very
small team and is funded by donations
before I begin this story please don't
kill the messenger I am reporting on the
news regarding an ongoing discussion
about security and privacy I am NOT
discussing my personal views on the
subject on the show but you are welcome
to follow me on social networks if you
want to speak on it more I have been
avoided talking about this topic for
months because of the reaction I
received from it and the personal
attacks but given that this is a big
topic sorry
I got to talk about it so Facebook
Twitter and Google were called in to
appear before the Senate to testify
about Russian interference in the 2016
United States election during the
hearing Senate officials asked the
companies if their negligence helped
Russian operations to interfere or
influence the election process Facebook
explained that a Russian group called
the internet research agency posted
80,000 times before and after the
election of which 29 million users were
directly receiving ads and fake news
reshoring could also have allowed the
ads to hit 126 million users that is one
third of the US population Facebook also
said they identified 500 an authentic
accounts that posted highly political
ads about immigration guns and LGBT
rights for example much of which
included false information all of which
was bought for 100,000 dollars in
advertisement payments Facebook stated
that they are continually updating their
Terms to remove fake news spam and other
related content from their platform now
Twitter reportedly deleted over 2,500
accounts leaked to the Internet research
agency both tech companies believe it
involves a global threat of more than
just Russia now each of these companies
has begun or has promised to begin
working on an effort of more
transparency about who's buying ads and
serving them on their platform Facebook
and their changes aside Twitter has also
stated that they will ban ads from Sun
Russian publications and Google will add
transparency by implementing a publicly
accessible database of election
ads as well as disclosures about who
buys the ads but many were not impressed
none of the CEO showed just their
lawyers and some of their answers leaved
much to be desired Facebook would not
commit to banning some foreign
currencies from purchasing political ads
none of the companies agreed that they
are also media companies which to be
honest from the view of a creator on
YouTube they kind of are and none would
commit to supporting the honest ads Act
so this is the same rule that applies to
radios print and TV political ads that
say something like this ad was paid for
by X Y Z campaign which you always see
or you always hear read on the radio
whenever you listen to a political ad if
implemented for online ads there would
need to be a disclosure in any political
ads saying who paid for it as well none
of the companies could confirm that they
had found all of the propaganda either
and much can be left unresolved now
given that the hearings left much
answered or unfulfilled Congress could
act by implementing rules for social
media sites that they would be forced to
abide by thank you again to all of the
