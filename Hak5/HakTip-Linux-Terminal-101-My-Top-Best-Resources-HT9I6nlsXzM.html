lynda.com
welcome back tip the show will we break
down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and 19 ninjas I'm Shannon
Morse and today I'm getting into my
favorite Linux resources now there are
tons of websites and tons of books out
there that can help you learn how to use
Linux and you have sent and plenty of
email feedback as well about your
favorite places now here are my top
websites and books to make you an expert
Linux user in just a couple of weeks now
the first choice I have is command-line
food this website helps you learn
complex commands and check out their
popularity via the notes and the votes
on the page the site also helps you
easily copy the command straight from
the site for example you can notice over
here that this one hasn't gotten any
votes up and down this one has two up so
it seems pretty good I can just simply
click on it to copy it and they also
have plenty of comments down here about
each and every one beautiful and easy
now this second one I love because it's
just a simple little PDF and I think
everybody should have it I have a
printout of this one sitting next to my
desk at work in case I'm having a well a
horrible brain fart because you know
sometimes that happens this PDF lists
several common commands and what they do
for quick reference
this one is must-have if you're just
starting out with Linux now check out a
riley dotnet for a really huge listing
of commands that you can also find in
their book Linux in a nutshell that's
also a really good book by the way now
this won't give you an example so to
speak but it will help with confusing
directions and descriptions this is what
the website looks like when it closed my
wish list here and if you click on any
specific one like passwd which we're all
pretty familiar with it basically gives
you a very nice listing of everything
that you can do with passwd it's kind of
like a man page for passwd yes Finnick
cool huh now this blog the next blog
that i'm going to mention
is from free video lectures and it has
links to five different sites that are
really extremely helpful for learning
commands many of these lists the
information and a table of contents and
they help you understand not only the
command name but also why it really
works and why it's useful now if you go
over there they have plenty of different
links IBM developerworks University of
Surrey which is a really good one and of
course there's the Novell opencourseware
project and Linux security for beginners
all of these are really useful websites
and they're all tied into one place
where you can find them all now after
the break I'll show you my favorite
books one in particular that I
absolutely love but check it out first

books now if you know anything about me
you know that I'm kind of a bookworm I
have an e-book reader and I pretty much
have a library in my house so it's one
thing for me to find websites that are
useful it's another thing for me to
actually find books that I find really
good about a certain subject now I have
about four or five books for you to
check out all of them are really really
awesome but this first one has got to be
one of my favorites this is called the
Linux command line you can find it over
at Amazon for pretty good price and it's
also available as an e-book it's a
wonderful book if you've never even
touched the operating system now Liam
schatz describes everything in a way
that's really
to understand and to use to your
advantage
I couldn't recommend this book enough in
fact I've been using it a whole lot for
these hack tips and it has helped me
immensely definitely go check out this
book if you buy anything any books in
general the next one I wanted to check
out is Ubuntu for non geeks Ubuntu for
non geeks makes using not only the
terminal but also the GUI really easy
it's a great book to check out if you've
only used strictly Windows going up
growing up or if you're converting over
from a Mac grant teaches how to do
simple tasks like keeping Ubuntu updated
to of course the terminal I mean how
could I not include the terminal in one
of these books now how could I not
include the Linux Pocket Guide everyone
I know has one of these and you can also
find this one on Amazon even Darrin has
one I mean I think he has an older
version of it but he does have one and
you think he has everything memorized by
the way toxin in some of his segments
but of course it's a definite buy on my
list the Linux Pocket Guide I can stick
it in my purse and bring it to work
really if I wanted to if in case I
forgot anything
and next up of course is working at the
Ubuntu command line it's a really great
nitty-gritty book so I want to give it
to somebody who's just starting out
maybe if you're a little bit more
experienced it's super cheap so you can
get it into your more advanced tutorials
really really quickly and last but not
least is Ubuntu made easy this is
another really great book by Grant helps
you do all those menial tasks like
setting up the printers because we all
know that sometimes in Linux those
things don't quite work right and it
drives me nuts but it is available for
all those different platforms and this
one is available as well on Amazon and I
recommend it a ton now I'll have links
to all of these in my show notes just in
case you missed them on the website
right down there so you'll know exactly
where to look for each and I hope that
some of these are really beneficial to
you as much as they were to me make sure
you email me tips at hack 5 org with
your thoughts in York
even your feedback on which books and
which websites have helped you out
throughout the process of learning Linux
and don't forget to check out our sister
shows hack 5 and threat wire for net
that matter we just started up threat
wire and it's really really cool you can
find it over on youtube.com slash threat
wire and with that I'll see you next
