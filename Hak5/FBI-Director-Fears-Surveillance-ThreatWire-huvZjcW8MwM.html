government FBI director creates
unhackable device and hey get quicktime
for windows off all your machines now
all that more coming up on threat wire
greetings i'm patrick norton and this is
threat wire for april twentieth 2016
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom a
big thanks to all the folks that make
the show happen by contributing to
patreon.com for windows right now did
you know Apple no longer updating
quicktime for windows did you know that
trend micro zero day initiative has
discovered not one but two new critical
vulnerabilities affecting quicktime for
windows that could be used to compromise
machines now well Trend Micro knows of
no active use of these exploits these
exploits will never be patched and quote
quicktime for windows now joins
microsoft windows XP and oracle java 6
as software that is no longer being
updated to fix vulnerabilities and
subject to ever increasing risk as more
and more unpatched vulnerabilities are
found affecting it the US security
emergency response team is spreading the
word you should too right after you
remove quicktime from your windows boxes
by the way Trend Micro zero day
initiative is pretty cool they buy
vulnerabilities and work with vendors to
fix problems or in this case spread the
word that the problem will never be
fixed Darren found an interesting read
on npr's the two-way blog let me start
with this quote I saw something in the
news so I copied it I put a piece of
tape I have obviously a laptop a
personal laptop I put a piece of tape
over the camera because I saw somebody
smarter than I am had a piece of tape
over their camera that's not your mom
it's not your uncle Wilfred its FBI
director James Comey missed your
absolute privacy hampers law enforcement
himself speaking at Kenyon College who
probably should worry as much as anybody
about malware getting to his webcam
given that we know that the FBI uses
such tools together until on suspects is
call me breaching his own nothing should
be unhackable stance I mean he's
guaranteeing no video surveillance from
that laptop Christopher sagorn who I
personally follow on Twitter and love
his work had this awesome tweet next to
a picture of rolls of tape quotes I
spotted this warrant proof anti lawful
surveillance of webcam Tekkit staples
today what if terrorists buy it look
it's a good question especially as the
two-way points out Comey was talking
about how quotes the public should
demand to know how the government
conduct surveillance demand to know how
their overseeing how they're constrained
demand to know how these devices work
it's nice to know the FBI director has
concerns especially given that in the
wake of the FBI's battle with Apple his
agency seems ready to compromise
encryption and privacy for everyone and
as a matter of fact has some pretty
powerful allies in that direction from
the US Senate I know you learned about
this last week but I gotta say props to
TechCrunch for an amazing Venn diagram
illustrating what the compliance with
court orders active 2016 will mean for
encryption in the US notice how the two
circles don't intersect that's because
encryption will fundamentally be made
illegal if this actually goes through I
am embarrassed to say that Senator
Dianne Feinstein is from my home state
of California and that she is vying via
the compliance with court orders active
2016 to make all encryption breakable on
command she's working hand in hand with
Republican Richard burr the chairman of
the Select Committee on Intelligence
which makes this all nonpartisan
stupidity really across both aisles all
the stupid and really really bad for his
computer security and for actually
finance and the nation as we know it
seriously computer security done if this
goes through I bring this up because a
collection of groups sent the honourable
senators a letter today techcrunch
summarizes it pretty well in tech
coalition's pen open letter to burn
feinstein over bill banning encryption
the groups include the reform government
surveillance the computer and
communications industry association the
internet infrastructure coalition the
entertainment software association and
pretty much well between those groups
every major player and technology is
represented like Microsoft Google Amazon
eBay Facebook Netflix so many more it is
doubtful that the bill will pass but do
yourself a favor call your senator call
your congressperson express your total
lack of support for the court orders
active 2016 because assuming it'll get
killed by Congress or presidential veto
it's a little more trust than
uncomfortable with
let's work hard to get it killed met our
featured comment on youtube today comes
from jjs who in response to last week's
threat liar bad luck is sad lock at anu
aunty encryption bill says quote
disappointed that part of the ransomware
discussion wasn't a single suggestion of
having a popper backup policy or proper
since I don't think popper is actually a
word we use when we're backing things up
Shannon posted a great response pretty
much the same one I have made JJ tasks
good point I should have mentioned that
as well we've discussed proper backup on
hak5 and tech things several times in
the past so I guess this show is next
look part of that I want to amplify one
thing remember make sure there's an air
gap on one of your three two one backups
as in it's not online it's not going to
network it's not in a PC and don't open
that back up with the machine that was
compromised until you have killed that
machine with fire and rebuilt it because
it's embarrassing to plug your one copy
of your unread somewhere data and
suddenly have it ransom word by the
machine you've got the word oops comes
to mind seriously thanks the comment JJ
