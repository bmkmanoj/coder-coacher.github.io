by dice com the career hub for tech for
half five I'm Jen cutter at CES 2011 we
are the razor booth here with dan dan
what are these things that you are
holding these are the Razer Hydra motion
controllers it's a magnetic motion
controller basically how it works is the
base emits a magnetic field the
controller's pick that up and give back
positional and orientational data and we
use that in portal 2 to manipulate
objects in a one-to-one way alright so
we're see portal 2 here will this work
of course with other games on your
system we have it working with left 4
dead 2 we also have a middleware
application that allows us to have full
backwards compatibility with most PC
games that's good news i give a huge
team collection you can put this to work
right away pretty much yeah all right
what are these going to be selling for
we're saying we're going for MSRP target
of under a hundred dollars and are they
coming out very soon we're not giving a
release date right now this year though
they're just kind of teasing out the
portal 2 and Wii Remote things for your
pc that's it yeah how many buttons are
on me um I don't know right off the top
of my head but we've got a trigger a
bumper four face buttons a start button
and a clickable analog on each
controller so i have a razer mouse so i
have like your specific program for the
mouse control of things i was to make
the same sort of program for this so you
can remap buttons however you like not
quite we don't have a whole lot of user
interface controls on it yet but as time
goes on those be a bit more develop oh
yeah I just don't have a whole lot of
information on that right now all right
so you're showing portal to hear you
guys have a partnership to make sure
it's fully integrated we're actually
partnered with valve six senses
partnered with valve and razor and we're
working on a razer hydra version of
