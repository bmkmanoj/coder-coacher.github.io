carbonite it is once again time to
answer your emails thank you for sending
those it feedback hack five that organic
way it was great one this week yes we do
it's from mark he asks he wants to know
how to disable TCP IP dhcp and other
stuff in backtrack and other linux
distros so that you don't accidentally
connect to AP i like access points that
you like oh yeah right no i'm on my home
Wi-Fi don't know anyway i totally
understand that's probably a good thing
to keep in mind actually I'm backtrack
and most debian you just want to take a
look at / etsy / network please good
today and you'll find you know the
scripts for you know your inner
interface is coming up going down what
they want to do actually about cats / ET
c / network / interfaces stock you may
remember from few weeks ago i backed it
up this is the default one and every
time it says auto here that's saying
automatically bring up this interface
which is dhcp it's automatically going
to try to get an address from a dhcp
server but is this as far as wireless is
concerned a backtrack comes with wicd
it's a nice little you know manager here
where you can come in say intranet wicd
and it finds all of the wireless
networks in the area and allows you can
connect to them pretty easily actually
prefer a network manager up here I've
got it disabled at the moment just
because it has a good VPN connection but
I actually don't use either of these to
connect to wireless access points just
because I rather have manual control
over all of that stuff and while wicd
can be configured very well not to
automatically connect to something just
based on it's SSID you know it's just
nice to know that you can can't be a
little bit more in control it's like the
difference between a punching in one of
these guys yeah yeah so I'm sorry Paul
basically what you want to do oral is
this is what I do is I'll do like we're
doing a lot of this on hack tip right
now I'm going to make sure my w land 0
is up yes it is alright so what I'll do
is I w list WN 0 and then I'll scan and
then I like to
set to grep and look for a couple of
things namely the ESS IDs i'll also look
for encryption and i will also look for
wpa go ahead and run that and we'll get
a whole laundry list of all of these
connections around here and what are
basically looking for is it's like okay
great we have this here's one keroppi
right and wpa is on its verte its wpa2
version one on that connection so if you
have used a wpa supplicant before it's
actually really easy to command to go
ahead and get your wireless on without
having too much of a headache here and
the command prompt what I like to do is
use the WPA underscore pass phrase
command it makes it simple to go ahead
and set your keys up so all you did do
is pass the two parameters the name of
the access point which we know is korobi
ke r OPP I somebody likes hello kitty
here and then the password will say
password and then when you do that
you'll see this is what your pre-shared
key looks like all that good stuff right
there so what I like to do is kind of
just put that in I'll put this in temp
comp but you know save it as whatever
you like and now I can reference that
with a wpa supplicant file you want to
use tech capital B to put it in the
background so you don't have a bunch of
messages coming up ok tech vwa EXT those
are your default options there your
interface for me it's w land 0 and then
taxi to specify your configuration we
just save that intercom and then once
that's done you should be associated you
should run d.h client your interface and
you'll go ahead and get a an IP address
and there you go in that way you're in
more control that's probably not going
to happen because the password to that
wireless access point isn't password
because hey go figure anyway that's stay
tuned because in just a bit we're going
to be back with the tech most photos and
the trivial excited for those yes

week are you excited I'm excited always
alright so this one comes from David he

and citizens of Sydney and by sharing of
course he means sniffing Wi-Fi packets
on a boat he's on a boat and remember

with us by sending them over to feedback
at hak5 org we love to share the technol
asst and now it was time for the trivia
I'm excited about that as always you
should be last week's trivia question
was this company that existed in the
late 80s and early 90s created the
software called procomp and it was
prominent before tcp/ip became popular
Wow what's the next question I'm gonna
be about trumpet winsock oh my gosh the
answer was data storm which many people
answered correctly actually has very
surprised now this week we don't have
another trivia question for you because
we are going to defcon next week so
we're taking a break from the trivia and
we'll be back in season 10 yes how
exciting I know blew through this season
yeah we did looking for I'm kind of then
Wow see this is why we use four digit
numbers for the episodes game yeah I'm
just saying right so makes us sound like
we've done like a thousand episodes it's
not I mean I know I like the seasons for
a lot of reasons but that will mean that
the first episode will be 1001 mm-hmm
just binary Oh ooh what is that binary
forked ten nine nine all right because
it would be for
I'm sorry it would be 8421 so it'd be
one plus episode ii eight plus one
