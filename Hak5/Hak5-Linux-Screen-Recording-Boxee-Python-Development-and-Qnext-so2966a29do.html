and Linux boxy development with Python
controlling your pc with you next and
haha yeah I can't explain that one
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by dying incorporated got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
calm and go to assist express hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen and this is your weekly dose of
technol us we have a freaking phenomenal
show for you guys this week Shannon's
talking about qnx Jason's doing a bunch
with Python and boxy and dude I'm so
stoked we're going to be putting os/2
warp on a Wi-Fi pineapple no actually
we're not going to do any of that it's
not i can we play with power tools no
actually the thing is I've got like a
bazillion in one projects running at the
moment so I figured I just share with
you a couple of nifty things that I've
learned over the last week well I have
lots of fun with serial ports and
backtrack and some botnet stuff and
ordinary botnet i meant honey nut
honeynet totally meant honeynet there's
no such thing as a hack five darknet so
i figured let's just go ahead and jump
into linux and learn something that i've
been playing with that's like been
totally saved my ass and that is how to
do screen recording and linux the proper
way there's a couple of ways to do it
and the first way that I wanted to
demonstrate was using a sweet little GUI
tool called gtk record my desktop so I'm
here in my ubuntu machine and i figured
i'd just go ahead and show you this
sweet program here that allows you to
record your desktop so you could do a
tutorial put it up on youtube whatever
you want and a little hyper today have
you noticed so with gtk record my
desktop installed we'll go ahead under
applications and pull it up under sound
and video and it's simple enough here we
actually get to see a area of what will
be recorded or with our mouths we could
actually select a region or we could go
into advanced here and check out the
performance settings now what I like to
do is the encoding on the fly with zero
compression it uses a lot of hard disk
space but it's totally worth it because
the CPU impact will be minimal that way
now the thing about the frames per
second is that typically what you would
like in video is 30 or 2997 but
regardless that's not going to happen at
all not with gtk record my desktop I
noticed that if you record any
higher than 6fps while you may be able
to get higher frame rate the playback
will be totally weird and uber fast and
it is a huge headache so you want to
leave that at six now supposedly you can
also record sound with this I haven't
tried that at all but let's just go
ahead and close this and basically what
you want to do once you've recorded your
reach or selected your region so I'm
going to select this top left area over
here and maybe that's where I'll put
like I don't know there we go I've got
like a terminal going on so I'm going to
like show you guys how to do something
neat like our m.tech RF / and I want to
record that because it's going to be an
epic moment in history so I'll click
save as and call it I don't know I am
stupid and save and it's just a matter
of hitting record it does its thing when
you're done up here in the top right you
hit stop and you end up with a video
file here's where the trick comes in
because that video that we just created
if I LS that we can see it is a dot o GV
file and this is what I've been using to
record since beginning of season 8 and
it has not been very happy now while I
love OGG will i love the theory of an
open source video codec like Audrey aura
premier and other video editors don't
seem to love it as much so to be honest
the problems really on that side in that
sense but in a practical standpoint when
you have to make things work like come
on like so what we want to do is
transcode this to something that will
actually be useful in this case I really
just want to make it like a simple avi
that it can like import into premiere or
that I can do something gorgeous like
ffmpeg to convert it to an MPEG and that
is where men coder comes in so I wanted
to mention that because it's a really
cool tool that comes as part of em
player which is a is this 50 media
player almost as spiffy as VLC but not
quite but that's more of an emacs of I
debate if you will regardless if you
don't have it already apt-get install
whatever your district toys package
manager is grab yourself men code
I show you this this is sweet so men
coder tak idx and that input file so in
this case I am stupid and then with tac
0 v ce la vie sea-tac OAC mp3 lame and
in fact that doesn't really matter
because we didn't record any any audio
and we just give it an output file so
I'm going to call this tech oh I am
stupid dot avi I don't have any
installed on this machine because I did
all my testing in a virtual machine so
we're get install it real quick yeah so
there we go transcoded our little 5
second video and I've just open that up
here and like VLC you'll see I am stupid
avi it's now a file of epic happiness
now here's the thing if you want to just
do this the right way from the get-go
while I think gtk record my desktop is a
freaking sweet app it's nowhere near as
cool as just using ffmpeg from the get
go to record so let's go ahead and do
that in a vm because it'll be way more
fun right now I've got my PHP virtual
box set up here adding a little back
track for next week but it's our test
server that we're really having fun with
the fact i think i'm already remote
desktop tin to it yes we are okay so say
like i'm going to do something really
sweet with this virtual server your
tests over here and i want to record it
for posterity so in that case you can do
it right from the command line with
ffmpeg which is a freaking fantastic
MPEG Swiss Army knife really so this
command recently came to me and has
changed my world because basically
running ffmpeg with tech f x 11 grab
that's that's the hotness right there
tak s the resolution in this case 800 x
600 if you don't know that run x win
info click on the desktop and boom there
you go it'll tell us that it is with 800
height 600 or you could run that and
click on any window and get all sorts of
crazy information about that you can
use this command to record just a window
I like to do full screen that's how I
roll so ffmpeg tak f x 11 grab and then
the resolution and then tack are for the
frame rate i'm just going to do 10
because i'm not feeling too crazy here
and then tack i colon 00 tak s again 800
x 600 I know it's little recursive but
you have to tech are 10 and then tack
same q and then we'll give it an output
so I'll just call this output dot avi
avi there we go now the tack f forces it
to do a frame grab the tack s is the
size of the desktop obviously the r is
for the frame rate I is for the input
file name and in this case colon 0 0 is
just going to be the screen and then
same q is going to use the same video
quality you could potentially use this
to record your desktop straight to like
an xvid or something like that but i
just like to go ahead and use the same
quality and then in my editing i'll
actually change it to whatever i need
through transcoding so if i go ahead and
start running that boom there we go it's
already recording now one thing that you
will notice here if I pull up under
system and administration of preferences
yeah administration if I take a look at
the system monitor you'll see a big
difference here you see our CPU is
already at like sixty seventy percent if
you just hit Q it's going to stop this
we can see we're already at frame number
300 something rfps and all that good
stuff i'll hit cue to stop that and you
can see the dramatic difference there in
the cpu so yes it is kind of intensive
if you're recording a smaller region or
a lower frame rate it's not going to be
as difficult but or as is intensive on
your cpu but i found this to be the best
so far and this is awesome because her
ray i finally have a good solution to
actually recording all this fun stuff
that have been having since just made
the switch completely in this season
however that is a lot to type
so I figured why don't we go ahead and
make an alias to make that a lot easier
so alias is are really just a way to say
hey when i type this i want to actually
you to run this command it's almost like
creating like a batch file in like
windows and then putting that in a
system directory but kind of cooler in
this regard so what we're going to do
and i'll just go ahead and keep going
with this test server that we got going
we're on my pw okay so i'm in my home
directory and if i were to actually do
something like find tilde which is my
home directory and then we'll do a max
depth of 1 because i just want to see
what's in this directory here tak name
and i'm just looking for dot star and
type f okay what that does right there
is it shows me all of the files that
begin with a period in my home directory
all of these are configuration files and
you know on various systems like if I if
I did it on my host here it would have
my like VLC all sorts of other
configurations the one that I'm
particularly interested in is the dot
Bashar see which is what's going to
allow me to do a whole bunch of fun
stuff as far as a lea Cesare concerned
so let's take a look at that file well
I'm kind of all over the place aren't I
now if i grep alias from my bash RC grap
I tagged a crap I can see already I do
have a bunch of aliases already defined
for example my alias for LS already puts
in tak tak color equals auto so if I'm
using a terminal that supports that I
get pretty colors when i do LS here and
it's like oh hey that one's blue that
one's purple yay but what we want to do
is create a new alias that'll say like
every time i say i don't know like s
record for screen record it will go
ahead and do all of that command that we
just mentioned about the ffmpeg without
me have to type all those bits out every
single time so for that let's just go
ahead and add it to him while i could
just use vie let's just do it an echo
way more fun so will echo that command
back to it so what was that command
was using an iPad here with my notes
really cool now I've got like the remote
control over here and it off too so sexy
ffmpeg tech f x 11 grab and I'm not
going to specify an output file because
i'll actually specify that every time I
run the alias and we'll use waka waka
which will append it to the file or
greater than greater than if you're not
down with the waka waka waka waka waka
waka waka playback man 2 tilde slash
bash RC of course I've got something
here if I were to run this every time I
would open up a terminal it would just
go ahead and start recording my screen
that that'd be good what I want to do is
say alias and then I don't know go s
record equals and then single quote and
then all that good stuff
excellent so I've added that or pended
it if you will to my dot bash RC so now
whenever I open a new terminal and type
s record I don't know I like cheese avi
there we go we're recording so much
better than typing in that huge long
command where's papa alright so this is
running long and Jason totally messing
with some weird server stuff right
behind me so I figured let's go ahead
and wrap up I'm gonna say the other
thing for next time and let's just go
ahead and answer an email that I got
last week okay basically this comes in
from one of our friends here that writes
that they were just watching episode 8
03 and I had to laugh when you said
slash user when I meant slash USR I tend
to do that every now and then too but it
doesn't stand for user it stands for
unix system resource Jeff thanks Jeff
actually you're absolutely correct and I
don't know why I've always done that but
it's totally an old-school thing to do
because if you take a look at like if i
do LS / there was like all sorts of
directories when they totally don't make
any sense from one destroy to another
but essentially if you've ever wondered
slash bin that's for your binaries SS
been that's where your system binaries
etsy is for your configuration files dev
is for your devices like you're teaching
wise and stuff like that so as home is
actually where your user lives rather
than slash user and mount well that's
just your media lives for your libraries
and / route well that's route home
because he's special doesn't get to live
in slash home and then you have us r
which is you make system resource which
is totally for non-critical system
resources like Python and PHP and stuff
like that even though it used to be the
user home but now it's not and then /
bars like short for variable so it would
contain like log files and temporary
stuff so I hope that clears things up
and if you have other questions you can
send this to feedback at hak5 org
Shannon's gonna save me for myself now
so let's just throw it over to her for
trivia this week's trivia question is
Lisbeth Salander goes by what hacker
screen name visit hak5 org slash trivia
for your chance to win and we'll be
right back after a brief word from our
sponsor so let me get this straight you
hijack my Freezepop diet calm domain
open a factory in Vancouver and now you
want me to choose the logo for your bio
campaign which looks like a more
delicious way to lose up to 17 pounds of
months yeah the blue one obviously but
that's not the point you could end up in
the hospital of all the way were freeze
pops so what are you smoking no oh
you're on fire no I'm not yeah you're
definitely on fire what did you do try
to host it yourself I told you domain
com me yes they've got world-class
hosting an amazing infrastructure
ninety-nine point nine nine percent off
time seriously it's not expensive you've
got some cup hak5 checkout with coupon
code hak5 get fifteen percent off your
order no way yeah throw unlimited web
site offering starts at just 8 75 a
month great can you put me out what and
waste my beer I don't think so here's
warm when you need dependable flexible
and affordable hosting take a look at
domain.com there's no setup fees or
commitments required just
state-of-the-art data centers with
blistering fast servers and save fifty
percent at checkout with coupon code
hak5 got a great idea it all starts with
a great domain domain com I have
programs for everything I have skype for
video calls a IM and msn for instant
messengers and i use gmail or my website
to share files with all my family and
friends either way when i start at my
computer i have to open up like 10
million different programs to get all my
work done wouldn't it be nice if there
was some program that was like a three
and one of all these different things
that we have to get done there is and it
is called Q next q next is a desktop PC
application that unifies streaming
communication and media sharing it is
for Windows Mac Linux and mobile devices
which is we cool and you can do all
sorts of stuff you can live video
conference with up to four people you
can do a voice call with up to eight
people to do a conference of sorts and
it has a universal instant messager
built-in for let's see a IM google talk
icq yahoo msn am i missing any I
probably am because there's
ton of them in there you can share files
by easily dragging and dropping and you
can stream music with all your friends
you can play games with your cue next
contacts remote control your pc from a
different pc your laptop maybe and if
you get the mobile application you can
use instant messengers stream music
share photos and view all of your files
if you use the web application there's
no download required and you can access
im's chats q next file sharing zones and
much much more now i'm going to show you
guys how to download this real quick
which is actually pretty easy once you
get the hang of it go to Kuhn XCOM and
select the free download for link at the
top choose your OS and then click the
free download now button and the
download starts on my slow connection
it's going to take like six minutes so
I'm just going to relax and wait maybe
for my pc download I'm going to click
run and then next on the Terms of
Service and now I can choose if i want
to start up during my pc startup and if
i want to let it capture audio and video
devices click next after that and then
choose where you want it to save and
then click install once that's finished
click finish and then open the program
if any updates need to be dead done go
ahead and choose proceed on those
updates qnx just going to restart after
the updates and then ask you to log in
if you don't already have an account go
ahead and create one now so my username
is going to be snubs password not going
to tell you what that is and then my
email address I'm going to go ahead and
allow my emailed to be seen since it's
my public address I don't really care
and then fill in your name gender &amp;amp;
birthday once finished click finished
and then it brings you back to your
sign-in page so I'm going to sign in and
ask for my IM logins I'm going to choose
to go ahead and log in with msn google
talk and facebook okay so now it will
log me on and it looks at it looks
pretty much like any other IM interface
under file i can add more IM accounts or
add my email account i can add a
specific you next
contact or share content so I'm going to
click on share content and I'm going to
drag and drop a photo from my pc so
here's a cute one of that Roger chain
took this was at the hak5 anniversary
party it's a pic of me Jason and Erin
how cute so I'm going to drag and drop
that and from the queue next file
sharing zone i can share files and
videos to any my contacts i can also
rotate my photos view detailed
information change the privacy of my
zone and when I save and close it takes
me back to the zone folder venue where I
can rename the folder I just made now if
another Q next user wants to send me
their link they can go ahead and do that
as well for instance mine is Q neck qn
colon slash slash 36 1757 which is my
uid / snubs q next own under tools I can
search the Q necks network for other
files that are shared by others play
games with friends and select any
advanced options now this next icon is
pretty cool it's a cue next explore and
it has all the information you need
through here you can set up your remote
PC options gains audio video options all
sorts of stuff now if you want to use
video conferencing audio calls or play
any of the games your friend has to be a
cue next user yeah I know if you want to
access the QNX desktop from another
computer you can download queue next
onto the new computer and then hit
retrieve on the sign-in process if you
have an iPhone you can get the Q next
application straight from the iphone
store and then follow the on-screen
instructions to login and to access your
data now if you want to access online
through a web browser it's really simple
go to https login connects calm and sign
in using the screen name that you signed
up with now you can access your im's
shared zones and account details from
pretty much anywhere and you can ox also
access this site through a mobile device
as well from here I have full access to
my main computer and I can disconnect
when I'm done so yay now I can share all
of my selected photos and files with
pretty much anyone and if you have any
questions about how to download
install this there's great faq on their
website as well as awesome tutorials so
my conclusion is although q next is
really really easy for sharing i love
the q next own how nice it looks and how
easy it is to drag and drop files into
it and pretty much how user-friendly and
painless the entire thing is it does
have that one downfall how your friends
have to be q next users if you want to
use the video conferencing the audio
calls or the games so that's that's my
only big little little pet peeve about
the entire program what do you guys

of feedback you guys have been sending
in about boxee is immense so i thought
i'd take Boxey development a step
further with some Python nothing better
than Python right now python is a is a
really basic scripting language with
immense power and when i say basic I
don't mean basic and what it can do I
mean basic and how its laid out and how
its structured and I think it's the
perfect thing to couple with the XML
that you've already put in for your
boxee app to go ahead and improve your
boxee app further so the python is like
i said in addition to the XML it is not
a replacement by any means and it's
important to note for everyone out there
the boxing is running boxing app
environment is running a Python 24
so all the documentation from Python 2
out 4 replies and nothing in 25 so sorry
but you know 24 is a really solid build
a Python so there should be no problems
there and and I just think that that
when you take Python and put it together
with something like boxy you can add a
real programmatic approach to things in
boxee apps because you know boxy apps
for the most part or just placeholders
for data you've got a list here a little
store from your from your RSS feed a
list of I of content that has you know
your title and your your thumbnail and
the video associated with it and you
know with Python you can really take it
a step further you can even authenticate
with Python there's nothing stopping you
from doing some HT access kind of things
with with Python and can you know doing
a secure boxee app so you could have a
boxy app you have to log into you know
the the ceiling is is you know just not
there with when doing Python development
for boxee and you know I really want to
take some time out and look through a
couple of these examples from Python the
Python boxee API and we'll go through
and see how they apply so let's go take
a look okay there's a couple things you
really need to remember in doing boxee
Python development inside of your XML
documents the important thing is it is
Python so you know it's tab delineate it
so in order to return wine or the
program knows returning the line it
looks at the tabs and the spacing as
opposed to semicolons as usually in
other programming languages so let's
take a look at this inline statement
we're actually going to use the onload
event lang is Python here and then you
see the tapping is it's not in line with
the rest of the XML but if it was in
line the Python wouldn't work so it is
not a strongly typed language so you
don't need to cast things to you know in
this case of control or an integer
things like that so we're dealing with a
control which are part of the controls
here and what we're doing is we're
getting the window the ID number is
14,000 which is specified here and then
we're getting the particular control of
102 which is all the way down here
102 is specified as the group for the
player box which we're going to be
adding to the hak5 box the app so that
when you're playing in a hack 5 episode
will be showing in the top left-hand
corner and the best way to do this is
programmatically because you don't want
a blank box always there you'd like to
know if it's playing show it if it's not
playing don't show it so 102 is a group
of controls that make up the element in
the top left-hand corner the ping for
the background the button to toggle so
you can get back to the player and the
video window itself let's go back up at
the top and look at more the python so
it's a pretty simple you know if MC get
player dot is video playing will tell
you if the video player is playing if
the video player is playing I'm going to
reference the control I'm going to set
it to visible and then if it's not set
it to visibility to false so when you
open the box the app on load if it's but
if the video players playing it'll put
it in the top left-hand corner if it's
not it won't be there it's not visible
so let's go actually take a look at the
more components inside of the actual
video player itself in here we have a
group of control allowing us to group
the different elements together allow
for easier manipulation like i'm using
visibility in this case so i can make an
entire set of controls invisible and
then you know it's pretty
straightforward another image and i'm
just throwing the image in the top
left-hand corner and then a button
buttons pretty straightforward but the
buttons a little bit different from the
other controls because i'm using on
click again i'm specifying the language
as Python and again it is delineate
lined eliminated by the tabbing and
spacing not semicolon so everything's
got to be shoved over which is ugly but
it doesn't work any other way
activate window and the window ID here
is is twelve thousand and five twelve
thousand and five is actually the idea
of the video player it's just a known
constant this will reopen the video
player when this button is selected and
then video window it's pretty
straightforward it only has a you know
the location and of type web video
window will get you the players video
window so with all that said let's go
take a look at the finished result let's
go and open the heck by that and let's
start playing so the video is playing if
I click escape it'll bring it back and
there it is top left-hand corner so
let's go ahead and go back to the video
let's go ahead and stop the video and
it's not there so that's it it's just
that simple to incorporate python into
your boxee app and get really big
functionality with very little footprint
of code you know I'd love to see what
you guys are doing with this stuff email
