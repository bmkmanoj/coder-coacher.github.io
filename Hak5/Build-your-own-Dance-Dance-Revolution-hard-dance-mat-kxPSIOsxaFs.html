playing a buttload of video games more
specifically a lot of DDR this is a DDR
pad for the Xbox it works all fine and
dandy but for me it sucks I need
something bigger and harder because that
bunch is under my feet and I step heavy
and plus I got big feet and I hit like
five hundred freaking buttons at once
now solution I could go buy a red octane
pad for 200 freakin dollars u.s. not
gonna happen I make my own so
that's what I did I went out and I made
my own hard DDR pad for just under 50
bucks and here's how I did it
materials for this project include an
old cheap crappy DDR pad not a necessity
you can hack a controller to do the same
thing see episode 4 on how to hack a
controller 36 by 36 plywood or MDF 1/2
inch would be best 36 by 36 plexi or
acrylic and it needs to be an eighth of
an inch thick 36 by 36 custom printed
pad graphic whatever you want just make
sure that the graphics on the pad line
up to how your buttons are gonna be on
your pad screws aluminum foil and wire I
personally prefer cat 5 tools soldering
iron solder drill duct tape and save the
foam padding from the mat if you used
one
here's your process first gut the old
crappy DDR pad you're gonna need the the
computer board the board and the brains
and the plastic thing up top and the
foam from inside everything else throw
away just make sure you kept track of
which way the traces go for the buttons
now the reason you paid attention to the
traces on the pad on the inside is that
we're going to be soldering wires to the
connection points on the board and
running wires from there to the buttons
so after you get all your soldering done
lay your grounding foil on your
plywood itself and tape it down duct
tapes the greatest thing ever invented
and now position your buttons around on
the pad as you see fit where they're
gonna work out best for you so and the
button needs to be ground file on the
bottom then a layer of foam with holes
in it it's got to have the holes so that
when you lay the foam on top and step on
it
it'll actually make a connection then
connect the wire to the top foil and
that doesn't have to be anything fancy
you can just twist it up in there and
it'll work just great tape it all down
and make a nice big duct-tape sandwich
lather rinse and repeat for every button
until you're done
simple as that once all your buttons are
laid out all taped down and look halfway
decent lay your graphic on top put the
plexi on top of that screw it down very
carefully drill pilot holes before you
put a screw in it or else you run a very
very high risk of splitting the plexi
with a screw play that's all you have to
do that's all there is to it plug it in
have a ball if something doesn't work
right take it apart wiggle it a little
bit done lessons learned now when you're
doing mods you know everything that you
see me do is normally Rev 1 it's the
first time I did it and it pretty much
works out I'll have to work out the
kinks before you see it but you know
take your time and have a lot of fun
with it you know it doesn't have to be
perfect I did my own 36 by 36 because
I'm 6 foot 1 I have a long leg span but
make it fit your size and you know if
you decide to do it please email us shed
send us pictures show us what you did
and how you made it better that would be
great Wes at hack 5 org info at hat 5
any of us email us let us know wiring
diagrams plans pictures and our personal
graphic will be posted in the show notes
on the forums enjoy the rest of the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
