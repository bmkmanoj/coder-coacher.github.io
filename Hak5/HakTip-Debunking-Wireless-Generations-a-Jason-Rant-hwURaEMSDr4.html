Hostgator web hosting
welcome to hack tip the show that breaks
down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Jason Applebaum and I'm here to
talk to you about wireless networking
generations better known as 2g 3G and 4G
here in the u.s. we have four major
carriers all of them using 2g and 3G as
marketing speak for speed well I'm here
to tell you it's not marketing speak at
all first let's come up with a G in 3G
really stands for well the 3G and 3G is
just generation so it's the third
generation of wireless cell technology
so when Verizon says they have the
largest 3G network what they really mean
is they started building their network
later than say AT&amp;amp;T which started on 2g
so in this some cases Verizon's 3G could
be slower than 80 T's 2g in the US
because the G does not directly
correlate to speed but as we all know
tech has a tendency to get faster over
time the generational spec really
dictates how tech of a given generation
use it to the spectrum to push packets
and furthermore because of how the given
technology uses a spectrum to push
packets it limits the speeds at which
they can achieve that's where the G's
don't directly correlate to speed these
generational specs were created by the
ITU or the International
Telecommunications Union here are the
technologies that are currently in
popular use today let's start out with
2g GPRS or general packet radio service
with a theoretical maximum of 114
kilobits per second sometimes referred
to as 2.5 G because it is slightly
faster than the base 2g technologies but
all said and done it is implemented by T
AT&amp;amp;T Mobile is currently a GSM
technology is a GSM technology it's not
currently it's always been DSM let's
move on up to 2.5 g or refer to as edge
enhance data rates for gsm that with a
theoretical maximum one megabit per
second whopping one megabit per second
but as you'll see it is faster than some
other technologies that are sometimes
called 3G with a 1x RT t or CDMA 2000
with a whopping theory
maximum of 153 kilobits per second the
cdma-based technology but yes it is
slower than the previous 2.5 g because
they don't relate to speed a video or
evolution data only sometimes referred
to as evolution data optimized with a
theoretical maximum of 153 kilobits per
second at revision 0 moving up to
revision a which is the next in line of
the e videos which is got a theoretical
maximum 1.8 megabits per second and then
finishing out the class of e video you
have one point nine megabits per second
at revision B again all theoretical
maximum so if you actually get these
speeds fantastic but don't email me if
you don't there's just maximums let's
finish out the low end 3G at with HSPA
or high-speed packet access with a
theoretical maximum ranging between 1.8
megabits a second and 14 megabits per
second depending on your release it is
in fact a CDMA technology let's move on
up to 3.5 G HSPA+ with theoretical
maximum speeds depending on
implementation of 42 to 84 megabits per
second this is the fastest of the
current known 3G spec t-mobile out there
and if your t-mobile you're listening
I've got your number
HSPA+ is not a 4G technology it is a 3.5
g-technology speed doesn't matter you
can't change the spec it is what it is
the last of the 3G technologies and
again don't hate me this will all make
sense in a second so 3.9 G or LTE yes
LTE the original LTE
did not meet the ITM advance spec which
is required set 4 which is a requirement
set forth by the ITU for 4G so since it
didn't eat that it's still a 3G spec or
3G technology so where the hell is 4G
let's find out after a quick break
Hostgator can get your blog or website
up and running in minutes with plans
starting at just four ninety five per
month you get 24/7 support and access to
website building tools with over 4,000
templates they'll even migrate your
current web site for free
hostgator servers are also 130 percent
powered by wind energy
for revision3 viewers hostgator is
offering 25% off your order or your
first month free just go to
hostgator.com and enter the code hak5
revision3 at checkout LTE and WiMAX are
the current and only 4G technologies
making the u.s. carrier Sprint and
Verizon the only people that have 4G
tech at work so let's talk about these
so LTE well actually it's not LTE its
LTE advanced or long-term evolution
advanced with a theoretical maximum of
100 megabits per second it's a GSM based
technology but notice how I said LTE
advanced LTE advanced meets the IT use
spec for 4G making it 4G not the fact
that as a theoretical minutes maximum is
100 megabits per second but because it
meets the spectrum spec petrels back as
an interesting word WiMAX advanced not
to be confusing the three view that we
just talked about or when WiMAX Rev 0 we
have worldwide interoperable for
microwave access that's a mouthful with
a theoretical maximum of 100 megabits
per second that is the last of the 4G
technologies check your carrier Maps
don't fall prey to this 3G 4G I know
what you're paying for
take 18 T UT Mobile's call ability to
call and surf the web they're using it
as this marketing thing but really all
it is is a GSM and CDMA modem stuffed in
the same phone and that's it's not
something magic that they're doing with
their network it's just the technology
they're choosing to implement and that's
why Verizon can't make a phone call and
surf the web unless you're using the
Thunderbolt because again that's just
two modems stuffed in the same phone so
know what you're paying paying for so it
basically boils down to this in a
practical sense no generations don't
equal speed now you know but don't care
about the G's what you care about is
speed so do this take out your phone
right now run a speed test oh wait I've
got something to play with so you'll run
the speed test I'll be right here
oh wait run your speed test great run it
again edge friends house we are on the
bus I work on the ice-cream shop at the
corner or anywhere you normally go
average it all up and tell me this does
it matter with a theoretical maximum if
your phones technology provides or the
generation it comes from or do you care
about actual bandwidth something you can
use let me know in the comments of this
video or hit me up on Twitter I'm at
Appelbaum then be sure to check out our
sister show hack 5 for more great stuff
that just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your techno lust
right ready and go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
