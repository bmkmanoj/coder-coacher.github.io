metacharacters part 2 this hack tip is
brought to you by Eero welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I am your
host Shannon Morrison today we are
talking about more meta characters last
week I broke down which characters can
be used as meta characters and started
showing you some examples today we are
going on with the mini series and we are
going to show you more of the meta
characters so today we are going to
focus mainly on the different ways that
you can use the little bracket meta
characters so first off when I see
brackets I'm talking about the square
brackets and they are used to specify a
set of characters inside of them so
brackets can be used to specify regular
literal characters or meta characters
which just so happen to be treated like
literal ones if they are inside the
brackets now this rule does not include
the little carrot or the dash and I'll
give you some more examples of that a
little later on now first I'm gonna do a
really simple example so for this one we
are going to type in grep single quote
hack with a capital H T and 5 close the
bracket close your single quote wildcard
dot txt and hit enter ok so this is
going to find any entries for hack 5
which you'll see the 5 right here or
hack T and there is the T for that so I
have hack T as one of my first ones and
then hack 5 and so on and so forth now
we can go ahead and add a little caret
sign to create negation so the caret
does a little bit wonky but it basically
tells the command to grep only the words
that don't have a 5 in the character
position if I use hack 5 for example so
for this one if I type in grep single
quote hack open bracket caret 5 close
bracket single quote star dot txt and
hit enter this will give me an output
with hack tip hack shop etc etc listed
but not hack 5 now if you add a dash
inside of those brackets that will look
for a range
characters so that would look something
like this
salty five through seven erase that
carrot hit enter okay so this one will
find hack five hat six hack seven more
hack five entries and another hack five
way down here now you may be wondering
what happens if you stick a carrot
outside of those brackets and it just so
happens it will be treated like a medic
character so for example if I type in
grep single quote carrot I'll do H and T
as an example for this one close out
those quotes dot txt hit enter okay and
here we have a slew of entries that I
receive this is why I customized it to
be green so that it's really easy to
find wherever my command was entered so
this is going to show me all the words
that start with either a capital H or a
capital T now if I add a dash in between
those like hack - T H - t it will output
all the words that start with any
letters from H through T in the alphabet
if you stick that - before HT like so
that is also going to find any words
that begin with a - begin with an H or
begin with a capital T now lastly if you
include that caret outside of the
brackets like this that is only going to
list words that start with H at the
beginning of the line while if I do that
without the caret like this that will
show me any entries that start with H
throughout the text documents not just
at the beginning of a line okay I hope
that all made sense because I'm going to
be right back with more meta characters
after this break when you're looking to
improve your wireless network making
sure your entire home has a strong
signal is definitely a must and that is
where Iiro comes in they are launching
their very first second generation mesh
Wi-Fi system that comes with one arrow
and one to two of these little beacons
these are mesh access points they are
not extenders they are smaller they plug
into an outlet they have an ambient
nightlight built in and they are more
powerful than the originals but of
course if you already have the original
that's totally cool
has you covered these babies are
backwards compatible and they can be
purchased separately two systems start
at 399 for all three of the components
together but if you just want to buy one
beacon to add on for example you can
they are cheaper than the originals too
at 149 dollars each we have gotten a
chance to test these all around our
warehouse where our Wireless usually
does not reach from one end to another
and the Eero mesh does a great job of
fixing the headache and giving me the
speeds that I pay for with my ISP plus
it was very easy to set up and it was
also reliable gyro is also announcing
the ero plus subscription which includes
advanced network security monitoring
supplementing the features that are
already built in that you get for free
with the device and they also include
content filtering which is great for
houses with kids now with any system you
get automatic updates two-factor
authentication for admin access and eros
backing with a bug bounty program and
third party audits which are super
important to the InfoSec industry we've
got a coupon code for you two for free
overnight shipping you can visit yo calm
and at checkout select overnight
shipping
then enter hack tip that's a check a tip
to make it free check it out and learn
more at erode comm alright we are now
back and we are going to talk about
alternation alternation matches a set of
strings to other regular expressions
that probably made no sense but for
example if I type in echo hak5 and I'm
going to pipe that to grep we have
learned about pipes previously searched
for it in my hat tip series I'm gonna
grep hak5 hit enter and I should get
hack 5 as my output now if I do the same
thing but I'm going to change this to a
lowercase hack 5 I get nothing it'll
give me no output now why is that well
the first one gave us an output of hack
5 because both commands matched exactly
the second command did not match so no
output was given alternation allows me
to fix this problem by adding a little
pipe to the grep command so I can type
in for example echo hack tip and I'm
going to pipe that to grep again we're
going to use tacky for e group
and I'm going to look for hack five or
alternation hack tip close that out and
hit enter okay so this one gives me an
output of hack tip because grep will
either look for hack five or
alternatively hack tip as well
now if the echo command does not match
up with either of these two it won't
give me an output at all now remember
that taki again is for extended grep or
egress which you can also use if you
want to I've gotten used to grep so it's
the one that I always use but it doesn't
matter you can choose whichever one you
want alternation the little pipe sign
that you see in there can be used with
multiple strings not just two either so
I could look for hack five hack tip and
tech thing all at the same time if I
wanted to you can also go absolutely
nuts and you can start adding in other
meta characters to your grep command to
find exactly what you are looking for as
well and now that you know all these
different meta characters yay you can do
all sorts of things be sure to subscribe
to our YouTube channel youtube.com slash
hak5 and hit that awesome little like
button and share this video if you got
some good information until then I want
to hear your feedback comment below let
me know which meta characters are your
favorite and what kind of commands you
use all the time and be sure to check
out our sister show hack 5 for more
great stuff just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your Tecna lest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
