by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us
welcome to the show I am so excited to
be here I am too yes can we talk about
our new announcement what we just added
because stuff like every week this is
yes
we're looked out until the end of season
18 I can't believe it like we finally
yeah I know it took a little while to
get settled into the new place but
things are just like on fire right now
so this week we are releasing the new
format of threat wire wire is back so
this was a short form format show where
we talk about what's threatening your
security your privacy and Internet
freedom so we're bringing it back to you
with not just darren and i but also a
third host and that's gonna be Patrick
Norton yes this is so exciting we fought
long and hard to keep the trademark for
that it was we were just so excited to
be able to bring you that when it was
launched as a YouTube partner thing and
now that we've maintained all of that
stuff we can bring it back and do it in
the way that it deserves to be done I
feel like we're doing it justice this
way and so it took a little while to get
everything all rolling but I'm so proud
of what we've put together and since
we're doing it in this new way with no
ads no sponsors and we don't plan to
bring on any a sponsor anytime since
it's about you know threats a threat
wire we are doing it strictly via
patrons so we will be able to accept
contributions be clear they can also get
stickers oh yeah yeah we're gonna do and
stuff yes no company no branding like
that low but yeah we're doing it
strictly for for patreon so you can go
over to patreon calm that wire and you
can contribute over there and kinda
featuring it's gonna be on the hak5
youtube channel yeah and soon enough
hopefully we'll have some RSS goodness
if we have reached the right milestones
and I don't know this is just really
exciting times for us and I'm so I just
want to thank you guys ahead of time for
making this happen because we're so
proud to be doing this it's like so many
people walk out to as icons and they're
too
like what are you bringing back threat
wire and I'm just like oh I really want
to do it we just we can't find the time
and I'm really happy that we can do it
now this is exciting
ah it's like the battle station is fully
operational we're starting the
Federation for a battleship yes if Borg
cube no JK lol hey let's talk about
social networks let's talk about that
yeah so are you on Facebook I am on
Facebook
I think I'm logged in it's just about as
long as I've logged into my myspace but
you know Facebook Twitter Instagram all
that stuff it's all just facilitating
the goodness where we can share what's
in our hearts those are considered like
centralized social networks well yeah
when you log into Facebook you log into
their servers and then you post
something and you make it private and
then like a year later Mark Zuckerberg
decides to change privacy policy and
then next thing you know everybody's
senior exactly you have to follow their
Terms of Service like there's certain
things that you can and cannot post and
there's certain things that they can do
behind this anybody owns that server
yeah it's just changed their TOS yep no
more nudie pics I don't know what what
is it that you can't do again the UK's
looks like you guys are crazy okay it's
crazy at a VPN um it's uh it's kind of
ridiculous
too because yeah on the one hand like I
understand it's like it this is your
playground you get to make the rules I'm
just here to have fun and you're gonna
monetize on me and that's ok 1 I get
monetized but they can't do it if
they're just putting ads at you all day
or they could use it yeah this is
they're all our alternatives yeah it's
like why put all of your eggs in one
basket when you can just you know
distribute the load and I guess that's
kind of one of the ideas behind
distributed decentralized social
networks exactly there's not one central
authority you can kind of think about it
as the difference between say Napster
where like you're downloading your mp3
song from like one guy and it's just
facilitating you to get to that guy
versus BitTorrent where it's like a
swarm of people and there's no
one node that's in control of it all
it's an interesting way to look at it so
basically means that users can
communicate across several different
social network websites with others on
other websites because the networks are
interoperable that's just one of the
many cool things about using a
decentralized social network yeah that's
so you're not just stuck in that one
place yeah that's the exciting thing
about open protocols like XMPP you know
the stuff like that that allows the
facilitation of like different networks
to talk to each other because vendor
lock-in is never fun no so you know
we've got so many great open protocols
but that you can build amazing stuff on
top of yeah XMPP like you mentioned
there's oh yeah jabber
of course there's OpenSocial and then
there's other widgets and api's that you
can just work into websites so for
example you might have been using
something like a decentralized social
network whenever you go to a website and
you start using like their comments
section to put a post a bunch of comics
but but it turns out if you're using
Facebook at the same time you're
actually logged into Facebook and you're
also commenting on their Facebook post
yeah so that's kind of decentralized in
that way even though you know well it's
it's decentralized in a way well it's
distributed yes distributed but it's not
decentralized because it's again just
going to Facebook's playground right
right right so it turns out there are
some awesome alternatives out there
these have been around for a little
while in 2010 big momentum got behind
one named diaspora and diaspora it's
pretty cool it's kind of complicated
we're gonna be talking about another
alternative that we believe is a lot
better and in fact we've rolled our own
here at hack 5 so you can start playing
with it today yes so you can go over to
social dot hack 5 org and you can start
playing with our own version of friend
eeka so friend nakai is one of these
distributed social networks and it kind
of stands out because it's extensively
obsessed with privacy like all sorts of
different settings that you can set up
and all sorts of things that you can do
on the server if you're installing your
own friend to cuss settings or friend a
cub I guess yes node so our node is over
at social dot hack 5 org and you can
just go to it right now in fact I'm
logged in and I can actually see you
know my friends like this is my feed
that can see like what people are
and it's great because these people
aren't even necessarily on our
community's social dot board but they're
talking to us through the notes yeah
then there's the community level which
is our local group where I can see like
just the the hak5 peeps exactly it also
integrates with other things too so not
just other nodes of friend akka but you
can also use it to talk to people on
Facebook or Twitter or diaspora for
example GNU social app net there's a
whole bunch of different ones that it's
built in so that you can you know
basically distribute your comments to
several different places at once right
think about the early 2000s where we had
like instant messaging was kind of a
thing before social networks and you had
all of this walled gardens be it yahoo
instant messenger MSN instant messenger
AI em all of those and then there were
alternatives like Trello which would
like Trello was that with the name of it
Trello yeah no not Trello well Trello
was the audio things you need to talk to
people all video games
I don't remember somebody let me know
the name of the you guys know what I'm
talking about anyway there were clients
that would that had reverse engineered
their protocols to be able to speak to
all of them so that you didn't have to
install like three different chat
clients this is what was that called I
feel like there was a bird pigeon did it
but there was a few others okay I used
pigeon
so for indica is basically you have all
these different instances of it so if
you want to you could just sign up on
some other friend instance and then you
could friend us over on hak5
or social hak5 org but since this is
like open source it's free and everybody
can use it
Darren's going to walk us through the
installation on his server next week I
believe yes it's quite involved and
actually it's a really great example
about doing a bunch of awesome stuff now
that we're building out the hak5 network
that is the like rack of servers
network not that collective of shows and
it's really exciting because this takes
advantage of like it goes into apache
again setting up as a cell goes into
databases it's a really great example of
setting up cool server stuff that you
might want to do inside your
organization or just for fun to learn
but regardless it's a retic
you'll asleep awesome distributed
decentralized social networking when I
encourage people to use it because I
feel like the future of the Internet
should be more free and open than the
homes that we have burrowed into on
these proprietary networks not that
those are bad they're fine and integrate
with them too
but just don't expect teams you know to
own your stuff there because it's not
yours yeah not your playground it wasn't
yours to begin with
ever since you uploaded those things
yeah nope so anyway this week I wanted
to give you just a quick rundown of some
things that you can do as far as
settings and security and how you can
set up your profile so you can get
started on our hack 5 social network if
you want to so if you go over to your
settings which is just under your name
up at the top click on settings and
you'll have a whole bunch of options and
down here as far as password your basic
settings for security and privacy such
as when you want to receive
notifications and who do you want to see
your public profile and stuff like that
I do want to note though whenever you do
sign up make sure that your email
address is a legit one because they are
gonna send you a temporary password when
you first sign up which you can change
after that and they don't have any
limits on their passwords which I
figured out very easily when I decided
to change mine to a 46 character
password nice and then I changed it
again so you don't know how long my
password is it I think it uses bcrypt or
something like that on the back end
anyway we'll be getting into that as
well I mean you know in fact the emails
are even using send email or was so like
I said lots of cool yeah that's right we
tried both and then also I did want to
mention as well if you're gonna use a
nickname which you probably should
because it ends up in your profile link
that's going to be in your link forever
so - slash snubs on the social hack 5
friend a cup age I'm I can't change
Tarun yeah I can't change that often but
that's great because since this is all
federated if you join a different friend
to connote and you look for hacked by
Darren you'll find yeah you could go to
our profile link and you could friend us
from there you can also do some things
like editing your profile and under here
unlike things like Facebook they give
you a lot of options that aren't
necessarily a social norm well you get
there a lot more progressive they are
like a lot of the proprietary mainstream
ones want you to fit in tort into some
sort of social norm
like a box yes not understanding that
you know the worlds are gradient so I
put my gender I'm currently male right
obviously my status is imaginarily
married because this ring ain't real you
just made a bunch of hackers very happy
my my let's say my likes are Cylons
replicants and Skynet and my dislikes
are humans of course I don't like humans
oh and my my love and romance I like
taking advantage of humans for my own
political agenda yes I'm registered as a
techno sexual can't do that on Facebook
I also wanted to show you something cool
with my contacts
once you friend a bunch of people they
show up under this little drop-down box
called contacts and if you want to do
anything like talk to your friends I
could talk to Darren for example I can
do pretty similar stuff to other social
networks like poke him but if you go
there you also get a whole bunch of
options so instead of poking I could
slap you what so I'm going to slap you
oh I could make this private if I wanted
to but I want everybody to see that idea
one everybody knows that /me slept pack
that smelly fish so then it'll show up
on my home and my little status feed and
then I can do things like like the pose
share the pose to repost it or I can
delete it too which is not something
that you see on every social network and
from there of course you can upload
files you can upload with mp3s and share
those out links of course videos it's
like a regular full-featured social
network it integrates with all of the
other ones if you want to do that as
well so you don't have to kind of like
get into some sort of tinfoil hat silo
where you're like not a part of the rest
of the world it's like we understand and
this you know a new age you have to kind
of be social to be part of the community
darn yeah I have to go outside we're not
all moving to Montana but we love you
guys like Montana they of course is yes
and they have Missoula you're not gonna
find that anywhere else okay I'll look
it up
moving I'm moving on we want to know
what you guys think because we think
this is pretty epic and we're going to
be diving into the server build on next
week's show but you can already go ahead
and get into it on social de hak5 org
and you know post comments and like us
and add our accounts and I had mine set
up as a like fan account so it
automatically I had everybody as a fan
and then Sebastian sends me a screenshot
sub from the Wi-Fi pineapples like oh I
see how it is and it's like it's great
job
I thought Darren has accepted you as a
fan and I'm like cool so anyway now you
can friend me properly so okay we love
you so it's so good this is gonna be fun
I can't wait between jitsi and friend
akka and all of the fun things that
we're building out here it's gonna be
epic loot so we do value your feedback
let us know and you know what this kind
of ties in with what we're going to be
talking about here in just a bit with
steena from yubico I know we had a
vendor on hack 5 it's really weird for
us to do this but she had the awesome
opportunity to talk to the president of
the US and about security and privacy
and Internet freedom all that stuff and
sure they're actually doing some really
cool stuff we're talking about school
about ways to use authentication just
here more than just the authentication
to secure the message you know encrypt
authentication this year the sorry
encryption using Krypton
be right back but first we're gonna
check in with see what's going on in
tech thing mm-hmm Tech five its Patrick
here from Shannon's other show check
thing do us a favour if you want to find
out what's going on with Microsoft's
BUILD 2015 is there a launch date for
Windows 10 is the hololens coming soon
where is the Raspberry Pi distro we'll
go check us out at technique amor you do
cops eyes detecting because you'll also
find out if I ever got that Apple watch
for testing its Shannon's word on the
latest in Xbox one headset tech thing
comm youtube.com slash tech name please
check it out so last week we had the
awesome opportunity to talk to Stina and
Jared from Yuba ki and you guys are back
thank you
we were talking about phyto and u2f and
basically universal two-factor and how
we can simplify the process rather than
using a dozen different apps and a dozen
different standards to securely log into
things like Bank of America and your
Google account and things of that nature
but this is one hitch a huge hot topic
that it's more than just geeks that are
really interested in high security and
to something that can potentially go
beyond authentication so see now I
wanted to ask you you got the chance to
meet President Obama at the White House
cybersecurity summit what was that all
about
so it was because of our involvement and
and contribution to the fight a you to
eff protocol our goal is that that
becomes a global standard not here for
not only for American citizens 300
million people but eventually for 3
billion people and it's not you know
it's not yubico standard it is for
everyone and it solves the problems that
President Obama has highlighted and
that's why he came here he came to
Stanford to invite the tech companies
and the financial services to say hey we
have a problem let's try to figure out
how we can work on it and I basically
went walked up to well I had the
opportunity to get an in-person meeting
with Obama and and there is some
interesting discussion now how we can
really take the phyto u2f protocol into
that can help everyone and one of the
ways we are looking at now is how do you
ensure that this is your real identity
because the final u12 is designed for
privacy you you can buy the product
online today at Amazon and you don't
have to tell who you are when you sign
it up for a Google account but if you
want to have it from government services
then you know the government or
financial services want to know who you
are and so there is a discussion with
the identity assurance organization
including US Postal Service on how can
you connect a device that you buy
somewhere you go into the Postal Service
or other organizations there they're not
the only one who for in this process and
then you tie it to your real identity
and now your your your real you
yeah yeah I think the option should be
available for everyone you want I mean
I'm seeing the future you'll have three
identities you got your work identity
you got your real identity you know
where you do your packet taxes online
and you pay your you know everything the
social security you know
DMV you do that you shouldn't stand in a
queue for that and then you've got your
you know your your stilettos in the
Castro and fishnet stockings and
Saturday night exactly are you gonna be
whoever you want to be yes you know so
so I think or you cannot even have more
but I'm seeing those three identities
and and u2f was designed to protect all
of these opportunities and when we
launched a fight a u2f protocol we
actually sent a bunch of these to
dissidents around the world to protect
their online identity because it we're
not it's not in the very simple version
where you just get it we don't know who
it is that's that's really okay so
there's a lot there I want to come back
and address some of those like for
instance you know the hacker mind it
might be like oh yeah that open source
you to have stuff in the wait the
president likes it okay
something doesn't smell right here you
know when we talk about you know for
example the kind of heat that Bruce
Schneier got talking about how we need
open
encryption and
strong crypto in a post-911 world and
certain government agencies not so happy
with that kind of idea and living in the
world where we are right now where
certain agencies would like to see
backdoors and encryption implemented by
default and so if this is truly open
source and and you know cross-platform
and used by all these different
companies and the president's liking it
what do you say to those kind of people
that are alike a little bit weary of
that in that case I don't know what you
want to comment Jeremy I think you know
that it's um you you have to protect the
good guys and you want to keep the bad
guys out right and invest that's the
basic principle we look at it as if if
the federal government wants to use an
standard that can help for good for the
good cause then they should whether you
choose to use it or not I mean that's -
an individual choice right so even if
the federal government decide that you
can use this if you want the great thing
is that from our perspective the user
makes the decision so when we provide
open standard anyone should be able to
adopt the standard it should be just a
government or a private bank or an
individual building is own blog side but
let the user design and that's what we
believe we believe to bring your own
keys right and you decide the key to
associate with which organization I
think that's a huge difference between
some of the models around where someone
issues you the key and that's that's
scary in some ways yeah we feel that if
you decide you want to associate the key
with that us that whatever organization
you make the decision yourself so that's
that's pretty different yeah I moved
from Sweden four years ago and in Sweden
we've got a national ID system where the
government controls and you know here is
your national ID card and this is what
you can do to to pay your taxes and I
guess you can go online and do your
taxes because that problem has already
been solved factly all so I like that
and you couldn't do that here in the
u.s. so but that's owned by the
government in Sweden it's a small
country where we trust our government
and you know we're we eat that here it
would not work so what we are
envisioning for us is a system where you
literally go and get whatever your
device you have your u2f device that may
be your phone or a UV key or a smart
card or some kind of biometrics tie to
your phone
and and you show that for an entity that
can assure that you you will you if
that's the US Postal Service or if it's
your bank you know some kind of identity
assurance organization maybe some kind
of online place you go and stand so now
it's my real you so he's not owned and
controlled by the government it's owned
and controlled by you that's what we're
proposing right the government's not be
was a really tough time with the idea of
what is done in controlled by ku because
previously you're not previously and
currently you know agencies can go to
different service providers and send
them a national security letter and say
hey we want all their email and hands
are tied here's the email because you
don't really have a choice in that
matter and we're seeing companies like
you know Google and Facebook actually
sue the government over this and like
say hey we should be able to at least
disclose you know how many incidents
there are of this and we've seen really
fantastic stuff being done as far as
transparency reports but there's still
so much further we can go and then we
see law enforcement not happy with the
fact that you know for instance an
encrypted iPhone hey we have this you
know suspects iPhone but it's encrypted
so hey Apple can you unlock this for us
and they can't do that no I mean that
was a reason that in this security
summit at Stanford some of the big CEOs
from the big tech company were not there
Apple was there and they made a very
clear statement of that they're building
great security to protect their users
and you're absolutely right there is a
tension between the US government and
the tech companies but I'm you know I
think there is a solution and I'm saying
this is a bigger problem you can't just
start fighting very little to do with
authentication at this point yeah yeah
the reason I wanted to be there and and
have the conversation is I we believe I
mean unicode this is in our mission that
people should own and control not only
their own identity and their own keys
but their own secrets everything and
they should and you have to be able to
be anonymous if you want to and you
won't need to hide your identity if you
want to because that's how internet was
Bill
yes and that's we're we should never
accept anything else that's gonna be
really scary if people start to control
internet right no free and open internet
fosters your inherent human right your
ability for freedom of expression and
freedom expression without prejudice
from say a government that doesn't like
how you are and so it's it's good that
for instance with you to F things are
being done as far as authentication and
making it stronger making it more
difficult to say break into your account
I'll give you an example in Arab Spring
Syria was doing some really nasty things
as far as Facebook was concerned they
were you know people were using Facebook
and other social media to organize
protests and the government realized
this and was you know hacking into
people's accounts by very simply doing a
DNS phishing it to attack where they
would you know redirect them to a
different facebook login looking site or
they could capture their passwords and
then find out who these people are their
true identities and people got
disappeared and that's really scary
because we're talking about the same
concept here as the law enforcement that
wants to get into some suspects iPhone
whether you have a predisposition that
oh that person is probably a drug dealer
or not it's really scary when we talk
about governments disappearing people
because they don't like what they're
saying on social media and to Facebook
credit they did actually do a lot to
change the the login scheme so that you
have to you know go through and pick
different people that are you know
whether they're strangers or real
friends so they've they have done a lot
in the authentication sense to kind of
prevent some of that from happening in
the future but I know that there's
certain instances where these companies
maybe they don't want to know anything
about their users after the Arab Spring
we know because many of these companies
you talk about are actually yubico
customers so we had quite thorough
discussions with them there they of
their dilemma in one part of them earns
money of collecting data and when the
Arab Spring happened there is there was
a security architect at one of the big
cloud companies saying to me steena this
was a situation where
we had we wished we didn't have the data
and and Fido u12 is actually designed to
address that problem that you can be
secure yet anonymous historically high
security is not tied to high you know
being anonymous it's and and I think
that's that's why we're excited about
you try yeah and I think that the it
goes beyond authentication as you
mentioned I think we try to figure out
what makes it's safer but as well as
more secure and I think that the photo
you talk is just a baseline I think we
can definitely grow that protocol and
make it something that goes beyond
authentication I think that's our dream
to see yeah yeah I mean you to have
Curtis an extent we'd be used for
encryption encryption of files and did
you Vicki you can already today use with
an open PGP and Pibb but it's not super
user-friendly but I think that there are
wishes that the u2f eventually goes
there and we also believe it could be
used for payment in the browser or you
just topped your credit card or directly
to your phone or even there's a lot of
fun things that can emerge from the
phone call it's two fantastic examples
that somebody could get involved with
the virtual hackathon the yuba King and
and build-out is what I think about this
from an adversaries perspective right
and I think like ok so now I'm some evil
government and I'd like to get into my
citizens account because I'd like to
disappear them and so I go for the late
low-hanging fruit because authentication
is in its current form very weak
I simply you know fish the login page
and get their their username the
password and then you know Bob's your
uncle I can now just log in and find out
everything about them that is solved
with using second factor whether it's
Universal second factor or or another
product it's that part of that is solved
but at the same time ok so again I'm the
adversary oh they're using two-factor
authentication that's ok I go to
Facebook and they say hey here's a
National Security Letter give me all the
data you have on this guy and you're
right it's very scary because you know
these services only exist because they
can monetize and the main way that they
cannot aman it
is through targeted advertising which
means that they need to know enough
about us they need to know
hey you're uploading baby photos so
here's here's some baby food that you
might be interested in things like that
if they don't know what the content is
on the one side
they're totally indemnified in a similar
way to Apple is when it comes to save
not being able to unencrypted the
person's iPhone they could respond to
the National Security Letter with we
don't know or maybe even here's the data
but it's encrypted you know so we don't
even know what's inside of there is that
okay there's there's two questions there
first of all is our world that we we can
actually strive to live in and actually
make some business sense and to is that
something that that you Baqi and phyto
and u2f can help support it's a tough
question I think you know we we haven't
crossed that yet in terms of making it
beyond authentication but I think we see
a world where users should have a choice
and I wish truly believe that we truly
believe that ultimately the user is
gonna decide and you can be a oppressive
government or not oppressive government
the user still wants to decide and we
need to support that and if we believe
that the Internet is open and free we
need to support the decisions made by
individuals that we want to protect
themselves and what to protect maybe
your families so we need to enable that
scenario and that's definitely a use
case that we strive to to meet as we
grow you know company yeah so actually
you're asking specifically what you know
it can we move towards encryption with
vital you trap and I certainly believe
that I mean you 12 is a very lean basic
protocol even where you can add stuff on
top of it and we would love to see
people in the virtual hackathon maybe
helping us to figure out you know what
is you know how does the encryption look
for a key that you buy on you know
eventually 7-eleven and and you upload
stuff on your you know somewhere in the
cloud and you're the only one who
actually sits on the keys
so if
if that cloud is hacked or if the
government say hey you know I want that
stuff in that cloud then you know there
isn't anything there the the person who
actually has it is you in in a key that
could be your phone or your Yubikey
right and I think about that because the
the implementation of u2f if you haven't
tried this you really should it's
actually really good because it's so
transparent to the user you don't have
to think about diffie-hellman and PKI
and all of that said no you just plug in
the key and then you're logged in right
so I would love to see that same kind of
mechanism applied in fact
technologically there's not much
different between protecting your
authentication and protecting your
content agree with that the premise
today is that the keys today mints out
key pairs so you'd as a private public
key and basically when we when we send
that over the wire everything is in the
sense that the digital signatures is
protected so you could apply today you
to eff is based on challenge/response
based on digital signatures but you can
apply the same concept to encrypting
data so we we see it as a first step in
this big things to solve in the world
which is to solve the authentication and
then bring it to the next level which is
can we actually do something beyond that
so I think the protocols prime to
evolved into something like that this is
by the way why these guys are here is
not because they're a vendor that makes
a really cool authentication token
because you guys are really thinking
about solving real world problems and
like you know bettering the internet for
Humanity and not just to solving like oh
I've logged in better but you know
providing open source tools for which
people can build out a next generation
platform that's not as susceptible to
some of the abuses that we've seen
against the human rights on the Internet
and that's that's really the warm fuzzy
that I get to take away here is there
anything else that you'd like to add on
this thank you for inviting us it was
great
awesome thank you guys so everybody
should head over to the virtual
hackathon find out about you became find
about out about u2f and all of that
over at yubico thank you doesn't matter
if you're a fan of WebRTC or active X
when you need a website and a domain
name you're gonna want to get it online
as fast as possible you've got that
killer idea let's take it to fruition
and you can do it the same way we do
Shannon and I huge fans of domain.com
not just because they've been sponsoring
hack 5 for years but because they are a
fun place to do business they're
affordable they're reliable they're easy
to use mostly you can tweet them at
domain.com and see why it's just such a
great group of folks over there I said
folks that's right there folks and these
folks want to hook you guys up so check
this out use the coupon code hak5 at
checkout and get yourself an additional
15% off so when you think domain names
think domain.com we're back and it's now
time for the trivia question of the week
last week's trivia question was what was
the first ARPANET message and the answer
was no not Hello just crash hey I
actually check this out here if config
low C okay that's not an Easter Egg I
just I am a dork hey I think that that's
how we should greet each other from now
on
hello hello hello you see how the DEF
CON sale oh you know I also have a
trivia question for this week if you
would like to hear it this week's trivia
question is Fe T stands for what kind of
transistor and you can answer that over
at hak5
org slash trivia for your chance to win
some swag and yes I did say swag it's a
good it's a good transistor it is yes
we're gonna leave it at that hey we have
some of your feedback this week that I
think we should get into because we're
doing projects and a lot of good stuff
going on so you want to kick it off sure
all right so our first question is hey
hak5 please please do more episodes on
jitsi can Jesse Hangouts be embeddable
or fired up on instance with an in
existing webpage sorry if these are noob
quest
I'm new to web development from Derek
and those are not noob questions those
are really good ones actually yeah not
at all and you can embed just about
anything on anywhere using a terrible
hack called the iframe and now everyone
cringes
even even YouTube uses this so you know
I guess is not the worst thing in the
world nowadays I was on team frames
actually I know I was on Team table not
frame but then again 90 doesn't care
anymore so the premise of this is that
you can create like a little box on your
webpage that actually is like another
kind of sub web browser to any other web
page so you can take an asset and then
just plop it on your page and so if you
head over to hack 5 dot or slash live
right now you'll see that this is the
same way that we've say embedded the
studio Dropcam which isn't streaming
right now or the hack 5 IRC or if I come
down here hello it's the hack 5 jitsi
and that's just a matter of you know
inspecting the element we can actually
come down here into the code and see
it's somewhere in here in there and
there you guys get the idea so it's a
it's an iframe
it's an iframe ok yes cool and so it's
just it's iframe SRC equals quote and
then the URL so in this case I've
embedded the Gipsy for hangout the hack
5 org slash hack 5 because jitsi doesn't
have like a good way to see what all the
rooms are and stuff and so I just say
hey everybody go into the slash hack 5 1
which is what a lot of people on IRC
have been doing so it's good stuff
speaking on the room question Blake
asked a room list would be a great
feature for a public hangout space
otherwise I don't know which room to
joint a hangout yeah that which is why
I'm saying slash hack 5 because
unfortunately there isn't a room list
while it's really nice that though you
know this that's not to say that it
couldn't exist because jitsi meat is
open-source
so if you wanted to hack at the code to
make that happen you probably could I
think what we're looking to do since
it's not so if you rolled this in your
organization you may want to use this as
an alternative to something more
expensive from one of the vendors like
Citrix or something or
say as an alternative to Google Hangouts
right so you could roll this in your
environment and then it'd be really
useful for say like the accounting
meeting team to use slash accounting and
some other like web dev team to use
slash web dev but now when it comes to
the hak5 community yeah of course we all
want to know we're like where's
everybody hanging so we've been just
kind of ad hoc we're just like popping
on IRC and being like I guess until then
I'm just gonna say use slash hack five
and we're gonna see what we can do about
fixing that maybe but Jimmy is really in
its infancy yeah like this is one point
0.46 or something version very new yeah
so that doesn't exist yet Bay it's open
source so you know take a crack at it I
think about that about wraps up this
episode that does we want again once
again remind you that we are doing some
all sorts of epic stuff between
Metasploit minute and threat wire and
tech thing and hack tip and hack five
and pineapple University and so much
good stuff we got pen test with hack
five going on
we've got camps coming up hack across
America it kind of just goes on and on
and on so hak5 to RG is where you can
always find everything no matter what if
we ever miss an episode on the feed
you'll always be able to find us there
and just want to thank you guys for your
continued support of that so yes thank
you everybody
and of course hack shop comm is where
you can go to check out all the
different merchandise that we have we're
bringing in a bunch of stuff for the new
shows so that's gonna be really exciting
there's um there's good things on the
way yeah I'm very excited yeah I expect
epic stuff for sure yes don't leave it
at that
turtle as a pet one okay so with all of
that it's gave away feedback a hack side
that org is how you can get a hold of us
and let us know what you like or you can
just leave a comment below and thank you
so much you know if you're like a patron
to Shannon's Tech thing or threat wire
do really appreciate that if you can you
know help us out by you know buying
stickers and whatever other hacking
March over a hack shop hey partner or if
you could you know just like and
subscribe and all of those things that
they say at the end of lots of other
videos and we appreciate that too no
matter how you get your techno lust on
we love it so thanks once again for
being part of something that's so
special to us with all of that I'm
Darrin kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
trust your techno s bye bye
