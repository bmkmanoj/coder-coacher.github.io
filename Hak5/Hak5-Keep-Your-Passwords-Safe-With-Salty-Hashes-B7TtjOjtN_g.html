passwords safe and secure with key tasks
and keeping your hashes secure with hash
salting all that and more on this
episode of hack 5
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by go daddy Squarespace
Gamefly and viewers like you oh and
welcome to hack 5 my name is Darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse and this is
your weekly dose of Technol us we are
here in Topsail Island North Carolina
yes we are visiting my family this week
so we decided to shoot an episode here
and get some of my cousin's in to do the
Audrey's it's gonna be good times all
good hackers need a vacation every now
and then so true so we're gonna keep it
short and sweet this week but we still
got some pretty sweet spot for ya we're
talking about salt just like on my
margarita here mmm delicious salt and
keep s right so we're talking basically
about passwords whether it be hashes or
on the user and actually entering them
array passwords it's like I don't know a
dental hygiene right but it's important
stuff yeah and we have found internets
out here so we were actually making
things work back well earlier we were
having a little too much fun with that
but you say that for San Francisco we'll
talk about that at the show all right
yeah so we have coming up well my
segments about KeePass which is
basically a huge database a huge place
where you can store all your passwords
and you just have to memorize one I love
that and I will be talking about
password hashes but first let's take a
quick break and find out what's going on
with our meetup in Williamsburg Virginia
at Busch Gardens right Cheers don't
forget our but our first ever hack 5
meetup at Busch Gardens Williamsburg on
August 15
we'll be geeking out riding roller
coasters drink a beer and having a good
time and you are officially invited get

so Shannon I used to have this thing
where I would use the same password not
on every site I would have like levels
of security like this banking it was a
really tough one but like for my slash
account my dig account stuff like that
it was this really stupid password and
then I got thinking when I was doing
research about the password hashing and
whatnot that if any of those on the back
end aren't secured properly and if you
know they were to be easily cracked and
I use the same thing like movies has
showed us with multigo it's super simple
to be like oh my space.com slash Garen
kitchen is the same thing as
facebook.com slash dairy kitchen right
so any people use the same passwords at
times a different size and the reason
being it's just so hard to remember all
those different passwords what can I do
so that you know I don't drive myself
crazy and I don't just put them on
sticky notes on under my monitor well
you could do that and then have somebody
come into your room and find out the
passwords to your entire life yeah or
you could use a system like key pass
which is a really nifty program that
lets you stick all of your passwords
every single one of them into this quick
little database and then you just have
one master password or a master password
and a Keith key file mmm that can
protect all of them and keep them
encrypted you mentioned that it's
encrypted and that the key file I picked
up on that okay so that sounds a lot
like TrueCrypt what you're talking yeah
we talked about how that can use key
files so how is how what's a similar is
there well the encryption you can do
either
AES or to fish those were the choices
that I had when I was running the the
portable version of keep s I'm not sure
if there's other ones but Aes two-fish
those are good and that's pretty good I
mean I guess if you really wanted to get
crazy
you mentioned okay portable app that's
beautiful because then you know very
cool you could just stick it on a USB
and walk around to all sorts of
different computers and you never have
to memorize all the different passwords
you can just always stick it in yeah
always stick in your USB and great
another mentor great accent throw on
your your pasta from up then last week
exactly yeah I love that idea and hey if
you want to get ridiculously secure and
fun with it you could go ahead and
actually TrueCrypt the portable app
really yeah you could except you can't
forget the passwords which it's
TrueCrypt volume that's got your
password safe that would anyway
what if you put your true current
password into your key pass well we're
running it so what about what about like
features within the program because the
thing is I've got a ton of different
passwords that I have for work for hack
five for personal stuff how do I
organize all this and is any better than
just like throwing a notepad but I mean
you know good question it's really
really user friendly it's so easy
completely crazy easy like I was able to
go in there I didn't even read any
directions and I was just like I create
a new database enter a password a new
master password key file and then I went
to groups which is so cool because you
can put your different passwords into
different groups like there's one for
home banking there's one for you know
internet email pretty much every single
type of different password that you
might have you could put it into a
different group great I would happen for
like domains web servers all sorts of
stuff you want to create your own groups
you don't have to use the default ones
that it gives you and then it'll just
fill out the form for me or how does
that work there's a form that you have
to fill out you have the choice between
AES and to fish and then you put in the
title of the password that you want to
put in like one of mine was called
snubz's Facebook mm-hmm and then I put
in the username or the email right the
password and then it also lets you do an
expiration date ooh oh this needs yeah
so I could set like a year expiration
date or sixty days pretty much whatever
I want that's good kind of gets you in
the encourages you to do that policy
that everybody should be doing is
actually changing their password every
couple months and not just putting a
different number on the end of it the
date yeah you mentioned that it's
cross-platform so I'm assuming you know
it was cross-platform and it's portable
so we could run Windows Mac Linux no
problem what about my browser that's
where I do all of my passwords for the
most part there are plugins for it
there's Firefox plugins and Internet
Explorer plugins as well as like 30 40
different other kind of plugins there's
a toolbar one on there which is pretty
nifty I tried it out just a little bit
and I liked what I saw nice so there's
tons of different things that you can
use for KeePass
I am definitely going to get in the
habit of doing this because sure I'm
always making my my passwords more and
more secure by just adding passwords to
them but it's getting a little
cumbersome now I think I might need this
thank you and of course if people have
questions about this they can check out
the keep s site which what I will have
in the show notes as well as some extra
information about it email snobs at hack
5 or that's rich at all right well let's
go ahead and find out what's going on
this week in trivia sounds good

you may remember from episode 419 when
we started talking about brute-forcing
the md5 hashes that many passwords are
stored in we were using a technology
from in video called CUDA so that we
could actually do somewhere like four to
five billion password attempts per
second which makes brute-forcing
password hashes kind of trivial when
you've got enough horsepower like that
and I thought that it would be apt of
course to talk about ways to protect
those hashes and particularly a
technology called salting which is kind
of apt for this margarita that I'm
having here on the beach so first we
should have a basic understanding of
what a hash is and then why it's
important to salting
so for instance my password if it was
just the word password when it's stored
in a database it's not stored as just
that in what we call clear text because
then anybody reading the database would
be able to see that password we actually
do what's called we hash it with an
algorithm like md5 or sha-1 or sha-1 if
you will and and many other different
algorithms but we use those to create a
cryptographic hash a
that password where we took the text we
run it through this and we get this
sequence of numbers that way when I ask
you you know if I'm the server and I ask
you for your password I'm not actually
asking you to tell me your password
because anybody listening in-between
would actually be able to say hey I just
grabbed his password right what I'm
asking you to do is send me the hash and
I'm taking a look at that and comparing
it to what I have I all ask you a
question maybe if it's his Kerberos I'll
say if I take your hash and run it
through this do you get that and it's a
number of challenges and responses and
fun stuff but essentially this way we
don't have to pass our our text or
password in the clear text if you will
so hashes are very important in so many
ways and what we talked about in episode
419 was how we could say great if only I
could just come up with a table if I
only I could use raw horsepower to come
up with every hash equivalent for every
text equivalent and then match them up
with your hash in
say oh this hash it means this ASCII
equivalent and that's what your hash was
so this is your password so what I'd
like to talk about is salting now
salting is basically using random bits
and appending them to the password when
you create the hash these salted hashes
don't look like normal passwords so for
example if I have two passwords if
Shanna and I both have the same password
they're not going to have the same hash
because the salt is going to be
different this salt is what makes it
more secure and you can consider the
salt almost like another password
because it needs to be kept secure as
well and when you mix these two together
you get a much stronger hash and what
does that do for you the attacker well a
dictionary attack is going to be foiled
by this because you would have to run
your your dictionary of all the words
and their hash equivalents against all
the words and all of the possible salts
and their equivalents and in the case of
a 32-bit salt you're talking about the
difference between hundreds of thousands
and trillions so it turns things like
rainbow tables or pre-computed time
memory trade-off tables basically makes
them impractical to use when you're
dealing with a big enough salt of course
that is to say we could brute force a
password hash that has been salted and
that could take forever or in the case
of older UNIX systems it could not take
that long at all I'll give you an
example and this comes straight from
like a frack article that I read back
when I was like 12 or something that
back then it was poppin UNIX systems was
pretty much just a matter of getting a
guest login or any log into a UNIX box
and copying a file called a TC /
password or pass WD right and and this
is where the password be kept with this
is before shadows ok before password
shadows but but this is where your
password bits sort and of course
it was limited to 8 characters and would
use a 12 bit salt well nowadays 12 bit
salt and an eight character password
there's only 4096 you know possibilities
for those salts so using rainbow tables
of brute-forcing especially with like
cuda or or other video card technology
would make it pretty easy to actually
crack those so you know and just you
know copy that passwd and that's you
know back then any user on a unix system
could you know see that file so it was
just a matter of grabbing that and
running it through john the ripper but
of course now that's not the case anyway
so that is essentially what salts are
they are another password on top of your
password that get mixed together to make
your hash more secure so that two
passwords are the same would not have
the same hash makes it a lot more
difficult for us to crack and it's
important to keep in mind if you were
building a one to build a secure
authentication mechanism so of course
with a topic like this that isn't a
practical here's how to you know run
these commands and pass it through this
I of course and very interested in your
feedback on on what you consider secure
and and what you use in practice whether
you're a systems administrator or a
programmer and other topics like this
that you might be interested in go ahead

that just about wraps up this episode of
hack 5 but first I didn't want to
mention that next week we are finally
going to San Francisco I am so stoked
about this I can't wait
yeah we'll be shooting over at Reb 3 and
I've gotten you know new camera that I'm
playing with a rental and Paul's maybe 9
tonight as well doing some fun stuff
with digital SLRs some video stuff so
the next episode is going to be somewhat
of a project I am saving for that one so
we're shooting an episode in San
Francisco I'm so excited yes that's
actually going to be our last episode of
the season can you believe that we're
already done with season 5 that's insane
thank God ok I'm gonna be so completely
like Dorothy here it feels like
yesterday yeah guys so of course that
doesn't mean that we're going on hiatus
or anything we will be back with the
premiere of season 6 the following
Wednesday so stay tuned for that that's
actually going to be right after our
meet up at Busch Gardens Williamsburg
you guys definitely make sure to come
out and meet us up I mean we're gonna be
you know doing everything rollercoasters
beer it's gonna be a good time
yeah also don't forget to meet up with
us we're having a Tweetup in San
Francisco so if you're not already
following us on Twitter check that out
yeah twitter.com slash hack 5 is where
you can find all of us you can find all
of us where I go into you know
twitter.com slash hack 5 and we also got
the Facebook fan page facebook.com slash
techno lust because we couldn't get hack
5 - sorry it's to survive characters and
they didn't get they didn't choose hack
point 5 they didn't let us do that so I
had to go with China less but I think
that's pretty good yeah until of course
we call Mark Zuckerberg and make it
happen that's true so you know we'll get
moving to get his number for us yeah
all right well anyway that's pretty much
it for this week's episode of hack 5 as
always feedback at high five dot org is
the best way to get a hold of us let us
know what you think about the show this
week what you would like to see in the
future at this point we are going to go
back to those margaritas and they got a
name on them we'll see you next week
we need to hire an intern to clip
