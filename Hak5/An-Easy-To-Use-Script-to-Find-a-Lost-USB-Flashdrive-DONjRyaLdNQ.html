carbonite welcome to tech tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today
we're getting into some easy scripting
to find a lost USB flash drive now I
recently lost my 16 gig flash drive
during my travels and have yet to find
it I know it's probably sitting around
somewhere but who knows maybe somebody
stole it for all I know some random
person picked it up and decided sweet
free flash drive now although this is a
bummer for me I now have a new Drive and
I need some sort of security feature in
a way to claim it as my own
luckily the good people over at daily
cup of Tech came up with a solution
first they thought of just sticking a
text file on the drive that says help
txt or I'm lost Tex but who's to say
that the founder will read that using an
auto IT script the creator made an
autorun file that the user can click on
the icon displays help I'm lost and when
it's clicked on it displays a message of
your choice whether that is your address
or a reward for returning the drive etc
if you right-click on the drive in my
computer the same thing shows up now
because of the high interest in this
code there is now a downloadable dip
file with all you need to get started so
all you have to do is simply download
the zip file extract the files to the
root of your flash drive and change to
the readme.txt to save whatever you want
now I'm going to do this to my flash
drive I already downloaded it and put it
on my computer now when you first
download it it'll be inside a folder
called lost drive you'll want to open
the readme text and for mine I put in
help I'm lost my only owner would really
like to have me back if you would be so
kind Center an email Shannon at hack 5
org that's me and she'll gladly send you
a reward for your trouble maybe a hack 5
t-shirt if any of you guys know where my
USB flash drive is awesome so you just
save that and drag it on to your USB
flash drive
which I already did right here and then
just eject eject it nice and safely put
it back in to make sure it worked and it
should show an icon right here and say
help I'm lost so it changed the name
have an help exe and a readme so if I
click on the readme it shows me what I
wrote in and also I can click on help
and it sends up a little exclamation
mark and says the exact same thing but
what if you lost your USB Drive and
there was sensitive data on it I have a
tip on securing your Drive right after
the break computer disasters eventually
happen to everyone your computer crashes
it gets infected with a virus or you
drop it like I do all the time
but if you get carbonite online backup
before your disaster than no need to
worry because your files will be backed
up automatically and safely off-site and
it's really easy to get them back plus
you get anytime anywhere access to your
backed up files from any computer or on
your smartphone or iPad with a free
Carbonite app with Carbonite unlimited
backup for your pc or mac is just 59
bucks a year that's less than 5 bucks a
month but when you use the offer code
hak5 to start your free 15 day trial
you'll also get two months free if you
decide to buy all the details are at
carbonite.com and remember to use the
offer code hak5 that's hack five to get
two months free with purchase and we're
back now the problem I have with my
flash drives that I have on hand is none
of them have any sorta as security
features sure I could shell out like
lots of cash for an encrypted super
drive but why do that when I can encrypt
my own for free and her TrueCrypt if you
haven't played what TrueCrypt before i
explained how to encrypt your entire
hard drive on an episode of hack 5 it
was episode 5 20 in crypt your entire
hard drive the same steps can be used to
encrypt a partition or a volume even on
a flash drive encrypting your documents
and important data inside a drive won't
keep people from stealing it or yourself
from losing it the actual physical drive
but at least then your data can't be
accessed without the proper password now
I did link up a really really nice
how-to and it's located in the show
notes

flashdrive hit me up at tips at hack 5
