I'm Darrin kitchen at CES 2012 checking
out the latest from Sensex you probably
think that I look awesome right now I
actually happen to believe I look
awesome
and that is because I'm checking out
this prototype here of what would be a
pair of like smart virtual reality
goggles and this really differs from
some of the other VR a our solutions
that we've seen in the past in that this
entire rig that I'm wearing right now is
an Ice Cream Sandwich Android device so
the media the games the the programs and
all that is built into this and they've
done some really interesting things with
it in that I'm actually using a like
these cameras here are kind of sensor
input so I could like swipe to left
swipe to the right and since it has all
these cameras it can actually tell like
you know some gestures and things of
that nature and you can imagine with
like a game controller being able to
actually interact with a virtual
environment wearing a headset I got my
my speaker's here and what I'm seeing
here in these goggles is a really clear
image the we're actually talking about a
1280 by 1024 display and these are using
like less than an inch small o le d--
displays and i just find this
fascinating because i really think that
when you put it all together the package
when it has everything i think it
totally opens up you know a market that
probably hasn't been dreamed of in like
a decade and that's so cool because you
know i think we're on the cusp of that
so so they're here just looking you know
to bring awareness to this to look for
partners obviously with android there's
been some really cool 3d games and as
you can imagine with this sdk they could
do some pretty cool stuff as far as like
bringing this platform to more games and
another applications I mean I could
imagine even Google Earth being pretty
wicked with this and as well as you know
look for a manufacturer this right here
is a prototype so this probably doesn't
look like what the final product would
be and that well they're not talking
about pricing they are talking about
just you know kind of hinting about what
the
I sing of kind of premium electronics
like your standard you know high-end
portable gaming system or tablet would
be so I guess that's what you could
imagine this to be if and when it comes
to market and I just think it really
needs to because as hackers come on we
are really style conscious and and this
right here this this is style anyway for
