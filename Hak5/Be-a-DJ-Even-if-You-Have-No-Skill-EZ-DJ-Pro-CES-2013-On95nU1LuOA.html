go further with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES what is this 2013
a digital experience oh my gosh the
years fly by I feel so old but I'm over
here with easy DJ pro with Greg Mitchell
thank you so much Greg nice to meet
Cheney you don't look very old at all
you look no more than like what 17-18 it
could even drink legally oh you're so
sweet I like you already so you have
this cool DJ experience but I gotta tell
you something I'm not a DJ like no
matter what my best friend is and she's
great at it but I don't know the first
thing about it so would i be able to
pick this up this products for you and
for me yet you don't have to have any
skill any talent whatsoever DJ's really
fun it's more popular than ever think
about all the guys who make millions
like Skrillex and deadmau5 they're like
household names these days with easy DJ
pro with anyone like you or me can
actually pick someone a friday at your
retail store and you can actually DJ a
party that friday night ok so you guys
do this hardware platform anything else
yeah the hardware platform comes the
proprietary software that actually does
all the thinking and all the skill work
for you to get you started as a DJ we
have a free app to that comes with it
that way you can use all your music
collection from your itunes or your
google play account so you have to buy
any more music over the binding or
add-ons it actually works with
everything that you've already got so if
you love your music you can now mix it
in DJ it now is this just plug and play
right here you don't have to other than
getting that app you don't have to
install any kind of software nothing
like that since this is CES this is
actually more plug-and-play that our
actual device will be all you need to do
is plug our device into the 3.5
millimeter audio jack in any device no
30 pin connectors no USB it goes right
through your headphone jack and actually
then pumps out the great sound and makes
the app work with the product okay so
show me how this works real quick god
I'm have to do it one-handed but maybe I
can show you how easy it is to use
alright so we get our appt off of our of
our smart device in this case we got an
iPad go Ahead's fire up the app
and what we'll do is we'll drag couple
songs that we love right into the app in
this case we'll throw a little uh uh
sure in here I'm sorry little LMFAO
little party rock get started cool all
right then we go over to our other track
will pull up a because no one's heard
this song enough gangam style your
favorite score so now with the but the
item already does for us is it beat
matches the songs so you have a song
with a high tempo and another song with
low-tempo it'll automatically beat match
it for you you don't have to do it you
don't have to have that headphones on
there queuing and speeding up it'll do
it all for you that's awesome so I don't
have to like actually no beats really
well actly he'll do it for you that's
just like tuning a guitar you have to
have even beats to match two songs up
otherwise it sound like crap ours does
not it sounds great so I'll do is with
one touch of a button I'm gonna take a
sample of size voice what i canno
stutter it that is so cool one touch of
a button I could take another sample I
can EQ effect it kind of like a all
those like great daft punk songs oh dude
that's my favorite band so just
compressed it with an eq button right
there again I got one button one finger
there one there that's it I could take
another sample of his voice and now i
can play him over LMFAO so you had your
favorite singer sing it over a beat I've
noticed song entirely oh my gosh I'm
already in love with this so where can I
find this when can I get in on the
market and how much does this baby cost
so we ship it it'll be out in August
it'll be at all your favorite retailers
all your math stores like Target Walmart
toys r us even best buys and great
stores like that amazon com and how much
did you pay for this um shoot man i'd
probably pay like 350 or something 50 50
bucks are you kidding me fifty dollars
okay yeah I'm sold I'm getting one of
these I'm gonna learn how to be a DJ
watch out world watch out I'm gonna DJ
