Hostgator web hosting welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers and gurus in IT ninjas I'm your
host Shannon Morse
now way back on episode 4 of hack tip I
introduced a program called uni your
universal multi boot installer and I
demoed it inside a program called
VirtualBox I got a ton in ton of
questions about VirtualBox so I decided
to dive in and show you guys how to use
it
I've been a Windows fan girl ever since
I was a kid and my dad was building
computers in our living room but I've
been toying around a lot with off crack
and Puppy Linux being somewhat new to
the Linux operating system you may not
be ready to dual boot your PC or switch
over completely to a brand new OS so you
might just want to you know test out the
waters a little bit in a virtual machine
that runs inside your windows OS so
we'll be setting up our very own
VirtualBox machine but first it's time
for a few terms first off a virtual
machine a VM is a software
implementation of a machine in this case
a computer that executes a program like
a physical machine it can be used as an
operating system that you can open and
boot into on your normal computer so for
example I'm currently running on my
computer Windows 7 32 or 64-bit but in
VirtualBox I'm also running Linux
virtual machines inside VirtualBox a
program installed in Windows 7 using a
virtual machine means that I don't need
any kind of hardware I don't have to
build a second computer just for Linux
and I don't have to reboot my laptop
every time I want to dual boot into my
Linux operating system
all I have to do is open VirtualBox
choose my Linux virtual machine and
start up the OS VirtualBox is a handy
open-source program that you can install
on your host computer ie my Windows 7 64
bit machine that I have right here and
if you don't have a Windows machine this
can also run on well Windows Mac Linux
or an OS called Solaris inside
VirtualBox you can boot into a second
operating system whether that means you
boot into Linux while being logged into
Windows or you boot into a Mac while
still being logged in on a Linux machine
etc anything like that and it will run
as if it's just another application on
your regular operating system you can
run as many virtual operating systems
inside VirtualBox as you want the only
limit is your computer's disk space and
the memory all of these operating
systems that you can boot into are
called the VMS the virtual machines now
VirtualBox will interpret any kind of
operating system that you install as a
VM DK which is a virtual disk image the
image file is considered a hard drive by
VirtualBox which is why it can boot into
the operating system so let's go ahead
and get started with the program when
you first boot up you won't see any kind
of VMs listed because you haven't
created any over on the side what you're
going to have to do is click over here
on the new button up at the top from
here you're going to go through a setup
wizard and the first thing you're going
to have to choose is the name of your OS
mine is going to be bun two 32-bit and
this is going to be version 2 since I've
created one earlier Dion it OS type
you're going to choose your operating
system luckily it shows it for me it's
Linux and the version is Ubuntu next you
want to choose how much memory you want
to allocate I would suggest anything
higher than 512 megs I chose one gig for
mine which I'll increase right here
right there I chose one gig just because
I wanted to give it lots and lots of
memory next you're going to have to
create a new hard disk since I have
never actually created an Ubuntu on my
machine on a VM I'll need to create a
brand new hard hrus hard disk enabling
VirtualBox to see and use the operating
system I've downloaded as a dot ISO file
so I'll click on create new hard drive
hard disk
click next and then you get to a hard
disk storage type I recommend dynamic
data storage because it takes up less
space and it'll only increase or use up
more space as it's needed after that you
click Next and you choose the location
that you want to store your data in and
I named mine
Ubuntu 32-bit version 2 it's also going
to ask you how much space you want for
the data
I chose 8 gigs of allotted space after
this you'll see a summary of all of your
choices and you'll get to click finish
so I look through my choices scroll down
a little bit I'm happy with it so I'll
click finish and it gives me the summary
click finish one more time and now it
shows up now you're ready to start up
your new VM or the very first time and
I'll show you how right after this break
Hostgator can get your blog or website
up and running in minutes with plans
starting at just four ninety five per
month you get 24/7 support and access to
website building tools with over 4,000

wind energy for revision3 viewers
hostgator is offering 25% off your order
or your first month free just go to
hostgator.com and enter the code hak5
revision 3 at checkout alright so we set
up the new VM and VirtualBox and now we
get to find out if it all works
correctly hopefully it does so first
thing you need to do is click on your
new VM and choose start so mine is the
bun two 32-bit version too you can also
go to settings if you need to click on
start and it's going to show me this
first run wizard first you'll need to
select your installation media so you'll
click Next and you'll choose your dot
ISO file this is where it comes in handy
to already have it downloaded and you
can get to bun 2 if you were wondering
from 1to dot org I I believe it is click
Next and click finish
and hopefully it all works after you
chose your ISO file you click Next and
click finish if all goes well you'll see
a first time pop-up that says how your
mouse is going to be captured inside the
VM and you'll have to press a host key
to use it inside your host PC which for
me is my windows 7 box and the new
virtual machine operating system should
start up it looks like mine is working
after waiting a couple of minutes you'll
see the Ubuntu start to boot up on your
machine or whatever the OS is that you
chose so as you can see I'm running
Ubuntu on my Windows 7 laptop and it's
running just fine I automatically
connected to the Internet and I can
tinker to my heart's desire in addition
to being able to use VirtualBox like I
did previously you can also choose to
add a whole bunch of guest additions
these are add-ons that enable you to use
the mouse without the need for a host
key to capture it you can share folders
and files between the host PC and the
guest VM and it can give you better
video support and plenty of other
features I added a link to all of these
features in the show notes along with
all the steps for making your very first
virtual machine now stay tuned because
coming up on hack tip next week I'm
going to be demonstrating how to create
a VMDK out of a USB bootable flash drive
until then I want to hear your feedback
what programs or commands are giving you
the warm fuzzies hit me up tips at hack
5 org and be sure to check out our
sister show hack 5 for more great stuff
just like this I'll be there reminding
you to trust your Tecna list that
I can't talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
