you
so Darren's gone and that means our
production studios gone along with them
because we don't have this passwords and
I'm trying to think of an alternative to
like having to go out and buy something
like Final Cut or premiere and sticking
it onto some computer and working hard
with that and that's that's just way too
expensive so I just remembered that
there was someone told us about you
bought two studio on a hack five live
episode and so I want to check it out
downloaded the dish an iso burned it off
stuck in on this laptop here and let it
run the install which is pretty easy um
so the first thing I noticed was most of
the program's pre-installed on this
distribution have to do with audience so
that's for your kind of I guess podcasts
or people people who like to talk too
much but a sense I'm video guy I looked
in there only for some stop-motion some
kind of send paint which I guess is kind
of like after effects I didn't look too
much at it but the fur the two I noticed
were PTV video editor and keno I went
into keno it's it has the multi-tracks
it has some kind of higher level stuff
that I'm used to working with in Vegas
so but I wanted to focus more on getting
it done kind of cheap lean quickly so i
went into keno and this is pretty much
how it looks it's a lot of black in this
distribution and you can see that has
the main preview pane on the left side
it holds what you're importing what you
would capture off of your tape from your
camera and then put it up into what it's
like a storyboard the sequence in which
um all the clips are like in ordered so
the first thing I guess you show off is
the capture you you can capture stills
but who does that you just capture the
video puts it off as a DV file probably
wherever you want to save it but then
you can look at that DV file
in the timeline now I found this pretty
cool because it will show kind of a
bunch of still frames of the entire clip
and you can just kind of click on it and
we'll take you to a break at that spot
within the editing tab on the right and
so you can kind of like mess around with
it see what it looks a little bit
forward a little bit behind but if you
go down there you find that you only
want this one bit what you go to is trim
and you'd be able to kind of cut off the
front and back parts that you don't want
keep the good stuff and then insert it
back into the storyboard either at the
front or the back of the whole build so
after you like trim all your segments
together you'll go back into the editing
and you'll kind of be able to move
around the storyboard so that you can
get the cuts all lined up correctly and
you can see how long it is you can play
it back and forth that there's also an
FX tab it does so you're kind of basic
stuff like black and white and a
phase-in fades out you can flip it over
there's the P it a little bit if you
into or jerky jerky and blur and then
you get like a foreign supremacy video
and then of course your export which you
can pump out just your DB file or so you
can ring cut it into whatever or MPEG if
you just want to kind of stick it on
something real quick so that's pretty
much it within keno like I said pit TV
is pretty cool it's a little metal more
difficult to get into because it can be
kind of daunting to look at first but
definitely check out keeno in ubuntu
studio it's all one CD you install it on
anything and it works and i definitely
recommend it but let's see what i was
editing first and play that off for you
what's up Paul not much just rocking out
with my out you're doing what
rocking out with my out you
remember what happened last time you let
that thing loose didn't hurt anybody
dude yeah I'm talking about my oh
oh then I'm not digging the new guitar
it's like rubbing up on my arm with this
I don't know smooth plastic stuff it's
just kind of irritating dude it's the
new hotness you got to get used to yeah
i love the wireless but it was so much
more comfortable with this thing even
though it was wire cuz like really how
often are you like walking around the
room you know what we ought to do we
have two of these bad boys and we're not
going to be using one because who needs
three guitars right let's break one of
them open and shove it inside one of
these okay have you been drinking no not
see you'll have like 10 buttons you'll
be able to do the orange and the green
at the same time do like longer runs
okay with you pull that off you're no
longer guitar hero you my friend are
guitar god exactly where are we coming
in where is this we're coming in at like
yeah let's do this kick ahead cuz we
knew would like be instant an awesome so
all right so already we stripped apart
the guitar right and we looked at
everything inside and decided what had
to be cut out and then put into another
one right and the first thing was you
spend a good on the tracks that the
buttons go into essentially like they're
the guides for the button right so they
don't shift at a place while you're
wailing hard
and then we epoxy no be bands from a
guitar similar to this this was try
number one yeah it took some
experimenting don't cut first yes all we
want to go in first yeah always yeah
glue it before you start cutting use the
fret button positions once they're down
and in as a guide yeah they sacrifice
are exactly the best guides to use so
lesson learned alright so we've got the
10 buttons placed in here now epoxy it
in set up they they flow make sure you
clean out any loose epoxy that got into
the tracks way it's not on that it's
it's not like you know a really thick
it's actually really really thin yeah so
use it sparingly or prepare to clean up
yeah so here we have our salvaged and
slightly modified pickup connector that
the battle and I get about a call it i
don't know if i forget what the name of
it is we cut off the label oh here is 9
50 55 key provision 1.3 yeah motivation
yes so this is what actually picks up
the electrical signal when you hit the
bucket as these a little kind of diode
things that come out of the plastic
better i guess or metallic enough to
write register right exactly so this one
was from our torrent park the annular
the one that we decided to sacrifice
right this one is going to go on the top
position which is where the normal
buttons would go
um the one that is currently connected
to our the original buttons are the
original buttons which one did we
release all the one that you can see is
very nicely attached and very rainbow
ish yes now some of you are saying but
your other one is it connected we're in
get to that which is why it's so
clocking one yes and we had to clip the
top off of this just so it would fit in
like closely because there's like an
extra half inch but if you cut the top
off and get as close as possible that
way it should line up like just squeak
right in there so that's good right
there fall yep alright so now that
that's done we've got that those two in
place and lacing is going to be at the
shore fold this down carefully make sure
that you guys are watching out for where
the screw holes are at in the bottom
here and then Paul if you would do the
honors of putting on the back side of
this first go ahead
hopefully don't count up go all right
snaps together our suit intuitive screws
we got way too many screws now oh three
guitars later yeah we use one we're not
supposed to use sorry Bess I'll buy
another woman promise um yeah so we had
to also cut out to the screw mounts to
put in the extra row buttons but we
don't imagine to be any problem
hopefully Oh your imagination boy button
for the sake of moving on and of course
it being two o'clock in the morning Paul
what's next and now we get it you have
these extra wires attached because you
spent some time soldering right right on
to the main board that kind of registry
had originally planned and soldering one
board to another the backplane for the
keys however that's not going to work
because for whatever reason they have
five wires no they have eight wires for
ten connectors yeah which is dumb so it
being two o'clock in the morning and all
we decided we're just going to go ahead
and solder on directly to the board now
what we're going to do here is to save
you actually having to watch this is
you'll see little clips ya know Paul's
good at that we're going to go ahead and
solder we just soldered one two three
four five six seven eight because
there's eight connector wires and we've
marked from our bore that's up here
which one is one and which one is eight
yeah make sure you keep track of that
it's also labeled on the board I really
both on the pickup and the key side of
it right so from there we'll go ahead
and solder these all together
and then after that look at that Paul ah
it feels just a nice hell it's even
 quieter man oh yeah yep so here
you'll see Paul later on demonstrating
the ten button hak5 a guitar hero guitar
which is I think a first yeah I think
they have one you can buy but it's not
it's not the guitar man no it's not it's
not this is it's not the red octane
exploder 360 guitar with a good 10 the
Explorer thanks Florence letter I like
the exploder and you know what this this
does it adds a bit of bulk really just
you just like the wireless one it's
actually a little filament little
bulkier no I don't know why but that it
may be this tired yes exactly so alright
so you want to go ahead and start
soldering these up nuh uh huh alright
well next time we see you guys you'll be
watching Paul rock out with the 10
button guitar hero controller for the
xbox 360
did that was insane yeah I can't believe
we beat expert five stars you're crazy
with that new guitar it just all them
buttons it just flies right out of my
fingers now oh well what are we gonna do
watch TV TV sucks anymore yeah I don't
have anything on the Apple TV I got idea
what don't go anywhere I'll be right
back alright so I brought you guys up
here because i'm going to show Paul some
really sweet stuff I'm how to stream
media from your PC to the xbox 360
products called winamp remote it's
completely free you can download it
stand alone or with a new winamp 5.5
available at winamp calm we've already
got the application downloaded here so
we're going to run that and we're going
to select next I agree install it's
going to go through the install process
which as of right now it's finished now
it's going to ask us to create a
username and password the desired login
and click finish and that's it so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
go down here into the task tray where
it's installed a little icon we need to
go to remote media actually we can do it
right from here configuration right
click on it and select configuration
pretty easy and from here you'll see
we've got a media tab now what it's
doing is you can specify which folders
that you want win a promote to search so
we're going to add one here that I know
that we've got quite a bit of media in
and what it's going to do is it's going
to go through and it's going to scan
that folder so that we can then stream
it out to either our winamp player the
xbox 360 playstation 3 wii or via the
internet so what we're going to do is
we're going to go
open up our winamp I'm going to go to
our media library and we're going to go
to the remote media section of the media
library click on video and we're going
to enter our username and it's going to
launch the interface for all of our
media we're going to select video which
it already is and here we've actually
got what appears to be 162 different
items it's only going to show 1 through
50 in the bottom part of the window but
there's a next page previous page so
what we're going to do now is we're
going to go show you how to set up the
xbox 360 to talk nicely with winamp
remote so what I've done is I've already
set up the winamp remote software on my
pc which has all the media on it already
and what it's going to do is once we
actually set this up it's going to
transcode whatever media that we want
audio video it doesn't matter real time
and pipe it to the 360 so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you how to
set that up right now now if you guys
have never set up a computer or media
center on your xbox 360 yet painless
process we're going to go over here to
the media tab we're actually going to
select video and then we're going to go
down to computer because we're going to
connect to the computer upstairs now
it's going to ask us if we've ever
connected a PC to the 360 before even
though we haven't we're going to say yes
because we don't need to download their
software we're to do that now it's going
to search for all the computers on the
network that have compatible software to
stream to the 360 and there we are hak5
mat that's me we're going to select ok
and here we go this is the folder that I
set up while we were upstairs so we're
just like that go down to a folder here
and select it and click play now it's
going to do it's going to start
transcoding live upstairs and it's going
to pipe it down to the 360 here once
it's gotten enough of enough of a buffer
it's going to start playing it right
here on the 360 that's all there is to
it now you've got a way to share your
entire library of media audio or video
and play it right on your xbox 360
