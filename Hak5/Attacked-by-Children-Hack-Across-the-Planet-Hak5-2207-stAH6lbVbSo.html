really hope it are hilarious
something and it's off to Singapore for
the weekend and then after that down to
Sydney to c7 it just kind of ridiculous
I really wish that I could explain any
of this batch is Singapore it also means
that I'm now in Thailand I don't even
have a clue why I'm here what's going on
well you trip probably a lot yes
Indonesia Singapore oh oh wow
down v 0o water festival maybe if they
were new year
yeah yeah tomorrow isn't alone
tomorrow's near in fantastic water what
if I give water festival okay for Buddha
yet okay
give water that's pretty cool
it's one of those times words I'm done
it's 2:00 in the morning and I just
arrived and it's that situation where
you look at and you're all like what is
that even I don't know I'll wait for the
Sun to come up and find out where I am
oh look this whole time
there's Bangkok doing its little Bangkok
thing go find some trouble told not to
take these in Jakarta but I get here in
Bangkok is nothing to do
hey I'm good I'm good
now we should do that sooner than later
what do you say Monday what day is today
Wednesday right now look school Monday
oh yeah it's um it's Thai New Years
today hey sergeant interrupts attack
across the planet vlog currently
happening in Bangkok I had just a few
housekeeping notes to make and first is
that I am now six weeks into this trip
and it is about another eight or nine to
go as I travel through Southeast Asia
for some reason and I thought that
embarking on this trip it was going to
be really easy to collaborate with
Shannon and the folks back in California
but as it turns out being 14 hours ahead
if basically when I wake up people are
leaving the office and when I go to bed
they're just getting to the office I
miss I miss everybody back home I sort
of figured that doing these spots on
hak5 and I just ship them to Shannon
would be really easy but that didn't
really work out and then the blog style
kind of just naturally evolved from the
first week so that is Shannon that I
started doing this every other
back-and-forth thing and then that's not
really working out for her right now so
for the meantime I'm just going to
continue doing this because I'm really
enjoying it and we'll just naturally
evolve hack across the planet until I
get back to California and everything is
going to go back to normal number two
which means I was not expecting to do a
tech segment this week with all of the
other crazy things that I
I'm going on open that please which
means that I wasn't really expecting to
do anything but that's okay
so enjoy this kind of far out there up
the soda pack five that's act 5 for you
for now there's also so much other great
content hitting the channel between
threat wire and hack tip and tech things
so be sure to check those out which
brings me to number three Shannon just
did an awesome segment Star Trek bridge
crew VR for NVIDIA so way to go Shannon
I'm really jealous no spoilers but she
was wearing a red shirt from the
original series of Star Trek so cool
uniform number four
speaking of Shannon we are co-presenting
a talk at Australia's Gold Coast at the
end of May as they believe it's the 26th
if you're in the area you have to check
it out and come out to our meet up we'll
have details posted on hack across the
planet calm it's going to be so nice to
see Shannon on this side of the planet
which brings me to number five speaking
of meetups I'm having a little shindig

getting together at the Biergarten s CBD

o'clock or 20 hundred hours Zulu or

bash planning was just featured by
infoworld
and it was kind of cool I love the great
quote and the cute little bunny photo it
said that the bash bunny was a Wow from
every person the author showed it to and
that if you're having trouble convincing
management to protect against Hardware
threats do a little bash fighting demo
they're liable to change their tune in a
hurry love hearing those success stories
and number but that's too many that 7
there's too many announcements next week
got some big news so stay tuned for that
