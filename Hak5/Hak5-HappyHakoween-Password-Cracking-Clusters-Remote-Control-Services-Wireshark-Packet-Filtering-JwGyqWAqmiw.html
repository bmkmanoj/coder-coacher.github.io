five is brought to you by godaddy.com
netflix.com where space and and
balls with barbecue sauce
hello and welcome to hack 5 is time to
your weekly dose technology i'm darren
kitchen i met last night got a great
show for you guys today we're talking
about like services clusters packet
sniffing yeah chris curling's continuing
his three-part segment on packet
sniffing darren you've got big ol
clustering and all kind of goodies
yeah wolf even not quite i'm gonna be
showing you guys some service action as
always we've got the land party and
trivia segments coming up as well and
we're totally rockin the halloween stuff
and darren got off the candy so that was
good yeah we finally destroyed the 30
pound bucket of candy it's in the hall
it wasn't pretty
there are pictures they will never be
posted online take a look at snubz she's
still in a coma yeah yeah yeah anyway i
think it's time to go ahead and kick it
off so let's go ahead and just go ahead
and cut to you your pre-recorded
segments about services okay so you may
find yourself in ministering a server
and you wonder to yourself how can i
manage services easier or give somebody
access to manic services on my behalf
before there was really never a really
easy way to do it today i'm going to
show you how to create not only your
custom service your own custom services
but we're actually going to allow you to
control services via the web using two
utilities both of which were which are
free and of course we love free the
first utility is part of the windows
resource toolkit which you guys can
download it microsoft comm links in the
show notes as well part of a 20
application package the resource toolkit
will allow you to create your own custom
services now there's a couple manual
configuration things that need to happen
before your service actually becomes
active let me go ahead and show you that
right now what we're gonna do is that
we're actually going to create a custom
service now a lot of people think that
creating services is a big myth and
mystery and that it cannot be done it's
very easy once you download the toolkit
we're gonna go ahead and do is going to
go ahead and win windows box and when
you download the toolkit you're
going to find a new directory obviously
placed in your your system I browse the
Program Files we go ahead and browse to
the windows resource kits and tools and
here you'll see all the tools that the
the installer installed one of those
being inst serve i NST SRV exe that is
the key one that is the one that's
actually going to allow us to create a
service of our own wrap your head around
this for a second the command I'm going
to show you is not the service that we
actually want to create it's the
launcher service there's two components
to installing your own service there's
instance dirt inst serve and there's
also serve any SR VA and y dot exe these
two components will allow us to create
our own custom service however the
command I'm going to show you right now
is not the service that we actually want
to create so the two components
obviously being like I said before
instant serve as well as serve any now
what I've gone ahead and done for making
command easier to understand is we've
gone ahead and copied serve any to the
root of our C Drive basically the
command is as follows i n st sr v dot
exe or without the name of your custom
service and then wherever the serve any
SRV a NY program is at on the machine it
just so happens ours happens to be in
our C Drive once we go ahead and run
that the service was successfully added
and that's a good sign
now you can't just go to the services
control panel and start your service
because we haven't actually defined it
yet so what we need to do is we need to
open up reg edit registry editor for
Windows if you're not familiar with it
probably you want to be careful because
you could seriously Bourque your system
when you've actually run the installer
and created your own service what you
will see in the tree of hg local machine
system currentcontrolset services we're
actually going to find
custom service which is what we just
created via the command line now we can
actually set up our application inside
this registry key but first we need to
go ahead and add a entry to this so
we're gonna go ahead and do is click new
and it's gonna be a key we're gonna type
in parameters so I can actually get that
spelled correctly you just double check
to make sure that's correct
yep parameters and we're going to create
a new string being application now the
application string is was actually going
to launch our service so we've got it
down to here new your string value and
type in application simple as that we go
ahead and edit the application and we
can type anything we want my custom app
now when we go into the services MMC
what we should see is we should see our
custom application our custom service so
we type in custom well that's not in
custom service right here now we go to
the properties of this you'll see that
the path to the executable is SRV any
exe that's good that's as I mentioned in
the beginning the launcher application
that is going to actually launch your
custom application so like I said wrap
your head around the fact that we're not
actually launching our program from the
services command MMC we're actually
launching the launcher service which
will then launch our program confusing I
know don't worry it gets easier so what
now that we've actually created the
custom service let's show you how to
manage that service via the web
the basic reason that we went ahead and
we created or we needed to find a
solution so that our community members
can manage our game servers that's where
this whole process came about that's
where the entire need for custom service
management via the web and custom
services was created if you go into for
an example our CSS server here in the
parameter
you can see that we've got the
application string and I'm running on
reserve battery power because somebody
please throw me a brick max players 32
tick rate so on and so forth we now have
the ability to assign users so that they
can create their own custom services or
excuse me so that they can administer
our game servers for us community
project run by the community we also
have FTP ability for them but getting
back to the services they can start and
stop the service for the game server at
any time and the tool that we actually
use to do that is panel daemon now some
of you may know of fire daemon fire
daemon being the service control
software that allows you to create
automate whole kind of stuff with
services we don't need that we don't
need service automation we don't need
service monitoring if somebody detects
that the server is down they have the
ability to log in but fire daemon has
created a front-end for their
application which they released as open
source panel daemon panel daemon is a
really nice piece of software that
installs as an extension to iis or
apache and allows you to view a list of
the current running or stopped services
on the box the panel daemon is actually
installed in now remember iis or apache
are prerequisites for installing panel
daemon so if you're uncomfortable with
having web service on your box for
whatever reasons to find another
solution
personally we don't have a problem with
it because is an apache they're pretty
locked down nowadays so long as your
keep your box updated but here
the users can actually hack 5 CSS they
can see that if it's currently running
if it's not running and if they need to
they can actually issue restarts for the
application now I'm not going to get
into installing a basic application you
guys are obviously smart enough to do
that the prompts are very easy select
sport number select the virtual running
you know web application directory ours
just happens to be panel daemon but you
can name it anything that you
for you know security by obscurity sakes
file FileZilla FTP server is currently
running start mode local system auto you
know it all of this info is available
via the services M and C or via the
website we can stop all the services we
can start all the services and we can
also limit and I'll just go ahead and
I'll show you guys who we actually have
set up as administrators on our
installation these are your community
game server admins this infos all in
this in the wiki you already know this
but so here you've got people who have
access to only specific services so when
they log in to panel daemon these are
the only services they see and these are
the only services that they can control
now it's great for granule or granular
security permissions obviously we don't
want them having complete access to the
Machine and all the services running on
it not that you guys are gonna do
anything to it but it allows us to make
sure that we have complete control over
who has control of what we normally have
control over yeah it makes sense so
panel daemon and serve any and and serve
all the links for the information will
be in the show notes you guys can go to
hack 5 org or my website matt less calm
and now I think Shannon is going to rack
our brains with some trivia Jana alright
this week's trivia is what vintage super
computer was named after strings arrays
and its speed and floating-point
operations per second if you're the
first one to answer this right and your
choice of forum whether it's hack 5 or
revision 3 will send you not only
stickers but also a pro knobos OCD and
GoDaddy is our sponsor get reliable
secure web hosting without the long term
contract GoDaddy's hosting plans are

code with
a k1 and now we're gonna bring it over
to Chris and Darrin with packet sniffing
all right here we are with the third
installment of the packet sniffing
extravaganza if you will once again
Chris Grayling
showing us how to actually get our hands
dirty we understand the high level stuff
how to put our packets together the OSI
layers
hmm let's take a look at some packets
and actual traffic will go beyond the
building blocks there we go so we're
gonna focus mainly on the Wireshark
program in this in this segment because
this is just what we what I use in a low
wire so it's great so we're gonna go
into some of the higher level functions
not all of them but enough to kind of
get you you know a little bit more
dangerous
tell us about what this basically does
and we've kind of showed it before but
we didn't really show you exactly what
we're doing
um it will capture everything off of a
given network network interface
depending on what options and filters
and everything you give it so by default
it just gives you the firehose you just
get everything you get ARP requests you
get you know who has this IP address who
has this MAC address who you just get
everything HTTP UDP you no matter what
it is and then again this is great for
either debugging as a network
administrator or if you're man in the
middle you've got somebody flowing
through a piece of fruit that you have
access to and you're just watching
everything in between exactly we don't
we don't just want to see everything
there's their stuff that we're
interested in so you've come and you
would want to talk like there's what IRC
traffic yes in this example yeah we have
an IRC as an example so I have an IRC
client up right here I'm just gonna
minimize it really quick and we're gonna
go back and we're gonna go to our
interfaces here so this is just this
this we're gonna use this mugger
cellphone because it's what our IP
address is and I'm just gonna hit start
and now anything you do like you do you
brought up a web browser and refresh
yeah yeah if I did a hack five and just
refreshed we're just gonna get thousands
of again there's no one big hack five
back you see how see how small that
scrollbar thing is right now yeah that's
one hundred where is it it's a hundred
hundred ninety-six packets just to 96
packs just forget about it
great so now we're going to we're just
gonna stop that one and I'm gonna
restart okay
just so we don't have all that stuff
there sir and I'm gonna go into IRC here
and I'm gonna reconnect so I was just
connected to my team in Tyra see oh so
now that we're connected I'm gonna
actually I set up a dummy accounts is
not my password no so I'm gonna message
the NIC serve identify and that's that's
me that's blah
that's my gets more dump you traffic up
in there and then we're gonna yeah we
can do that we can message annex serve
help yeah helps a good one
and then I'll just do one of these
random commands I see at the end here
you can't really do camera okay alright
so now we go back here and we see a
really tiny scroll bar again okay so we
have a lot of IRC traffic so now we
wanna actually you want to like make
sense of disk surface with SSTP and
there's a whole bunch of just you try to
scroll down and read it and you just so
much thought overhead it's more than
just IRC like exact Asian so so we need
to filter this so now I'm gonna stop it
so I don't get any more of this in here
so we can actually work with it so we
have 164 packets you know I don't want
to really go through and read 164
individual packets I think I find what
I'm looking for so what we devised is uh
there's this something you can use
called capture filters and also just
real time filters in general display
filters display filters and so what we
have friends is the capture filter will
filter it out before before it displays
in the filter just takes what you
already have so you won't even get it if
you do a capture filter gotcha
alright so we are gonna do IRC request
that's the actual string it's just like
boolean strings okay and we're gonna do
contains Nick serve so this is gonna
tell us just everything that now the
request is everything that the client
has said everything as opposed to ice an
ounce mm-hmm so we can do both with the
server okay great
so if I did if I already knew maybe part
of somebody's password
yeah who's responsible we're just
looking for responses or even easily
like a conversation that they're having
with just two people we would do a
response from that person exactly okay
so now when I hit enter here we're down
to three packets
and of course IRC is so small that we
don't need to worry about them being
like past the MTU size and have to
fragment and be multiple yep
so what's our first packet so our first
pekus is actually the identify packet
and there's the password so okay so so
highlight this cuz want to be able to
see that on this there we go right there
at the bottom here oh cool
what an inventive not really
that's not my password don't try to use
it well actually go ahead try but uh so
so you know if you didn't know before
IRC if you're not using an encrypted you
know totally plain text everything is
just clear text so remember that when
you actually people that you have like
usernames on an IRC servers don't use
passwords that used for important things
do not use your banking password don't
you know create a password that's strong
but that's you know the conversation in
and of itself
exactly okay great so we were able to
filter just the next service Duff what
about highlighting and and and getting
okay so we can go in here and right
click on this one for example and we can
colorize this this little puppy right
here so we can just do like a new
coloring role or I can just go with a
default one I don't really feel like
creating a whole new and so now we made
so now it's kind of a different color
right and you can do this using rules
and you can actually go here and I'll
open it up so you can you can look at it
but this is where you can go through and
and I have this because we've we have it
narrowed down but let me just cancel out
of this and you can see they show the
one that we created here's the one that
we created down here IRC request
contains next serve and that's kind of
ugly I know but is watching everything
in IRC and you're just looking for nixar
of passwords you want to just sit back
watch the whole stream and when the lady
in the red dress comes by you wouldn't
totally identify her so you know blue
and red kind of ugly but at least gets
your attention go get your attention so
alright so that's colorized those are
filters what are the fun stuff going to
do with um we can do statistics there
are if you can see here you can do
statistics for just about any sort of
packet possible I mean it's just
multicast streams different things like
they have well VoIP if you were had VoIP
traffic sure boy
you could look at that one of the nice
little things that I like to do is a
pulp a summary right here and I'll
maximize that this just gives you a
general overview of what happened during
your conversation so we captured 164
packets you know we displayed three it
just tells you kind of how long just you
know just a really nice little quick
summary of what happened we get out of
that we can pull this up again and I
like to also pull up conversations
that's a nice one that I like to pull up
so if you're just watching a whole lot
of traffic people are multitasking they
got instant messengers going on they've
got web browsers going on but they've
got to say to session some of this lots
of different types of protocols going on
at the same time and we don't even know
what we're looking at it because when
you look at the firehose it's a mess so
you pull up this and you're like oh
here's what they're doing and then you
might find some engines you can see
there's a fiber channel I mean there's
everything it's you've got ipv6 down
here you mean you've got IP x you've got
token ring so any kind of you know it's
just filters it out for you so it's
really easy this just just nice charts
for management you know again a
beautiful tool kind of a lot of
information but what we really want to
do is narrow down the signal noise and
then see the good stuff exactly so
there's a there's a lot more powerful
things you can do I mean there's even a
firewall ACL rule part right here where
you can actually generate a Cisco IOS
rule based on that you know higher
segment man it is so you of course have
a write up on all of this and and how
will you find other resources for coming
up with your boolean strings and and
your rule sets here so you can make your
own expressions you can make your own
filters and and make sure you're just
seeing ladies and red dresses right
exactly all right Chris excellent stuff
as always Nick wait and let's kick it
over to Shannon and see what's going
with this week's land party I know
Halloween is coming up in a couple of
days and I don't know about you guys but
I'm super stoked coming from the family
I come from up here we have a wall paper
by DGP celebrating the Halloween thing
and if you want to add your own
community wallpaper to our forums go to
the community image
and also I wanted to tell you guys about
our land party coming up this Saturday
November 1st you go to game dot hak5 org
from the comfort of your own home you
don't have to be in Virginia guys you
don't have to it's ok
join us up there play the game own up
some noobs with me probably because I
own if you don't really feel like
playing in the game go to hack 5 org and
check us out on the set camp but for now
we're gonna toss it over to the guys to
talk about Squarespace
that's right Squarespace is sponsoring
the hack 5 land party and we're excited
to be working with them it turns out
their bands of hack 5 been watching
since the infamous one EXO 3 yep yeah
and they've been awesome to us and and
I've been checking out the software a
lot of fun to use it's like a desktop
application but it's totally in your
browser blurs the line there a little
bit between web and desktop
yeah Squarespace I mean if you guys are
looking to create any kind of website or
blog or list or anything of that sort
Squarespace you need to check out not
only do they have great publishing tools
in my opinion their tools and analytics
rival Google or you know your web trends
or anything like that
if you've used something in the past
that's like a online publishing tool
like I don't Google pages for example
you're getting the wrong idea of what
publishing systems can really be like on
the web I mean speaking of versatile the
people over at Squarespace the
developers who obviously we've talked to
if if you guys are you know trying out
Squarespace and you find that there's
something that you don't like or you
think should be added send us an email
so that we can talk to them because they
are super motivated in adding anything
and everything that they can possibly
add I know Kevin and Sarah from
revision3 both had requests that were
implemented in less than a week for
their personal websites what he's trying
to say is that Squarespace is basically
at least four times cooler than mat last
knock and we do check it out in fact one
of our very own Joe eagle has even
checked out Squarespace and put together
a page about the hack 5 Halloween land
party yep that's right we were putting
together kind of a fun Halloween land
contest thing and that is all you need
to do is on Halloween once you're done
trick
reading or maybe too old for that kind
of stuff head over to game die hack five
dot org UT that five dot org of your
into the Unreal Tournament 99 the old
classics we're gonna also be playing
counter-strike so CES hack 5 org and
battle and that peddle food I'm sorry uh
Team Fortress Team Fortress 2 so that's
tf2 hack 5 org we're gonna be having so
much fun game I'm kind of like a little
bit on the fence as to what game I
should be playing I think I'm gonna be
in the UT 99 server but I'll probably
also trade off with the Team Fortress 2
I'm probably gonna be destroying the
battlefield 2 server CSS really isn't my
game but in addition if you guys have a
suggestion for a land party please hit
us up feedback at hack five-door hatch
or you can go to squarespace.com and
sign up for a free trial and we want you
guys to create the new hack 5 land party
website go to squarespace.com sign up
for your free trial and in addition
you'll see the power and the you know
capability that Squarespace really
offers and you get a feel for and you
know if you feel like you guys need to
use it like there and said WordPress is
great but having somebody ensure that
your site is up a hundred percent of the
time is far better than you know a dog
and well I mean I had no idea about
square so when they were first precious
it was like it was this stuff and it
just watched the video on the home page
and like BAM instantly like within a few
seconds totally rocked it and of course
hack 5 Halloween doc Squarespace comets
where you can find Joe Eagles page where
you put up all the details about our
event this Halloween and we hope you
guys will join us so anyway at this
point we're gonna go ahead and talk
about clustering so I'm gonna head over
to that sit magically and talk with
snubz about all the fun happy stuff you
can do with clusters so darren has all
this hardware all over the set he's
taken over the computers on the network
what the hell are you doing well all the
computers are simpler evil server
because we don't got yeah we want to get
him on the same network as us but yeah I
wanted to use these to illustrate
parallel computing or in particular
what's that cluster computing uh it's
when you take lots of different hardware
and you use it to spread the load of
single instructions or tasks so lots of
hands make for light work
so when you say hardware are you just
talking about one computer and a bunch
of processes or are you talking about
multiple computers well in this instance
I want to talk about cluster computing
where we use lots of individual
computers each with their own operating
system that all kind of converge and
work on the same problem at the same
time if we work on something
simultaneously in parallel we can do it
a lot faster so you can take like my
computer and Paul's upstairs and your
computer yeah that's what we've done
here is I go to working bees exactly a
lots of little worker bees I've got a
via base system here I've got an Intel
based system there and then upstairs we
have an AMD based system and we're gonna
put those all together and use all of
their resources
hopefully efficiently with a cluster but
I also wanted to kind of touch on some
of the other types of parallel computing
systems there are
well there's massively parallel
processing which is what you would see
in things like like the earth simulator
like supercomputers oh yeah okay well
the difference there is that all of the
components kind of come together in a
single machine rather than like in our
cluster where they all actually have
their own resources that they have got
to manage their own it sounds a little
bit expensive yeah this isn't something
that you that's not something you're
gonna do on a hacker budget and then of
course there's grid computing which is
kind of cool what's that well are you
familiar with folding at home oh yeah
that's grid computing yeah has their own
team on that yes hak5 has a has a
folding at home team and you can donate
your processing power when your computer
is idle it pops up a little screensaver
and starts using it to like fold
proteins and fund a cure for cancer or
something like that and the difference
there is that it's very loosely
organized it's like only your your
system resources only join the grid when
they're available you know when you're
not playing counter-strike you wouldn't
loss maybe folding in the background and
they're geographically dispersed so
that's the difference between grid
computing there whereas a cluster would
be kind of like in our house all the
Nets
yeah so we're not we're not carrying any
cancer today are we no what I want to do
is I want to build a Beowulf cluster
that sounds very it's it's actually
named by the epic Pole yeah the epic
poem
it was actually the term kind of came
about 1994 when NASA built a system
that's actually called the Beowulf
cluster but then it kind of became just
a general bit on slash dot exactly
there's a slash shot mean like imagine a
Beowulf cluster this landshark you know
or whatever but it's become a generic
term for just any cheap hardware that
you can kind of throw together and build
a cluster out of so that's what we're
gonna be doing today and I've got some
examples yes so show me what's going on
on this computer okay let me show you
the example then I'll go into some of
the the systems that use it so what I've
got here
booted up is an instance of cluster
Knoppix now cluster knoppix is an open
masak space system and I should probably
qualify that if please do sir ma six is
a management system for providing SSI
which is single system image and it also
allows for simple process migration so
first I gotta explain single system
image all of this hardware this this via
system here that P for the AMD upstairs
all have to run the same at the same
image here in this case its cluster
Knoppix could be a lot there's lots of
other different Linux distributions that
do this in this case we're just using
clustering optics and that's the SSI
that's the single system image and open
ma six provides both that and the
process migration and that's really
where this parallel computing kind of
comes into play is that we've got we
want to take something and split it up
into as many processes as possible so we
can distribute the load I'll take a
process you can take a process mat can
take process we give a process to Paul
and then all four of us get break out
the Lego bricks and build a giant castle
nice done faster well you know hopefully
four times faster than it would be if we
were all do it individually great yeah
of course that it's not always exactly
four times
you know you would think okay so free
the example of like password cracking
right if I could crack say a five to
five character password like we'll just
say a Windows ntlm hash and in like four
minutes with one computer you think that
I would be able to do it in two min two
minutes for two computers one minute for
what three computer four computers yeah
every time we double we would get double
the efficiency that's not exactly right
there's there's a sinkhole at endles law
which talks about the way that the
program is designed and the efficiency
that that's there and it really talks
about the bottlenecks of the design of
the program and it's a way for you to
kind of estimate or gauge what what kind
of of efficiencies you should expect for
different programs when you actually do
a multi processor or a parallel
computing scenario so are you saying
that since we have different kinds of
computers different kinds of CPUs we
won't get as much efficiency as we would
if we had three right the exact same
computers there's a lot more involved
with it than just CPU while these are
all three different systems running at
different they have different
architectures because they're made by
different companies they're running at
different speeds we've got different
outs of RAM
now the OS is exactly that's the SSI
again the single system image they're
all running Knoppix Linux right not
picks the clustering optics right now so
that's so at least the operating system
is all the same but they're their
hardware differs vastly and even you
know but they're all just kind of tied
together in a single network in this
instance the network is kind of a
bottleneck because it's on a 100 megabit
network rather than the gigabit and
that's just because a limitation of what
we have here on the set we've got
something bigger in the closet and feel
like bringing it out but oh yeah so so
that's that's a difference there of
course it would run a lot more
efficiently if we had all the same
hardware but so that that's a factor
into it's also a factor into the way
that the whatever it is that we're doing
in multiple processes is is written so
that's Andals what law okay so I guess
I'll go ahead and show you an example
here in cluster Knoppix and what I have
loaded up here is the open
mastix viewer open mas6 is a open source
alternative to ma 6 like i just
explained the management system does the
SSI in the process migration and what
I'm gonna load up and you can see right
in here we've got three different
machines and we've got peas there's our
eye peas we can see their overall load
we can see their memory usage here
how many CPUs exactly we have four CPUs
in this instance over three computers
because one of them the aim is a dual
core so that's that would be me yeah
awesome okay except for Paul's octo he's
got eight cores oh my god I know
seriously so just show an example and
there's many different reasons why you
would want to do this be it folding at
home rendering video oh god that's the
one hour I wanna do yeah rendering HD
video takes about seven times longer
than standard long so yeah it's become a
little limitation um
the benchmark danger is gonna show here
as an example is password cracking okay
it's fun yeah so let me go ahead and
show you what I've got here passed in
cat passwd and you can see I've got a
couple of hashes here and these are just
ntlm hashes yeah from Windows I just go
ahead I just went ahead and used the
switchblade to pull these off of one of
my machines nice with some BS password
so nothing in here sensitive or anything
but but I'll go ahead and Shea here I've
got my user account aardwolf I got my
hash here and I'm gonna go ahead and run
this against a password cracker and I'm
just gonna do a brute force attack I'm
not using and it precomputed anything
but what password cracker are you using
I'm using this one called I'm gonna
totally mess up the name here it's
called Susilo Cecilia Cecilia sorry and
the you could use something like John
the Ripper
but this Cecilia makes it really easy to
split up the job into multiple processes
and then through process migration with
the open ma 6/3 all the processes are
gonna split up and you'll see here I'm
just gonna go ahead and run it so you
can see what happens then in the viewer
so I'm gonna go to s RC go okay so I'm
going to run this command here it's gone
set to log test file and this part right
here where I do the attack n4 that's how
many processes I'm going to spawn and
this of course pastor BD is the file
that I got from PWM 4ft dump so I'm
gonna split this up into four processes
because again down here I actually have
four CPUs to use because they've got
three computers and once a dual-core so
go ahead and run that and down here you
can see Oh so this machine's at 91%
because it's doing all of it at once and
then all of a sudden it's like wait a
second nice and that's where the process
migrations that and exactly it just says
hey guys we a lot of crap to do here and
everybody just kind of pitches in hope
if hopefully he was would all get to
100% if I was on a much faster network
of course
so some bottlenecks in here but that's
why I want to build something where
everything is the same hardware and on a
on a very fast networking yeah okay so
here we go it's already done and you can
see here's user aardwolf passwords beefy
real simple until well so as I think I
should change it I mean that's not
really my password yeah I used three
character passwords way more secure
three characters boy it's good yeah it's
got a dollar sign in it okay that's the
third character is that the one with
those no so some of the so I touched on
open ma six but there's there's another
way to do it and that's MPI that's a
that's a message passing interface it's
an API that your programs can be written
for this there's open libraries for this
in in Python and C Java different
languages can use this to to basically
speak to all the other computers and
network and kind of figure out their own
queuing of how they're going to manage
this workload and it's it's um it's an
interesting API it's not really based on
a standard if you will it's become a
standard in the sense that it's kind of
a de-facto standard but there's no like
it's not like a to 2.11 it's not like I
Triple E there's no standards body
behind it never it's a specification so
as such just like SQL you've got
different flavors of it so Microsoft has
a cluster for Windows Server and
there's lots of Linux variations that'll
do this so we're actually going to be
using pelican Linux later to use this
technology to make our own hack five
clusters very cool yeah
and then it sets up the SSI and all that
fun stuff um so yeah I guess that's
something we should probably talk about
the the hack 5 Beowulf cluster
definitely it's something that we are
really looking for your input on because
it's gonna be a ongoing project here
that we just want to start and and build
our own Beowulf cluster based on well
can I kick some ideas around with you
guys but we're looking for your feedback
on what kind of operating system right
now we're looking at Pelican HPC and
we're looking at something like Intel
dual core ish and we'll have some specs
up in my show nets but basically we want
to start a dialogue on that because this
is something that we can build and then
do some segments on talking about the
software the different hardware of
building this and I'm sure we can
totally build it like you know oh it
doesn't have you even have to be in a
case it could be amazing nikka Dell
Legos or something fun yeah making it
out of a wooden box it doesn't matter
totally so do you have anything else
that you want to show us what this no I
just really wanted to give this
demonstration and talk about some of the
underlying technologies as business is
one of these projects I didn't make her
own yeah
the hylians project I want to touch on
some more because there's like so many
different ways to do this and I'm really
interested in hearing from the audience
like how they think we should build this
and we'll put it together and talk about
the hardware and software and everything
and took some good rather than just
cracking passwords because that's kind
of past today I mean we can do that and
put rainbow tables precomputed without
and yeah but this is gonna well this is
cool though you could use this to
generate rainbow tables you could use it
to just unfolding at home you could do
video rendering is one of the things I
want to do with it what's the difference
between this one and rainbow tables well
with rainbow tables and we've talked
about rainbow tables in the past and
like the second and third season but
real quick the basic idea is is a time
memory trade-off so in the sense that
this took what 2 minutes to crack that 5
character password right that was the
time versus rainbow tables is the memory
where I need 200 gigs
however many gigs to hold a gigantic
lookup table between the hashes and what
they equal yeah totally I'll have links
into the show notes in the season 2 &amp;amp; 3
stuff that we did on that real simple
stuff but of course I should note that
this is good for salted stuff so you
could use a password cracker that can
actually handle that and and distribute
the load if you've got tons of computers
just laying around your house you know
definitely try this out there's not
picks cluster Knoppix is kind of it's
the projects has kind of dropped in fact
so is open mas6 and that's why I'm
looking at Pelican but there's also some
other really cool distros this one
called chaos in particular that's worth
noting because it's one of these
university projects that was created
about around the whole idea of I believe
ma 6 and what it does it's it's a six
megabyte distribution which is perfect
if you've got one of these guys Oh God
and well no there's a six gig I'm sorry
there's a six Meg CDF s partition on
here which you could flash it to and
then it runs in memory so you could go
to the computer lab pop it in a computer
boot off of it and chaos would boot up
and then you do it on all the machines
and what happens is it kind of ad hoc
not in like this is kind of like a
hub-and-spoke model thing where it would
just kind of ad hoc develop a develop
link speak to each other in IPSec so
it's got encrypted links between each
other and that's the kind of the cool
part is once you've got that with
encrypted links then you could
technically use it on semi trusted
networks like universities Network I
mean I'm not advising you to do anything
illegal here but you know if you've got
a giant corporate network this time
really doing anything at night you could
use these things to harness that kind of
computing power for for good for evil
mostly good so you're obviously gonna
show us how to do all this on your blog
yeah I've got links to lots of different
arcs I mean I know we've run long here
but it's a lot of info and there's a lot
of changes that I find really
fascinating so I'm looking forward to
hearing what you guys think of this and
then of course
together the hak5 bell cluster oh yeah
gosh that's so exciting well thank you
very much Darren very very much and now
we're gonna take a break
see ya
so that just about wraps up this episode
but before we get going I want to let
you know you have to tune into next
week's episode because we've just come
back from Freaknik I have a fun episode
for you guys to check out so next
Wednesday noon Eastern check it out it's
gonna rule the other thing we're gonna
let you guys know about is these
stickers which are still for sale you
guys may have noticed that we've gone to
a little bit higher resolution SD the
most beautiful standard-def you have
ever seen mind you on the internet
that's cuz that's how we roll
but however we are not capable of
releasing HD because we can't edit the
HD footage yet turns out it's really
high bitrate and our machines are just
kind of choking like a euphemism that I
can't use on this show now if we had a
Beowulf cluster of Awesomeness yeah that
would be easier instead if we had
knocked oh and octo Mac Pro yeah so
that's what we're currently striving for
now people may think hey what the hell
III thought this was it no we need this
last component and it trust me it's much
cheaper than the $15,000 mixer plus a
Mac Pro we are currently this close yeah
we're borrowing fooling pause and we're
trying to hook it up with a little bit
more RAM but we're gonna need are in
that pro and until then I mean you guys
can check out hack 5 org slash stickers
remember yes yeah definitely and you
guys have independently got us to you
know this beautiful SD so I want to
thank everybody out there in in hak5
land for hooking us up and stickers are
still available we love your support
we've got more on their way more
different designs on bunch of fun stuff
and look forward to yeah definitely with
the quickness indeed okay so I'd also
like to remind you guys that Netflix is
sponsoring this episode of hack 5 and
Netflix not only is awesome but they
also have over 90,000 titles including
lots of blu-ray titles and with free
shipping both ways you can get your
movies on let me tell you 40 shipping
centers almost same-day delivery or a

plans just start at $4.99 so check them
out you can get a free no risk trial
over at wwf/e important WWE Netflix
calm / hak5 and again remember the www
because somebody can't figure out h TTX
s but regardless i've been using the
roku netflix box for like the last yeah
i'm knowing the crap out of the rest of
the the hack house people's because i
just been watching a lot of
documentaries about stealth fighters and
let's just say the ex35 is awesome and
poor bowing on the Joint Strike Fighter
but still very cool documentaries I'll
have a list of my favorite stuff over at
Daren kitchenette and willing to think
Netflix for sponsoring this episode of
hammer also need to let you guys know
about I fanboy which is currently on the
revision3 Network Wednesdays at 3 p.m.
Eastern if you're a complete calm ik
book nerd geek you know and you you you
just love comic books then this is the
show for you I didn't think communist I
mean this not so much for the communist
action but yeah but comic books you guys
can go to revision3.com /i fanboy and
remember that you check out their new
episode with Brian Bendis writer of The
Avengers and Superman spider-man comics
excuse me for Marvel Comics and you can
watch again I fanboy every Wednesday at
noon eastern on revision three.com yes
yeah that Touche and for Darrin and
myself we are reminding you too
just go real see you next week
hello and welcome to a hack five this is
one second Rin I had me fart I'm gonna
can't be the only blooper boy I can't be
your blooper boy Darren hey next episode
we will be airing all the fun happy
stuff that we've been doing at Freaknik
of course we don't know any of that
stuff right now because before it Bob
okay
and we agreed we would never do that
yeah we did agree that all right spin up
our FTL cuz we're about to lose hello
and welcome to hack five is time for you
to play more one more one more
do it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
