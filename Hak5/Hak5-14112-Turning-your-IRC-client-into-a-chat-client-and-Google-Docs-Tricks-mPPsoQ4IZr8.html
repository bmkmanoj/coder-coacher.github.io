by domain.com IRC is not only for your
three year old version of you anymore
and also not for your hack 5 IRC walls
but now you can use IRC to you do chats
like in AOL MSN what do you have it of
course you can use IRC perch at its
entrance of course but you can also use
it for like your AOL Instant Messenger
and MSN instant messenger because we all
use that right can I use it for my 5
digit I CQ OPA shell all right cool well
actually you know why I'm using this I'm
using this program for Twitter because I
turned my Twitter account into a big fat
chat room dude that is so cool
so you're tying in modern-day mind a web
tool oh yeah we were just reading that
turns out IRC is from 1988 88 Tim
berners-lee and HTTP I feel so old now
believe it I love that it's still around
and look it's still Lively
so so how do we get our get Twitter see
buying these two you need to use a
program such as Biddle beat now there's
a couple of other ones out there that
you can use Biddle B is the one that I
decided on but you know email me
whichever ones you like feedback at hack
5 org and I'll check them all out I mean
see why not but if you go over to Biddle
beat org you can download it straight
from there this is for Linux and for
your IRC clients and it can work with X
chat with whatever IRC clients you're
using it doesn't really matter which one
you can also apt-get install it if
you're using Ubuntu so Darren what are
you using on here I'm actually in Debian
so ok yeah ok cool I'm going to see if I
can follow along yes so see if you can
apt-get install it and then once you do
that see I have my Twitter running over
here so I can make sure that I see
what's going on up to date once you do
that you just open up your chat your ex
chat or whatever you have and you choose
one of the servers it doesn't matter
which one so I just go into the Ubuntu
server or you can go into the sec foe I
or c14
the hack 5-channel sure and down here
you type in server localhost okay so you
were just trying to get out of the
pop-up that exigent typically does you
can actually just disable that in the
settings you don't have to first join
sir yeah I need to do that regardless
well I just joined the server and I
typed in slash server localhost and this
the reason for that is because it'll be
is installed on your machine and it is
running as a server on your physical
physical laptop so but I just installed
mine on a virtual private server in the
cloud because my boon to VM was acting
up VM then you should be able to connect
it to it the same way right but I
actually put it up in the cloud so I can
get to it the same way I just need to
hit it by the IP address in this case
okay yeah yeah that should work then so
the local host of course is my own
machine once you get in there it's going
to ask you to either identify yourself
or to create a new account if you
haven't already created one now creating
it in a new a new account is really
really easy and when you say creating an
account what do you mean by that what is
basically just so that you have not only
your screen name but it's really easy to
log in to all of your different chat
clients every time that you boot it up
okay so you're like integrating in the
other services when you create accounts
yeah so there's a bunch of different
commands that you need to basically
follow along with when you first install
it and the easiest way to do it is to
type the help come in once you're in the
bittle be root Channel I just did it you
got it well I totally just installed it
on a virtual private server and it
already sweet okay cool so type help in
the root bit will be channel okay I did
and I got like Quick Start commands away
Smiley's so it's going to give you a
whole bunch of different commands that
you can basically read through on your
own time but the really important one
here is to type help quick start when
you do this it's going to tell you how
to start your own yours user name and
register and create your password and
whatnot now when you type in your
password here it's going to give you it
back in plain text but you also have the
option to use I
I guess you would call it encryption to
type it in without a being seen and
coming back to you physically on your
computer okay so for myself I just did
an example one and you're also you're
doing it on localhost yeah I wouldn't
shut up like SSL or SS al or or SAS else
are its SAS how we can get into that
later but since you're doing a local
it's you don't really need to worry
about a man-in-the-middle as much now I
really never going outside of your like
this like on an open network even if you
are on an open network and somebody's
sniffing whatever's going on then you
should definitely use the IRC protocols
yeah actually to this VPS I go through
tour to get to it anyway so good yay
okay
so once you get on and you've registered
you can if you ever close out of it just
type in identify and the password that
you chose for mine i typed in I doubt a
identify starbuck okay that's like the
worst password ever yeah it's like lame
for example okay deal and then you can
sign on to all your different accounts
now to do this I'm gonna type help quick
start to maybe oh I switched over to
Twitter my bad help quick start - and
this is going to show you how to add all
of your accounts so it's very simple I
love how easy they make it you just type
in account add so if I'm going to add
say I don't know MSN or something for
example I would type in account add the
protocol and the protocol will be MSN
and then your name so my username would
be you know some Z at hotmail comm with
your password so if my password was
Starbuck I just type it in Starbuck
account add MSN MZ at hotmail calm
Starbuck and it'll authenticate
automatically for you and once you do
that just type in account on and it'll
log you into every account that you have
set up so how does it show up in your
iris because you know I'm used to using
like multiple you know use
a bouncer to maintain a connection to
multiple different servers I see this
building is just your own IRC server so
in this case I would have also connect
to local O's or my VPS so I can show you
my example for Twitter since I already
have that one set up yeah I just notice
your tweet Paul you want to check this
is an awesome tweet by Shannon help
quick start - that's wonderful tweet
thanks guys
so I'm in my little B Channel right now
but if I wanted to go ahead and log on
to my Twitter account it automatically
sets up a different channel for Twitter
so my entire Twitter feed of everybody
that I follow in anything that is at
replied to me will show up in this feed
so up here I have a whole bunch of
@reply oh so they just show up is red
because they're at you yes exactly so
they show up just like they would in
regular IRC when somebody just types in
like snugs well depending on your notify
settings but the default x chat notify
settings totally in red that's awesome
and of course you can customize it if
you want to you can change it just like
you can in IRC as well they also have a
whole bunch of different add-ons like
you can um you can add and delete your
friends you can choose to follow more
people through msn through Biddle be if
that makes any sense sure sure you can
like add people okay yeah so and what
other protocols because I knew yeah
there's a wall MSN I believe aol's on
there there's a jabber as well and
Twitter so you can use gtalk with it
that's what I use all the time so that's
that I'm on here and I'm like hey
Shannon what's up so you're in your
gtalk yep okay ah so if you look at mine
it shows up down here as a different
channel it's a basically a p.m. no like
a private message so over there on the
left so I click on that and it shows me
hey Shannon what's up and it gives me
your email address at the top aardwolf
at gmail.com so I can type down here hey
dude nice computer nice so it's gonna
tell me that you're away because your
your notification on gtalk is away but
you should still receive my reply in
both Gmail and Biddle B that's awesome
not about I won't be able to start a
video chat no no video chats and IRC or
fortunately if you do have two-factor
authentication you got to set up your
whatever it's common time password yeah
application and application specific
password yeah application specific
password I'm sure that's the same with
any other thing that uses two factor as
well just set up the app specific one
and you're good to go and it logs on
just fine I love how this can tie into
we did a segment Wow
a year ago now on setting up znc it's an
IRC bouncer that allows you to always
remember that yeah so you can maintain a
persistent connection to all of your IRC
channels if you coupled this super easy
this is the beauty of that like hak5 and
some of the stuff we talked about you if
you couple bittle be which is running on
port what six six six nine as a regular
IRC server as well as znc
as your bouncer as well as ssh
forwarders so you came through like a
dynamic ssh proxy that's then it
maintains your security through that and
then suddenly you could be in all of
your IRC channels and your Twitter and
your XMPP or your Yahoo that's so cool I
love it
yeah yeah it's so easy to use let's see
I got a nat reply on Twitter so here's
somebody Anthony Lawler said Quick Start
to technical support how can I help you
today
so everything shows up right there for
me I never have to go back to the
internet so I can just stick around and
IRC all day that is so cool I wonder how
it truncates after 140 characters with
without ever if it uses one of those
like you wanna find out services yeah go
ahead let's find out yeah the quick
brown fox jumped over me blue
effing
seriously best tweet ever I just
don't know we're recording hack five
okay that's uh so it tells you over in
your route bittle B it says Twitter
error maximum message length exceeded
145 is greater than 140 that is awesome
funny 145 is greater than one for like
your away messages on here oh my god I'm
just thinking about the amazing egg-drop
bots that you could now combine to
Twitter this no seriously I once wrote a
oh I wanted to show this on hack five
and they changed it like the next week
using there used to be an awesome PHP
library to interface with Twitter over
XMPP it used to be that Twitter spoke
XMPP the same language that jabber
speaks that Google Talk speaks and using
an awesome PHP library you were able to
I was working on a a dungeon dragon game
over Twitter where you'd be able to
attack your friend I did the whole thing
in PHP with this XMPP thing for I can
probably resurrect that code and now
just spit it out to IRC instead of this
is crazy wicked okay yeah I love it
suddenly I want to hear what everybody
is thinking as far as the kind of
integration they can do with this now
yeah me too I definitely want to hear
what other people have done with boo
because I mean this is just the
beginning there's so many more commands
that you can learn for this program yeah
I really like it I think it's so easy to
use it's really easy to set up there's
no really really amazing how to's online
so I hope this was a good how-to for you
guys yeah and if and if you have some
more ideas of how it could integrate it
with more things hit us up a feedback AK
5 we'll leave a comment we're gonna take
a quick break but when we get back I
hear that is trivia in Technologist I'm
it is just what I hear tastes delicious
so here's a fun little piece of trivia
about the internet that we all know and
love
of course it coming out of a Department
of Defense project but did you know that
an RFC in 1984 proposed the very first
five top-level domains gov edu Tom mil
and org were on that list what wasn't
was dotnet but when those first five
came to fruition so did dotnet so it's
no wonder why it's so globally
understood and known and instantly adds
credibility to your next project I know
that I got one when I got Darren
catching calm and hack across America
calm and so if you already have a
dot-com protect your investment go ahead
and get yourself a dotnet or if you're
considering a new domain and the dot-com
has taken a dotnet is a perfect
alternative and when you're thinking
about that dotnet that you want to go
ahead and get you want to get it at
domain.com
