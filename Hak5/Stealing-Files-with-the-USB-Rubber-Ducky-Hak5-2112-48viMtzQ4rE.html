USB rubber ducky this time on hack five
hello and welcome to hack 5 my name is
Darren kitchen my name is Jenna Morse
you do weekly dose of technological
commedy I'm wearing my powerful women
t-shirt this is a powerful women
powerful women love them all week man
yes all week with the power there we go
but we are recording this the day after
the u.s. elections I'll see you in the
car the today we're talking all about
the USB rubber ducky so this is an
excellent tool for quickly in silently
exfiltrating documents did you know that
you can actually exfiltrate documents no
what I like to call that what is that
we're forming an involuntary backup oh
my gosh that's screwed up involuntary
back oh there's it yeah hey hey two is
one one is not not it's true so we're
going to be breaking up this episode
into three the three biggest challenges
of doing this kind of exfiltration
technique so first off you have silently
executing a script off of the USB Drive
and then you have exfiltrating targeted
documents off of the target computer and
then number three is combining the USB
rubber Ducky's hid attack with mass
storage so we're not only using it as
like the human interface keyboard but
we're also using it for mass storage oh
yes and they're gonna wrap the whole
thing we're gonna wrap it up with a nice
ducky script so at the end of this what
you're going to have is a drive that you
can just plug into a box and have it
copy all the files over yeah it will be
fantastic ah - today we are looking at a
part one yes because it is quite long so
in part one we're going to be executing
scripts off the USB drives automatically
so we will begin by taking on the
biggest challenge on Windows which is
surprise surprise it's kind of weird but
you need to figure out what the letter
is of the USB Drive because with
different Windows devices you get
different Drive letters see this is
where like if you remember the 90s high
the nineties I'm not old I'm old in
internet years because I've been around
since BBS's but the CD ROMs with your
printer drivers used to
on them they would be written on a mood
say click start click run and type D
colon backslash
setup.exe and then it would say where D
is the letter of your drive right and
then that's where all the consumers are
like what is that mean what what's the
drive letter of my cup holder right
that's Illyrian yeah and so i can't
believe that here it is like two decades
later and we're still dealing with this
surprising i can't believe it's been
around for so long well i guess actually
you know what it's not that much better
in linux you know slash dev slash SD a
SD b oh man with some of these like MMC
block devices it gets ridiculous so we
can currently do this through the
command prompt correct we can let me
show you the technique that I had
previously used to to make all of this
work and I'm gonna you know there's a
lot of like PowerShell and snippets and
stuff in this one Shannon so I'm using a
little cheat sheet document here to make
it a little easier but let me open up a
command prompt okay and let's take a
look at this actually let me increase
the font side here so that we'll be able
to actually see this on the show pretty
well all right if I execute this right
here what we're doing is we're doing it
so fast thanks it's called paste we do a
for loop that is going to put into this
this variable right here D right so the
for loop will put in D whatever it gets
out of this command now what this
command it does is it uses wmic which is
utility that allows us to specify hey
vol get drive letter as you might
imagine that right there if I were to
copy it and let me come back here to the
very beginning and put a pound symbol in
there so it doesn't actually run it let
me just run that wmic get drive letter
so this just enumerates my whole drive
and says hey you've got a CD in an e
drive and if I go to my computer you'll
see a CD and you dress C D and E drive
now the D H my E drive right here is is
actually my USB thumb drive if you will
and it has been labeled DK by the way
quickest way to label something in
Windows you can select a drive letter
hit f2 and you can just type in ducky or
I like to
everything as short as possible so I'm
going to call it DK not for Darren
kitchen but for duck
can you just call it D I could but I
don't want to what if you could save one
more character yeah a little confusing I
don't want to break anything I want to
make it a little bit more yeah I
understand that
finesse this is this is all going to be
about finesse and making everything as
short as possible okay so in order to
keep this segmented short if possible
let me like power through this basically
what's going to happen is you see this
wmic get volume drive letter well if we
do a comma label it'll say hey II nice
is DK so that's fantastic I can now find
systematically that the drive that I
want I'm interested in this drive right
here the DK drive that's my USB thumb
drive you see is niet well eight gig USB
drive and that's going to let me explore
iterate my documents to that fantastic
well what this does is it says hey run
this and pipe the output of that to find
string so fine string is kind of like
grep and yeah in linux and it's looking
for DK so what it's going to do is it's
going to now assign this variable
percent D as well okay right all right
E yeah so it's going to assign e to that
so what's going to happen if I go ahead
and do that what it will do is set DK as
you - whatever that was - so I'm
actually creating a new variable here
called DK don't confuse it with the
volume letter DK can actually you know
just to make it less confusing let me
actually replace this with my drive okay
is this PowerShell no this is actually
this is the old way to do it so it's not
PowerShell this is just dass it looks
horrible I know it does well okay so
I've gone ahead and run Linux command I
know way more myself as well you know if
only we could get bash on Windows
wouldn't that be a weird world we would
live in Oh we do live in a weird world
and we were getting bash what is wrong
with the wall anyway back to the back to
das okay so what we're doing here is
we're setting my drive to equal whatever
we got from that so if I
echo percent my Drive percent because
that's how you do variable so you eat
it's going to do e which means if I say
dir that it'll give you whatever
whatever is in E right and I see I have
a DC MD there so if I wanted to
systematically run that DC MD which is
my payload I would do this back slash DC
MD now I'm not going to do that because
I want to talk about making this into a
one liner ooh
might imagine that's really important
because always whenever you're like on a
USB rubber ducky making a payload that
does a lot of things that change GUI
elements yeah every time oh yeah then
you're gonna run into some troubles like
maybe they have administrator privileges
maybe they don't you have to hit yes and
no maybe the user will do something on
the keyboard yeah or maybe you know
windows will pop up and take longer or
less long than you're expecting and so
via the hardware in the computer - yeah
the best kind of payloads are these
little windows run dialogue one-liners
so let me show you so if for instance I
hit Windows key R I always get this if I
wanted to I could do CMD tack K tree C
colon backslash right that's a one-liner
and it's just running whatever I told it
to do and there we go right you're
hacking yeah I'm hacking right I ran the
tree command I'm so leet well here is a
way to do this now putting this into
PowerShell so that I can run that as a
one-liner right so I could just like
paste that in and I'd be off to the
races so let's take a look at what this
entails basically what we've done is
PowerShell with these parameters here
and then we're going to start a process
we're going to start CMD we're going to
pass it these parameters which is going
to go ahead and for moment keep the
command prompt and it's going to run all
of that well here's something
interesting I have to pass this to
PowerShell within these quotes so this
quote right here at the very beginning
and this quote here at the end
so that means everything inside of it
well if it has quotes needs to be
escaped which is why unlike the previous
example I have actually two single
quotes there that looks awkward I know
it actually depending on your font it
may look like a double quote which is
really confusing yeah but two single
quotes in PowerShell will be escaped and
allow me to pass that within the actual
so we level quotes okay what this is
going to mean is that I can now pass
this as a one-liner so let's take a look
at what that will look like okay all
right so it's the same thing except I'm
using PowerShell to start the process
CMD for me so that I don't have to type
CMD hit enter and then do it
so basically normally that would be like
two or more different commands that
you'd have to run but since you put
those things in quotes
it all ends up being a single line yeah
it ends up being the one-liner I want
and you can even see I have you know
it's separated out after I specify D K F
so after create that variable D K as my
actual Drive letter yeah then this
ampersand here it's not pretty you know
if I put spaces it might be a little
prettier but after I do that I specify D
K backslash D CMD so that's going to go
ahead and run my payload so I'll go
ahead and hit OK on this command and
you'll notice that hey wait a second it
didn't work I'm ended up with a command
prompt here by the way the command
prompt stays because we executed that
start process CMD we specified /k for
keep if we wanted it to close we would
do a slash C but since we're just
developing our payload right now right
notice I hadn't even broken out the USB
rubber ducky or started writing your key
code okay I want to test it first make
sure it works it's going to keep that
command prompt okay and see what that
error might have been well what's that
error so the specified path can't we
can't find that path you're like wait
what what do you mean it it executed
correctly when we did it manually in
boss right why not echo that variable
and hey look it why didn't it work so I
found E it found E so why here
when we specify when we do this wmic
thing and does that have to do with your
quotes now you know what kind of yes
actually in a way it is because of the
quotes but what it is is the variable DK
doesn't get expanded so what it does is
it just tried to run literally % DK %
backslash d-doc CMD what powershell I
know this is so frustrating ok so how do
you fix it well basically we're going to
have to take a totally different
approach okay because since it's not
actually expanding the variable that
means that I'm this I basically you know
beat my head against wall for like quite
a while trying to get this one-liner to
work and then configure that that it
wouldn't expand so you know what here's
a method that does work which is why I'm
doing this show I'm going to come down
here to my next example and that is
right here this is this is it this
section right here that we can actually
pass in it in a quotation marks in
PowerShell in one-liner in the last one
right we're actually using a we're
creating a new variable called dollar
sign up right okay and we're going to go
ahead and use the get WMI object and
check out the wind 32 volume and then
we're looking for a label that is equal
to and okay DK whatever you want to
drive the you know name your drive
letter so it's going to say to select
that name yep and it's going to store in
this case this is going to store eco 'ln
into dollar sign at you P right after
that then we are going to CD we're
actually changing the directory to
dollar sign yupi and so that would be e
e : d DK yeah so it would be the same
here as doing CD D :
or sorry do-do-do-do-do
well in PowerShell it does that it gets
you there we're not in PowerShell we're
in CMD right now so they get it right
and then the last bit is and I like
PowerShell how it's a little bit like
bash we have to do a
backslash saying in this directory run d
dot CMD oh yeah that's just like running
a like a dot s HS script exactly halt
so before we move on to what that D CMD
actually is let's make this one liner a
little bit better because you know what
it's gonna be left in our history which
we don't want anybody said to happen Oh
got office key you know why and actually
this is true story this happened a
couple of days ago I got a phone call
and it was like it was like early in the
morning I'm like oh and dude is like
there's a problem with your computer
what does this happen so I'm like I'm on
the phone with a guy I'm like really
like what do you mean he's like oh we're
from Microsoft and we noticed there some
you're not one of those oh my gosh not a
Microsoft phishing call right so of
course I'm like oh no the computing is
like yes your firewall Internet is
exposing your IP address and it may be
causing the BLT Drive to go a WOL and
I'm like that sounds terrible and so
that's to either ever to get them to
like walk me through what they wanted me
to do they took me into Event Viewer to
like see all these errors and convinced
me that I just want telling me about oh
yeah I know is amazing it's so great so
as I'm on the phone with a guy I'm I'm
spinning up my virtual machine that I
use in pen test with hak5 because I've
got this like on my Linux box I have a
boy I wasn't gonna give him you know
access to my real machine I just learn
about real Windows box so I'm spinning
up this virtual machine on my Linux box
and I'm giving him access to that
because what he had me do was good or
like support me or something like that
some sort of Citrix II remote desktops
right yeah so like I'm on the line with
them playing stupid I'm recording the
entire session with Kazaam just a screen
recorder for Linux that I highly
recommend and anyways like looking
around right yeah and I'm like oh good
he's about to hack me
I can't wait to you know start reversing
the malware yeah um he clicks start hits
run and you know it was left in the oh
no the invoke min the cats
oh hey load that we did a couple weeks
ago and he know he knew what that
engines like he was just like like dang
it he's like there's a hacker on that
beanie on man I know what stinks I know
I didn't get high would have been
awesome I was so looking forward to
getting hacked guys you have no idea
ah you know I have not gotten one of
those phone calls well when you do spin
up a virtual machine ring record the
thing you know record the call if you
can
it should be good I'll even like I'll
get on my my Windows machines and we can
freeze that machine and then start like
watching the traffic and and do some
analysis alright we're like little off
the rails here but this is why you need
to clear your run history if I take a
look here and hit Windows key our look
at that I got a bunch of PowerShell in
there if you're like a you know an ell
user you're gonna be scared to death
it's like it's like seeing that and
being like oh no hacks right X so what
we're going to do is come down here to
this little snippet that I love and
using the remove item property here a
second I thought that said remove item
party and I was like don't remove the
party not the party well which party
again it's November 9th so we can run
using this right here we can go ahead
and remove an item from our Windows
registry in this case is HK current user
software Microsoft yada yada yada this
right here is where all of these are
stored so if I hit the drop-down I can
see all of those oh I see what you're
doing so it's it's nice I can actually
pop this thing into a bit of PowerShell
and go ahead and use it to remove my
things so what I'd like to do is
actually marry these two bits together
so that you know if I add this to the
beginning and here's what it's going to
look like this is now our PowerShell and
I look long dude it is right so as you
might imagine this is what we've done
before where we're creating that you p
variable with the drive letter
whatever's DK and we're moving to it and
running our CMD but before that and I
love that we can actually do this before
it doesn't matter we're going to go
ahead and remove that thing and we do to
tech name is star so it's going to get
rid of everything and then tack our
action silently continue cool here's the
only problem with this unfortunately
yeah really
it's 275
characters and the run line maxes out at
260 we're 15 Chargers over well that's
okay just put on YouTube anyways
somebody will fix it for you that's
right
that's why no I always note there's at
least one viewer out there who will be
like I can make this shorter but I heard
something about like you don't search if
you like searching for something on the
internet put out like if you asked like
hey what is XYZ nobody's going to answer
you but if you see X Y Z is a is a
jablow mind all the things right and
then you'll get corrected okay so
actually maybe it's a great point
maybe this PowerShell will get better
through this segment and it will in a
moment because here's the thing we can
fix this in one of two ways right
first thing that we could do is kind of
obvious we could actually get rid of
that - error actions silently continue
that's the part that argument that says
hey if you run into any problems still
leading this Windows registry value just
keep going I kind of prefer that that
silently continue thing so I want to
keep that it could cause some problems
if we don't especially if we do run into
an error so how are you gonna make it
any shorter well this is automatic
aliases
I love aliases you should be quite
familiar with aliases shannon's are
awesome not something you show up in the
90s
no I have I have one on my other
computer cuz my my wireless card always
fails for some reason so it's just
called internets and it restarts the
card anytime I boot up my machine I
just go internets and it runs I'm like
yay aliases aliases are the best thing
ever if you haven't seen my hack hack
tip on aliases you need to watch it
it's very cool yeah she's really excited
about alien species well thankfully
PowerShell has an alias for remove item
property which is literally just our pee
oh yeah right that makes sense so what
was previously 19 characters is now -
which if we apply that to our script
we'll bring it down from 275 characters
to 257 Oh just less than 260 how do I
know I'm proud of me - because it's an
awesome here here it is
booyah that right there is it - it's the
257 characters
which will silently run whatever you
want off of your drive and I'm super
excited to show this to you this is our
final final command right here well it's
the final command of the first step of
the process of building this
exfiltration payload which is obviously
to test first on our target machine and
then we can have it run DC MD so um I
have a question yes what is do you not
see MD do okay so let's say let's take a
look at D that's a way to bury the lead
yeah I know right
well actually I'm gonna go ahead and
just run this I'm going to go ahead and
paste this in and just run it and you'll
see a bloop and it's going to say Oh
slurp top that isn't there because I
renamed this right before we started the
thingy and so let's take a look at that
I'm on the e Drive and let me notepad on
uh let me open it with sublime because
I'm leaked subl DC MD what Oh
ergh subl is not in my path this is what
happens when we sew two windows like
double yay I don't know why I just
thought I could you know on my Linux bot
you know what notepad I can't type
anymore
DC AMD right actually why I got that
error was because that should be CMD
instead of bat so let me run that again
Oh notice there's nothing in my run line
because when I ran it I got rid of
everything
let me also open up Explorer and take a
look at my II drive and you'll see I
have a slurp directory and it is
currently empty right now let me run
that PowerShell again that little
one-liner that I have mistakenly cleared
from my clipboard
there we go wait what happened it just
like popped up I was gone fast yeah well
now I've got it oh hey look
well there's the thing this does look
and there's all my text files right well
we'll get back to that in a bit but
let's go ahead and again know what
you're doing yeah so you'll notice
nothing popped up and that was because
this DC MD is a stager if you will and
it quite simply runs our slurp dot bat
or I guess now slurp CMD Halo
and it uses start which is all my
favorite commands and you specify slash
min to go ahead and open it minimized
that's cool
yes yeah obfuscation yeah which means
when we put this all together we
basically have a command which will
silently execute a payload off of a USB
Drive and simultaneously clear a run
line in just one little simple 257
characters which is awesome yeah we can
build on this which means that next week
we can take on the next challenge which
is targeted exploration of our documents
and then we can couple that with the USB
rubber ducky both hid and Mass Storage
attack and then wrap it all up in one
nice ducky script a lid for everybody
except like and I'm doing it this way
because I am just now starting to really
get into PowerShell which means I've
noticed which means that now that have
put this two hundred and fifty seven
characters into the universe as it were
you can find the show notes at hak5 org
and find the article on how to do
exactly this I would love to hear your
comments on ways to make this even
faster which means just reducing the
amount of characters because 257 is
great but what if we could get it to a
tweet dangerous tweets ohms so let me
know in the comments below
and with that we're going to take a
quick break
do you have brilliant ideas for phone
tethering pineappley apps of your own
but you should bring them to the
interwebs and the best place to do that
is over at domain.com because that's
where you can get yourself a nice domain
name and you know what it's where
Shannon and I go whenever we have
brilliant ideas and it's because they
have this awesome domain discovery
system that makes it super simple to
find the perfect domain name just for
you and then their checkout process
which is super streamlined and easy
means your website's going to be up and
online in no time flat and best of all
domain com huge fans of hack 5 huge fans
of yours so they have a coupon code just
for you it spells hack 5 it's hak5 and
it saves you 20% checkout it domain.com
how awesome is that these guys have been
supporting hack 5 for years and years
and we love them so you know even if
you're not getting a domain name today
you should tweet
at domain.com and say dudes you guys are
awesome for supporting hack 5 and next
time you need a domain name think
domain.com we are back and it is now
time for the technologic every single
week we are asking you guys and gals
what is your techno last what is
tickling your techno lest and we want to
see your picture so you can hashtag hak5
that spells hack 5 which is the name of
this show which I really hope that you
guys know if you're watching the show
hashtag hack 5 send us your pictures
over on Twitter Instagram or Facebook
and we will send a different prize out
every single week this week since we're
talking about the USB rubber ducky we're
going to send a USB rubber ducky to the
winner and we decided this week's winner
is at time excited 12:33 this is cool if
you know if you've seen some of my own
previous segments I love messing with
Arduinos so I really like this hack so
this is a pumpkin with an Arduino and
moving eyes so he must have used a
couple of servos too mushy their eyes
moving yeah there's the servo right
there and then he's got some LEDs built
up at top and it looks like he's just
got a breadboard setting up there so
he's got the LEDs lighting up the
interior of the pumpkin I love it I
think that's so cool
any Arduino hacks are okay with me so
we're going to send you a USB rubber
ducky I'll get in contact with you over
twitter and everybody else send your
pictures in we love seeing all the
different hacks and we hope that our
show as well as other podcast inspire
you to do amazing things like this hey
you know what else we love it when you
guys make our set even better and I
believe we have a we have something for
that do we do we have two different
letters they're both from koumei all
right coma Hey oh yeah awesome he comes
to our open warehouse parties yes indeed
done one in a while night two we need to
have another what do we need to have it
so oh cool theta stickers I we did a
segment on the theta a couple weeks ago
months ago time flies about taking 360
videography and photos and stuff it's an
awesome camera I'm using it I love very
call and thank you will pop one on the
set what else do we get
khmer also sent me a letter and he said
you made it to japan i did finally and
it was amazing uh-huh you witness the
trains they're supposed to be electric
fast and frequent which is completely
different from what we have over here
but he got to go to the BART fleet of
the future unveiling event so our local
Bay Area Transit is called BART VAR T
Bay Area Rapid Transit and they've been
needing to upgrade it for a very long
time so he got a chance to see the new
cars that they're going to be building
in this area which are hopefully going
hey that is really cool very cool yeah
yeah totally love it like seeing support
for public transit like you know helps
with the climate and everything so I
love seeing that thank you so much
coming love it
coming Elsa says I know you're a big fan
of the Ricoh theta and virtual reality
in general so uh so am i and attached
her stickers from my favorite Meetup the
Silicon Valley virtual reality and the
limited edition theta stickers hope you
like them awesome thank you so much this
is a cool meet-up the Silicon Valley
virtual reality that's going to vary I
love that we're living in a world where
like virtual reality isn't a joke it's
not like flying cars and I'm biting my
tongue and so we're living in an
interesting age and I'll leave it at
that
if you guys are interested you can send
over your stickers too we love
supporting different hacker events and
different charities and conventions and
even your local hacker spaces - so yeah
send over your stickers hak5 org slash
addresses where you can send those and
they will come directly to us we would
love to see what you guys are doing day
