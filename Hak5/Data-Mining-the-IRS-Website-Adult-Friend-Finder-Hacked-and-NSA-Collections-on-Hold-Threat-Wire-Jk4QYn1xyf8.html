isn't currently being recorded but the
IRS is being all your information and so
our adult dating websites all that
coming up now on threat wires I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
form a 27 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom first off I want to
give a huge thanks to all you guys who
have supported the relaunch of the show
we couldn't be more proud of all of you
in our awesome community and of course
if you're new to threat wire on the hak5
channel this is a show that we did about
for about a year on the tech feed
channel and now we brought it back so
with that let's go ahead and get started
there may be a slight issue when your
tax collection system is hacked and
that's just what happened to the IRS Oh
their online service called get
transcript allows taxpayers to download
tax return and transaction data and this
service was targeted from February all
the way to mid-may access was gained to
over 100,000 taxpayer informations with
200,000 total attempts made get
transcript requires several
authentication protocols before a
taxpayer can actually get into their
information so the attackers had to know
info including social security
information date of birth tax filing
status and street address before
accessing the IRS systems they also had
to answer several questions that only
the taxpayer would normally no questions
that you've probably had to answer when
accessing your credit report for example
no other systems were breached now the
IRS did shut down get transcript online
temporarily while the working on a fix
and they're also offering free credit
report muttering to anyone affected the
IRS is also sending letters to all of
those that were included knowledge-based
authentication like this one can be
easily abused because the questions
asked or they never change and they can
also be found on other data breaches not
to mention social networks such as
Facebook are a huge feeding ground for
anyone looking for personally
identifiable information about any user
more than 3.8 million email addresses
sexual orientation information marital
status and more have reportedly been
leaked in a hack of the adult dating
website adult
finder com according to the parent
company friendfinder networks an
internal investigation has been launched
and they are working with mandiant a
security firm to investigate they state
quote it is important to note that at
this time there is no evidence that any
financial information or passwords were
compromised however it is possible that
credit card data was also included in
the unredacted original file this leak
could be used as blackmail against users
who were secretly using the site as a
way for an attacker to gain quick
payments and lastly the NSA isn't
accepting your recorded phone calls
right now please call back in a week
lawmakers are on a week-long recess
after the Senate voted 57 242 against
the USA Freedom Act tons of debating and
filibusters and a failed attempt to pass
revisions for the Patriot Act so just a
reminder the Freedom Act was made to add
changes to the Patriot Act which was
used as legal grounds for the NSA spying
the House already passed a companion
bill to the USA Freedom Act but they ran
into difficulties with the Senate they
feel it'll harm national security and
the fight against terrorism the Patriot
Act along with its section 215 the part
that justifies phone call records is
expiring on june first the senate plans
to reconvene on May 31st to make a final
decision our featured comment today
comes from Anakin Wolfie who in response
to the Android factory reset flaw said
time to erase the old fashioned way
thermite while I'm not suggesting anyone
destroy their electronics with thermite
that would definitely work but please
use caution thanks for the comment and a
kid Wolfie and have you any thoughts on
today's stories of course you can leave
them below in the comments and before I
go I want to give a huge thanks to
