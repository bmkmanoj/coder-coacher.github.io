the Ben Heck show
tails it's not just sonic the hedgehog's
buddy it's a way to protect your privacy
and now we're gonna check out Shannon's
tail so that's the one what da hell no
well you back you didn't want it you
didn't have me like hey you're like my
bring you in that was pretty cute yeah I
liked it okay so um have you heard of
this linux distro okay to be honest
shannon i have but i have not used it
personally um and I've looked into doing
it the hard way yeah and I have done it
the hard way and it's hard so I do like
the idea of this and I might start using
it maybe in a virtual machine or some
okay well this is I know Stevie I got
some friends who do use this and ok so
this just rooms called tails you just
Google tails and you can find it it's
really really easy it's a linux distro
that boasts all about their security in
their privacy in their anonymity for
their users that's what I want yes
exactly everybody wants that everybody
wants security and privacy so all the
connections that are on tails they go
through tor and we all know tour of
course The Onion Router and so if you're
not familiar a tour that is a project
that is worded by the eff in it is a
wonderful way of doing a secure ish
private ish communications over the
Internet by bouncing your stuff through
traffic you probably and it better than
I so toward bounces traffic throughout
the world so that somebody can't learn
who you are what sites you visit and the
sites can't figure out where you're from
exactly because the location is
completely obscured no matter where you
are entails has to be booted also from a
flash drive or a CD you do to the vm
well you could and you could also
install it I guess you can install it on
your Peter if you really wanted to be on
tails yeah well always run tails it is
based on debian and i love some of me
some debian it is yeah but then if you
do install it on your seat on your
computer you have that distrel on your
computer and at least traces of your
actions on on the actual machine so if
you just stick it on a USB and at the
end of the day when you and lug it and
you shut down completely erases
everything that you've done right
because and then the same thing with the
CD I mean at least with a CD you know
that there's actually no right
on it where I wonder if you could
probably boot off of like a SD card to
have like a switch on them that allows
you to put them in right protect mode so
that the operating system can't actually
write something back in there so we
should try that well the idea is you get
owned or something while you're on that
instance you rebooting you're not owned
because it hasn't touched your file
system isn't touched your computer at
all that's true and then tails is also
really cool because it uses encryption
for your files and data even instant
messaging so it's got like tools Dilton
yeah all sorts of tools are built in and
it uses your RAM memory not the hard
drive space so any traces are wiped
clean after you shut down off of your
USB stick you can even save data onto
another hard drive or USB while using
tails so if you're working on some
really really important file and you
have to save it at the end of the day
you can save it onto another USB and you
can encrypt it if you want there's no
problem with that what's cool so it does
come with a lot of really cool stuff
already built in for you well so I'm
used to like poor with like that the tor
browser bundle where I'm just like it's
Firefox overt or what else do you know
that's the primary usage for me to set
up well it's if you do it yourself
there's a little bit of and you know
it's a little involved it's not too bad
but but my concern is always like what
if it's leaky what if dns queries aren't
going through it what do ya you know you
don't set it up properly and so the tor
browser bundle does a great job of
making it easy to like download a
version of Firefox that's already set up
it's a portable app version of Firefox
it's got tour built in this is taking
that a step further because now you've
got all of the components the operating
system and they've gone through great
lengths to make sure that it is as
secure as they can which I you know
would definitely trust the towards
project people to make something that's
an especially since it's open source and
can be that of course of course yes go
on so pre-installed software in tools it
has HTTPS Everywhere for your online fun
Luck's for USB encryption lu KS yeah i
like to use that one so I doing a
fortune in Linux we'll talk about it's
kind of like tricked kind of don't make
a good settlement mmm openpgp for emails
of course we'll be talking about always
have to have gr for instant messages and
Nautilus wipes so you can wipe clean the
entire hard drive and
your files from the computer completely
nice excellent and it has plenty of
other stuff pre-installed to for your
security security in your privacy so
it's kind of like like backtrack is
depending as tails is to privacy yeah
exactly so you know if you're a
journalist in a really really scary
country and you don't want anybody to
track what you're doing while you're
writing your articles you could use
tales now there are some caveats to that
though so I'll say I'm a journalist in
you know pick pick the your country of
choice whereas an American you probably
don't want to go I don't want to like
give away that I'm using encryption
because just by having encryption you're
suddenly an enemy of the state and there
are some really scary places and I don't
want to get into it because I live in a
you know a land of disney land and games
but there are people that get
disappeared because they speak out about
the government they blog well if I'm
using tales how are they gonna know well
if you're using tales you're on tour and
if the ISP which in a lot of cases in
those countries are controlled by the
government they can see that your
packets are going through the onion
router even if they can't see what your
message is they know that you're using
some sort of obfuscated technology like
traits yeah so what's nice about the
tour tales project is that even on their
website they list out a whole bunch of
things that you have to remember
whenever using tales they're saying like
hey it's not going to keep you
completely private because there's still
some loopholes that people could go
through if they really really wanted to
well like for example exit nodes and we
haven't gotten into like big discussions
about horse in a long long time on hak5
but you know the idea that your packets
bounced through different nodes
eventually they need to unless you're of
course only dealing with in the tour
egos yeah if you wanting to go out to
the internet they have to hit what's
called an exit node and that's the nude
that finally takes that data and then
puts it out on to the global Internet oh
and some would venture to guess that at
least half of those are run by nation
states or other various organizations
that maybe don't have your best interest
in mind so one more people should be
running their own exit nodes that aren't
nefarious but to you should keep that in
mind that it isn't going to you know
protect you from a you know
joel global adversary as they were
potential global adversary it's awesome
nope not going to make all your
passwords really nice you have to make
sure that you do that beforehand yeah
but we're not gonna do a segment on
strong passwords you guys know you guys
already know how to make your password
strong and you also have to trust the
tape tales distro you know you it's just
like using Ubuntu you have to trust it
beforehand or just like using Microsoft
you trust they don't have back doors in
that I mean zactly at least with the
back doors yeah this I fall at least
with tails and and Boone to like Mark
Shuttleworth was talking about like last
week when we're talking about your bun
to privacy concern it's open source so
it can be vetted and so at least in this
instance you know you have to there was
always going to be some level of trust
just like you trust comcast not sniff
all your data well maybe you don't so
you use torch I assume you yeah well you
know what's the difference oh man I
could totally tin foil hat right now but
I'm not going to because it's already a
long show but but yeah I mean you
already trust you know if you don't
trust your ISP maybe use tails with tour
and at least maybe only half the exit
nodes of the government and then you
know they're your high the government um
and the government and the other forget
what were we talking about oh and then
the trust that you know so it's just
like it's always matters of trust just
like we talked about like vp ending your
traffic when you're on a public Wi-Fi
over to your virtual private server in
the cloud you trust that that virtual
private server company isn't sniffing
right because that's basically your exit
node just that you trust you know
canonical not to make some evil stuff
into ubuntu just as you trust the Debian
developers not to f-up debian and i
think that it's just easier to lend your
trust to an open source project that has
this kind of I don't know they're
serious about your privacy I met you
guys at an eff event and these guys are
serious oh really they're serious
scrutiny by the governments and whatnot
of the world because you know haven't
forbid we actually have the Kadim
tinfoil hat again okay there anyone we
all know that you have the table yet all
I'm saying is
yes I I would trust this yeah you know
I'm not I don't have time to go through
every line of code on the source so I'm
sure people have gone through it and
have like look through a whisk scrutiny
and said like hey where is where the
problem as long as we're talking about
trust though we should probably mention
that when you go and download this make
sure that you actually get the the
fingerprint of that image file yes and
verify that what you downloaded is what
you think you downloaded because you
know a man-in-the-middle attack could
occur to wear what you thought was the
the legit version of tales ended up
being your nation states version of
tales that doesn't get what you think it
does and I like I like that they
actually give you a step-by-step guide
line on how to do that on their website
to they're like hey make sure that the
key is correct when you download this
and they tell you exactly what to do and
that's one of the only distros that I've
seen that actually does that for you on
their website it's weird cuz i've
actually had downloads of a tour fail on
ISPs here in the in the nation and in
the US which is kind of crazy I mean you
can't you just try again and you try
from a different source than it worse
but anyway really I don't maybe that's
why you have a mirror on their website
too well there's plenty of mirrors but
anyway the point is that if you verify
the signature than you should get you
should have a pretty good level of trust
that what you download is what you think
you have yes yeah so anyway this is what
the website or this is what tales looks
like on the distro i do want to mention
though if you're just using this in a
cafe or something and you're worried
like some kind of government official is
watching what you're doing you can boot
it up in this XP look like addition
during like right when you build up you
have this option ok so it is based on
debian linux they put a skin on it that
makes it look like Windows X just like
windows XP all the way down through the
background cuz that's what we find in
most in a lot of cyber cafes around the
world did I just say cyber cafe i guess
that is really a gang all over the world
and so um I've been to cyber cafes yeah
in Toronto's but they also have you were
actually showing me some other feature
that they have to see kiryu if you're
say at a cyber cafe and you don't trust
the hardware you're on ah yes so um for
example
so here I have the browser open and what
Darren was mentioning is I have an
on-screen keyboard so you know about
keylogger is if somebody has a keylogger
on a machine and you want to boot into
boot up on that machine and like I don't
know check your email or something like
that if there's a keylogger they're
going to grab your password so you can
use it on screen keyboard oh I love that
they have this installed in there I mean
it's such a simple thing but this isn't
something that I would normally have
thought of to actually use is this
on-screen keyboard in case those key
loggers we I guess if you're using this
on your own machine and you trust your
own machines keyboard then that's one
thing but yeah right if you're at a
cyber cafe I guess it used to be that
you could just look at the back of the
cable and like oh there's a you know
dongle here between the ps2 or the USB
port in the computer but I guess you
can't necessarily tear apart their
keyboards and look at them huh that
that's the other thing is like more
often now you actually see keyloggers
being embedded inside of the keyboard so
no bring a screwdriver no just use the
on-screen keyboard screwdriver well I
Murray board there's also they have this
open pgp encryption applet up at the top
and you also see this little onion right
here connected to the Tor network so
when you first boot it up you do have to
log onto the wireless it'll tell you
that the proxy server is refusing
connections at the moment cause you
actually have to connect through the
onion router and once you do it'll give
you this congratulations your browser is
configured to use tours so it is ready
to go you don't have to reinstall
anything sort of like it is you don't
have to worry about it being leaky and
DNS going at the phone they've done
everything for you it's like awesome i
think i love that it automatically does
this for you and you don't have to
install all the extra mumbo jumbo it's
just ready to go nice well you can find
all the links for all of these things
and more over at our show note to hack 5
org thank you once again Shannon for

Sam once again check port 110 yes it is
you know I've had so much starbucks
today oh my gosh my heart is going crazy
right now well Pete overload yeah it's
crazy all right so Clifford he asks hey
guys i am always on the go and i need
access to my home network for a growing
number of reasons do you know of a free
portable VPN client that can fit on a
flash drive ok so if you're doing your
own home VPN you guys know how I feel
about openvpn it's real simple to set up
for home users and a dito makes that
super simple we've done segments on that
in the past here's what i've found as
far as portable is concerned oh v pn o
VPN p sf.net it's it's the opens it's
the portable version of the vpa the
openvpn client it's on sourceforge it's
windows only which is important to note
but the nice thing is it is open VPN and
it is open source and so that's
important to me the other ones that have
found our kitty which is a fork yeah
it's ki TTYL just like putty opu TTYL
because it's all TTYL anyway um which is
a fork of putty it is it basically
allows you to ssh tunneling for non
privileged users on it is again windows
but it's a fork of an open source so
it's open source and so that's the only
thing that I've found that's open source
for Windows and so I would encourage
anybody else that knows of something to
do like pptp or ipsec if those are the
those are the protocols that you're
going to be using when ussa or when you
want VPN into your home network go ahead
and email speed back at hak5 org if you
know something else but the thing is I
got well I found some other stuff out
there and there's some really crappy
looking apps right for Windows that do
it that are closed source and I feel
like when it comes to your VPN client
you know the thing that's going to be
taking your sensitive data and putting
it through yes yeah yes so without the
source it's like sorry bro not gonna use
it you know sorry bro you got hacks not
gonna go with those hacks yeah what it's
from Cisco and iknow joking we're gonna
roll right into that techno less photo
of the week this week this one comes
from Lenny he sends in a photo of his
son getting started with tech very
early he says here's my son playing on
our VPS is a VPS with minecraft bukkit
and ventrilo he is hooked at age three
he's an OP and he can even run several
commands like /t p / give / time and he
loves kitty cannon and eddie cannon
seriously yay kind of depressing we're
working on in texture packs next in
thanks to all the great tips and tricks
and if you guys have pictures you can
always send those over to feedback at
hak5 org with the subject line technol s
or if you have children you can go into
your command prompt type sudo su tak hit
enter and turn your password and then
give the keyboard to your children
hahaha let see what happens that's an
awesome idea they can't break it
three-year-old with rude would go ok Oh
God and now it's time for the trivia oh
I love the trivia what was last week's
last week's question was what woman from
geek history designed cobol and the
answer was Grace Hopper this week's
question is who was the first woman I
love those old school history women so
who was the first woman to win the
Turing award essentially for the Nobel
Prize for computing and you can answer
that over at hak5 org slash what is it
trivia trivia I thought lyrics less
trivia yeah it's her first time hold of
course we value your feedback so if you
have some questions if you have some
comments you want to get involved in
some crazy pgp based alternative radio
storm forward happiness or if you want
to let us know what you think on tails
and other sorts of ways to using Onion
Router alt or alternative internet fun
stuff feedback at hak5 org that's where
we're like forgetting all the links and
you guys can always go over to hack 5
daughter work / follow to find links to
all of our social networks to keep up to
