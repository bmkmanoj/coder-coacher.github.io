series on virtualization well Darrin and
shannon and the wii homebrew series with
backups and emulations
this episode of act 5 is brought to you
by godaddy Squarespace gamefly and
viewers like you hello welcome to hack 5
i'm darren kitchen I met les doc I'm
Shannon Morse and this is Kirby and this
is your weekly dose of techno lust as we
call it we've got an excellent show for
you guys tonight a lot of wii homebrew
stuff some virtualization finally and
people have been hounding you over that
yeah i got a lot of emails about
virtualization so finally I'm like you
know what maybe it's actually time to
appease the masses and I what we're
gonna do is we're gonna go into um it's
gonna be a whole series like from start
to finish yeah and I'm gonna do a little
like little brain dump stuff a little
brain dump and then we're also gonna do
a little like homebrew personalization
instead of like buying all the kind of
show I love homebrew all right yeah
guess what I've been getting a lot of
emails about your fuckup yeah I kind of
messed up the editing last episode so
enjoy the director's cut speaking of
which there was a good idea that came
out of that little is that blue / DVD
you know I hind the scene you had been
keeping that DVD out we have had some
fun we'll talk offline because I have
some ideas about like my video the audio
the mix eat I'm looking out for you guys
alright well beyond a little bit cuz
this is a homebrew you want to talk
about home bruh this is homebrew HD
video production for like less than what
a single lens cost the big boys yeah yes
our big brother Chris taking it real up
in williamsburg VA but see the thing the
thing is is like if like the revision 3
studio isn't portable know that's a
Selma thing cuz it in a box so what's
gonna happen is anytime they want to do
like something remote like multicam
multi audio needs they're gonna have to
come to us and be like hey can we rent
yo I'm like yo we should go to
network and then live switch the
diggnation stuff for whatever man it'll
be awesome not I'd be cool yeah they're
gonna hit the HTC I don't know huh cool
I got ya stuff so um I like turtles
let's go find out what's going on with
wii homebrew
I'm kicking it over to Shannon
hey guys I'm back this week I'm not
bringing you a hack this week but I'm
bringing you some homebrew news and a
quick recap of what we've done so far as
far that as far as the Nintendo Wii goes
first off teen tweezers you guys
remember them from the homebrew channel
they've been working on boot me but--my
basically brings you this low level
console control over your entire wheat
it boots up before the system menu so
you have that control they've done it
already on 12 different ways and they
haven't bricked any of them yet so
they're bringing out the beta version in
the next few weeks you can expect that
also one in cocoa he was the guy that
did the USB loader he just released this
thing it's this homebrew we app that
lets you backup your game disk onto USB
hard drive or an SD card it's pretty
cool it lets you run games straight from
your SD card instead of using the game
disc for every single thing so you can
just leave that in there and play all
your games straight from there so last
week you remember I brought you the weed
dis number by nitro tux it's basically
the same thing as the USB loader except
it takes a good 10 hours in six
different parts for a certain kind of
game discs the USB loader takes one
tenth of that time and only one iso file
it's great everything's packed into one
file and Darren is going to be showing
us how to use this to get we 720p on
your computer and last off for the news
I wanted to tell you about dolphin on
the 13th they release build 2962 this is
brand new it has open al audio support
frame dump for avi and they included an
even powerful more powerful Rumble for
your xbox 360 controller sounds good to
me all right now for our quick recap the
first thing we talked about when we were
talking about nintendo wii was the zelda
twilight hack it's awesome it has the
special saved game that causes this
buffer overflow and code execution all
this cool stuff basically just brings
home brew on your on your machine that's
a good part the bad part Nintendo just
really system menu for point oh this
sucks because if you haven't updated
already you can get the zelda twilight
hack but if you have already updated and
you don't have it yet you cannot use the
twilight hack to get
home brew on your machine although if
you haven't updated yet and you have it
and you want to update you can because
it won't break the home brews that you
already have on your machine although i
would recommend staying on the old old
mode just because it's probably much
better that way just saying alright the
homebrew channel this basically lets you
launch homebrew apps from SD card and
it's makes it very easy so there's no
need for the Twilight hack for every
single game that you want to play that's
homebrew on your week one of the most
recent things we talked about was the
homebrew browser and lets you download
all sorts of homebrew apps and games
everything you want straight from the
wii's internet connection so you don't
have to move your SD card from your
computer and back again every single
time if you want to know more about
homebrew apps you can find information
and apps that you can download over at
the root we brew org wiki and if you
want to check out everything that we've
done step by step so far you can go back
to the previous set episodes and
definitely check those out download them
or you can check out our show notes over
at MC calm and hak5 org and i want to
tell you about this month's land party
it's going to be fun one we're playing
doom to skull tag its doom the hak5
oregon 25th i can't wait to see you guys
there it's gonna be a lot of classic fun
double barrel shotgun for the win so
anyway yuki all the details about that
at hak5 land squarespace com as we can
find the wads where you can suggest a
pea pod for us to play or you know just
find out where you get skull tagging
just just bitch about who's best in it
anyway let me direct your attention over
to the squarespace page though because
they are fine sponsor of this particular
segment and i want to show you a nifty
feature you can do here so i'm on my
Squarespace page and i'm logged in and
it's as easy as clicking over here to
modify my navigation i'm going to add a
new page and i'm going to show you a
nifty feature here where I can actually
cry
map so I'm going to configure my map i'm
going to call it the epic land party and
i'm going to bring that down here and i
already have a Google Maps API it was
real easy to get and I'm going to give
it an address i'm gonna say 2 3 188
that's our zip code here at the podcast
Williamsburg Virginia there we go
awesome and i'm going to call this you
know the hak5 epic land party and you
know check some buttons sounds good and
then create page and I go over here to
epic LAN party now and there we go i
have a google map and you know if i if i
actually had like a street address you
could click this and be like you know
find the directions to it so if you're
doing like an event or something this
would be excellent say for instance if
hak5 had like a meet-up at Busch Gardens
in the middle of the summer I'm just
saying that would be kind of cool and we
would have maps to like hotels and and
the theme park and all sorts of stuff
right there in the Google Maps anyway
squares place plans start at just eight
dollars a month and you can get ten
percent off the life of your service
over there when you check out at
squarespace com with coupon code at five
so at this point I'm going to go ahead
and kick it over to Matt who is Canada's
office teaching us a little bit about
virtualization
hey guys today we are in my office
actually the conference room of my
office here in Williamsburg and after
the mountains of email that I've gotten
I finally decided that we're going to
start our virtualization segment I know
I've done a couple little things here
and there with VMware server and you
know workstation and some other things
but today we're actually going to get
into the enterprise virtualization
segments it's going to be a whole big
series it's probably going to consume at
least a month maybe two I don't know
don't hold me to that but I've got Paul
the camera guy who has graciously tagged
along and is filming my little white
board segment here now you guys may be
asking yourself ok I understand about
virtualization you can put a couple
things per box that's all fine and dandy
besides you know cost savings and things
like that what else is there that goes
into virtualization well there's machine
virtualization there it's the actual
physical to virtual putting multiple
boxes on a machine there's also storage
virtualization storage area networks
things of that nature equallogic EMC all
of these big companies have what they
call storage virtualization which allows
you to blah blah blah we'll get into
that later what I'm going to show you
today is kind of a brief overview of the
system that I have set up now it's not
the most awesome system in the world and
it's not even set up the best practices
according to VMware or Zen however that
being said it works for us let me show
you what we've got in our server rack
here we've got 36 terabytes in three
cages okay of sand space now you may be
asking yourself why 36 how are they in
three cages blah blah blah we're using
12 terabytes per cage there's 12 disks
per cage one terabyte drives each there
SATA and SAS 7200 rpm we wanted the
maximum storage capacity that we could
possibly have because each of our
virtual machines needs to be at least
200 gigabyte
we run SI p and it's a beast beyond that
we have a single del r 900 this is the
beast of the beast as far as Dell is
concerned this machine is enormous it's
got four processors when I bought it you
can only get quad-core processors but
now you can get six core processors and
you can load this beast up to up to 256
gigs of RAM on this box alone we are
running the equivalent of 45 physical
machines so let's let's take a step back
and think about that real quick so 45
physical machines I've got 45 different
installations of Windows on this single
box this box cost my company 23 thousand
dollars go through your entire rack fill
it with 1u servers how much is that
going to cost you got it about fifteen
hundred dollars per server if you were
going to go with what the equivalent of
our 45 servers equals you'd have to
spend fifteen hundred dollars per one
you in a 42u rack to equal what we have
in three use the system itself we give
each machine for processing cores we
give each machine at least six gigs of
RAM here there or bouts and it runs like
a champ now this are 900 here is
directly connected the 10 Gigabit
Ethernet to our San so now we've got our
sands which these two cages are actually
linked in this cage here both in raid 50
and we get a throughput on the disk
spindles at about
a 120 megabytes a second and that's with
all 45 physical machines on so this is
kind of an introductory not really
saying why or how or you know that kind
of thing I just wanted to give you guys
a real world example of an
implementation that is in a production
environment if this machine goes down I
am so fired let's just put it that way
so we'll get into some of the more
specifics of VMware with virtual center
server the B motion and the disaster
recovery and high availability systems a
little bit later in its series but I
just want to let you guys know that not
only the cost to purchase the 45
physical machines think about your costs
too cool to power and to back up these
machines I'm going to leave you guys
with that thought and check back next
week when we're actually going to get
into the nitty-gritty of how we're
actually going to go about architecting
the solution it's a lot cheaper than you
guys actually think so right now we're
going to kick it over to trivia and take
it away alright guys so this week we are
bringing you any trivia but we are
bringing you the hak5 monkey wallpaper
contest basically you can go over to

a condo toy section coupons to yes case
you forget yeah rock on what's going on
well I am gonna go across the set and go
tell you guys how you can backup your
wii games to a hard drive copy those
over to your computer and start playing
them in HD if you get the video card for
and kirby's break in my computer there
we go so I'm gonna go do that and you
have here take this from me I'm having
way too much fun
alright guys just like Shannon said at
the top of the show this we home Bruce
stuff just changes so fast especially
lately since system menu four point oh
and whole sdhc card support and whatnot
but what I wanted to talk to you guys
about like we said last week is doing
using the dolphin emulator to play your
wii games at 720p in HD yeah see we can
do it too you know not just the ps3 and
360 just got to have like a two thousand
el gaming rig but what we're going to do
it now here's the thing last week we
showed you guys how to use a technique
go I forget his name anyway we tried to
we showed you how to use a downloader
that would like download the game disc
in your way to an SD card we had to do
it like multiple times because in SD
card in the big knife and all about
about about anyway some really cool new
stuff come out just a few days ago as of
taping and that is the USB / SD loader
this thing is sweet it basically allows
you to not only you know copy your games
from your wii discs over to something
like you know like a removable hard
drive or even a you know a USB thumb
drive it allows you to even play them
from them so you can backup your entire
we library to a hard drive not have to
change discs in and out really cool
stuff we're not I mean obviously there's
you know potential for piracy there
we're not interested in that at all what
we're interested in is playing our own
legit games that you know we own here on
on our PC in much better graphics so how
do we get it all set up how do we get
the USB loader installed so we can start
backing up our games to iso files right
well there's a couple of requirements to
be to get the USB SD load or going take
a look here I've got the this is
basically the package that you'll find
links to on our website and there's four
steps to the process here first we need
to get the USB loader wad installed on
our wii pretty easy thing to do we've
talked about using the wad loader before
and you're seeing it's a breeze to get
installed so once we have that installed
we also need to go through this see iOS
36 rev 10 installer and basically you
know this is your standard boot deal
well if you're familiar
homebrew channel you know what we'd do
is we'd come into your in apps and I'm
just going to use I don't know sne i'll
use we 2600 as an example i'm going to
just copy that folder and paste it come
on it's not that big really alright so
now i'm going to rename that to like
cios 36 and gas you've got a bunch of
stuff in here we don't need so the only
thing that we really need to keep here
is the meta.xml and the not the about
the icon PNG so that'll show up in our
homebrew channel copy over that boot DOL
and then we edit this xml file here and
we want to change this out instead of
saying we 2600 will say the sea iOS 36
yet I fill those out basically so it'll
show up in your homebrew channel and
then go ahead through this installer
it's a really easy install it modifies
your we so that we can you know plug the
USB hard drive into it and start having
lots of fun so now that we have those
first two steps done we need to make
sure that we have this particular wad
file here in the root of our SD card
that were running all our home brew off
of and that is the seat of the iOS 3664
the 1024 wad file just pop it in your
route you'll be all set so this is what
you end up here you get this nice new
channel called the USB loader channel
we're going to go ahead and start that
here and i have a eight gig USB thumb
drive plugged into the back of the wii
there you could put in a much bigger
drive and then we select our storage
device or either mass storage or we
could put an sdhc card in there i'm just
going to go with the USB mass storage
and you can see here not a whole lot of
space only get six gigs free but they're
already i've backed up mario party eight
and i can go ahead and like launch it
from here or i can hit plus with a wii
disc in the drive and start downloading
that to an iso file on our USB stick
here so it takes about an hour for a
single layer we disk to download to USB
drive and keep in mind your USB Drive is
going to be formatted in what's known as
wbfs we brew file system now I'm not
really sure if it's ext3 or what but the
thing is you need this
program on your Windows computer called
wbfs manager and you can go ahead and
grab that and what it allows you to do
here is select your drive you load it up
and and you'll see all of the ISO is
that you've downloaded to your to your
hard drive there and you can even
extract them you click little extract
button down here and it will allow you
to save that I so out it even has the
ability to down to scour the net and
download the cover art for your games
which is excellent so once we've
extracted our I so here you can see I've
got the dolphin 64-bit edition of the
emulator up here and I got a couple of
games I have legitimately downloaded
here like my zelda winwaker super smash
brothers brawl and mario party eight and
i can show you right here i actually
legitimately on all of this okay so so
let's go ahead and dive right into the
emulator so i'm going to launch dolphin
really easy to configure like for
example if I wanted to change my
controller options they've got a sweet
little checkbox here i just plugged in
the USB version of the xbox 360 gamepad
and i just checked this box that says
enable x 360 and that's it or imap my
controls to whatever else i can even do
wiimote which is pretty nifty lots of
options in there to have fun with anyway
all i really need to do is go ahead and
open i'm just going to go ahead and show
you show you mario party here and i'm
going to load a save because it's got
save states right so I gotta save state
here already going good all right so
I've started up mario party 8 here and
as you can tell not every game works
perfectly i got a bunch of graphical
glitches here but you know it's still
playable but it's probably not the best
choice really i actually went ahead and
spent all the time to download the dual
layer discs here the Super Mario
Brothers super smash brothers brawl a
lot of fun game except I have the ntsc
version because I live in you know the
United States and the emulator really
only supports the pal version right now
so I'm looking on play asia or somewhere
to actually buy the pal version be
as you know I'm not downloading an iso
from tpb r.i.p so what I have here is
winwaker so let me go ahead and show you
winwaker and how actually playable it is
so fire up dolphin again open and my is
all the wind waker and it's nice because
you get these little save states here so
like i can press you know f1 f2 to cycle
through my save spots and there you go
with my xbox 360 controller here i am
chopping and chopping and doing all that
fun stuff that delta does so I mean
that's pretty much it aside from you
know some wonky pneus with the emulator
it's still it's pretty still pretty
early in the game but it's a lot of fun
I mean you know the the most of the
gamecube games run excellently and you
know the wii games are only getting
better and better with every build so
definitely check that out and find all
of the details of how to pull all this
off and it went really fast but all of
that is in our show notes at hak5 org I
think at this point I am going to go
ahead and then summon the rest of the
hak5 Cruz so we can wrap this bad boy up
alright guys so we hope you enjoyed this

fun I'm dude I'm like blink and I'm like
oh super badass you know what I forgot
to mention in the segment that I just
did is if you want to get dolphin
actually working there's two little
nuggets there and that is you need to ad
microsoft visual c++ 2008 service pack 1
and you're also going to need the latest
directx runtime and you might as well
just go ahead and update your video
drivers as well while you're at it but
yeah you do all those three things and
you will be golden when it comes to
slash and things is linked so are those
like the three things that take you a
couple of hours to figure out because
you can't find the documentation
anywhere let's just say vbulletin is not
really known for its search function but
google with site colon forums d dolphin
dash mne you
calm with the queries and the bullying
much better than the people who oh my
god vbulletin is horrible which is why
we don't run it yeah what are we good
style IP new version coming out here
soon too by the way out speaking of new
versions we are working on the new
version of the hak5 website which darren
is working very hard on right there yeah
and a new store which you can get just
got that huge labeler thing I'm so
excited you're becoming that guy I'm
like dude it's a hack I love complex
systems it's why I love trains it's why
i love atc air traffic control that's
why i love digital slrs did you see a
bathroom has a spot open for vice
president of communications I know right
exciting i did lose mine but uh but yeah
so you guys can go over to hack 5 org
slash suckers for right now / stickers
and the new website i should have
hopefully 4 512 that's gonna be an epic
episode do512 that's how much kilobytes
of RAM my first computer add yeah well
the 64 k kg I got now but um but yes so
that's what's going on say you got
stickers if you're looking for a
pineapple Darren is still selling them
at hak5 dot org slash pineapple I'm like

something cuz to make that work oh I
hear Chicago cons Chicago con having
them on the website yes we are Chicago
Hans pool you know great guys putting
that on it's the same people that do the

engineering masters class that's the
cool thing was a crazy Bell guys from
Tiger Team if you're familiar with that
series and they've even got ok so the
conference is hundred bucks is the
ethical hacker hacking conference going
on that Friday may 18th through Saturday
