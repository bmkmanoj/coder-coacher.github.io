by Atlassian welcome to hat tip the show
will we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers growers and IT
ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morris and
today we are talking about man pages
okay so first off I realize talking
about man pages is very much Linux
terminal 101 but I realized that I had
never actually done an episode about
customizing output for man pages so I
figured why not so man which is short
for manual stores a bunch of information
about different kinds of commands that
you can run into that you would normally
use in the terminal they are often
written by the developers that wrote the
commands but not all the time and they
are all different so you will find that
most man pages follow a bit of
organization there's description of the
command what it does and then some
options that you can use it with
sometimes you will also find examples
that can be super super useful now man
pages are not always up to date keep
that in mind but they are a really good
starting point for understanding a new
command if you want to find a man page
that you want to look at so for example
mine I'll try I'll try I'm an IPS and
that's the one I most recently used and
no there is no manual entry for woman
and super easy I can just scroll up and
down with the arrow up and down or I can
page up and down to go to the top or the
bottom or I can use f to move forward B
to move back and I can use spacebar to
skip forward to so super easy just
really nice keyboard shortcuts that you
can use there I can also use the forward
slash just like that to look for some
kind of terminology so I'll look for
route and then hit enter and you'll
notice that it highlights route up here
and then I can use n to skip to the next
saying of route wherever that ends up
being in the in the main page now let's
say that there is a command you don't
remember what the command is actually
called but you know that something
exists using some kind of terminology so
in this case you could actually use man
tack k and then whatever the term is
that you know so for example if I want
to
on law cat but I don't know the full
name law cat I would just be like okay
so I know that law cat has the word cat
in it somewhere
and it turns my text rainbow colors so
what I can do is go over to manna stack
kay and look for cat and this is going
to bring up everything that has cat
somewhere in the main page so I'll just
scroll up and look for something that
involves rainbow colors and eventually
I'll find it rainbow coloring of text
and it's called law cat by the way if
you want to install lock out yourself
it's just simply sudo apt install law
cat and it's really really cute
trust me it's totally worth it okay so
now that you hopefully have law cat
installed because it's so adorable let's
go ahead and take a quick break to thank
our sponsor let's be honest your code is
your world you create it you tweak it
and you lovingly obsess over it every
single day so picking the right
repository management tool is super
important only the best for your code
same with me only the best for my code
that's why the team at Atlassian created
bit bucket the bucket is the get
solution for professional teams helping
over 5 million developers build with a
purpose the bucket gives teams of all
sizes free that's right
again I said free private repositories
with state-of-the-art features like the
world's best pool request algorithm
built in continuous delivery in
integrations with your favorite tools
like docker AWS and Adger plus you get
JIRA integration since it is from
Atlassian giving your team everything
you need to take your code from concept
to customer we've used bitbucket here to
share private code and collaborations
with each other so that the code is so
perfect before we ever release it into
the wild the bucket is for the code that
takes us to Mars it's for the code that
decodes the human genome or it drives
your next car or for us InfoSec people
maybe it's for your next InfoSec tool
you can visit bitbucket org slash for
the code to start your free account
that's bitbucket org slash for the code
try bitbucket today what will your code
do we are now back with more man pages
so let's say I just want to know what a
command does not necessarily open up the
man page because that's just too much
work for me so I can do this with man
tack F so in the case of look at it
would just be man tech
slaw cat and then that will bring up la
cat and tell me exactly what it does
whatever the description might be if you
think your man pages need to be updated
you can use man tack you law cat to
update the database so you'll notice
that law cat has a six after it and that
basically just means that it falls under
the games category now there are eight
different categories that you can run
into so the highest number that you will
see over there is a number eight so I'll
list those out for you from number one
that would be anything like ssh agent
like this one or it could be CD or make
directory number two is low-level stuff
like socket right here or it might
include chmod c library functions that's
number three that's going to include
beep HTML parser and then you have
number four which is special devices so
special devices would be anything like
LP console and a lot more
number five is for file formats and
conventions so this would include passwd
apt hosts those also know fall under
that category and then number six again
is games which is self-explanatory
number seven is going to be miscellanea
and number eight is system for things
like mount and shutdown now some
commands may fall into more than one
category keep that in mind whenever
you're looking through here but I
believe they usually list them with the
lowest number possible now that's about
all you need to know on man pages but be
