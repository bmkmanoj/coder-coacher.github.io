by domain.com hello welcome to act 5
it's your weekly dose of technology i'm
darren kitchen Shannon Morris is with us
a little later on in the episode talking
about some cygwin action that's right a
little bit of Linux windows lovin and I
am actually up in Eugene Oregon with
Peter talking about drones so let's just
kick it over to there
welcome back to our drone series to
recap we are building a autonomous
platform for awesomeness and we're using
an open-source flight controller and
that's where we're picking it up Peter
cuz we need to dive in and start setting
this guy up as we talked about in the
last segment in the series about the
flight rent rollers we're talking with
some of the sensors the magnetometer is
an accelerometers and gyroscopes and
barometers and other things like that
that were I think we were demonstrating
in the Lisa S which is your really small
version this is the smallest yet and
we're using the slightly larger version
yet it says it's bit easier to handle
because it has bigger connectors and
stuff so this is the Lisa M yeah the
Lisa M and it has actually less sensors
than the other one but the bigger and
has less the bigger and has less sensors
but it has enough for us for now so it
contains a an IMU called aspirin and it
contains 3-axis gyroscope three axis
accelerometer and three axis
magnetometer and a barometer so so the
only thing that it doesn't have built
onto the board is the GPS GPS do I do a
fully autonomous flight and we're going
to come back to the GPS because it will
support it yes that's correct but that's
something we will plug in later well
this is really exciting I want to know
how do I go ahead and do it like is it
simply a matter of pulling it out of the
box plugging in the pins well yeah I
mean I think we have to tell it like how
does it know if we're using a quadcopter
or a hex rider or something crazy that's
a cross between an airplane and
a quadcopter that's right so we
definitely have to tell it what to do
and how to do it and to what we are
planning to fly with it it by default
comes with jessa bootloader only no
firmware on it
what kind of loader are we talking it's
a DFU bootloader so we use the same one
in the rubber ducky it's yes exactly
you're easy to use so this makes it
super easy to just plug it in over USB
and you can flash and work so why do we
need to flash the firmware to it because
there is no firmware for first of all on
it but otherwise we have to also tell it
what exactly we are doing so it's more
so than just like giving it say a
configuration file yes so the difference
here to some other projects is the
paparazzi actually integrates a lot of
its settings inside the firmware so that
there is no chance by to change it by
accident while you're in flight so it is
the approach is more ok we can change
some settings to tune stuff but at the
end you want it to be compiled in so
that there is no accidental change in
for example your gains and this thing
falls out of the sky so we're so we're
actually going to be configuring a
quadcopter program compiling it and then
flashing it on that's right yeah and the
the process is quite streamlined in
paparazzi because it's an integral part
of actually putting something in air
it's actually compiling the firmware so
what software on our computer we're
going to need to speak to this guy so we
basically there are some already a bunch
of videos of how to set up paparazzi in
the first place you just download a few
packages on Ubuntu or Debian or on Mac
OS there are also binary installers for
it so we download that package and then
you clone the git repository of
paparazzi
type make and then it compiles
everything that you will need and you
should be good to go
nice well let's go ahead and take a look
at it so first thing that we will start
because let's assume we all have already
paparazzi installed on on our laptop is
the so called paparazzi Center this is
the control center of our operations
because Papua is really like a suite of
applications that's right yeah more than
just like one
you know configured like configuration
script you've got the build scripts and
and you've got the ground centers yeah
calibration scripts and in two limitary
tools yeah that's that's right and
there's also all the modules and the
firmware it's like an ecosystem let's
say sure okay so now we start paparazzi
and this is what we are presented with
it is at the paparazzi Center and it
divides in three columns okay so we go
from left to right all right the first
thing that you want to do is to select
an aircraft and by default paparazzi
starts up and loads a few example
aircraft for you okay so this is this
drop down here a c4 aircraft and there
is a bunch of example ones already
pre-loaded for you right so like a hexa
Lisa L would be like a hexacopter
hexacopter with a Lisa autopilot on it
okay for example like a quad with Lisa M
or a quad with the Lisa S or with an OP
go
it's another auto pilot that paparazzi
supporter I'm even seeing some airframes
that are familiar there's a Bixler up
there there's a source way yeah in fact
we that that's in fact even the AR Drone
yet we have air drawn in two flavors
actually using the the official SDK and
not using it bypassing their official
SDK because you can get some things done
better without really annoying there's
the K that's a pretty cool way to just
get something off the shelf yeah like
right into paparazzi when is this so it
really is valuable you don't even you
know for instance you're just using its
flight control and reprogramming yeah
that's right that's right yeah you can
cross compile basically to do that we're
talking about this thing runs on x86 so
why is your laptop not in fact flying
yeah yeah why not or or anything else or
your cell phone or anything right yes
okay
in our case because for our build series
we will be using a certain set up that
using the Lisa M this is what we decided
on because that has good set of features
and for that we will start with the quad
Lisa m2 airframe so over time when you
get to it you basically will replace
that set of configurations with your own
and it will basically show your aircraft
hangar content so this is why you're
saying also to get cloned because that
way you always get the latest from the
repository as far as like figurations
that's aircraft yeah there's there are
stable ones stays stable releases that
have their tags and stuff and you also
do your fork and then you can have your
configurations in the fork if you make
any changes it is super easy to send
pull requests in fact speaking of
changes we will be in fact building for
the specific airframe that we'll be
getting into in the next segment we're
going to be configuring it and then we
will have that as a part of the download
so you'll it'll just be in the drive we
will we will add it to our cook our
examples it will be in paparazzi so just
so we will probably put it somewhere in
the comments nice alright so so on the
left side of the aircraft then I have my
airframe and so so the consists of
several several files that are being
combined to a one like configuration of
a specific aircraft so airframe is what
airframe is it an AR Drone with which
autopilot this is this part defining the
hardware that we are flying okay then we
have the next one is the flight plan
this is something we will get much later
into is what when we are flying
completely out and honestly what the
aircraft will do because we can program
it like with blocks kind of if you've
ever used like Lego Mindstorm or or some
of those other
I don't know node-based that's
resistance we can really do some pretty
powerful stuff with the ground station
there's our the with the flight plan
telling it do this and then wait for
conditions and then if everything is how
we expect it to listen to sensors and
based on that to could jump to a
different block and right yeah hit the
it's basically a domain-specific
language for those that are that know
computer science and you you basically
program it in a very high level terms
you rarely very rarely if you have
something incredibly complicated you
might need to go in to see but it's
normally not necessary okay so the next
thing is a set of settings that this
aircraft supports over the telemetry
link this is a set that we provide to
expose the internals to the user while
we are flying to do settings again as I
said yes we compile it firmware and we
compile in the default settings so that
they don't change but we still while in
flight are able to change things that we
expose and we explicitly say that we
want to be able to make changes to
variables mid-flight yes so we can tune
for example the controls of this thing
so that it is very nice and stable
dynamically while we are flying and
after we are done with those we might
decide okay we are done with this this
is stable we know that it is the right
thing and remove that setting from being
exposed so that there is no chance of
changing it cool okay so the next thing
is a radio this is something in our case
because we use spectrum receivers that
are completely and digital this is a we
don't
it is completely being ignored the radio
part this is only needed if you have ppm
receivers namely they not standard RC
receivers that output the pwm signal
that you measure it so PWM pulse width
modulation versus using York basically
in our case we'd use a serial output of
the satellite receivers and that the
satellites are output
and we are just reading this serial
digital data directly from our remote
control more or less okay and the
telemetry and the telemetry that again
configuration which information we want
to receive from the from the aircraft
while we are flying right like if we
want to know what the battery status is
and if we want to know at what angle is
it pitched and things like that that's
right and if you for example adding new
sensors or Gimbels or you can you can
modify this and say okay I have this
very special sensor on my aircraft that
outputs the the flux of the molecule
societies yeah yeah yeah some with ease
and we can we can basically add
additional telemetry packets and put
them into the telemetry setup and get
them to the ground alright so that's the
left side is our aircraft then what are
the other bits so the next bit after we
selected that this is in our case also
completely fine this is a nice default
setup for the Lisa M so next part is
basically compiling the deformer that
goes onto the autopilot and then we have
if you do it ever on the command line
you have make and then make clean and
make make all to compile everything so
clean is the first button and you can
select which target you want to select
so ap is the auto pilot and PS would be
the simulator so you can run so we can
test it before we even yes that's right
n where yeah that's that's right we
could test it we could compile a
simulator and run the whole autopilot on
the ground so the entire flight plan
could be running in your laptop without
ever rotor spinning yeah that's right
that's right you can test your complete
flight plan and that basic settings are
right and it is not doing weird things
before you even put it on there okay so
we select autopilot
the default flash mode is nominee affine
and
you can press build and it will compile
a timer look GCC it's actually like you
said this is C code that it's simply
turning now into a what like a bin file
or a hex or something - yeah it's an elf
file or and Emily generates generates
identifiers and then DF and so at this
point we're ready to use DF you uploader
do not load it to the autopilot so very
similar to flashing the firmware on your
router at home we're going to go ahead
and do that here right right so the
thing with Liam what you do is you have
a micro micro USB connector and we just
take a micro USB cable and plug that in
and we get a nice cylon I love that
blink pattern so this means that the
bootloader is running okay and it is
waiting for data to be flashed to it so
it detects that we plugged in USB and it
is waiting for you to upload the
firmware okay in then when you have it
in your aircraft then you have a
separate source of power from the
battery and then it won't be in and but
it makes it super easy when you have it
already in the aircraft just plugging in
USB and it will automatically go into
bootloader so you can upload a new
firmware if you need to do all changes
so now go ahead and push the firmware
yeah let's flush the firmware just press
the upload button and there we go
and it is done and we see that the
autopilot is initializing we see the
fast blinking red LED is showing that
the IMU is calibrating at startup so it
is taking a little bit of time to figure
out where gyroscope zero is so that it
is so no sample so it knows where the
ground is and waits
yeah angle is again it's all completely
configurable what you do it's like you
can switch it off you can make it longer
you can make it shorter it's beautiful
setup it's like when you get into the
details of it the green LED is the life
LED it will always blink with one second
interval
showing you that deferment didn't crash
quickly so that a heartbeat
it's a heartbeat yeah exactly and the
other LEDs will show also different
status like for example do we have GPS
fix is the radio working is the battery
still working it's also again completely
configurable so that's setting up the
aircraft and down building the firmware
so I take it at this point
we're ready to fly but not really
because we're not about to hook this up
to motors you see what happens ya know
they kind of want to make sure that all
the sensors are never there I'm working
right yeah yeah it's like I I would
rather do that yes take it dig in you
could try to put it in and say I I
wouldn't recommend to do that in any
case I guess so how do we get the
telemetry so from this now so there is a
serial port that you connect to so I
have an an adapter here it is an ftdi
usb-to-serial it's the floss high-tech
and it has a serial connector here and
we can just plug it into the telemetry
port okay you just look up on the wiki
there is beautiful graphics showing
where what is what and what things are
available and then after we connected
this we can just execute in the third
section of the program a session and
this session is starting up the ground
control station so a ground control
station is is showing us why is this
where we plan our this is not where we
plan our flight plan this is where we
would get the light lemon this is this
is bait this is your tool on the ground
that you and it's your it's your tower
it's your second remote control more or
less its day it's the computer program
that is the remote control when it when
the aircraft is flying completely
autonomously let's say okay but we can
use it has a lot of more information
about the status of the aircraft so this
is something you would want to start
first to see that everything
doing well right so even though we're of
course we're going to start out flying
manually with a controller with a remote
but it is nice to see what it's feeding
back yeah we are basing later when we
get into taking stuff wool we are taking
a look inside its brain it's like what
are you thinking overhead kind of your
thoughts were what is it thinking so and
the GCS divides in several sections we
have the map and that's in the black
area we can just load the maps it's just
some random place because we don't have
a GPS plugged in well let's see some
random place than some random place hey
hey nice and straight cool we can zoom
in into the map and then we see a basic
flight plan containing and so where are
we we are this quadrocopter in the
middle let me move this way point here
so we see this quadrotor with the arrow
in the front so that arrows so that line
is pointing towards now this is its
track it's where I came from but it's a
it's just an artifact of actually
starting up where the waypoints didn't
update yet and and the second thing that
is also interesting is the PFD it's the
virtual horizon so if we take the Lisa M
in our hand and if we tilt it forward
okay this is the imaginary forward of oh
I see
tilted forward and we see the horizon
Asst oh no we're pointing towards the
ground yeah we are pointing towards the
ground
pull up around pull up pull up and the
sky oh wow and then we tilt it left so
you see the horizon is still think this
is the horizon you have to be careful
because it is easy to get confused it is
from the perspective of a someone
sitting inside the aircraft so you are
basically imagine yourself being
teeny-tiny and sitting on the on the
autopilot on the top of the PC d ya know
about the PCB and then looking at the
horizon then which I guess would kind of
illustrate why it's
that the PCB is secured to the frame
yeah yeah laughing around yes because
this is your as we said your co-pilot so
don't let him flop around in the
aircraft a bumpy ride oh yeah cool so
what what is what is the center that's
feeding us that lemon tree back and so
this is a complete already a fusion of
several sensors together so we have and
also the magnetic orientation is showing
when you look at the map so up here on
the map I can see that arrow just
changed yeah if you rotate it okay so it
will pause our yaw so we have yaw and
then down there we can see the pitch and
roll yes and so this is the basic
information about the how the aircraft
is pointed and then each aircraft in the
GCS will get also a block here on the
Left left lower corner okay with
information about about its status so we
get an orange block about the battery
charge so how many much voltage we don't
have a battery connected at the moment
so zero and then what is the status of
the aircraft is it in kill mode is it in
nav mode dadada kill mode yeah kill mode
means we don't want the drones are
killed out on the ground you want you
don't want it to commit so they live
that's suddenly without you wanting it
so he'll note is like no rotors or
spinning no rotor spinning and please
don't change that fact okay it's not
fire the missiles mode now and got it no
that's
oh and hey look AGL above ground level
yes that's the you take the information
from the GPS and the barometer together
and then you can calculate the altitude
so you get the AGL so when we
incorporate this live telemetry back to
us with even with our remote we're
already adding a lot of value because
you can see in the sky you're like oh
there I am I wonder about oh hi I am
yeah that's right look down there you
are yeah that's that's the beautiful
thing it's when you even when you are
flying completely manually
and having it GPS - is a very nice thing
and having the telemetry is also really
useful imagine you do something wrong
let's not do anything wrong but it flies
away and you want to find it it is nice
to have the telemetry so it's like hey
I'm going I'm going for a Slurpee piece
that you've got like the the GPS
coordinates of where it yeah yeah it's a
yes yeah it's useful like hanging out in
a field with all the other quad copters
alright and yeah the rest is related to
also the link quality and so on and so
forth but we will we will discuss all
the details when we just continue
building it up and try flying well
that's what I'm excited about because in
the next segment we're actually breaking
out the kit we've got a really cool kit
in fact and it's time to actually start
building this and soldering things
together and putting motors in and
suddenly things are going to start
spinning yes oh yes stay tuned for that
but we're going to take a quick break
you know there's only ten kinds of
people in the world those who don't
understand binary and those who know
that when you've got a killer idea you
need to stab yourself a domain name and
web hosting fast and domain.com let me
tell you they've got the quickest domain
discovery system and easy checkout
process to get you up and running in no
time and I love the guys over to remain
calm because they're easy to use they're
reliable they're affordable they're huge
on social media you can tweet them at
domain.com and see why we think there's
just such a fun place to do business and
get this they're a huge fans of hack
five so they want to hook you up if you
use the coupon code hak5 at checkout you
can Dexter fifteen percent off so when
you think domain names think domain.com
we're back and it's now time for the
trivia question of the week so last
week's trivia question was who coined
the term robot and the answer was Yosef
or Joseph
Cappetta si AAP EK now this week's
question is what was the first
commercial application of micro
processors you can answer that over at
hack 5 org slash trivia for your chance
to win some awesome hack 5 goodies
cygwin you all know it you all love it
but for the people that don't know it I
decided to talk about it today it's been
around for years since 1995 I think so
up kind of a long time and a thought
occurred to me we have never demoed
cygwin on the show so first off what is
cygwin well it's a GPU licensed open
source Linux like environment for
anybody that's running on a Windows
machine so whether you're running
Windows 64 or 32-bit you can install
this baby now I've installed it on my
64-bit Windows 8.1 laptop and it runs
just fine which is great with sigmund
installed you can gain access to a bunch
of standard unix utilities so you can
use it with bash or the Windows command
prompt yay so cool
and this could be incredibly useful if
you want to say you need to work on a
Windows box at work and they don't want
you to install Linux or you want to be
able to use original Linux commands and
you don't really want to use the new
Linux ones or you don't want to learn
that completely new toolset for Windows
I mean who really wants to use dir when
you can use LS I mean come on people
it is a dll file and it works as a Linux
API layer with Linux API functionality
so how do you install this baby well you
go over to cygwin comm very simple
website up here you go to install cygwin
and you got to know whether you are a
32-bit or 64-bit my computer is 64 so I
just installed the 64 dot exe version so
super super easy once you have that
installed and I'll show you what the
installation looks like go over here to
my downloads and keep this file don't
delete it because it will come into use
later on so I'll hit yes and you
basically just run through the
installation click Next a whole bunch of
times choose all the defaults so that
way you don't have any kind of problems
so just install from the cygwin website
32 64 installation should not take too
long and you'll need to choose a mirror
site to download it from and during it
you'll see this crazy page that has a
bunch of optional packages but for now
just stick with the default just don't
go any nuts and don't click all of them
because it will take like 14 hours to
download the entire thing
we don't want to do that so just click
next and move on so for me installation
took about 15 minutes and I created a
shortcut on my Start menu and on my
desktop to make it super super simple so
once I have everything installed I just
go over here to cygwin 64 the terminal
yeah it's so pretty
click on that and you get a simple
little terminal so once you get cygwin
installed it's fairly similar to using a
regular linux command line interface
like bash so you can try out some normal
commands that you normally use like for
example I can type in PWD and I can see
I'm in the home slash Shannon folder I
could use CD and then dot dot to go back
if I wanted to let's see what's in here
LS not dir Shannon so I could go back
into there if I wanted to I could use
touch to create new text files if I want
to I could do it pretty much anything
that I went to now of course we learned
a lot of these in my Linux terminal 101
series on hat tip so make sure to watch
that if you need a brief overview or if
you forgot any of them which I kind of
did and also keep in mind you may need
to run as an admin to be able to run a
bunch of the different commands just you
know right click run as admin super
simple so let's do something simple
alright so I'm going to go ahead and
close this I'm going to run as an admin
so I will select yes all right so we got
a nice big box for us to work in so
basically here I'm just going to create
a I'm going to create a text file I want
to read from it and I'm gonna maybe
write something new to it so let's see
first off where am I
okay so I have a text file already in
that folder that I'm in right now so
this is my cygwin folder and if you're
wondering where you end up you end up
under C cygwin home shannon and there's
my to-do txt so if i want to create a
new folder or a new file i'll call it
touch let's call this wedding dot txt so
now if i go down here okay so i have
wedding alright so and now i want to
let's say i want
add something to it so I'll type echo
whatever I want my text to be remember
to pay winning then you fee because that
would be really crappy if I forgot to do
that and then add it to wedding txt and
you can just tab over just like you can
in Linux press ENTER so now I can use
Phi wedding txt and there it is remember
to pay a wedding venue fee and if I hit
wedding there just remember to pay
wedding venue fee so yeah it works
totally just like I thought it would
ctrl Z gets me out of there so super
super simple everything works as it
should now say you want to customize it
you want to put some new packages in you
want to maybe change around the terminal
because you don't really like what it
looks like right now
now the terminal that you get sent to
whenever you download cygwin is called
minty but you have other options as well
you can use alternate programs like
console you can also use minty which
change the look and feel of the program
so you have lots of options you can also
download new packages so this is why we
want to keep that setup.exe file that we
opened previously so if I go down here
to setup keep it at all users click Next
a couple of times direct connection yes
same mirror I'll keep it on the same one
so it's going to download real quick if
there's any updates to the setup file
now we have this really big screen that
has all these packages that you can
choose from so these are kind of crazy
and if you don't work in Linux a whole
lot it might be kind of confusing so I
would say add things on as you need them
because you you really don't want to
download all of them at the same time or
you'll end up with just a bunch of
really really long wait times so I'm
going to go up here to games and you can
see I've already downloaded one right
here you can also uninstall it reinstall
it or just keep it the same as it is
right now I'm going to choose this one
so I just clicked on skip chose to
download it the bin and 24k that's like
tiny so that's good click Next and now
I'm downloading a new package so
obviously I'm not using apt-get
like you normally would but it works
pretty much the same it just has a GUI
interface so once this is done
installing click finish and I'm going to
reopen this just close anyway I know
that's totally bad but I'm going to
close it anyway and I'm going to right
click run as admin again yes and I think
that one was called nin vader's yeah
okay so this is some kind of video game
ha ASCII yay ah there we go

you can see things work like they should
in Linux but you're on your Windows
machine that's so cool yes I know that

need to work in the terminal and do a
few fun little things on your Windows
machine now tell me what you like most

it into a computer and actually record
