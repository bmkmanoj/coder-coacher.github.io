by Jackthreads and if you look at the
remote control they are here so we have
thrust on the left stick then we have
your on this stick and we have pitch and
roll so this is being translated
directly into the actuation of the
airframe okay so we can take those and
we want to define them we could also add
additional commands like for example if
you have a camera on it you want to add
a command to be able to actuate it in
Peggy ad servers on the amur it seems to
me egg painting and stuff exactly or you
have something you want if FN SLR you
want to make make a photo you would add
automatically and they could make a shot
or start recording us what we wanted to
fire the missiles oh yeah so and then
the laws so well those common laws are
how the commands that you have are being
translated into other comments you can
create new commands in between so you
can do some math depending on how
complicated you things are in our case
it is we only have a your that is
translating into the motion of the
Elevens so we have it translating an 11
left and 11 right are based on the roll
command so in this case so sorry it is a
roll command that is situated I see so
next thing would be in actuators for a
micro copter motor controller we don't
use that this is just just a placeholder
in this case but we have additional
coefficients here lower it is pitch
coefficient r 0 coefficient yo
coefficient and thrust coefficient these
are basically the translation from the
command to the modern thrust command so
because this airframe is similar to a
quadrocopter it is using the thrust
difference to actuate in the whole
airframe and legs all these going at one
speed in these going at another exactly
so if you want to pitch down then you
would speed up the upper ones and
decrease the speed of the lower odds
so this translates dielec directly to
this what are those four values then so
these values are basically the
translation sign translation from from
take command if I put a pitch command it
is being multiplied by this value so it
is between zero and one and it is
translating it into a command to the
actuator so in this case if I pitch a
good pitch then it would be minus two
hundred fifty six to 12 the a1 minus 256
to a2 and soap and water to b1 and b2 or
yeah b1 and b2 is the same order as as
you find above great it's very very
simple the same for role in this case so
if you want to see you could modify
these so that it was slower banks like
the baby's like it is no in this case we
have a translation if we have a complete
our other order of the motors if you
added more motors you would have
additional positions you could like take
something like this grab a off-the-shelf
airframe and then attach the exact menu
just have redefined and you can just you
can just take two bars put them in a V
for example and put the motors and say
like okay to actuate those i need to
multiply the values like this and done
so it is that's like really versatile
that's a lot easier than like going into
the C code and changing it on that level
we even have a habit or in the paparazzi
wiki or a description how you can
calculate this values by just measuring
you frame and saying where everything is
located then you just run it and you get
this values out yeah so you don't have
to sit there doing trial and error
because trial and error with software
okay but trial and error when you've got
you know an expensive craft yeah much
exactly it's with hardware it's well
that's a great way for somebody to go
ahead and start modifying to start
hacking away at what's already existing
in this XML I know that you can get a
lot more in depth with it I mean
paparazzi all being open source up and
that being so cool that you were able to
take you know using like the open-source
paparazzi stuff that had already defined
fixed-wing aircraft
as well as rota quadro quadricopter or
multicopters and this the quad shot here
being kind of like a marriage of both
was it you know I know it's not just a
matter of like copying and pasting the
code from the both libraries or whatever
but how much would you say that helped
you from from a standpoint of you know
prototyping oh yeah it's so killing it
because because it is modular to be
beside all these settings you have also
modules that you can load through the
XML but definitely having already the
rotorcraft support and then having the
airplane support a we already had
something to work out so we started
basically with a quadrocopter code so it
could hover only and then we started
adding the code from this from the
airplane side and marriage in that
together and also improved our control
so so we had a base to work at a certain
point to this guy come up and then tell
and then become an airframe later and
everything like this this is the idea to
to have both have egg hovering airplane
that is stable and easy to to to hold in
place it doesn't run away or fly away in
this case and then you can transition
you to horizontal flight and have much
more insurance fly further for longer
and do also 3d aerobatic flight so got
to steal let's talk about actually
flying it away you have software in here
this part of is it part of the propeller
software the ground control software so
this is paparazzi da edition so GCS yeah
ground control station is part of
paparazzi we currently not don't support
it yet so we have the hardware supports
using GPS and so on and so forth but and
paparazzi does support autonomous flight
that's where the GCS would come in so we
we are working on getting the support of
that working too but first first we want
their friend to be stable and work right
of course of course we take a look at
what that looks like short sure it and
so here it is this is a place in to
loose this is the flying field of
Antoine okay I suck
here he is this is an example in this
case we are running just a simulator not
an actual airplane in the background
okay that makes things easier so this is
a micro jet it's an airplane with with
an autopilot on it it is simulated in
software so that we don't have to like
always fly the actual thing we can debug
our software we can work oh good it's
like we were talking about prototyping
with exactly okay so you've got like a
virtual version of Warcraft and what are
these points that I'm seeing around here
so this R this R waypoints we have a
waypoint for home and we have additional
waypoint called standby after the
airplane takes off it make circles
around standby we also have two
additional points it called one and two
and this is where we can do some
additional flight around them so let me
let me launch the vehicle and I launched
it we see the airplane here it's this
little blue guy little blue guy and it
is taking off and soon we will see the
carrot here the orange triangle this is
what it is trying to follow the green
circle circle is the circle that it will
fly around the stem PI point we also see
that we have 2.7 meters a second wind
simulated so the airplane is being
pushed away and trying to keep steady on
the green line even though it is being
pushed away by wind so this is where
where the nature you have control loops
and the autopilot doing it for you so no
I am NOT flying it it is flying by its
own yeah nice and then you can just give
it additional flight plans and yes I can
choose for example for example I can
switch directly to figure 8 around point
1 and 2 and then we see the first circle
of the eighth and when it continues you
will see that it will start making eight
surround the point one and two nice that
is so cool is it you see that the
direction that this will go when when
more people get their hands on instr huh
yes I yeah that's that's the hope of
ours it's like the more people have it
in their hands and
and do more with it and I we are really
looking forward what they will do with
it and this is like the the place where
you can get like having the completely
autonomous flight and do very
interesting video flights or
surveillance or finding finding people
in the forest that got lost and so on
and so for that is so cool and I can't
wait for more people to get their hands
on this and start hacking away with it
especially with that xml looks really
easy to just like get started where can
people find out more about how they can
get one and get Bob project so you can
find more on the kwacha com it's our
website we also have a website for
paparazzi itself it's paparazzi anakata
far this is a wiki this there is a lot
of information about paparazzi itself so
you can find everything there there is
also a quite a big community with
mailing lists and everything so
wonderful all right well we love that
open sourcing stuff especially when it
varies flight will be back in just a bit

dude those were popular they were like
fun really popular just sent I know I I
did another recent one with a foil foil
yes no this is a Faraday cage I messed
up completely I'm gonna have to revisit
this because guess what I didn't ground
it oh yeah yeah so thank you ham
operators Wow okay got a lot of emails
about that one didn't you yeah maybe a
few all right well tell me about this
