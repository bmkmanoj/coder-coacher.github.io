the Ben Heck show
aaron swartz who co-authored RSS at the
age of 14 it was also the designer of
the code layer of the creative commons
one of the earliest architects of
creative commons i was also the founder
of info gommi which later merged with
Reddit and the founder of demand
progress which in 2010 was a huge
campaign against internet censorship
bills and was instrumental in blocking
SOPA and PIPA legislation Aaron was a
genius technologist in a
multi-disciplined activist one of his
areas of interest was public access to
information now short for journal
storage JSTOR is a library containing
digitized back issues of academic
journals including books and even
current journals now most access to
JSTOR is through subscription in late
2010 and in early 2011 Schwartz use a
laptop hidden in the basement network
closet of MIT building 16 to bulk
download a substantial portion of
JSTOR's articles when JSTOR noticed they
stopped the downloading and identified
that it was Schwartz the content was
secured with the confirmation from
Schwartz that the content was not and
would not be used copied transferred or
distributed the next month Schwartz was
criminally indicted by direction of the
United States Attorney office while Jace
or was subpoenaed they were also quick
to point out that it was the
government's decision to prosecute and
not their own and that JSTOR was only
interested in securing the content not
starting an ongoing legal matter
Schwartz pled not guilty in September of
2012 since then Schwartz's moved to
Brooklyn New York working on the Avaaz
foundation of Oz meaning voice in
several European Middle Eastern and
Asian languages it's a non-profit whoa
global web movement to bring people
powered politics to decision-making
everywhere and on January 11 2013 Aaron
took his own life at age 26 from his
Brooklyn apartment many people including
his family are clear that the pending
legal case against him undoubtedly
tributed to his death from the official
statement from family and partner of
Aaron Schwartz quote Aaron's death is
not simply a personal tragedy it is the
product of criminal justice system rife
with intimidation and prosecutorial
overreach decisions made by officials in
the Massachusetts US Attorney's Office
and at MIT contributed to his death the
US Attorney's Office pursued an
exceptionally harsh array of charges
carrying potentially over 30 years in
prison to punish an alleged crime that
had no victims meanwhile unlike JSTOR
MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and
its own communities most cherished
principles JSTOR responded with a
statement of heartfelt condolences to
Aaron's family friends and anyone who
loved knew and admired him in the days
following Aaron's death many academics
have posted to Twitter PDFs of journal
articles as a tribute with the hash tag
pound PDF tribute anonymous launched a
denial of service attack against the MIT
Network and compromised to MIT websites
leaving behind a farewell message to
Schwartz the message also calls for
reformation of computer crime laws
copyright and intellectual property laws
and a greater recognition for oppression
and injustice 'as and a commitment to a
free and unfettered internet much of
which has been lifted from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation farewell
to Schwartz in the wake of this tragedy
many are questioning the accountability
for prosecutorial abuse The Wall Street
Journal learned that two days before
Schwartz suicide federal prosecutors
again rejected a plea bargain offer from
Schwartz lawyers which would have kept
him out of prison instead they demanded
that he quote would need to plead guilty
to every count and make clear that quote
the government would insist on prison
time Tector discovered in September that
the US Attorney's Office for the
District of Massachusetts severely
escalated the already excessive for
felony count indictment with an
additional nine felony counts each
carrying the possibility of a fine and
imprisonment of
up to 10 to 20 years / felony at the
funeral Erin's father said quote he was
killed by the government and MIT
betrayed all of its basic principles
while US Attorney Carmen Ortiz and
assistant US attorney Stephen Heymann
have refused to speak publicly on the
matter or to his husband IBM executive
Thomas Dolan posted to Twitter
criticizing the sports family for
assigning blame to the prosecutor with
quote truly incredible in their own sons
obit they blame others for his death
once Dolan's identity was discovered he
received criticism and he deleted his
twitter account House Oversight
Committee darrell Issa on Tuesday opened
investigation on the Justice
Department's prosecution in so stated
quote had he been a journalist and taken
the same material that he gained from
MIT he would have been praised for it it
would have been like the Pentagon Papers
a petition to remove US District
Attorney Carmen Ortiz from the office
garnered more than the required 25,000
signatures for review on whitehouse.gov
aaron has been Herald across the globe

champion of free information his
memorial can be found at remember Aaron
