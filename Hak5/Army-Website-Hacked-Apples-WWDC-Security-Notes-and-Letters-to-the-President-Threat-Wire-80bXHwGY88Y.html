apples all about privacy and more
letters to the White House all that
coming up now on threat wise I'm Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for jun 10
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
first off thanks for supporting our
relaunch let's get started with the
first story the Syrian electronic army
they claim that they have hacked the US
Army's website army mil on Monday June
eighth the website is mainly just used
for news and public information but
pop-ups from the hack were displayed to
visitors or visitor's stating quotes
such as your commanders admit that they
are training the people that they have
sent you to die fighting and one
claiming that the hack came from the SCA
it is suspected that the hack originates
from overseas and the US Army later took
the site down and was confirmed as
compromised this is the second known
hack in six months that has occurred to
a US military website the first being in
January when their social network pages
were breached now the intruders may have
gained access through the limelight
networks content delivery network as
suggested by a screenshot on the essays
Twitter account which shows censored
user names names and emails of many
military personnel in a quote from a
limelight spokesperson to Ars Technica
quote we take security concerns
extremely seriously and in an abundance
of caution we are conducting a full
investigation at this point we have no
reason to believe any customer data has
been compromised so does anybody else
see the contradiction here if that
screenshot is actually real yeah earlier
this week at apple's annual worldwide
developers conference the company shared
some interesting aspects on their views
on privacy as well as open sourcing
their code base so firstly swift to the
programming language for building apps
in the apple club is going to be open
source even allowing code that works
with linux distros what awesome so
second off Apple devices collect your
data locally for better consumer usage
we kind of already know that but Apple
doesn't collect said data on their
servers this is a huge selling point for
apple products due to the ongoing
stretch of government
their tips and third parties to get
anything that they want out of you also
just an FYI I'm an Android user and
lastly in a story that's eerily similar
to one that I recently discussed tech
companies are again sending the White
House letters about privacy the gist of
it is that the information technology
industry Council and the software and
information industry association wrote
quote we urge you not to pursue any
policy or proposal that would require or
encourage companies to weaken these
technologies including the weakening of
encryption or creating encryption
workarounds end quote now while the USA
Freedom Act was passed into law by
President Obama in June second the US
government hasn't created any kind of
agenda about data encryption
specifically currently end-to-end
encryption of several different kinds of
types is available on both iOS and
Android as well as many other platforms
our featured comment today comes from
Jeffrey who wrote Patrick in your report
on hacker one bounties for security
flaws you said that you were curious
about whether this could turn the corner
on security researchers offering
zero-day exploits to the highest bidder
rather than selling them to organized
crime or the NSA is there really a
difference between the two piece well
the NSA doesn't have to give somebody
money to get ahold of that kind of
information so I think that's the only
real difference that I see there the NSA
thanks for the comment Jeffrey if you
have us on on today's stories you can
leave them below in the comments and
before I head out again thank you so
much for supporting threat wire
seriously patreon com is tone goals and
our perks for contributors you can spare
eight cents per episode eight dollars
per month every bit really really does
help and of course we couldn't do it
without some fur babies like this one
new pictures of I so that's cuteness
overload right there we're continuing to
do threat wire three times a week
because this news is so important and
because of you this show is independent
and ad free of course if patreon isn't
in the cards right now for you share the
show with two friends this week that's
what I asked for two friends to learn
about threat wire because everyone
should know what's going on with
security and privacy you can find all of
the threat wire
things at threat wire net and with that
I'm Shannon Morse I'll see you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
