photo bulbs that powers the key lights
went out and made this awesome explosion
inside and I know what to do with it but
it looked really cool so I gave the West
to say hey man come on I know you can do
something fun with this and you've done
some really fun stuff with LEDs so let's
take a little thing to work with all
right so what we got here
it's basically it's a a photosensitive
light so when the lights go dim it comes
on so it's a geek nightlight basically
awesome and it also doubles as a really
good beginners project getting into
electronics hey that's a great great
mantra episode one
yeah I thought so and you guys I
actually do plan on doing a lot more
like Tron stuff is a good place to start
and basically what we're looking at it's
it looks more complicated than what it
is it's actually a fairly simple circuit
once you get past the wiring diagram
which actually threw me for a loop real
quick
where'd you get inspired by this this
actually came off of a hardware hack
that I saw on both Instructables and I
hacked grant went on it to be haven't
been there oh yes a great great resource
to find projects people have come up
with and if you want to repeat on
yourselves but the original project was
a most level well okay so we're using a
big photo bulb here but you could also
use bottle balls with some Courvoisier
whatever you want you can use whole core
bhatia whatever strikes your fancy
whatever you have on hand we just
decided to use this light bulb you know
just don't know but if you're working
with glass please exercise caution
especially if you're going to cut open
light bulb like this one because you are
working with glass short Reggie that's
vacuuming all that funds in there the
vacuums not the big problem it's the
actual if you have to if you happen to
break the glass so yeah it's a very
loose cream course yes you follow all
shop safety as always with any mod that
you do yeah it's okay so can you walk us
through how this thing works okay
basically what we have here is a 9-volt
battery right here and that's obviously
supplying power oh my goodness and two
resistors here one is a 100 K ohm
resistor and the other ones it's like
it's a 460 mm member correctly okay dat
eludes me at this moment they're both
connected to the positive line and the
two resistors goes to the LED and the
LED goes to this NPN type switching
transistor right yes that's really the
brains of all this this is what's making
it work because we have two electrical
currents running here the other the 100
km resistor is connected to our photo
resistor on the back here okay right
there so that's what's giving it the
special sauce so that just would I see
that the LED is shining right here yeah
because I getting oh but I expose it to
the light the LED goes out nice easing
so when the light goes out the LED goes
on oh yeah awesome and and the way these
little photo things work these predators
work is more like they have more
conductive they are okay so it's
stealing the electricity from the
battery then what's it's it's bypassing
the current going through the light so
we still have a continuous electrical
current so it's actually working but the
lights not getting power cool and then
no light it stops being conductive and
then the LED gets the power and you also
seem to have built a pretty spooky
little kind of I don't know it's got
kind of an oriental feel to it little
enclosure for this bulb here and so can
we put this all together and see what it
looks like yeah and of course you know
if I were doing this you know like into
a permanent thing I would I would
tighten this all up right I just need
red cord goodbye Corey yeah breadboard
definitely I just wanted to make sure I
could illustrate the circuitry a little
bit better so if this shorts out well of
course it's going to sort out this is
live television
of course okay yeah is it shorted oh I
got wires touching oh god something here
nevermind it actually decided to work
how about them okay so when the light
goes out I see that's oh oh that's so
much fun
also yeah I can either sit like that
myself down and get you the long tube
window now if somebody wants to build in
their their own at home where did you
finish it and the show notes that we'll
have them the pack five wiki will have
links to the ball the balls like on
Instructables on Instructables or I have
a Sharpie this works sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
