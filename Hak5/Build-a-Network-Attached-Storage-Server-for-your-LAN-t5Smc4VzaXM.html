of us should do but most of us rarely
actually do it whether we just don't
have the correct solution for it the
space whatever now there are some good
solutions out there for network-attached
storage to back your data up to and
aaron has found out a great way to do
that a great way to make a network
attached storage there's a network
attached storage i'm ass an ass if you
will yes what is it Darin well an ass
differs from other network attached
storage I'm sorry
NASA differs from other backup solutions
like a external USB or firewire hard
drive or dat tapes or CD ROMs we're just
you know spare hard drives in your box
because it's the the focus is the
network aspect okay it's on a remote
computer somewhere else attached to the
network so it doesn't have to be
physically attached to your machine
right and the beauty of that is it's the
same thing that you would expect when it
comes to like having a printer that has
its own print server on the land it
becomes a network resource so now rather
than just myself having access to this
backup medium I can give access to West
to Ally and we can all keep our
documents sane and secure okay if you
will and it's away from our machines in
case something happens like me worried
the hard drive dies and I lost a lot and
the magic smoke just poof yeah so now
we're using FreeNAS correct right now
what is FreeNAS well freenas is a
network attached storage solution that's
based on the FreeBSD six operating
system and it's licensed under the bsd
license and what's really neat about it
is it's got a very small footprint and
that has some unique abilities for
example it can be installed onto a USB
key or onto a compact flash card or even
onto the drive that you'll be using for
storage it's also got it also has many
services built in like CIFS and more you
know windows and unix also has NFS and
even FTP service nice now could we
access that FTP from the Internet
- or we could set that up you know with
a router some port forwarding you know
set up the user lists and authentication
and you know you could open it up so
that you could back up from work to your
home machine you can even set one of
these up you know off site so that you
would have a off-site backup and I'd
imagine its features like these that
really sets FreeNAS apart from the other
solutions exactly one of the other
network touch networking that NASA I
can't speak I'm on too many painkillers
the one of the things that's really sets
this apart from one of the others that I
was using before was was NASA light and
NASA lights really neat but it's not a
free solution whereas this is it's free
open source and the small footprint
allows you to little just nifty stuff
with it okay so now that we've got know
a pretty good idea if you know what
we're working with now what goes into
the box that is our actual network
attached storage well that's a beauty
you don't need a very sophisticated
machine whatsoever the minimum system
requirements excuse me are something
with 96 megabytes of RAM mm-hmm
obviously you need a network interface
of course and a see a bootable CD ROM
Drive to install this actually we're in
the eye sight right in our case we're
just using our spare box that we've got
sitting around the lab it's a Athlon XP
2200 with a with 256 Meg's of RAM we've
got a cd-rw and in our case we popped in
a nice 320 gigabyte Seagate drive that
we got inexpensively online and I think
it was even under about a hundred
dollars so for three hundred you know
that's a big deal now didn't this and
that the one that's like cool
perpendicular drives right it's the
perpendicular drive technology in fact I
believe that that was recently featured
on lab rats and deal TV as well so good
stuff okay and so that's a bit and so
long story short you need a basic box
right this will just need a bare bone
this is our spare machine and then we
spent about
110 dollars two hundred and twenty
dollars on parts the other part that we
picked up just for this was this really
nifty compact flash to IDE adapter now
this is a 32 megabyte compact flash
drive that I had a card that I had that
came with my digital camera I love when
you get those nice huge megapixel
digital cameras and then they give you
an 32 yeah yeah so it decided to give it
some new life and using the compact
flash to ìdid it after the machine
reads this as a regular hard drive okay
and this way there's no moving parts
it's got lower power requirements Erie
it should have a much longer lifespan
exactly okay that's a really really neat
solution okay so we've got all our parts
together so what do we do about setting
up breena's okay so to set up free now
first you need to go over to FreeNAS org
download the latest ISO and burn that to
a CD it's really small eyes so take that
CD pop it in your machine that you've
designated as your new network attached
storage box and when you boot off of
that CD you'll be given a screen similar
to this that will give you the
installation options now I believe it's
it's option number seven will start the
setup procedure to install it on your
compact flash card on a body or the USB
USB key or the hard drive right and then
from there it's a pretty simple
procedure of just following the
on-screen directions next next next
finish as well the UNIX world of next xx
finish the equivalent thereof and then
once that's done you'll pop out the CD
reboot it'll boot off of your
installation medium and in our case the
compact flash drive and we end up on
this and wheeler console screen we end
up with the same exact console screen
it's where you get all the work done and
the next step is to set up your network
interface and that's option number one
and that's where you assign it what
network card you're using and whether
that's eth0 or what it'll actually auto
detect those and give you a good list it
makes life easier I mean from there I
either get I guess we go to number two
which is setup LAN IP address we give it
a static IP address that will all that
machine will always have right now we've
given ours 192 168 1 that's 66 so ok
the IP address we will use to
administrate it and to access it over
the network for dumping our files okay
so now that it sees its network
interface and we've given it an IP
address on the network now where do we
go well we can run option number 6 which
is to ping a host to make sure that our
IPS our interface is working and once
that's all good and done we can just
unplug the keyboard we can unplug the
monitor we can throw this in the closet
or stick a next to our cable modem and a
router and all that other fun blinky
lights and it'll just become like a
permanent fixture in our land
ok so it just sits there and hums where
do we actually access its functionality
from your your computer once you've got
it hooked up you don't really have an S
yet you've got an S server running but
the hard drive isn't formatted or added
so what we need to do is log into our
freeness web interface and in our case
that's over here in Firefox we head over
to one 92168 1.66 we'll be prompted for
user name and password the default for
that is admin for the username and
freenas for the password and once we're
into here we'll go under disks we'll go
to management and from here we can add a
disk and then once we've got our disk
added we can go and format our disk
mm-hmm and that will format it in I
believe we've formatted this with what
is it
ext three okay is the file system that
would this drive has been formatted in
and if I head over here to the Status
page I can see that I've got you know I
can see the memory usage and I can see
the drives and everything and the
hardware that this is running on and
once we have our drive added toward ass
we can then start using it but we need
to enable some services so that we can
see it over the network yeah because now
it's been formatted with a UNIX type
operating system and we're running
Windows computers so now do we have to
do some kind of like samba or something
like that yeah I can put it on their
head over to and this is the easiest but
we just click on CIFS and then we just
click enable ok we give it a NetBIOS
name that
that pious name freenas if we pull up
start and run and go to backslash
backslash FreeNAS we'll pull up our Nass
why that's our drive that we've
formatted and added to the the the
network attached storage system and we
go in here with you know we've got our
hack five masters we've got you know
episode files backed up so there's
everything backed up okay so now FreeNAS
is up and running we have access to it
over the network so we have a place to
backup - mm-hmm but the worst part about
backing up is remembering to do so right
and that is where the automation process
comes in and if you're on a Windows
environment one of the best ways to do
that is with a couple of scripts and my
favorite command the at command to
schedule it and there's cron yes and you
know why reinvent the wheel when one of
our own community members who goes by
the name of go intern has made an
awesome tutorial on the hak5 wiki that
has a great batch file and walks you
through the steps involved and setting
that up so that you can specify
directories that you want to be backed
up and those will you know you can run
that nightly so that it only backs up
what's changed and you know I could walk
you through the whole thing but he's
done an even better job than I could of
explaining that on behind live wiki on
the hack point five wiki so now we've
got the automation scripts available
we've got free knives up and running so
we were set we're set and you know if we
wanted to go even you know many steps
further you can integrate this with
Active Directory radius you can set up a
software raid you can do so many amazing
things with this piece of software so I
really recommend you go and check it out
because backing up is something we all
need to do and this is the perfect
solution if you're enough you know
Network environment where you want to
share it among multiple people so if
people want to find out even more about
FreeNAS I'd assume they go to the
website go to website FreeNAS org or
head over to our article on that and
that'll be on the hack 5 wiki under the
show notes ok so thank you so much that
is freaking awesome I'm glad we have
that running here in the hack 5 Studios
now so let's head over to Allie and see
what's coming up next in the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
