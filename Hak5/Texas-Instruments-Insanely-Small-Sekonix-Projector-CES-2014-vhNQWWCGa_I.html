by Toyota for hack 5 I'm Darren kitchen
here at CES 2014 checking out some
really cool stuff from Texas Instruments
you guys know I'm a huge fan of DLP look
at this I mean this thing is itsy-bitsy
teeny-weeny and what's inside of here is
nearly a million little less than the
size of a human hair mirrors that are
all independently controlled to refract
light do freaking awesome stuff and so
okay I mean the technology aside like of
course you know I want to talk to have
kids I don't want to talk about the
technology behind behind it but you
probably want to know like what's the
practical something you can do with that
well this is really interesting out of a
Korean manufacturer that's taking this
DLP technology into like the nano sighs
look at this this is the Seco Nix DLP
from TI that they've put into this tiny
tiny form factor and as you can see here
all we actually have is microUSB and a
focusing element there's not a fan in
here there's not a heatsink in here it's
pretty cool they've got it hooked up to
a laptop over USB so it's not like HDMI
and or anything like that so I don't ask
me about the connectivity all I know is
it's NHD which is code for 640 by 360
but still ridiculously cold now it's not
mega throw for how small it is but
that's fine
what I'm thinking is look how tiny this
thing is imagine LED throw ease except
led project ease I don't know that's the
kind of cool stuff that's going to
evolve out of this kind of technology
and Ti is even talking about open
hardware platforms that interface with
this kind of stuff so I'm very hopeful
to find out more about that in the
future but I thought I would show you a
really cool implementation of what can
be done with these nearly a million tiny
hair size sub Hera sized mirrors the
Seco Nix check it out thanks once again
to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
