data stolen Australia passes a big
infrastructure security bill and
Facebook introduces new security
settings all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for April 3rd
2018 it's your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom our patreon is over at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that
is always the best way to support the
show and will help us reach our next
goal and if you want access to
exclusives make sure to check out that
link in the show notes below and now on
to the news first off My Fitness Pal
have you ever used My Fitness Pal it's
this app available for different
smartphones that lets you track data on
your health and your fitness it sounds
super useful you can create goals and it
will help you get to those goals over
time yay well unfortunately Under Armour
owners of My Fitness Pal announced on
Thursday that 150 million accounts were
breached in a hack of the site and the
application according to a press release
about the breach under Arman first knew
about the problem on March 25th four
days before announcing it an attacker
had gained access to accounts in late
February 2018 so they had access for
about one month now this was a very
quick turnaround from discovery to a
public announcement affected information
includes user names email addresses and
passwords which were hashed using bcrypt
now some of the data leaked was still
encrypted with sha-1 which unfortunately
is not a good hashing algorithm and it
can be easily brute forced sha-1
requires less processing power and it
could still be used for users who had
not logged in to the site for a long
time while bcrypt would have replaced
sha-1 as the notable hashing algorithm
of choice now all the users that were
affected were notified with an app
messaging and via email any users of
MyFitnessPal are urged to change the
passwords immediately and make sure that
that password is not used elsewhere and
if you did use your old MyFitnessPal
password elsewhere you
probably change it on those sites as
well it's very rare to have some
international security news hit actual
US airwaves but when I come across some
news I try to cover it now in Australia
the Australian Parliament just passed a
new bill called the security of critical
infrastructure bill which will be used
to protect infrastructure including gas
electrical grids ports and water supply
from national security risks which
include espionage sabotage and coercion
from foreign involvement it's big news
now this new bill opens up to different
measures number one is tracking who owns
and operates infrastructure and number
two is allowing the minister to issue
directions to said owners whenever there
is a risk the bill also allows the ASIO
which is Australia's security
intelligence organization the ability to
provide advice to the ministry based on
security assessments and the Minister
can then direct owners and operators to
do certain things now this doesn't give
the minister full power over critical
infrastructure though he or she would
still have to take the ASIO security
assessment into consideration as well as
consult with other heads of government
as well as the owner or operator
involved before being able to actually
command them to do anything so the power
is limited as a last-ditch effort now
since most infrastructure in Australia
is privately owned and operated
none of them necessarily follow the same
book of rules and regulations so adding
government oversight could help without
being incredibly intrusive since malware
campaigns ddossing data breaches are all
becoming more and more common for these
sectors it's very important to assess
and communicate potential flaws with
other sectors that might be impacted by
the same thing now I do wonder do you
think that this is a good move or is it
too much government oversight let me
know what you think in the comments
below
Facebook amid all of their problems with
Cambridge analytical and regulatory
powers has released new security options
for users including a feature called
access your information and an update to
the settings menu on your mobile app
announced on March 28 the new settings
will allow users to
more easily download data as well as
change security and privacy settings
inside the application the apps menu was
redesigned so settings are all in one
single page as opposed to 20 different
pages which how could anybody navigate
that so I'm glad they change that some
outdated settings are no longer
available and clearer information is
given for the current options there is
also a new privacy shortcut menu that
details clear information on security
privacy and advertisements and this is
where a user can set up two-factor
authentication they can log out of
unknown devices they can change personal
information control which ads you see
and so on and so forth
but if you are fed up and you just want
to delete your account I totally
understand now it's easier to download
all of your data under access your
information you can view data that
Facebook has stored in self-explanatory
sections like photos posts likes in
reactions etc you can go and delete any
of those or any one of those posts from
sections in the browser it is also
easier to delete your account from the
settings as well but if you are like one
coder than just deleting your account is
not enough a systems admin named kevin
Matthew took it a step further by
releasing code that can poison obfuscate
and purge your Facebook data so his
script will open each and every post on
your page edit it and then replace it
with some randomly generated text and he
purports that by doing so you'll mess up
Facebook's algorithm and they will no
longer be able to track your data and
the Facebook / JavaScript code is
available for download via github and a
walkthrough is available on a site I
just I love that entire thing it's so
fun
you're trolling Facebook Facebook is
also working on improving its ability to
detect false profiles and accounts as
well as increase add transparency reduce
the spread of false information and
comment foreign interference in relation
to elections now this includes requiring
any political ad purchases to be
verified with a US government ID and
mailing address but this only applies to
election based ads not issue based ones
which could be a loophole as wired
points out there also rolling out
fact-checking partnerships with The
Associated Press along with six other
countries so users will be notified if
they share false information and the
post will be limited if you are a
patreon patron first off thank you you
