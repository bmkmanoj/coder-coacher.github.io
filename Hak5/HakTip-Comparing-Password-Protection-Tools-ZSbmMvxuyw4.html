carbonite welcome to active the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morse and
today I'm doing some comparison shopping
between KeePass and LastPass your
passwords are crucial to protect so I
love checking out software and tools
that can help
sadly my memory only goes so far today
first on my list is LastPass with this
program your master password is the only
password you'll ever need to type in
only when you're first logging into
LastPass since your master password is
encrypted on your machine and only you
have access to it to unlock data it'll
protect you from all sorts of theft by
using your LastPass account available
over at LastPass calm you can
synchronize across a bunch of different
browsers and computers now they also
have a service for $1 a month for your
mobile devices if you want it you can
securely store notes automatically fill
out forms import and export already
existing passwords generate a hack proof
one for new sites and you can try out a
portable USB version that is compatible
with Firefox and Chrome portable apps
because you know I love my portable apps
first off to use it you need to download
the version of that is compatible with
your operating system you'll need to
create a master password when creating
the new account so make sure that this
is a very very secure one that hopefully
you won't forget LastPass doesn't keep a
backup or a copy of the master password
so they don't know what it is
you can let LastPass find unsecured data
on your computer import those items and
it will let you delete them as well now
you'll need to restart your browser and
click on the little LastPass star in the
corner and login okay so i'll login
and click login ok now I can start
browsing the Internet's as usual and
LastPass will remember all of my
passwords as I enter them in now when
you first go to a website like I'll go
to
thinkgeek because it's one of my
favorite shopping sites you'll have to
enter your username and password like
usual and then a bar is going to show up
at the top telling you that it can
remember it so I'm going to log in and
click go and this little green bar
appears at the top it says you can save
the site never save it or not now for
LastPass so I'm going to choose save
site and it takes me to this nice little
LastPass form now from here what you
want to do is keep the URL enter a name
so my name is going to be thinkgeek and
i'm going to add it to a group I'm going
to call this group shipping because that
completely makes sense I think I already
have that in there shopping yeah and
then I need to put in my username and
the password so your name will be and
you can add notes if you really want to
after that you can choose any of these
options below you can favorite it
require a password Reap romped which is
pretty good if you need a very secure
computer you can auto login which I
really like and you can never autofill
so I'm going to choose Auto login and
save now when you log out and go back to
that main page you'll see your changes
take effect
I chose login so it should log me in and
I don't even have to do any kind of
typing whatsoever
let's try that out I'm going to log out
real quick now it says you're not logged
in and it says LastPass had filled your
login information for from from this
page shock choose autofill login
hit go and there we go it logged me in
perfectly now what you can do is click
on the red star and it'll show you a
nice drop down of all your your
preferences your vault and other stuff
like Auto filling forums and whatnot
if you choose your vault when you click
on that go to my LastPass vault it
basically gives you a nice listing of
all of the groups and all of the
websites and you can just simply click
on a website and it'll take you to it
and log you in so if I do
Jynx so I'll click on Jenks I also have
this one set to auto login so it
automatically logs me and now if you're
out and about and you need to access
your vault from a public computer you
can also log into LastPass via their
website and if you're worried about key
loggers you can use this nifty thing
called a virtual keyboard to enter your
password with your mouse
so the key law goes can't catch anything
that you type in I'm going to try that
and see if it actually works because it
sounds really cool and I need to click
on show keyboard okay so there's my
virtual keyboard now my keyboard should
still work and then I should be able to
just click on my password yeah and it
should log me in now I'm putting in the
wrong password because I don't really
want to share it but when you actually
click sign in and you're using the
virtual keyboard and you put in the
right password it should log you in just
fine LastPass is pretty cool when it
comes to remembering your passwords but
what about KeePass I'm going to check
that one out right after our break
computer disasters eventually happen to
everyone your computer crashes it gets
infected with a virus you drop it but if
you get carbonite online backup before
your disaster then no need to worry
because your files will be backed up
automatically and safely off-site and
it's really really easy to get them back
plus you get anytime anywhere access to
your backed up files from any computer
or on your smart phone or iPad with a
free Carbonite app with Carbonite
unlimited backup for your pc or mac is
just
59 dollars a year that's less than five
bucks a month but when you use the offer
code hak5 to start your free 15 day
trial you'll also get two months free if
you decide to buy all the details are at
carbonite.com and remember to use the
offer code hak5 to get two months free
with purchase he passes a powerful free
and opensource security tool designed to
keep your passwords and your username
secure everything is encrypted inside a
database kind of like LastPass is vault
that you can access with a master key
password key pass features drag and drop
a clipboard copy a password generator it
can do auto locking Auto typing it
imports and exports your database and
tons more
it also encrypts everything in a EES 256
or two-fish encryption and did I mention
that it's free I really like that like
LastPass key pass can also organize your
entries into categories which is
extremely good for somebody that's like
super OCD like me it's available in
classic or professional editions with
the main difference being the supported
OS is the professional which is the
obvious choice supports Windows Mac and
Linux now after you download the program
first you want to save your new database
to begin working on it you'll need to
create a master key but you can also
access your database with a Windows
login or by inserting a key disk that's
pretty cool next you can create a
description name and color and choose
what to protect I'm going to go ahead
and do this type in my master password
okay I'm going to create a brand new
database and I'm going to call this new
database test click Save and this is
where you'll create your new master
password okay my database name is going
to be test two description test and I'm
going to make this yellow or an orangish
color that sounds cool there's a whole
bunch of other options that you can
choose as well all right so you click ok
and then you can right click on the
sample list from here you can add you
can edit and delete websites and use
names and passwords and to use a
password or a username you can click
copy username password or site by
right-clicking as well
copy username copy password or the URL
this will copy to the clipboard for
about 12 seconds before it wipes it
completely clean and you can also move
the new entries into the tab categories
to the left by dragging and dropping so
if I wanted to move this one into my
Windows passwords I can just drag and
drop it over there and it should appear
now I'm going to create a new one just
to test it out add entry and to add a
new one I'll call this Twitter my
username snubs and the password
I should be able to open that in the
browser and then I can copy and paste
and sign in and it works yay
although I do like the functionality of
LastPass way more than KeePass
especially it's easy use keepass is
still open source it's completely free
and it has a portable version as well as
its mobile version all of this is free
which is awesome I love free okay so I
want to hear your feedback which one is
your favorite I like both of them for
different reasons so I don't know I
can't choose a favorite they're both
pretty cool in their own ways let me
