netflix gamefly and domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain everybody welcome this week's
episode of hak5 I'm Matt lust I'm Darren
kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse and today
we are coming to you live from none
other than Virginia Tech
a lot of it gives in the room a lot of
Hokies in the room obviously it's our
first live show that we've done on
location really stoked about being here
you know and so we made the trip and a
lot of people came out so we couldn't be
happier but today is going to be kind of
a refresher / there's liz's a lot of new
viewers I got an email recently about
some guy a new is like oh I love the
show I've been watching since the
beginning of the sixth season comes with
like really you know we started this
back in 05 so this is a great episode
for anybody that's new to the show or
even you know when I say new I mean like
season four right and we're gonna be
covering a lot okay well that adorable
little creature there is the network
monkey and he absolutely loves your
packets he is the proverbial monkey in
the middle just like the pineapple is on
the Wi-Fi networks he actually comes
standard with ethernet jacks in his
hands right oh boy wait there's more
yeah so you plug you know you plug that
end into the target pc and then you know
right behind the pc is the network jack
into the wall so we plug it into there
and then well you get the idea he's in
there so what is he doing well he's
actually listening to everything in
there and that's actually the power cord
in his foot yes I don't have the power
cord with me but that's a plugs right in
there and then in his tail we have a
Wi-Fi antenna because what he does is
monkey see monkey do everything that
travels between left arm and right arm
he speaks through his banana phone to
the black van in the parking lot so yeah
they uh here but just molest my monkey
for just a moment right I'm not going to
be able to get this out anyway there's
there is a fond to point out in here
that looks very similar to this phone
here except it has two Ethernet ports
obviously so that he can sit there in
bridge mode and let the connections go
in between there and the end and he just
transmits everything over the Wi-Fi you
actually connect to him and initiate an
open VPN connection back to yourself and
then everything is tunneled through a
secure link in the Wi-Fi
he is another device that is perfect for
penetration testers this is actually
something that you don't have to put
inside of a monkey that's optional if
you would like to however you know got
they will be on the site next week for
sale ash what if we will have monkeys on
the hak5 side that's gonna be great but
but but yeah I mean a device about this
size you could embed behind a wall plate
jack you know how to add a corporation
or get me like anywhere here you see
these little network jacks you just
unscrew them pop one back there you've
got power right next to it you know and
you could have everything that's flowing
in between broadcasting at to your
little black van and that is the idea
behind the network monkey it's taking a
essential what it is is what are they
called um a passive tap its passive tap
but it's an active wireless tap and I I
absolutely love the monkey he's one of
my favorite hacks and again the kudos
here goes to Robin wood because you know
I can't program myself out of a wet
paper bag and he seems to be very down
with the open wrt because again this is
a fun plus so our favorite development
environment you said he was kind of
invisible what did you mean by that um I
can't remember the exact IP but he does
actually have one but it's not something
that's going to be on your range most
likely i think it's like 255 255 255 255
for tyfa anyway it's something obscure
yeah if you if you were salve enough you
could probably could find him on your
network but then again you'd also have
to find what network jack he's in and
what not so yeah but what's cool is when
you're having when you have a monkey in
the middle in between you it does not
change the time to live on any of your
packets it does not add a hop so when
you do a trace route it's completely
invisible that it's actually there
yeah want to play all the latest co-opt
video games but don't have any friends
contract the companion it's a great idea
that starts with a great domain at
domain.com domain.com has sweet deals on
domain names like player two rentals com
domain names for less than 10 bucks a
year without pushy upsells no commitment
web hosting for under six bucks a month
private registration and even killer
virtual private servers are wide domain
com is the place to get your next domain
best of all hak5 fans get an additional
fifteen percent off their orders when
they type the coupon code hak5 at
checkout got a great idea it all starts
with a great domain at domain com so the
wii homebrew it's this entire hat called
the twilight hack and this was way back
when we had like three point two and
three point four and three point oh the
different software for the wii all this
crazy stuff and then you walk backwards
on Zelda that's all you had to do and it
would start booting up this brand new
thing and it was this homebrew channel
through this homebrew channel on the
menu yes there you go looked exactly
like that and you're able to browse
through Vanna White it reminds me of my
corporate presentations where I end up
being the PowerPoint bitch you are my
powerpoint bitch and I love it so much
fun so through the homebrew channel
you're able to download all these
different homebrew games you can get
like the really old school super mario
games and you can get these games that
Nintendo would never choose to actually
advertise and branch out with so I got
super excited about this and then the
day that we came out with a segment on
hak5 Nintendo did an update to their
system rendering Shannon's instructions
useless and I was just like great
awesome thank you so much nin to Noah
really appreciate it so they updated
everything to four point oh when they
did that they ruin the Twilight hack
there's no point in doing it anymore
unless you didn't update you could still
do the Twilight hack if you had it and
you decided to update it would stay
work the homebrew channel was just fine
everything was cool just if you didn't
have it and you updated the four point
out you couldn't get it and I was ticked
it's like thank you a lot how common is
every time I do a segment on some kind
of like homebrew stuff for the wii u for
the kindle or whatever they come out
with an update the day that we put out
the segment which is greg so if you want
some software to be updated let us know
Shannon will do a segment on it and just
let me know when you want your 360 to be
hacked and I'm sure they'll come out
with something even better so this is
brand new to me there's this new one
called Indiana poem I think it is
Indiana owns or smash stack for a super
smash brothers these worked exactly like
the twilight hack thank God I wrote down
all of my notes on how to to the
twilight hack or I wouldn't be able to
show you guys how to do the
four-point-oh system menu for the
Indiana owns and the smash stack which
it I'm so happy that teen tweezer
tweezers came out with these because if
they didn't we'd still be screwed as far
as homebrew on the wii it's very
exciting the mall of this is that it
turned out to be so simple to do all
these different homebrew apps and to
actually update your way without going
through nintendo that it was just
amazing it turned my life around as far
as gaming goes because I found out you
could do this stuff in just a split
second and if they update it somebody's
going to come out with a new hack a new
kind of boot loader that's going to fix
it for you and you'll always be able to
get that home brew
can't screw you over Netflix thank you
so much Netflix response during this
episode of X live with Netflix you can
rent over 90,000 titles online including
lots of blu-ray titles with free
shipping both ways to your home they now
have vote over 40 shipping centers
almost all deliveries happen in just one
business day Netflix plans start at 499
and as a new member you can get a two
week free trial membership go to WWF
flexkom slashed at five and please don't
forget the wwc so how many people
believe in global warming awesome and
what I'm gonna have to say really
doesn't apply to any of you the whole
premise of virtualization is a lower
carbon footprint I don't believe in
global warming we've been outside
recently oh so during our day jobs you
know the question came up how do you
actually deploy systems without spending
ridiculous amounts of money aside from
the fact when you think about it for
every server that you add for every
computer that you add you have to have
power cooling and backup systems so the
thought process there was obviously
virtualization has been around for
probably about five years or so really
now in the enterprise that it's actually
usable there's a couple advantages less
servers you have the less power you
require carbon footprint people make a
big deal of it not important air
conditioned to cool your server rooms
carbon footprint don't care with a
product like Zen or VMware or Microsoft
now hyper-v because they realized why
not us to you can actually set up a high
available system you know dumping it off
to remote sites in real time with block
level this with block level that but in
my case in a lot of people's cases the
reason that they chose virtualization
beyond consolidation is ease of
management
my job is stressful enough without
having to figure out where a machine is
located why it's not working and is it
even on at that point so in the end the
two thousand dollar server Darren is it
still running yes yes it is and do you
like it I love it as long as it keeps
humming I have a job um so building off
a virtualization what do you think what
do you see as the trend is moving IT
into the cloud I mean that's sort of a
loose phrase that we're hearing but i
just wanted to pick your brain about
that larry ellison had had a great
comment that really infuriated a lot of
people he basically said cloud computing
was Larry's a powerful guy but
when you have the entire technology
industry basically call you a moron it's
probably not the best smartest thing
that you've ever said cloud computing
works on a different basis than you know
your standard I have a server and it
does this with cloud computing you pay
for CPU cycles you pay for used ram you
pay for disk space all of which is
shared with other users now you can by
committing you know resources so that
you have guaranteed functionality
however if you go over your commit
you're paying redonkulous amounts of
money what I really see going forward is
the desktop is going to go away and what
I mean when the desktop is going to go
away is kind of like the cloud aspect of
things there is a movement toward VDI
which is virtual desktop infrastructure
where your desktop is not limited to
this anymore your desktop is actually
stored on a server and you have
real-time access to you know utilizing
the the 3d architecture in the piece of
hardware you're using which you can
access it from his Tonka toy POS
or one of the supercomputers that you
guys have here in the building what I
will say is it's going to be a very
difficult transition for a lot of people
simply because VDI requires pretty much
cloud access and you know there's the
interchange between public and public
you guys here at Virginia Tech utilize
NAT 'add networking for most of your
stuff when you get a sign of an IP
address it's a 172 number most of the
time that's what i was told i haven't
been sniffing I could be wrong okay on
the wireless but even then you didn't
tie it in to the public network to pull
an IP address because you don't have
enough right I'm guessing that's
probably one of the reasons I think
recent projections indicate ipv4 is
going to expire it could be at the end
of 2013 we're out of addresses no more
public addresses are available there's
only been twenty six percent adoption in
core routing services across the
internet for ipv6 which has somebody no
to visit trillions of addresses
something it's a really big number yeah
it's some stupid number but once that
actually happens the VDI the virtual
desktop infrastructure is really going
to take off because you're no longer
limited to you know taking a laptop or
you know your desktop at home and stuff
like that so beyond the cloud computing
aspect yeah there's the services like
Amazon you know there mc2 no that's easy
to EC to their ec2 product which is
great for you know Twitter and stuff
like that and it's great for certain
aspects but it's definitely not a
mainstream platform I think of it more
and I'll end on this real quick
everybody heard of web two point oh
Owens last time anybody said web two
point oh it's a buzzword
is going to get you excited about
whatever it is and it's going to fade by
the wayside I look at cloud computing
like that because it's just a buzzword
but the technology behind it once more
mature sure he'll take off but until
then we're stuck with this keep your
personal information away from spammers
hackers and your crazy ex roommate
private domain registration from
godaddy.com protects your privacy by
keeping your address phone number and
more out of the public database check
out revision 3.com / godaddy for all of
our godaddy codes and offers so who here
is on the wireless network okay who here
is on my wireless network what's the
name of the SSID are connected to just
go ahead and check right now and and I'm
going to go ahead and pull up look at
one two three four fo I see a lot of
traffic going now five six seven great
all right well with the person with the
mac address ending an e 661 please note
I'm joking right we're not going to pick
on anyone in particular and if you've
been wondering why the Wi-Fi has been
sucking it's because you've been going
through my cell phone for your internet
access you basically going socks man
from this device here the you know
pineapple the Wi-Fi pineapple is running
their jaws again software through my
computer the man in the middle that's
been you know sniffing all those packets
and then after this beautiful Verizon
network which you know works everyone
like you 18t bitches so no nobody was
using aim but but I'll be saving this
this log file for for further fun later
throw some analysis ah well right now
I'm apt gmail com really okay get on
resin reset now to enter best feel safe
okay so oh this is right there and of
course everything is start blowing up
this is the Wi-Fi pineapple it is not a
device that you want to go through
airport security with in your check the
way in your carry-on luggage and I had
next
erience on my way to to San Diego now
we're going to San Diego for the work on
and you know take all take the cameras
and laptops out of my bag I don't check
anything because you know it's my
equipment man I need you close to me
right well lady goes up pulls me aside
and she goes what's this we found it in
your bag and I go oh well that's my
novelty router really yeah yeah it's a
wireless router but they make it look
like a pineapple always Nikki looking
for my grandson any okay that's what
they're really she tells me it really
does look like a grenade on on the x-ray
yes essentially using a USB like to
serial TTL connector you connect to a
couple of these pins here and open up
here your terminal and when this boots
up and you issue a control see you can
actually get into the bootloader and
flash it with your own your own file
system in your own kernel and that's
very convenient and this is again one of
those those hacks just you know right
right along with this physical fools
security stuff taking advantage of the
inherent trust that the machine has with
the human and and and having fun with
that fence there between security and
convenience and making an operating
system and just a platform where users
can actually use it and not have to be
you know linux geniuses like most of you
guys here in the room right so you know
when your machine boot up in it then it
goes out and looks for oh I remember my
home Wi-Fi or my corporate Wi-Fi or that
linksys router i always use and not mind
my neighbors but it's it sends out a
probe that says hey is linksys around
and this sees that and says who why yes
I'm right here a new machine doesn't
know any other wise or you would think
you would think you know Microsoft would
would say and I am out of virtual memory
that that is beautiful this is why you
should not be using a netbook on a
penetration test this was a very good of
virtual eight data bitch this was I
gotta capture it totally wanted to
analyze it later I gonna miss that that
I map gmail conversation oh damn it it's
like it's duh it's like I need to dump
my memory real quick and then try to
retrieve it from Iran yeah yeah okay
good look at that hey because I told it
not to use virtual memory at all I said
well anyway so where was I oh okay so
you would think that the operating
system would say hey that that linksys
network that I connect to always has
this MAC address or this bssid but that
doesn't really work when you get into
things like whs when you get into things
where there's like mesh networks and
lots of ApS on a specific wireless
network you may have you know 50-100
wireless access points around the campus
that are all the same SSID different
hardware so anyway this takes advantage
of that inherent trust and it's a fun
tool to have in between a modem or
another Wi-Fi access point and it made a
big splash because it's just a great way
to get a man in the middle I mean
there's lots of ways to get man in the
Middle's unlike Wi-Fi networks but a lot
of times you have to associate with the
network that they are on you have to
look for them and find them and then you
have to like try to do things like our
cache poisoning and you know get a man
in the middle between them to see all
those fun juicy packets but what if you
could just suck them in like a black
hole it's like a honey pot that's just
about wraps up this episode of hacked
five until next time dress the Technos
bored to tears now they want to go
drinking let's go down all right like
that idea all right okay
I'm adequate now I have so much buffered
in my head right now it's about the
blank if I tip my head it's going to
pour out I'm just taking it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
