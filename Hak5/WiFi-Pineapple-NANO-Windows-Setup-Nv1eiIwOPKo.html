setting up the Wi-Fi pineapple Nano in
windows so let's get started I already
have my Wi-Fi pineapple plugged into my
Windows computer here using the included
USB Y cable the LED is solid blue which
means it's booted so I can come over to
Wi-Fi pineapple comm slash nano and
download the latest firmware and save
that there and now I'll browse to the
Wi-Fi pineapple at 170 2.16 dot 42.1
colon 1471
click continue then when prompted press
the button on the bottom side of the
Wi-Fi pineapple and continue choose the
file from the download and select the
upgrade bin then click upgrade this
process takes about five minutes and
during that time do not unplug the Wi-Fi
pineapple nano or otherwise interrupt
its power wait for the LED to finish
blinking when it goes solid the device
is fully booted and will be greeted with
the welcome screen if not just refresh
the browser click get started at this
point we will need to once again press
the button on the bottom of the device
and that will complete secure setup and
at this point it's simply a matter of
setting up our password and SSID accept
the agreement and complete setup then
we'll log in and at this point setup is
complete so now let's just configure
internet connection sharing so that our
Wi-Fi pineapple can get connected to the
internet through our Windows machine
click the network icon and network
settings then under Ethernet choose
change adapter options and look for the
Wi-Fi pineapple network interface it'll
show is an a six USB fast ethernet
adapter I like to press f2 to rename
this and type Wi-Fi pineapple then from
your internet connection source via
ethernet or in my case Wi-Fi right click
and choose properties then from the
sharing tab check allow other network
users to connect using this computers
internet connection and from the
drop-down choose Wi-Fi pineapple click
OK then right click the Wi-Fi pineapple
and click properties from Internet
Protocol version 4 click properties and
change the default IP address from its
192.168 to 172 16.4 to 42 and click OK
then close now we can test our Wi-Fi
pineapples internet connection by
clicking load bulletins from Wi-Fi
pineapple comm and similarly we can go
over to advanced and check her latest
firmware updates and that's about it for
initial setup and internet connection
sharing for the Wi-Fi pineapple in
Windows let us know your thoughts and
the forums and the comments and I will
see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
