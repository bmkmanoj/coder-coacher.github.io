by domain.com having several tools and
several USBs or cds can be a real pain
in the butt especially when you're
looking for a specific one but you don't
remember what USB you put it on to save
us from the trouble and to save us time
there are many applications available
online they let you create just one
multi bootable USB Drive
thus you can store all of your tools on
one USB Drive instead of like ten we
reviewed you me a little while back in
unit Boonton Darren's also done his
multi pass and I've checked out katana
this week I'm checking out a couple of
your user pics
ex boot and Sardu the first one is ex
boot this one is a light weight utility
for creating multi bootable USB Zoar CDs
to use it you just download the zip file
over from their website which is sites
google.com slash slight slash charm luxe
ex boot you open the application and you
plug in your USB flash drive now you'll
need to have some ISOs already
downloaded onto your computer or you can
go into file download and choose some of
your favorite utilities in Linux distros
for example I have already don't
downloaded a whole bunch of ISOs onto my
computer I got Clonezilla Puppy Linux
and ophcrack as well in my nice little
ISO folder to keep them organized when I
go into ex boot if I didn't have them I
could also go to file download and
choose any kind of utility a linux
distro or what-have-you
click on it and go to the open download
web page and it will download it
automatically for me very nice and very
simple once they are done installing you
can drag the ISOs into the box under the
create multi boot USB / ISO tab for mine
I chose my off crack cons Clonezilla and
Puppy Linux distro so I'll just go over
to my window and drag all three of these
over make sure those are correct yeah
those look good the correct megabyte
size now over on the other side you can
see the total size of the files added
you can remove any files that you need
to you can look up the md5 hash
hexam in case you're wondering if it's
the actual tool and at the very bottom
you can choose to create your ISO live
CD or a USB bootable flash drive I'm
going to go ahead and choose my flash
drive create USB now as usual you do
want to make sure that you're selecting
your USB flash drive and not your hard
drive so I went ahead and chose my D
Drive which is my flash drive snubs
number two and this is pretty cool you
can choose what kind of bootloader you
want to put on here you have the options
for syslinux which is the recommended
one grub for dos or you do not have to
install any bootloader if you really
don't want to I'm going to go ahead and
choose syslinux and press ok and I'll
just have to wait for a couple of
moments while it installs everything
onto my flash drive and then once you
click Next it'll start copying all of
your ISOs to your thumb drive and create
the bootloader so just kick back relax
go get a beer and wait for it to finish
all right USB created successfully so
once it is created you'll have the
option to run it on QEMU to test it you
can also edit the flash drive by
clicking on the tab that says edit multi
boot USB inside the X boot program now
the second one that I chose or that you
guys chose is called Sardu Sardu can be
found over at Sardu CDI t now sorry was
a program that i found that was
apparently made by vikings using
hieroglyphics as you can tell by the
cute little photos all over the program
you simply plug in your flash drive you
click on your choices for your antivirus
utilities linux distros and our windows
cds and you choose to make a bootable
USB now clicking on the different
utilities in Linux distros will download
them from their websites you can also
click ISO at the top and you can choose
make ISO and then click on an ISO folder
sometimes somewhere inside your Windows
Explorer and you can choose to make it
on your flash drive now I downloaded out
all of mine into my downloads folder so
I'm just going to navigate over to my
downloads folder ISO make ISO
and my nice little ISOs folder and I
press okay and it'll look through that
folder and find all of my ISOs and it
will create the ISO is for me or it will
put them into Sardu for me so I see that
each one that I had which should just be
the three are highlighted in green
Clonezilla off crack and poppy Linux
once you're all done including all of
your ISO is you can click that cute
little USB button up at the top or the
CD button and wait for it to finish
creating the bootable USB and once it's
done you can boot off your flash drive
using super grub disk the tabs at the
top enable you to check the hash you can
create and defrag your USB as well now
I'm going to go ahead and restart my
computer and boot into syslinux 4x boot
and grub for Sardu and I'm going to try
them out so let's see if they work
you
all right I'm going to go ahead and
restart my computer now then i know
Clonezilla is working and I'm going to
try Sardu ok sorry looks to be working I
got into the menu pretty good tools so
these are a lot of built in tools that
come with stardew you can also choose
your utilities and your Linux distros
let's see if Puppy Linux works on here
okay so it looks like they both work and
they work well the three ISOs that I
chose they I'm assuming all three of
them boot properly since the first ones
did and I can always add more if I want
to so of these two I do have to say that
Sardu which was obviously made for
Vikings took a little bit more time for
me to figure out how to get my ISOs onto
the USB and make it bootable it turns
out I was just thinking way too hard
when trying to add my ISO folders X boot
on the other hand was pretty natural to
figure out and it was easy to use X boot
was definitely my favorite
so after googling around for other multi
boot creators I think I found all the
ones that I could but are there other
ones do you guys use a tool that you
could make my life easier make sure you
