with hak5 my name is Shannon Morse from
CES 2012 and I am at the bulkan booth
with the newly introduced Wemo isn't it
cute and I know all of your nerds will
like this because this is a wireless
home controlling device wireless yes you
heard me right you can download a free
iPhone or iPad at Android is coming out
soon I know they are developing it and
it is in process so we will see Android
soon don't worry guys I've heard all
about it it will be released in May and
this is going to cost about forty nine
ninety nine with the extra wireless
motion sensor one for 59 99 or you can
get them as a bundle for about 100 bucks
and it will also be in released in
europe in about two months after May so
keep that in mind all you european guys
over there it kind of acts like an
access point it'll create its own task
this point and then when you get on your
iPhone your iPhone will have the had the
option to connect to it wirelessly or
make it part of its own wireless network
your home wireless network the motion
sensor one works for about 15 feet away
the sensor will turn on any kind of
electronic devices or turn them off
wirelessly cool thing about this is it
is grounded so you don't have any kind
of problems with plugging in any kind of
electronics that you have you can plug
in your pc or your lights or even a
motion sensor for your cat whenever it
goes to litter box so you can turn on a
cute little nightlight for Kirby if you
wanted to and there are no relay clicks
as far as we can tell when I listened
very very closely to it so I'm really
excited to get one of these into maybe
do a little bit of packet sniffing maybe
a little bit of accessing will see from
CES again my name is Shannon Morse and
you can find all of our coverage over at
revision 3.com / CES and again I would
like to thank Ford for powering our CES
coverage the Ford Fiesta comes equipped
with sync applink allowing you to
control your favorite mobile phone
applications through voice control the
pandora app allows you to tell sync the
names of songs and artists and it will
serve up a radio station person

PlayStation m83 radio sync applink
