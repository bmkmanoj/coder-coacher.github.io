5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show we break
down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm Shannon
Morse and today we are going to go over
timing options and nmap now last week we
did cover most of the timing options
that you can use an nmap and some of the
basics of how and map reads time stamps
in your comand so this week we'll finish
off customizing those timing options to
fit your needs so first off this week is
the packet TTL option this is going to
specify the time to live so you're gonna
set your TTL option if you're on a slow
connection so packets don't timeout to
click quickly so my command would look
something like this I'll type in nmap -
- TTL and then 100 for 100 milliseconds
10 dot 70 3.31 dot 1 for 5 and it'll run
the command it looks normal as usual now
you can also use a command like this one
which is for a host timeout so I would
type in for this one and map and then -
- host - timeout and I'll do 1 M for 1
minute 10.7 a 3.31 dot 145 so same
target as usual and this is basically
going to make nmap stop trying to get a
response from a host after a given time
this option is not going to show you any
output even if the host is timed out
even if it has open ports so basically
you're just going to let it timeout so
you won't see anything now nmap does
give you a lot of power and scanning
network system so it's no surprise that
you can also set up time delays between
probes now if you want to do so you'll
type in and map and then - - as usual
scan delay and put in the delay that you
want so I'll do 10 seconds 10 dot 73 31
1 4 5 and press Enter
so this will create a delay between
probes of 10 seconds for that target
you'll notice that it runs a lot lot
slower but you may get
better accuracy if you do this now you
can also set a maximum scan delay with
nmap - - max - scan - delay and then put
in whatever the delay is that you want
so for example if you did 400 it would
take 400 milliseconds this is going to
speed up your scan since it would be
just 400 milliseconds between probes but
it may be less accurate because it's not
taking that big break in between each of
the probes now with that we're going to
take a quick break and we'll go over a
few more timing options right after BRB
the hack shop is hack 5s premier store
for all of your pen testing needs
including one of my favorites the USB
rubber ducky which looks like a flash
drive and it types like a keyboard hmm
it can type scripts into a computer
crazy fast like this week's favorite
from hexa near one three three seven
packs nearly which he calls the
trollface virus and it's pretty awesome
so check it out in the forums now of
course we couldn't do the show without
your support so we would like to thank
you with something special use the
coupon code snupps with any order for
your very own signed pack tip sticker
BAM awesome you're gonna be the coolest
one of your friends thank you so much
for supporting the show again we
couldn't do it without you we're back
with the last few timing options and
then we're done
you can set the minimum number of
packets that n and maps ends per second
with another command of course another
command now this one would be n map dash
dash minimum or min for minimum rate and
then whatever the timing would be so I'm
gonna choose 50 10 dot 73 31 5 my target
and then you press ENTER so this is
going to send 50 packets minimum per
second be careful though if it's set way
too high it may become inaccurate so
keep that in mind also if you want to do
a sneak attack on a system this is kind
of fun you can avoid some detection
systems with the maximum packet rate
option to do this you would type in n
map - - max rate so similar to the last
one and then ten I'll do ten for ten
milliseconds ten dot 73 31
one four or five and hit enter so this
is going to take a lot longer to scan
and it'll take no more than ten packets
per second you could even set it lower
than that if you wanted to you could do
0.1 milliseconds to send a packet every
ten seconds does that make sense okay
good now lastly for this week is
defeating the reset rate limits that
some targets may set on rst packets
reset packets now to do this you would
do another command and I'm going to
control C out of that last one so what
you're going to type in will be and this
is a pseudo command so pseudo and map -
- you're gonna see something weird here
when I do this defeat - RS T's for reset
- rate limit and then your target and
hit enter haha there we go
alright so that one didn't take too long
either now once you are done with this
this is going to automatically adjust in
and map though so chances are you
wouldn't need to use this command
normally because it's pretty much built
in now that's about it for this week's
episode of customizing your timing
options but I want to know what you
would like to see next on end map of
course there's plenty of other tutorials
that I could do but I want to know what
you want to see so send me a comment
below or email us tips at hack 5 org and
be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 for more great stuff just like
this I'll be there reminding you to
trust your Tecna list bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
