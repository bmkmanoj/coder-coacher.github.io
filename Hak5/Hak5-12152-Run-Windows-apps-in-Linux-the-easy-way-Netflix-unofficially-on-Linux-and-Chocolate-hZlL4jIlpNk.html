by domain.com okay so we all know from
what Darren has said that wine is pretty
awesome but it can be really complicated
because you have to go through each of
those programs you gotta change settings
you got to get the compatibility issues
to work with all the different Linux
distros and yadda yadda yadda it can be
kind of a pain in the butt there's
dependencies and all that good stuff
right so there's this program called
play on Linux it has a whole bunch of
programs pre-installed in the GUI and it
can be downloaded to work in linux with
just a click play on linux uses wine as
its back end so you're already using the
easy GUI to install those programs and
games and it also installs whatever
version you need of wine to run any
specific programs so no dependency hell
you guys we can't get any better than
that although there is a little iffy
moment there they don't support piracy
so you still need to have your CD or
whatever your license code is for the
different games or programs say like
microsoft office or a specific game that
you had to purchase and you had a little
key on the back of it yet you still got
to have those now today i wanted to go
ahead and install a couple of apps to
give you an idea of what it looks like
and how easy it is to use now if you go
over here i already got it installed and
the first thing that you're going to see
is this little window right here that
has run clothes install remove and
configure as you can see down here I
don't have any apps installed yet I
don't have any programs nothing on here
from windows so I can't go ahead and go
in here and run a program over on play
on Linux in the actions you can choose
install a program settings or your
messenger now if I click on settings I
get file associations the extensions in
the program that is associated with each
one that I've installed any plugins that
it's requiring and you can also change
proxies which is kind of cool so you
don't have to install things over any
kind of a like open network you can do
it straight from a proxy it's awesome
that they include that now I haven't set
up a proxy but I just want to say
install amazon kindle so i'll click on
the program and this takes me over to
this big menu this is going to give you
a list of everything that they have
available and if you want to you can
even check out some apps and different
programs that they have for testing
purposes as well now I can choose to
download different ones right here under
testing but that's going to tell me that
it's testing installers play on Linux
cannot ensure that your app is going to
work without any problems so it's
letting you know ahead ahead of stance
that hey there might be some issues if
you try to install something it may not
work we're still working on those so I
don't want to install any of those also
no CD needed if you click on this it
lets you know they do not support piracy
therefore they won't give any support to
patch your programs now i'm going to
unclick that and if i go into
accessories i see they have a whole lot
of choices i can click on amazon kindle
and if this is a program that i wanted
to install all i would have to do is go
down here to click install now I've
already got this one installed it does
take a little while to download i'd say
like 10 minutes or so for it to actually
refresh and get into your program list
and i have it running back here there we
go so this is my amazon kindle app they
do have an application for firefox and
chrome now which is great because you
can run firefox and chrome on linux
obviously but if you didn't have one of
those already installed or you just want
a separate kindle app you can do that
it's really easy to use you just put in
your username and password for your
amazon account and it automatically
downloads all the books that you already
have and that you have already bought
through kindle so i have a book pulled
up here and it works exactly like it
does on Windows it's beautiful it's
really easy to read everything that I
want to read and it's it's simple I mean
it's got a reesie's so you don't have to
go into wine you don't have to you know
do all the sudo apt-get stuff and
download every single thing separately
and all the different dependencies and
all the different backends that stuff
just kind of drives me nuts sometimes so
I just wanted something that was really
simple really easy and I got to thank
our buddy Evan Toberman he sent this
over
they over to a feedback at hak5 org and
thank you so much because this is super
great it's really easy to use there's
tons of stuff in here you can also see
if you go into the games so many games
to choose from now I know that they're
still working on Steam right now to get
that working so if you don't want to
wait you can still get your wow on right
here now I'm not saying play wow cuz I
definitely don't yeah not a big fan
anyway we'll have links to download play
on Linux in the show notes and you can
also find it in the Ubuntu Software
Center so of course very simple coming
