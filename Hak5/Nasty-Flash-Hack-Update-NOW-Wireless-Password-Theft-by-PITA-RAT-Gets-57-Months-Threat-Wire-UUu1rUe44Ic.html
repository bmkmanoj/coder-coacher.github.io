watch out Wi-Fi pan Apple here comes the
PETA wireless password theft
Blackzilians leader gets 57 months for
rats all coming up now on threat wire
I'm Patrick Norton and this is threat
wire for wednesday june twenty-fourth
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and internet freedom
people it's time to update flash and
chrome immediately if flash is installed
your Windows Mac or Linux machine if
you're running the Chrome browser or
running I e on windows 8 dot one
seriously if the answer to any of those
questions is yes you need to download
and install the latest version of the
adobe flash player this is not trivial
adobe says these updates resolve a heat
buffer overflow of vulnerability that
could lead to code execution that's CVE
dash 2015 dash 3113 and this isn't
theoretical adobe is quote aware of
reports that CVE 2015 3113 is being
actively exploited in the wild via
limited targeted attacks systems running
internet explorer for windows 7 and
below as well as firefox of Windows XP
are known targets that said did you hear
us mention chrome and windows 8 dot one
update flash chrome and internet
explorer immediately links for the
downloads are on adobe security bolton
and we've got a link to that Adobe
Security Bulletin right down below in
the show notes and if you're just
totally over flash but think you can't
give it up do yourself a favor go read
Krebs on security a month without adobe
flash player might help you decide if
you can live without flash and it might
be easier than you think watch out
pineapple here comes the rogue pita
sandwich now Darren and Shannon my
partner's on threat wire have spent a
lot of time on hak5 experimenting with
software-defined radio and if you know
hak5 then you know about the Wi-Fi
pineapple the premier tool for Wi-Fi
auditing and penetration testing go buy
limit the hack shop now meet what wired
calls the rogue falafel the $300
portable instrument for trace
acquisition built by Tel Aviv University
and Israel's technion Research Institute
why do you care well a quote wired you
can listen to the accidental radio
emanations of a computers electronics
from 19 inches away and derive the users
secret decryption keys enabling the
attacker to read their encrypted
indications seriously people we're
talking like van Eck phreaking except
for passwords instead of images on a CRT
and if you're not familiar with van Eck
van Eck basically was using antennas to
pick up CRT emanations and recreate what
the person was looking at on the CRT how
cool is that well frankly as far as I'm
concerned this is even cooler the device
can fit under a piece of pita bread
portable instrument for Trey's
acquisition PETA huh now imagine what
you can do with it at a coffee shop or
by putting it in somebody's cube or
office or maybe underneath their desk
should you panic not yet the researchers
concentrated their attacks on the new PG
but since the methods used apparently
could be modified for say RSA and pretty
much any other encryption system you
might want to start looking under your
desk or the table at the coffee shop
before you enter a password especially
since apparently you can buy most of the
parts you need off ebay for under three
hundred dollars tons more detail in the
wired article including parts info go
read it feels pretty rare that a malware
maker gets jail time but the wall street
journal reports that Alex you sell the
owner of black shades which sold the rat
remote access tool for 40 bucks a seat
just got hit with a
two-hundred-thousand-dollar fine and
four years nine months in jail black
shades ran from twenty ten to twenty
thirteen and according to the wsj
reports generated about 350,000 and
revenue and apparently a hundred people
have been arrested around black shades
and the rat investigation including
users of remote access tool and if you
don't know what a rat or remote access
tool is it offers hidden or secret
access to other people's computers at
least if you could get it installed on
their windows machine which you could do
by getting someone to install it for you
installing it yourself or getting
somebody to click on your basic targeted
email we call that spear phishing the
FBI has a pretty detailed article could
your computer be infected by black
shades that is actually packed with info
and how to check the registry for it
should you be feeling paranoid right now
links to the article and the FBI well
instructions are in the show notes
