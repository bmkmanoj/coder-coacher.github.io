looking for some Wi-Fi and you're
watching hack point five
welcome Agnes so another episode ahead
point five the show will recover mods
hacks and have some laughs I'm your host
Aaron and I'm Wes and for an additional
1995 we'll even come to you every
Wednesday maybe not right this episode
we've got some really good segments for
you including a really good case Maude
some nice webcam code and an awesome
disk image install so sit back grab your
favorite drink and let's get started on
this episode we're going to install a 12
volt accessory outlet into your case
it's basically the same thing that you
would use as a cigarette lighter in your
car but now you're going to be able to
charge your cell phone and use any other
accessories off your case things you're
going to need are of course the
accessory outlet you can buy this at
RadioShack its catalog number two 700
1556 I'm going to use an optional rocker
switch this is catalog number 275 731 a
soldering iron and solder I used a
multi-tool as my wire cutter and
strippers a rotary tool a spare male
molix connector a multimeter and some
heat-shrink process is going to go
something like this first we have to cut
the holes for both the accessory outlet
and the rocker switch and go ahead and
mount them after that we're going to
wire the rocker switch in line with the
hot line of the accessory outlet we're
going to connect the molix to the switch
we have to test everything for
continuity if everything checks out
we're gonna go ahead and Hotwire a power
supply unit and check the whole thing
with that and assuming all of that works
out we're gonna go ahead and install it
so let's get down to it I'm going to
install everything onto a five and a
quarter panel and I've laid out where my
holes are going to be just do this per
dimensions on the packages and from here
we can go ahead and cut everything out
so you get your rotary tool I'm using a
drill bit just to cut everything out
all right now we've got the holes all
cut out we can go ahead and drop in our
rocker switch and our outlet and these
just pop right in just slide them in the
hole make sure you leave a little tab
and when you hear that clip you know
it's seated do the same thing for the
rocker switch alright now that we've got
the rocker switch in the outlet seated
and the leads connected back to the
switch I'm going to go ahead and prep
the molix connector now these molecule
line is the 12-volt hot line so that's
what we need for this particular
application so coming off the back of
this male end I'm gonna go ahead and
trim the five volt lead and ground off
like so
and then I need these wires so I'm gonna
cut this female end off over here like
that separate them there we go all we
have to do now is strip them down and
get them ready for soldering all right
so I've done all my wiring and just you
know make sure you stick to the
directions on the back of the package
for the switch I'm just finishing up
I've already done my load and my hot
wire
they've been soldered and heat shrunk to
the back of the switch I'm just gonna
finish it the ground right here and just
give a little solder make sure you have
a good connection all right NAT they
were all sided up and uh tied down go
ahead and heat shrink it with this
lighter here just make sure our
connections are good and snug all right
now we're gonna go ahead and check the
continuity of our wires and assuming
everything checks out like it did here
we'll go on and test the whole thing
with a live power feed with a
jump-started power supply all right
everything's wired up and cooled off so
we're gonna go ahead and test it out and
go ahead and plug in my Maltz connectors
here now if you ever have to do any
power supply testing without a
motherboard you can jumpstart it by
jumping pin 14 and pin 17 on a 20 pin
ATX power connector I've already got
that set up over here
so chop it powers running now let's see
if we've got power on the switch there
we go red means go in this case final
step installation and actually plug in
and accessory alright now that we've got
everything installed back in the case
powers running let's really give it a
test and plug in an accessory turn power
on I've got a red light there it is
founder's charging so now that my dead
phone's charging I think I'll log on and
play with the hack five light dude that
was actually a really sweet mod thanks I
really appreciate it like I think I've
seen that before and it was like some
stupid you know $10 buy it pre-made
doesn't even really fit or look right in
your case but dude that just adds so
much flavor yeah well the problem is you
know they've got all these premium odds
now and nobody wants to take the time to
do with them said no do you remember
back in the day where we were actually
using neons for cars like auto parts
store oh yeah it was cheaper than the
cold cathode you buy online oh yeah I
definitely had to supply some Aleksandar
the race and now you go down to compusa
and it's like mud your case just to
exclude on these parts it's like sands
or something he just takes all the fun
out of it
so what do we have next um we've got the
Humber bag houses which this is really
neat um we're extending on just like we
did with mod we're extending on the last
hack that you guys had so much fun with
that we can make blink oh my gosh that
light was going on and off forever
anyway I think you guys are really going
to enjoy this one so let's just take it
to the next segment alright Cheers
change last time on hack 25 we showed
you how to control your household lights
over the Internet this time we're going
to take it a step further with a webcam
so you can see what's going on your
house while you're away
alright are
gonna use a normal USB well for this
normally we've used one of these
inexpensive USB webcams but in this
particular scenario server and the
webcam are going to be pretty far away
so we don't want to use USB because
there's a finite amount of length we can
use with extensions and whatnot before
we get signal loss okay so what about
x10 wireless we could go with the x10
but as you probably already know one
they're expensive and two if you've seen
from the shadows or system that can be
easily picked up and the last thing we
want our viewers getting in there
turning on and off the lights and
checking out the webcam heaven forbid
so what we're going to be using here is
either this antiquated VHS see camcorder
or one of these pics era small little
webcams and I like these you can pick
these up on eBay pretty cheap and the
neatest thing is composite alright and
like your reference before composite has
no no definitive length we can run it
wherever you get the cables or whatever
length we need and USB has a finite yeah
length to them exactly so we're gonna go
with the composite here okay and so
assuming we have everything set up and
wired how do we get that on the server
to get into the computer we're going to
need to use a TV tuner or a capture card
this card right here will accept
composite in Jack or we could use a ATI
all in wonder card or basically any card
that'll accept a composite in Jack
windows is going to recognize that as a
windows media device and it's going to
work the same whether it's a webcam or
whether it's a composite camera like
this it doesn't care our script will
still use that the program will still
use it so all in all this integration is
gonna be really seamless really seamless
so let's go ahead and set up the
hardware and then take it to the
software let's roll
all right so we're back at the lab let's
check it out
we're using a piece of software here
from SourceForge it's called doorjamb
and it's going to be our capture device
it's going to basically take the image
from the webcam and put it in a folder
you can get these anywhere they're
pretty simple
and I just like doorjamb because it's
open source and come from sources free
yes so as you can see here we've set it
up for a Windows Media device we can do
a preview here and as you can see there
we are in right here provided our blood
hey Paula camera guy so we'll go into
the capture settings sorry we're going
to the store settings we see a setup a
storage setting here and hold it to
store the images hak5 jpg in our Apache
folder we've also done some captions
eggs these are pretty cool
we've added the ability to put the hack
point pod cam on the bottom with our
font so it'll look pretty neat so if we
go ahead and take that over to the web
page you can go ahead and see you know
there's latest image point 5 cam sheep
set right so let's go ahead and check
out the code all right basically this is
the same PHP code that we used before
we've added just a little bit of HTML
and we've got this http-equiv refresh'
content 15 seconds what that's basically
saying is every 15 seconds refresh the
page okay now it's HCD equated equals
expires content equals zero what that's
basically saying is don't cache the
image so if you were to repress a page
and your browser was caching it you get
the same image over and over it just
doesn't repose well it's not really
about the cookies what it's doing is
it's telling you not to catch that image
so we refresh you get the new one every
time right now right and then basically
here at the bottom we just go ahead and
add in the little image tag to the Nikon
JPEG and we end up with this and it'll
automatically refresh every 15 seconds
all right we still turn on and off the
lights and at tocker's do it that's all
there is to it
fantastic phew that was pretty cool I
really enjoyed seeing how we can expand
on that previous code I just like the
fact that we can come back to this and
add to it and really I felt like the
best part of that code was coming home
from work and just watching the lights
turn on and off so much fun is like is
like DIY strobe light right so what
second that's next um what is next oh
we've got our resident chick with tips
right on okay well let's get to that for
then nice goatee so your plate working
and you're running about a dozen
programs and all of them are taking all
the space in your taskbar power menu is
a Windows utility that allows you to be
able to minimize any of your programs
into the system tray well if you're
running Windows 2000 or XP you can also
set a window transparency you can
download the utility from this
ridiculously long URL Vertica calm flash
tummy slash programming slash power menu
so Darren which is extremely important
last weekend and dude we want to get
somewhere as off the land and I've got
500 gigabyte Seagate and look at and
this thing is fugly but sigh a land
parting with this now if you instant
newb I know man please hook me up set me
up so next time I go we're set alright
lie to you came for the right place I
got just the things check it out alright
dude so I've got the final product here
you gotta check this out it's beautiful
we got all the essentials of course
starting out with the cowboy and the
swimsuit girl and the space dude right
of course I can still get to the power
and the USB if it pop off the top here
you can see we got the internals to the
IDE and the power and under here you can
check out your Seagate 500 gig er and
then under here we got a 97 millimeter
case fan that's gonna keep your drive
nice and cool with window exhaust ports
in the back how's that so let's go ahead
and get some juice make sure it works
check that out you're gonna be where's
in like a champ Oh sweetie that's an
awesome mod dude I really appreciate it
good pone yeah baby last episode's
trivia question was how many shaves and
haircut are there in a gigabyte that's
correctly answered by Travis from Broken
Arrow Oklahoma who writes a shave and a
haircut is two bits so you get 268
million four hundred and thirty-five
thousand four hundred and fifty six and
a gigabyte critical mass is my best
friend exactly especially when you're
using gigabytes and not a billion bytes
what's your hard drive manufacturers lie
to you about this most trivia question
would be what is the frontside bus or
was rather the frontside bus of the
Pentium 75
socket seven or socket five so email
those two trivia hack five org and also
keep sending your questions into
questions at hack five org we've got our
behind the scenes career crunching away
at them right now and we'll come back
with some more responses episode three
now back to the show
so here's the problem I've got 50 pcs on
a network all running with is xp service
pack 2 using the Windows Firewall and
I'm rolling out an application which
requires a couple of ports to be open on
the firewalls now what makes matters
worse is it's not a domain network so I
can't use group policies this means I
need to go to each machine individually
and change the firewall settings
normally this means going through a
bunch of gooey but I don't want to do
that what we're going to do today is
show you how to automate that process
with a couple batch scripts so we're
here in our command prompt and let's
take a look at some of these commands
that are going to make life a lot easier
first is net Sh firewall show config and
this is basically going to show us the
configuration of the firewall whether
it's enabled what ports are open what
programs are using and what we want to
do is create a couple of batch files the
first one is going to disable the
Windows Firewall so let's run copy con
disable stop that and then turn the
command net Sh firewall set up mode
disabled press ctrl-z and enter to save
the file
now if we run disabled up that disables
the firewall now we need to create a
batch group to enable the firewall again
so again copy con enable up add and this
time it's net SH firewall set up mode
enable now when we enter an enable
firewall turns on so now let's get a
little bit more advanced what we're
going to do is create two batch files
which are going to open the ports that
we normally use on our computer or close
those ports and this is great because it
allows us to change profiles depending
on where we are like before sitting at a
coffee shop on the Wi-Fi so in order to
do this let's go ahead and create
another batch file and this time we'll
name it
open ports so for this example we're
going to show you how to open closed two
ports and in this case is going to be 80
and 21 as if you are running a web
server or an FTP server so we've gone
ahead and opened up our open ports patch
and we're going to run net Sh firewall
ad port opening TCP for the protocol 80
for the port and we're going to call
this web server and we'll do the same
again this time change it to the port 21
and call it FTP server now we'll run
that batch file and it's going to open
both those ports now I'll create a batch
file and close those two ports so copy
con closed ports top that and net SH
Firewall delete ports opening TCP 80 and
the same goes for port 21
and now if we run closed ports there
they go now we're going to automate the
process a little bit more by creating an
autorun de INF file for that copy con
autorun.inf first line is going to be
bracket autorun bracket second line is
going to be action equals config
firewall but it can be anything and the
next line is going to be shell execute
and in this case we want it to be equal
to open ports bat save the file and
basically what this is going to do is
when we pop in a CD with these files on
it it's going to look for this auto run
to INF if it finds it is going to see
the second line which is shell execute
equals open port stop at and it's going
to run that batch file now it gets a
little bit trickier with thumb drives or
flash drives or whatever you want to
call them and that's where the action
equals config firewall comes in when you
use a removable drive like a thumb drive
flash drive whatever and you plug it
into a Windows XP machine service pack 2
it's going to pop up a little dialog
you've probably seen it before asking
you what action you want to take it will
automatically run the auto run to INF
however at the very top of the list will
be config firewall all we need to do
after that is press ENTER and it will
run our batch script so now we're going
to take all the files that we've created
and put them on a CD so we can take them
from computer to computer and run start
thoughts to open this folder and explore
fire up a copy of Nero create a new data
disc drag and drop this files over to
the CD and we're going to call it
firewall config
and let's go ahead and burn it so if
you're like me and you've got a lot of
commands you need to run on multiple pcs
that aren't on a domain network you can
use the same process with the auto run
to INF to call a batch file and run
anything you want so now that our burn
is complete just go ahead and finish
this check CD pop it right back in and
it should go ahead and open those ports
on the firewall there it goes ports are
open now one last thing we can do to
make life a little bit easier if you're
on the road between hotel networks and
wireless networks is to create shortcuts
on the desktop - these open ports and
close ports patch files now this kind of
allows us to have profiles depending on
where we are we'd also like to stress
that nothing beats a hardware firewall
and you should not only rely on the
Windows XP built-in firewall
I got a call from a friend
he said come down meet me here bring a
camera didn't tell me what it is but
it's got something to show me so let's
check it out there are some what's up
Darren how you doing all right so I've
sold the show liked it a lot
I got something my little tickle get
alright check it out
you know what's up dude what's up John
how you doing pretty good bro we got
Darren from hack point five sweet yeah
just work up some code for a hat point
five from actually so it's up to be good
at us show not what you did yeah it
definitely there's a lot of buzz going
around on the internet about installing
Mac OSX on a PC so we're going to show
you the easiest and most simple method
to do so how sweet for Tobruk let's get
to it you know what you got well take a
look
holy shit dude that is gorgeous
sweet you think you can do it to this
gateway yeah alright so we need to get
started ok well first of all you need to
make sure that you have the tiger disk
image it's been floating around the
internet so if you don't already have it
go buy a Mac second you need to make
sure that your processor supports SSE 2
instruction set now you can do that with
a little tool called cpu-z and when you
run it it will tell you exactly what
instruction sets your processor does
support ok now you have to remember that
you won't be able to run Rosetta without
sse3 but you can run tiger with sse2 um
next we're going to be using a Linux
live CD in this case we're using Knoppix
3.7 ok um and we also need a removable
hard drive or a network drive to store
the disk image so let's get started I'm
going to go ahead and pop in this
Knoppix CD simply restart the computer
and do it all fit so we got Knoppix
loaded the next step is to make a
directory and mount your network drive
under this computer
I'm going to make a directory called
Tiger 86 just sound them out
go ahead and enter your password because
we're connecting to your computer
there we are
all the files are there now the last
step is to run a command
- off
all right so what's it doing right now
basically now it's going to load the
disk image from your computer onto this
machine and erase everything on this
machine's hard drive so basically you're
gonna lose everything that's on there
pretty much yeah so as soon as this
command finishes all we have to do is
reboot the machine and select Darwin and
go get so we took a quick break and I
took the liberty of shutting the
computer all now all we have to do is
turn it back on and see if it work
alright let's boot in the Darwin looking
good so far
and starting there go sex all we're
doing is waiting for that login screen
right now make sure to enter your top
secret super secure password oh and
we're in what do you think so there you
go Darren to run a few things is to make
sure it works let's pull up the terminal
and it's looking good so far there you
go guys Tiger running on a PC dude
thanks so much that was a great hack
everyone gorgeous more on that five one
last question before I leave
was that legal actually yeah it
definitely is so think of it as a shower
application try it out to feel for OS 10
and then go by Mac not planning on it
alright remember
winners don't do wares but I will see
you next about this that's about it for
this edition of hacked point 5 if you
have any questions or comments about
anything covered feel free to shoot us
an email or contact us to the forums and
while you're at the site don't forget to
cast your vote at the bowl also lots of
great things happening in independent
media this month what's going to be
coming to us live next week from
Newton's Bar and Grille tech file a tech
file that CA is going to be doing a live
show on the 8th and rumor has it the
broken episode 4 on the 12th the brokens
back let's open oh I'm so looking
forward to that me too and of course
diggnation command down your weeklies
and many more great IPTV WASD
open alpha from the shadows right so uh
you know too many to even lists so get
your updates at tech file no I don't get
him a tech file get him a tech tainment
geek video big dance org IV roots so
much love for the big cast community
show your support keeps us torn seeding
and we will see you next month on Darren
and I'm les
crush your back no lust
the Parana good scream plan for you last
weekend lol WTF and I will just I'm
going to get some whereas whereas I love
that and whereas as in good a 97 little
meter case fan that's gonna keep your
drive nice and cool sweet so there's
really hot and sweaty lamp oh god it's
not bad really not sweaty bill i'ma go
steering and on West
what was my longing shit shit sorry I
remember the last time you mother I'm
your ghost Aaron and I'm Wes and for an
additional 1995 we'll even get nothing
won't what I'm saying about the alley
things yeah you crosses over here oh no
we're not gonna do that we're just gonna
get naked every Wednesday yeah welcome
halflings to another episode
my five Michelle will recover Oh Krag
hats and locks we don't cover cracks
you're thinking of like hasta LaVista
yeah I know rolled off the tongue when
we cover code laws and some laughs
that's not so lame
it's just ditching
several other applications you have to
have sse3 unfortunately I don't have
that but you will be able to install mac
OS and run most of the applications and
having survived it's all natural attack
countermeasure perfect now all we have
to do is turn it back on and hope that
we see Louie right I will see you next
the sounds go back to Gibson good use it
it's gonna get oh you know it is God
we're secret or sex or one of you cut
that
but it's an ancient file format and
we're back at point five and I'm your
host Garen and with us today is a
special guest real player in from
Seattle Washington realplayer how are
you great thanks for having me
well it's great to have you on the show
you know there's a big question on
everybody's mind today and that's with
podcasting and IPTV how is that
affecting reals market share why don't
you go ahead and let us know what you
think well you see Darren and and and
and what the hell is buffering then give
me a real guess please
