by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is Darren kitchen and this
it's a Mike Osman Mike welcome to the
show it's dude it has been been so long
since you were here in studio that the
last time you were we were talking about
the jawbreaker yeah and it wasn't here
in studio it was at a different studio
right so it has been way too long
and of course Mike is on a very special
mission to keep us in focus and provide
don'know stickers stickers yes
so Mike's idea is to start a new sticker
wallet maybe with Shannon's but alright
tendon saying it was ours and I guess
we're gonna do just that's alright thank
you sticker we're gonna go with the
Great Scott gadget hardware for hackers
excellent
nice get you right there in the corner
Wow boom our girl sticker alright new
wall 5:48 marks three three nine three
seven one San Francisco California
ninety 104 send the stickers but we're
not here to talk about stickers today
we're here to hack some RF it's such an
appropriate named product isn't it hack
RF yeah well you've been having well
we've been having so much fun with your
new yardstick one which everybody should
go out and get because Mike did an
amazing job putting together a cc at
eleven K or is the K important I guess
just on that CC eleven eleven okay just
to see 1111 and if you want to recap
that for anybody that's new to hacking
sub one gigahertz yeah so yardstick one
is a radio dongle and it's basically a
digital radio modem on a chip so it
allows you to take various radio systems
do mostly low speed digital
communication systems below one
gigahertz in frequency and interface
with them very easily and and it's it's
not really a software-defined radio of
people kind of know me for a
software-defined radio stuff like hack
RF but but it's a software controlled
radio and it's very easy to use and
that's why I like it and that's why I
wanted to come out with this product was
to was to make a device that was very
easy to use the learning curve for SDR
is steep that's it's rewarding I think
for people to learn SDR in the long run
you're going to be able to do more
things with software-defined radio but
if you want to get something done
quickly and as easily as possible for
many applications it's easier at least
in part to use tools like like yardstick
1 using RF cat and other tools that
might have a like a wireless transceiver
chip as opposed to software-defined
radio right and it makes it as easy to
hack with some gigahertz stuff that that
say in the similar sense have you played
with the ESPE 8826 s or whatever right
and you can just like you know hit them
with 80 commands over a serial
connection it's kind of in the same vein
you're not interfacing directly with the
radio you're telling the radio what to
do exactly yeah
you're controlling the radio from
software same thing of uber tooth is the
same type of architecture right so if
you have a 2.4 gigahertz a kind of
solution that you're trying to probe and
it's using Bluetooth or anything that's
vaguely like Bluetooth you can use uber
tooth instead of using suffer define
radio there are two different tools two
different types of tools those wireless
transceiver chips versus
software-defined radio software-defined
radio is far more flexible and powerful
but oftentimes the wireless transceiver
chips are easier to use for a given
application and that's why I think it's
it's beneficial to have both kinds of
tools in your toolbox well we're gonna
be using both tools today in fact
because you bots brought some fun things
to hack on that I think everybody should
have some experience with especially if
your parents have liquor cabinets with
one of these yeah so this is a this is a
cabinet lock a wirelessly controlled
cabinet lock and so it has that gets
installed in a cabinet or drawer so you
just screw this into the side and then
yep and then there's this guitar it's in
a locked state right now but if I enter
the code what the booze let me enter the
code in the keypad okay here
GSG
yes and then an okay that I had the
unlock button mm-hmm
totally didn't work one more time okay
I really should use a shorter password
there it is
aha there was a little click there
before you pulled that out it was I was
unlocking I got to the booze we got ya
okay and then similarly too so you want
to show that to the other camera so that
we can actually see this keypad it's
kind of interesting and that number
numbers and an unlock and a lock button
and nothing happens until you hit the
lock or unlock button you enter in a
numeric code you hit the unlock or a
lock button and then something happens
so it's keyless entry in a similar way
to what we've been talking about with
like you know key fobs and that sort of
system right it's very similar to that
except with a keypad that allows you to
enter a code and and I'd like to kind of
go through an exercise where we use both
the hack RF 1 and the yardstick 1 to try
to reverse-engineer this thing as
rapidly as possible okay so I find that
it's very handy to have both tools at
your disposal some things are easier to
do in one type of tool some things are
easier to do in another type of tool
well let's get to what's the first step
well the first thing I usually do of
course is is look up the xec ID yeah
right so the FCC ID on here so I believe
it's well well there's physical access
to the liquor cabinet already you can
see the FCC logo there yeah but if you
don't you at least have the number on
here and actually there is an FCC label
on here but there is no FCC ID because
this is the receiver it's not an
intentional transmitter and that device
is that's actually a really important
point that if if you see a pair of
devices like this and one of them has an
FCC ID and the other one doesn't that is
a very strong indication that the one
that has the FCC ID is a transmitter and
the one that doesn't have the FCC ID is
a receiver and therefore it's not
bi-directional communication so ah
that's the important part because people
keep bringing this up as we've been
delving into hacking rolling
on automobiles key fobs as people are
saying like oh well how does it know
what the code is supposed to be all
obviously they go back and forth it's no
they don't right cars not transmitting
back to the fob right except on the
passive systems but just pleasure doke
but in the yeah the standard remote
keyless entry systems that's absolutely
correct so one-way communication and
this is a very strong indication just
seeing that we only have an FCC ID on
one of these devices tells us it doesn't
tell us with a hundred percent certainty
you know like sometimes things don't
follow the rules but it's a very strong
clue that this is probably one way
communication and we're only going to
see transmissions come from this device
so let's look at things here okay it's
on here are you on FCC I oh well you
know I'm actually no I don't have my
laptop hooked up to the to the system to
you let me grab this magical HDMI cable
from off-screen and then everything will
be wonderful I hear there's this place
called the internet I'd like to see
what's there
oh ok well if I just pull up my screen
here I can now go to where am I going
FCC dot IO FCC Daioh slash slash the FCC
ID is vc RTP - one zero zero thank you
right to it all right
that's easy down IO is a cool website
it's actually it was created by
Dominic's bill who is the lead developer
and the uber tooth project and his
active hack RF and yardstick one and so
forth and he put together this really
cool tool that everybody should know
about super easy to look things up and
one of the great things about FCC I oh
is it gives you an easy way to share
URLs for FCC filings because the FCC
website is horrible for that well they
just redid it actually just like toes
ago you couldn't do anything for you
could file anything and everything was
broken and it was terrible yeah so
anyway let's take a look and and I just
want to look briefly yeah
the details I mean the main thing I want
to look is right here Oh was it right
there is 315 megahertz oh you know I'm
gonna I'm not even gonna look what isn't
315 megahertz when it comes to sub gig
hacking I know there's a lot of stuff at
350 megahertz there are tire pressure
monitors or our garage door openers all
sorts of remote keyless entry systems
but sometimes you see things at 300 and
390 so 33 now we're entering the
Internet of Things where everything is
z-wave or ZigBee before there was the
internet of things you can think of it
as the dial-up of things and everything
was 315 on-off keying that's a good
point the dialog the dial-up of things
it's a back we have to apply after the
fact it's like the Stone Age you know
you didn't know you were in the Stone
Age until we were out of it so so we
should expect to find this thing at 350
megahertz now of course there's a lot
more information we could find if we dug
into the the documents but for now let's
just go with that let's see we can find
a 315 megahertz right and at this point
this is where I like to turn to
software-defined radio like hack RF one
or like a real tech dongle or you know
any kind of a software defined radio
platform yeah we've just been using
these yeah you know they're great I've
got a hacker up one plugged in here wait
so I'm gonna run Osmel comm FFT which is
a favorite tool of mine it's really
simple and it just talks to the hacker
up and gives you a real-time FFT oh
that's cool that's the FFT right from
within Canoe radio and you just called
it a command-line exactly this is a this
is just a something that you could do by
throwing together a flow graphing can
you radio companion but it's a
ready-made tool that you can call from
the ground night so let me just turn
this to 315 megahertz and see what we'd
get here I'm going to enter in my code
and try to lock or unlock it and did I
get something there we go
definitely something if you hit the key
cold then you can you can see very
distinctly right by that big middle
finger you should see something else
happen higher peak and it's really high
because I'm holding it a very close
range now one of the things I like to do
and one of the great things about
osmocon FFT is that it has this little
record button in the lower right hand
corner and so in addition to just tuning
around and adjusting the bandwidth and
adjusting the gain you can also when you
find a signal just hit the record button
and save the samples to file and it's
saving the raw as what to say cuz when
you're reporting with gqr X which is
really convenient because then we get a
nice little wav file we can open it up
in audacity it we've run into some
trouble when we want to systematically
decode that right right and I and I see
people do that a lot they use GQ or X or
some other type of tool that gives them
a record function that records or it
saves to disk the demodulated waveform
but you might not have your modulator
your demodulator in that software
configured in the right way for the type
of signal you're looking at what's great
about osmocon FFT is that its record
function saves the raw inq data the
actual data that comes over the USB from
hack RF or whatever platform you're
using the raw radio waveform now is
being saved
instead of AD modulated interpretation
of that waveform now notice that nothing
happens when I push these numeric
buttons so we can observe that very
easily
until I then press the lock or unlock
button I have to press four to eight
numerals and then I hit the lock or
unlock button and then it generates
something
so apparently what I need to do if I
want to get a nice concise capture file
is to go ahead and any buffer those in
there you're right examine a large I'll
be recording with a bunch of noise we
want is one two three four then I'll hit
record and then I'll hit the lock button
and we'll see what I get
I'm recording now I stop now let's go
take a look at that file
all right so I exit Altima comm FFT and
but take a look I have this file called
slash temp slash something-or-other it
called it name blah blah blah
I could have adjusted this name in the
GUI but the default actually encodes a
bunch of information in here that's kind
of handy to see it tells me that it was
captured at 3.15 nice times 10 to the
8th power and so forgiving it gives me
it was captured 3 or 15 megahertz there
was captured 8 million samples per
second I mean a date code so even though
I didn't change this name part of the
file name I at least get a bunch of
metadata encoded in the file name which
is kind of handy if I want to go back
and see so I'm going way better than
asdfghjkl T of naming files like that
who would do that
so say I captured one earlier but this
is the one that I captured just then and
I'm going to open it up with a new
software tool called name spectrum oh
it's it's brand new it remits very it's
very new it's very young it isn't very
sophisticated yet okay but it it is a
handy tool that you can find on github
that is made by a friend of heck RF and
mike he it's built in my case oh it's me
because my channel totally yes I've seen
him on IRC and I've seen his work on in
fact it's on our list of I saw it on
github this is that tool we were going
to show it off we're doing it right now
there we go ok so here we have this this
selector Francis it's like a waterfall
but it's not live right you can go back
and look at what happened in that
there's the lady at a red dress yeah
totally saw her go by notice the default
sample rate is 8 million which happens
to be the default sample rate in autumn
economy FFT so I didn't have to
configure that but it lets you change a
couple of options and like zoom in and
out and stuff but what I'm gonna do is
just scroll down until I get to some big
event hey look at that
and then I can scroll and see what was
going on there now you'll notice that so
this is it's kind of similar to what we
were doing on audacity except we
actually have all the data this time
right so regardless of what modulation
was used we've captured the entire the
entire event actually in a form that we
could replay without even knowing how to
demodulate it that's a fun thing to do
with SDR but I'm not going to do that
right now I'm just gonna use this in
spectrum to inspect the spectrogram and
figure out what was going on here if i
zoom in a little bit
if the zoom goes vertically and you can
see that right next to my DC offset
which is the green line down the center
there there are these bursts going on it
happens to be really close to 315
megahertz if I increase my f50 size
you'll notice that things get wider
horizontally and I can start to actually
discern a difference between the stuff
that's happening at this frequency and
the stuff that's happening at this
frequency this frequency that is my
center of frequency though so that's
where I was tuned to 315 megahertz so
this is just below 315 megahertz and
that is the signal that was being
produced by our little keypad here and
you can see you see how there's sort of
a very consistent frequency right right
- it's like on/off keying exactly in
fact we can see some that are longer
there are some gaps yeah and notice it
starts with a very consistent pattern or
if that's some kind of a preamble like I
just a clock hey what is it called we
were just talking about it last week I
would call it clock yeah yes I would
call it a preamble
although notice that unlike some
preambles it's not on and off for the
same period of time okay so see how it's
kind of long pulses right right as I
short gaps like dads and send dots
that's a little bit different than you
might see in some systems but you never
know what you're gonna get but in this
case we seem to have on/off keying where
we have a lot of long pulses to start
the packet
and then we start seeing some short
pulses and notice that these short
pulses are followed by longer gaps and
then we start seeing various short or
long pulses there every pulse seems to
be either short or long there are two
durations so this is probably pulse
width modulated on/off keying where we
have short pulses representing a 1 and
long pulses representing a 0 more
vice-versa we don't know which but you
know it's as opposed to the amplitude
shift keying stuff that we've been
working with ok and and well although I
would call this a form of amplitude
shift keying except that its pulse width
modulated and so it's yeah that the
whether it's a 1 or a 0 whether the data
bit is a 1 or a 0 is encoded in the
length of the pulse okay
the one thing you may notice is that the
duration from the start of one pulse to
the start of the next pulse is very
consistent yeah and if we look kind of
close so it's so it's almost like
there's like a constant rhythm that it
speaks Zac is a way to think of it
whether it's a short pulse or a long
pulse the time between those is always
going to be about the same yeah and if I
turn my FFT size down I actually get
like I no longer have the ability to
like tell that the precise frequency but
as well but I get better resolution in
the time domain
I have kind of there's time on the
vertical axis frequency on the
horizontal axis right and by adjusting
my FFT size doesn't seem to be moving
around frequency wise right so I don't
need to really pay attention to that I
can I can turn my FFT size up if I want
to see more frequency information I can
turn my 850 size down if I want to see
more time information so if I turn it
down I can see more precisely how much
how long these bursts are and you can
use the ruler on the left hand side
they're got to figure out and the
African millisecond you can eyeball this
and see basically like there is a unit
of time and a short pulse is
one unit yeah followed by a gap of two
units I mean everything uses time units
even ryfi a long pulse is two units long
followed by a gap of one unit so
everything's in these three time units
and so if you were to interpret it
interpret it as a basic amplitude shift
keying a long pulse would look like one
one zero and a short pulse would look
but like one zero zero right if I call a
symbol some time so we mean we guessed
like okay to make that just make the
hypothesis how can we systematically now
take this data and and test that theory
and see oh well does it give us I don't
know like a normal unit of bits like do
you get 64 bits out of this or something
right common right and this is the point
at which everybody if you if you've used
SDR this is the point at which you've
said okay it's really easy to get to
this point how do I get to the next
point how do i and now I figured out how
the information have data yeah I should
do something like you get from the way
for him to bits you won't see the bits
graph paper yeah and and sharpies and
that's how you make really nice-looking
presentations instead of PowerPoint no
that's what Mike does yeah so you know
you've had the you've had the experience
of struggling with getting from the
waveform to bits and in particular yes
running the problems with clock recovery
have you Matt yes I have well the new
radio is awesome in that one of those
modules that clock recovery should if
you filter it the right way if you send
it the right signal mm-hmm it should be
able to spit out bits and I saw a great
paper that you did with help me out here
I mean I don't know either logo but I
can't remember their name anyway another
security vendor on you know done doing
exactly this I don't know okay it's no
mental in the paper hidden a thing that
I've worked on a lot and everyone who's
ever done the digital reverse
engineering with software-defined radio
has struggled with
recovery yeah like a well I guess it's
it's a very picky beast it seems to be
it seems to only want delicious packets
and if you feed it you like one
delicious package its garbage is gonna
come out right you have to figure out
you have to learn how to kind of massage
your input to a clock recovery algorithm
so that you set it up for success but
we're not gonna mess with any of that
today no we're not going to take out
this IQ data and squash it down and feed
it into the I'd love to teach people how
to do that but it takes many hours so so
that's what my SDR video series is for I
chose mention right we were talking at
the talk about how the differences
between the yardstick versus hack RF and
how you can do everything with
software-defined radio right it's just a
little steeper of a learning curve but
you've made that a lot easier so I'm
going to save it for the end but let's
just plug it now you guys should stop
watching hack 5 right now head over to
Mike's site because you're doing some
awesome tutorials with great Scott on
the great sky gadget site about and
we're getting radio theory like one of
the stuff we're getting there and then
there's also videos that Shannon's done
and I mean a lots of people are trying
to help you learn SDR you you know you
everyone but but it is a a steep
learning curve there's a long way to go
even my video I'm ten videos into I'm
ten videos into my video series and I
still haven't gotten a clock recovery
yet we'll get there but I'm not there
yet yeah so but what I want to do today
is turn away from SDR brutalities the
nice thing about these is you can start
going straight into the practical
exactly I know how to write Python right
and if your reverse engineering a system
like this the SDR platform like hack RF
one is fantastic for finding the signal
recording the signal analyzing it
determining the modulation determining
the data rate which I'm not going to do
right now but you can use the the ruler
right here on the side of the screen to
to figure out what the this unit of time
is here and it turns out there's twenty
four hundred and fifty time units per
second so a bit rate we've got a bit
rate okay once we know a frequency and a
type of modulation and a data rate we
can turn to a fast
easy-to-use tool like yardstick one for
the next step in the process let's do
just that now I want to thank Mike Osman
for joining us in studio we're having so
much fun and we will pick this up
tomorrow with part 2 of 2 because this
is really exciting taking what we've now
done with the hack RF and then putting
it over into the yardstick one with RF
cat and we're going to demodulate and
crack this code and break those locks
it's gonna be so much fun so I will see
you tomorrow with that if you have
questions leave them in the comments and
before we get going I do want to thank
our awesome sponsor domain.com if you
guys have been watching the show for a
while you know how much we love these
guys they're fast affordable easy to use
and they will get your website up online
in no time and getting started with
domain.com is a snap whether you're
looking for a new domain or hosting and
right now I can't express how right now
is really the most epic time ever to get
yourself a new domain over at domain.com
because they are having a big huge
awesome gigantic sale hh-hey jumbo is
the coupon code that's gonna get you an
extra 35% off new domain registrations
it's a limited time off for just between
now and november 30th so you really have
to act fast
but again domain comm use that code hak5
at domain.com for supporting hack 5 for
so many years and remember when you
think domain names think domain.com for
Shannon Morse and myself and of course
Mike Osman we will see you what we'll
see you tomorrow and again next week
until then trust your tech palace
/ we actually get into the setup in the
demo I do want to talk real quick about
some of the differences between the
yardstick one and the other CC 11 and
angles so most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
