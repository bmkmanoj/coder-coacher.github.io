bitbucket by Atlassian welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas before I get
started don't forget to hit that
subscribe button if you are watching
this over on YouTube so you get to see
all of our newest active episodes I am
your host Shannon Morrison today we are
talking about dealing with flash drives
in the terminal see if physical hard
media is actually pretty easy to manage
through the terminal all the way down to
installing ISOs and including formatting
I recently had to write an ISO for
example to a flash drive in Linux for a
main cabinet build that we were doing on
hack 5 and texting which are my two
other shows so it was really important
to me that I did it right because it was
for assignment now going over to my
computer you can see what devices are
mounted by just typing mount and you're
going to see a whole lot of stuff in
here
you'll see devices listed as a device
flash de vie on directory called the
mount point plus the type of file system
and any kind of options now if I stick a
flash drive in my computer which I'll do
now and do the same command where's the
flash drive port there it is the hood
downstair goes ok ah now that I have
that flash drive plugged into my
computer I type mount again and it's
going to show up in my file directory on
the GUI sure but it's also showing up
under that mount command at the very end
so in my case it shows up at slash dev
slash SD a 1 to unmount that device
because oftentimes with flash drives if
you don't unmade you can type you mount
slash dev and in my case slash SD a1 or
whatever the flash drive name is that
appears on your computer now be really
really careful with names you can screw
up your computer if you unmount the
wrong three thing or if you end up
formatting the wrong flash drive or
formatting your hard drive instead now
next thing we want to do is change the
mounting point to by typing mount TAC T
whatever the file system is for your
flash
five and then flash dev slash sd1 and
then put it in whatever that new
directory is now breaking this down this
basically correlates to mount from
melting some type of storage media in my
case is the flash drive tak T is the
filesystem type so maybe it's in fat or
maybe it's exp three or whatever it
might be for the type of file system
that you're mounting so flash drive and
then slash DES slash SDA one which is
the name of the flash drive according to
my operating system and lastly the new
directory for wherever I want it to
mount the thing about Linux is the mount
point can end up being anywhere in this
file system tree so if you have pictures
on your flash drive and you want to
mount it in the pictures folder you can
do so you can change the directory as
well with CD slash does slash sd1 and
then go into that directory
once you type LS you'll actually be able
to see all those photos now if you try
to unmount your flash drive while you're
chilling inside of it while it's mounted
in some kind of directory it's going to
give you an error just like it does on
my computer so what you want to do is CD
back over to your home directory and
then you can unmount it now I'm going to
do a little bit more about formatting
right after the break
let's be honest your code is your world
you create it you tweak it you break it
and hopefully you fix it - and you
lovingly obsess over it every single day
so picking the right repository
management tool is super important only
the best for your code right that's why
the tena Atlassian created bitbucket
bitbucket is the good solution for
professional teams helping over five
million developers build with a purpose
the bucket gives teams of all sizes free
private repositories with state of the
art features like the world's best pool
request algorithm built in continuous
delivery and integrations with your
favorite tools like docker AWS and Ezer
plus you get JIRA integration since it
is from Atlassian giving your team
everything you need to take your code
from concepts all the way to customer we
have used bitbucket to share private
code and collab on it so that the code
is absolutely perfect before we release
it publicly bitbucket is for the code
that takes
to Mars it's for the code that drives
your next car or maybe it's for the code
for your next InfoSec tool you can visit
bitbucket org slash for the code to
start your free account
that's bitbucket org slash for the code
try bitbucket today
what will your code do we are back and
now it's time to reformat some flash
drives so let's reformat our drive make
sure that it is an empty drive and you
write down the name so that you don't
end up reformatting your hard drive
accidentally so in my case again it's a
CA one first off I want to unmount the
flash drive again and I want to use CF
disk slash dev slash
SD a one to use F disk now in here
you're going to see a little command
that says type M so type N to see the
whole menu and this is basically the
help menu it'll show you all the
different commands that you can do but
next we are going to type P to view the
partitions so this is going to give me
information about the kind of disk that
I am wanting to reformat if I want to I
can type to you to exit or I can check
em for the menu again to see what else I
can do through the drive or to write any
edits with W and then I can quit I've
actually used this same fdisk technique
for a hard drive that was not working on
Windows for some reason because it
couldn't read a 4 terabyte hard drive so
I fixed it in Linux and then I installed
it on my gaming machine at home and I
finally was able to read all four
terabytes so F just totally works
I love it back on my computer if you
want to make a new file system on your
flash drive you can use sudo make FS
that's mkfs /t and whatever your file
system type is slash dev and slash SDA
one next to discuss is filesystem check
or fsck for short it's kind of
weird-looking it almost looks like a
curse word to be honest this can repair
filesystem if there is some kind of
problem with it so my flash drive for
example has a problem luckily it's a
very easy problem to fix so I'm going to
type in sudo fsck
slash dead slash SDA one to check its
integrity and it sees a problem so I
just took one and hit
and I'm going to run it again so I'll
type in the f ck s da one and this time
it shows me that there are no issues to
be found
yay so I fixed it now lastly to copy
files from one drive all the way over to
another you can use the DD command which
stands for data definition I actually
remember it by saying duplicate data I
know that's not what it means
but duplicate data makes a lot more
sense to me so I can type in DD if i F
equals and then whatever the file is
that I want to copy so I'm going to copy
this patreon py of equals slash does
slash SD a 1 so if it's the input of the
original file and of is the output or
where you want to send the file you can
also use this to burn iso images to a
drive or for example you can use d D if
equals and then laka ISO of equal slash
does slash SD a 1 so that would be to
burn the Locka iso over to my flash
drive alternatively you can also reverse
the two file names if you want to copy
the bootable info off of the flash drive
onto your hard drive and then make it
ISO out of them later to wrap this up
and you should always check the md5
checksum of any kind of iso that you
download online so this is going to
verify that the iso is authentic and it
wasn't changed by some man-in-the-middle
interception now a website is probably
going to show you md5 checksum and then
a bunch of numbers and letters that
don't really make any sense this is
going to show you that there's an
algorithmically generated specific heat
that only belongs to that file
md5 is very old-school I know it can be
hacked but for the most part this will
help you out in knowing whether or not a
file is good you can run a check by
typing md5 sum md5 and then actual s um
sum and then whatever the file is dot I
so when you hit enter it will show you
md5 checksum and whatever the letters
and numbers are in my case I'm not using
an ISO for this example but it's very
very simple thank you so much to
bitbucket
