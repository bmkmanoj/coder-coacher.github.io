welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas i'm jim
morrison today we are checking out
Wireshark and address resolution
protocol aka tarp oh the guys are
looking at me weird so today we're going
to delve into understanding normal
traffic and being able to find abnormal
happenings on your network so first
let's discuss how a computer actually
sends a tcp/ip protocol packet so first
your computer is going to send out a
thing called an ARP request this
basically means that your computer has
some sort of IP address and some sort of
MAC address and it wants to try to send
something to another IP address so
another computer but it doesn't
necessarily know the MAC address the
address resolution protocol aka tarp
will respond with hey that's me and here
is my MAC address here you go and then
everything is shiny and happy because
both parties can see each other in some
packets to each other so everything's
cool so now let's look in an example of
an ARP packet and what that header looks
like so if I go over to Wikipedia
Wikipedia is awesome and they have a
wonderful layout of exactly what an ARP
is and what one would look like so in
this little graph over here it says
Internet Protocol ipv4 over Ethernet ARP
packet so an ARP header this is what
this is over here this will have a
hardware type like type 1 for Ethernet
and then it will have a protocol type
run right underneath that so this could
be like ipv4 which would be listed in
Wireshark as 0 X 0 8 0 0 and a step down
you're going to see the hardware address
link so this would be like a number 6
for Ethernet and right underneath
Hardware address length you'll have
protocol address length so this is going
to be something like ipv4 which would be
shown in Wireshark as the number 4 below
this will be the operation that the
sender is doing so 1 for request or 2
for reply and then
you'll have the sender's hardware
address and the protocol add address and
lastly is the targets hardware or
protocol address as well now these last
few could be an example like the MAC
address for the hardware in the IP
address for protocol now I'll show you a
few examples of this after the break in
my own Wireshark so you can see exactly
where you can find this information the
hex shop is hack 5s premier store for
all your pen testing needs including one
of my favorites the USB rubber ducky
which looks like a flash drive and it
types like a keyboard it can type
scripts into a computer ridiculously
quickly like this week's favorite from
buzzer man I kind of love your forum
name the script allows any application
to run on top of the Windows seven login
screen that's kind of cool ooh scary
whoo we couldn't do this show without
your support so we would like to thank
you with something special use the
coupon code snubz with any order from
the hack shop for your very own signed
by me hack tip stickers and again thank
you so much for supporting the show and
we're back with apart packets I like
saying that now if I run a packet
capture in Wireshark which I have
already done for you guys so you don't
have to wait for me and I look for some
sort of ARP protocol I can find one that
has an address resolution protocol
packet header for a request and a reply
now you'll notice that the MAC address
listed under Wireshark is just a bunch
of zeros so if I go down here this is a
broadcast from this Asus tech computer
and it's an ARP and it's looking for
this one that says who has 1070 330 170
so I'm looking for that MAC address for
that IP address if I go under the second
box down here where you get a little bit
more information and we've discussed
what's down here a little bit you'll
notice that I have the address
resolution protocol request so the
request is the first part the reply is
the second of course now down under here
a little bit lower you'll notice that
the sender of course I have my MAC
address and I have my IP address but we
do not have the MAC address of the
target so all we see are a bunch of
zeros now that could be anything right
it's currently not known but
we find the reply packet you'll notice
that the Mac is now filled in so as soon
as the reply goes through that Mac will
change to the actual MAC address of
whoever that target was so that dot 70
IP address
now if devices on your network tend to
change do different IP addresses which
is pretty common
then Wireshark will send out something
called a gratuitous ARP which basically
means that it will keep the destination
open so when it receives replies it'll
collect all the new IP addresses of all
the other machines on the network that
sounds like a lot the destination will
be set to something like F F : F F : and
so on and so forth and then the target
in the sender IP addresses are going to
be the same down in the description so
this information can be very very
interesting while you're doing your
packet captures if you're looking for a
specific protocol type is certain header
especially if you're trying to make sure
that those address resolution protocol
x' are going through correctly now if we
compare this to what we saw on Wikipedia
let's go over here so first we we have
Ethernet which is number one under the
hardware type and if we go over here
you'll notice that the hardware type is
the first part number zero second off we
have the protocol type so this is going
to be IP luckily Wireshark lists this
for you but if it does not if it just
shows you the zero X zero eight zero
zero you already know from our
description earlier that this is going
to be the second part of the header and
this will be IP address interesting and
you can go down below this and see the
hardware size the protocol size the
request or if it is a reply and then of
course the MAC and IP addresses of each
now I know this is quite a bit of
information but this is a very very
important part of networking and
understanding how everything works on
your network so you can actually use
Wireshark usefully let me know what you
think of course send me a comment below
or you can email us tips at hack 5 org
and be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 for more great stuff just like
this we just moved into our warehouse
and I would love it if you guys checked
it out I'll be there of course reminding
you to trust your Tecna list bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
