by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen and this is
your weekly dose of techno lyst kind of
an unusual scene here i am actually at
the seattle-tacoma Airport about to head
back from tour camp which was I can't
even begin to explain to you how amazing
and you guys will find out next week as
we kick off season 12 some of the
amazing stuff that we saw at tour camp
well right now I'm excited to talk to
you guys about Def Con um you know it's
just like it's con season it's like you
know black hat that def con the tour
camp we've got derby coming up we've got
tour again and San Diego it's gonna be
so fantastic and some awesome hak5
meetups so be sure to pay attention to
the social networks the twitter is the
Google+ is to find out how you can get
involved with hak5 and fun stuff that
we're doing in the San Francisco Bay
Area but anyway without further ado I
just wanted to kick it off to our
awesome segments we've got the quad shot
guys back we got Georgia women finding
out all about Android hacking it's gonna
be good I'll see you on the other side
you may remember one year ago here at
def con 2011 we ran into this awesome
UAV and now we're here talk to once
again the guys from kwacha what's up
Peter hi how are you doing I'm doing
really well so it was exactly one year
ago that we saw this flying thing over
the Rio and Laura what is that and talk
to you about this thing that you were
trying to get going you did the
Kickstarter thing had you guys at in
studio that was so cool it's been
exactly one year now uh what what have
you learned about the experience it was
a very encouraging experience it's like
it took us a year now we are shipping
and we have all the molds done and
things are getting together and we are
now fulfilling all the orders from
Kickstarter and continuing from their
own so what would you say are some of
the most challenging aspects of the
project see and feel free anybody just
jumped in here so I can chime in on that
I did the mechanical design and sew them
the mold process of sort of my
my bailiwick and getting that done took
almost six months but we're really happy
with how they came out and so now the
the production models just looked
beautiful and but it took a long time to
get there now I was actually following
the Kickstarter and all the updates and
one of the things I notices you guys had
to change materials for the pylons at
one point and so can somebody tell me
what's the deal with behind that and
what does that mean for the consumer so
basically we where prototyping using a
PP material it is a foam material that
makes it light and nice but we had to
realize that this material is difficult
to work with and creates longer times of
turnaround at the molding factory and
many other things so we had to decide to
use EPO instead that allowed us to do
the pylons with overmolding so basically
you have a plastic skeleton inside the
Pilon that is rigid and you can / mold
it with the phone so that made it much
better and so over the pros and cons of
the two different materials EPP in EPL
so EPP it's very durable you can like
hit it as hard as you want and unless
you physically tear it it will rebound
to its original shape EPO EPO which is
what we're using it's a little easier to
like ding with your fingernail but it's
much more nonreactive so EPP for example
in this environment here where it's 108
degrees or something it would actually
start to kind of wilt and slowly change
and creep and change shape in the heat
EPO is totally totally like doesn't care
we leave in like the bat we leave it in
the car here in the garage and it's
where it's a million degrees doesn't
matter and it also has a EPO has this
really nice shiny beautiful surface and
it's just a really clean material to
work with so so per night you were
telling me that you actually did some
crash testing and really tried to tear
up with watch out what was the was the
procedure like what was your method for
this and what did you find with the new
material well so he initially chose EPP
like Jeff said because it's a very
robust material and when we decided to
switch to EPO we said well we better
make sure that it's at least as robust
right and we have these accelerometers
we can test how many g's an MP
creates so right after we got our first
shots from the factory with the EPO
material we went out spent a couple of
days just flying it up and lacking this
aircraft into the ground whacking it
into trees and essentially what we found
was and i think we had like 15 g
collisions and what we found was that
whereas the EPP would at some point
essentially just air and then you'd have
to glue the wing back together EPO would
you know get creased it would have some
dings but then you could take those out
with hot water but the airframe would
bind largest stay intact and so you know
that was fantastic because we had the
advantage of immune immaterial and you
know the disadvantage is that we were
scared off that it wouldn't be as robust
we're just not true because it was
better so it worked out quite well so
what other things have changed besides
the material is the autopilot software
and all of the other accelerometers and
the board have they stayed pretty much
the same since we last spoke so
definitely so we as week this was
actually an interesting story in itself
so and we started we got more money than
we expected so o Allah I just remember
refreshing the Kickstarter page when the
hak5 episode came out I know that
there's a lot of viewers that are really
excited to get their sorry tangent yes
so basically we said like ok so we got
so much more to support from the people
so we want to like give back and we want
to improve on it so basically the
autopilot got a new revision it's a two
point O revision of the Lisa mi
autopilot we also improved the IMU we
are using new chips from event sense
that are smaller more more reliable more
have better behavior in a calibration so
they don't diverge between the chips so
much so you don't need to it is
improving things if you can so so
there's like UT like jitter is that what
it was and no basically the
manufacturing differences between the
chips are not as significant as they
were before so it is basically all the
software as it comes is able to deal
with it much better you don't need to
like calibrate it as much of course it
would improve things but it is
completely acceptable performance
without without doing that and then
remind me again what I am is sense for
and so it is an inertial measurement
unit so we have in the basic model we
have just accelerate three
accelerometers three gyroscopes in this
one tiny chip in the higher level models
we have also a pressure sensor for the
altitude measurement as well as a
magnetometer for heading so adding GPS
and doing some more interesting stuff is
definitely possible that's what I'm
really excited to do with this is it
seems like a great platform to start
building on that more interesting stuff
have you been able to maintain the same
payload capacity around 13 ounces or so
and so the airframe itself because of
their robustness requirements and the
manufacturing requirements got a little
bit heavier but at the end it's
basically the same payload it's not
impacting it very much so and one other
exciting change we did I think since we
first showed it to you is so the pylons
now instead of being glued in actually
snap in and snap out and so they yeah he
can grab one so the spar that runs
through the through the long axis of the
wing is strong enough that the that the
pylon just literally snaps on so here
I'll show you that sowed so the the
skeleton inside the foam has this just
see shaped gripper basically and then
inside the wing is the carbon-fiber tube
and so basically for transporter if you
crash these can just pop out and then
you just snap them in like that and so
they're locked in place and so to do
that we need to make the carbon fiber
spar a little heftier and so that's
essentially the biggest change the foam
weights are nearly identical and so that
must obviously make it easier for the
consumer to assemble transport of course
it you can now fold it much be easier
like last year ago I remember we were
coming here with two quad shots and
basically the whole trunk was taken
taken by the quad shots now you can snap
them off and we just put it behind the
passenger seats in the back stack them
up perfect they're like IKEA they flat
pack hello and so so now you guys know
that it's like okay you know you did
your initial you get your investment and
you're working with factories and now
all of those other logistics and fun
things come into place like hey you know
actually it would be great if there's a
salt flat packed what if there what have
you learned that you weren't expecting
that you even needed to find out about
that's yes that's one thing like no
hacker can figure that we did but it's
just ah yes okay it's like we we work we
had some backers from Australia for
example they have like super weird
requirements in sizes of boxes it's like
we had to shave off like inches of the
box at the end like so that it the big
difference was like five hundred dollars
shipment versus the fifty dollars yeah
it's well that's a hack within itself
now tell me curse about the actual
flying of it with the different material
since it is a little heavier have you
actually is there a difference how does
it feel the major difference is because
I they do fly better they're slippier
their smoother they're polished before
we machine them ourselves out of the epp
we never late we didn't wire cut them we
didn't get to hotwire them because the
the scimitars shape crescent shape so
these are definitely more
aerodynamically efficient it they're
better cool and of course with the
autopilot software that kind of assists
as well that must make that and with the
the new version of the board I'm sure
that all gets a little sexier yeah this
is like things like it changes more
connectors so that you can have now much
easier access to the eight connector for
the for a gimbal that is actuated in
both axes that is now really easy to do
well it's something for for people to
figure out but it's a in this this
software advantages like we had a
working software as he saw it was flying
really nice but over this year we were
like flying a lot and pranay did quite a
lot of improvements in the algorithms
for compensating for example in a turn
so maybe yeah how does that evolved so
one of the things that you know you
mentioned the jitter now part of the
reason for the jitter initially was that
the control system was based in such a
way as to fly in a certain area of the
flight envelope you know at a certain
angle attack and a certain throttle
setting so now what we've gone ahead and
done is that we've made it such that you
know different types of control systems
and different types of control gains
are employed depending on what the angle
of the vehicle is or what the speed of
the vehicle is and so now you can get
very very stable flight in really really
you know like a huge envelope so you can
firewall the throttle and still have a
nice stable really fast flight and you
know just pull all kinds of angles and
you know it'll still be nice and stable
and so you know that's out a lot and
then we've done a lot with safeties
because again you know designing for
manufacturing and sending it out into
the public is very different so you say
designing for safety what do you mean by
that well so you know things like
initially last year we had this on off
switch on our transmitter that would
turn it on now if you pull the pitch
stick for example and turned it on the
thing would actually spin up its drops
and come and eat your face now what we
have is a safety where it makes sure
that your sticks have to be centered
your throttle has to be all the way down
before the autopilot arms and therefore
you have to make an affirmative action
put on your you know turn everything on
push up your throttle and only then will
they take off and so you know exactly
that is going to just take off straight
and so I'm going to just go in any
random direction because a switch was
you know configured wrong for example
and that's the kind of refinement that
you find when you have a year to start
you know and have you thought about
doing like some sort of like AI
self-preservation where it's like huh my
out choose dropping rather quickly and
I'm not pointed up maybe I want to flip
over and hit the engine well you know
there are things that we're working on
at the moment one of the things that you
have to kind of walk around as far as
you know giving it autonomous features
is to keep it within the FAA guidelines
and you're right right because isn't
there like a point of intelligence where
then you start happen to get like
regulations come into play absolutely so
essentially what we've done at the
moment is that if you lose radio contact
for example or if you turn off your
transmitter by mistake what it will do
is it'll turn off the motors and
essentially do a fast glide down to the
earth so that because the point of
impact at that point is probably not
heavy enough to damage the airframe
significantly compared to if the motors
are turning and you're just doing up you
know power dive into the ground so that
kind of helps a little bit and all
so the mortars are part of it's much
less likely to damage other things on
the ground or hurt other people because
you don't have these spinning props and
you know that's one of the safety
features we've added and written because
the difference there is if you were to
press if the radio were to disconnect
you can't keep those motors going and
have intelligence right right so the FAA
rules are under a review right now but
essentially right now you have to
operate as a remote control vehicle
where the pilot always has affirmative
control of of the aircraft so yeah right
now you cannot sell a fully autonomous
UAV and then go and fly it and go and
fly it all by all autonomously by itself
you so we're selling it as a kid and
it's and it's such an RC vehicle and
then what we're hoping people do is you
know on their own of their own volition
you know personal use do cool things
with it and and because it is okay to
have something like this where you still
maintain that RC link but can add more
autonomy on top of that and and so it
truly is a hackable UAV platform yes
absolutely so what's next for you guys
Oh for now basically finish up building
them and sending them out to people and
we will continue improving the software
improving things and we are just waiting
for people to come back and say what
they like what they don't like what we
should improve and go from there and
maybe build some more other add-ons to
it more more hardware we'll see yeah we
also have some exciting other also
different vehicles in the way same way
that the quad shots differing from an
airplane in a helicopter we have other
exciting types of vehicles we're just
getting started on so a lot of ideas
coming up you guys will have to let us
know especially when you get all of
these I just imagine like a swarm of the
mesh networking and taking over the
skies thank you so much guys it's really
a president I'm so happy to see how you
know in one year it's really blown up
you guys are proud of your success
so get this I'm in the seattle-tacoma
Airport on my way back from tour khan
and I just had a poorly an idea adorable
puppy rentals it's like like mail-order
DVD service except for cute puppies and
then that way you can go downtown and
pick up chicks right well when you have
awesome ideas like that what you need to
do is go over to domain com to the best
place to register domain for next great
idea they've got you know Comstock hose
all of the domain name out my favorite
of course com it's the original you know
we all know and love it it's Lobley
understood immediate credibility is
given you know you know what your
website is going to be and plus if you
want to invest since like selling and
trading domains the dot-coms have the
highest after market value so find new
comm names over at domain.com you know
Shannon I we love them they're
affordable to be reliable they're easy
to use and plus domain com is so active
on Twitter the support is so cool
they'll take care of you tweet at
domain.com and you know show some love
because do wacom wants to hook you guys
up just like they're hooking hak5 up get
fifteen percent off their already
affordable donated names when you end
their web host and when you head over to
domain com and use the coupon code hak5
that's fifteen percent off for the
savings and don't forget to use coupon
code hak5 when you think domain names
think domain.com
so who doesn't love a framework what's
your framework about it's about bringing
smartphones into a pen test so up until
now it's kind of been like we have
always bring your own devices and
whatnot that are attaching to our email
or servers just getting on the network
being just like another node on the
network but there's no real way to test
them from a social engineering
standpoint from a vulnerability
standpoint and I'm trying to make that
possible bring so we're talking about
mobile phones and tablets you know our
iOS and Android devices so what are you
trying to do with the software what I'm
trying to do is just bring in all of the
known exploits social engineering
attacks remote attacked client-side post
exploitation write some things for each
platform see once you've gotten in what
you're able to find from a corporate
standpoint from post exploitation just
trying to make it something like we're
used to as Network pen testers a tool
that looks normal to us has the same
sort of feel and gives us this
information about smartphones what's I
mean it's obviously ridiculously
important right now notice that we've
seen like there's you know exploit after
X plate and you usually use for good fun
like jailbreaking a routing and yet so
much devastation could be brought upon a
corporation in an environment now where
it's so much so that people are just
like oh well of course I can bring my
iphone into work and connect it to the
Wi-Fi and you know boom another node
must know though why why another tool
kit instead of just making everything
like a module for a toolkit or a
framework that already exists like you
know the metasploit to the world right
create my own thing I feel like those
tools work really great i love
metasploit and i love social engineered
toolkit i use them on every engagement
but I just felt like this had a
different scenario we're moving toward
more towards using the mobile modem in
the phone as opposed to just a regular
call back over the network so it just
seems easier to create my own thing
hopefully I want to do some integration
with those other tools at some point
right now just what I was looking for
was just a little bit different so it
okay so tell me about this the software
it's obviously but you know that goes on
your computer what's the tie-in with the
phone then but what I actually have
right now your option to use the mobile
modem for instance if you want to send
out SMS is like social engineering SMS
is trying to get them to click on a link
or download an app the exact same thing
we're seeing from malware writers so are
my users in the environment going to
click on this so it seems like most of
the tools right now
you have to use a paid gateway over the
internet to send SMS but I figure you're
already paying for probably infinite SMS
is on your phone so my platform actually
hooks up to the mobile modem you already
have in your phone so when you tell it
from the from the server to send an SMS
your phone actually sends it so my
scenario is a pen tester now is I go out
and I get myself like a burner phone
something pretty paid for a month while
I'm doing this engagement and I'm
sending all of my you know fishing text
messages through this just as I would
create bogus email addresses absolutely
exactly like either put a prepaid sim in
it or just get a burner phone somewhere
like Best Buy and yeah just for your
exactly the same way exact same attacks
we're seeing them in the wild so we need
to know as corporations our users going
to click on these malicious emails are
they going to click on delicious text
messages same thing if they're on the
network attaching to your email
attesting to any other corporate node
then we need to know our users falling
for social engineering so what about the
actual exploitation so you know I'm
using this tool to send out those text
messages I get them to click what do I
get them to click right now either it
will put up a malicious web page they'll
try and pop their browser typical way
you do it with PCs as well and we've
seen that in the phone side as well and
it also will have you directly download
an app like oh well this is cool Angry
Birds add-on please download this was
for instance I had one of my phone
providers actually send me one and SMS
and it said you're a premium handset
subscriber you can download this
security app and sent me to a third
party app store so I can build something
just like that so I want to know if this
was legit that your phone company sent
you yes this is absolutely good we have
to burn them what telco is this it's the
steam oh nice right so I want to know if
I'm in a corporate environment if my
users are gonna click on that they're
seeing this so if they're falling for it
for tmobile when it's legit will they
fall for it when it's j random hacker
this not legit so same sort of scenarios
we've been doing with pcs forever but
we're just moving it into the phone room
in fact more and more the hacking is
going mobile i mean i actually think i'm
on j random hackers cellular network
share i mean it is def con and I mean
even like the ninja guys over there have
like their own cell tower going
right exactly i think you'll see more
and more of it i think it's just really
starting to get big a lot of people like
oh i haven't seen that much mobile
malware but i think it's just more
fiscally awesome still to do ie or
Firefox but I say three to five years
we're not even going to have laptops
it's just going to be like your big
phone over there and maybe a little
bigger so I think in the future that's
all that's going to be his mobile
malware and they're just like Linux
system so hacking Android hacking iphone
it's not that it's hard it's just that
we're it's a newer platform we just
haven't seen all of the switch but I got
a text message from target the other day
saying that I want a six-hundred-dollar
gift card and please go to this lake
that was like target com that something
dump is so me as a understanding how the
internet works realized this was
something that vis but just you know my
dad or my mom maybe they would think
that's target calm and yeah they want a
gift card but it's obviously a phishing
attack so it is starting to happen so I
think corporations are going to want to
see this more and more when they come to
me for a pen test gonna want to know
everything and not just leaving out the
smart phones because they could be a
definite vulnerability as well so tell
me exactly how the department of defense
ties into all this you mean DARPA well I
actually got a DARPA cyber fast-track
grant for this so they actually paid me
to do the research but I keep all the
intellectual property rights so it's
like a researchers dream so I got seed
money for my company basically is the
way I used it so I'm like for the next
eight months I know I've got money so I
can see whether I can make it on my own
so it was really great for me they have
been really great to work with I think I
turned in the proposal which wasn't even
that long or hard you think you're going
to work with the government there's
gonna be a really long hard process but
it was a really easy template to work
with to do the work and then I turned it
in on monday and i think i got approved
on thursday and then started work on
monday that's awesome to see to like the
government reaching out to hackers right
a lot of the top people have them a lot
of the talks here at Def Con and black
hat have been the product of the DARPA
cyber fast track and they've just
extended it for another year was
supposed to end on august 3rd for
proposals but they've just announced
they're going to extend it for another
year so if you have a research idea i
think it's definitely a way to go cool
down so where can people get the
research because obviously this
just-released where can people go and
download and start you know doing a
little pen testing with their own mobile
devices right this tool is released
open source and BSD license so you can
pretty much do anything with it and I'd
love to hear your feedback if you use it
things you'd like to see as it grows
this is just the initial release version
0.1 so find the bugs find the new
features you want it is it bold security
com my new company though you can
download it all open source there
alright thank you so much Georgia well
that just about wraps of this episode of
hak5 I want to say thank you for
achievement unlocked its season 11 a big
one and so much cool stuff is happening
when we want Susan 12 we're doing some
cool stuff to the set we're adding some
really nifty things next week of course
begins our coverage of war camp that I
can't stress how wonderful was and of
course we want to remind you that you
can support the show directly by going
over to hack shop hjk shop calm as well
as go ahead and check out hack 50 /
following for all the places where you
can subscribe to the social networks and
that's where we'll have information on
some cool Bay Area meetups I here in
Northern California it's gonna be
and I guess what all that I should
probably get back to the fun that I'm
having at the seattle-tacoma Airport
with oh yes two pineapples at the same
time on that later talk to you guys soon
Oh what was it trusted
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
