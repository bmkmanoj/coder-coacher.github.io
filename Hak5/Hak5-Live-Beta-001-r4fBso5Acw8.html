got a cool mod from moonlit that I'm not
sure you had to do and Google Sketchup
as well as all your questions this time
on a very special hack five live beta
doesn't matter you have a gun
do yours I was that one first just to
play now though the exploitation of a
child or you're able to find that one
piece of evidence that an investigator
working homicide needs that's what
motivates you that's what keeps you
coming back all right and now we're good
all right
hey welcome to hack 5 the live beta show
and I think you've already figured out
that if a data yeah yeah we're we're 15
minutes behind schedule but we are so
glad that you could tune in especially
to everybody in the UK that's up way
past their bedtime what about the
Aussies that are still up they just woke
up yeah yeah so you wouldn't believe the
crazy stuff that we had to do to get
this to work out I mean we don't have a
you know million dollar a broadcast
studio or anything like that we really
need hours yeah I mean you know a lot of
people say this is the show done by
geeks in their basement and it's like
this close to being true yeah yeah
seriously you got to see this this crazy
thing we got going Paul you want to just
show this off for a second and pull up -
oh there we go all right so we're gonna
be taking your callers tonight we've got
a couple of segments and we're just
gonna throw down for a good hour of
geeking out so tell the girlfriend you
got something better to do it's oh yeah
that's awesome
afterwards yes seriously we will be
doing the LAN party we're going to be
playing Unreal Tournament 99 the classic
one so if you don't have Unreal
Tournament 2003 99 go ahead and get
yes it's going to be awesome so we'll be
owning that up in just about an hour
give or take yes all right
up first so let's take our first caller
of the night as soon as Paul gives us
the cue also I do want to mention that
we do have a poll going on during the
duration of this live show you can weigh
in at hak5 org slash poll and we've got
a really interesting question for you
guys that I think is going to be kind of
fun we'll retouch on this poll at the
end of the show and see the results and
the question is we've got David Lightman
for more games Paul you want to bring up
four or three and David Lightman from
war games we can't forget Abe Murphy and
zero cool from hackers and of course
what was the guy's name Martin Bishop
from sneakers yeah I'm a big fan of
Martin Bishop because well Robert
Redford's awesome that needs like the
professional penetration tester like
he's the man yeah that's true hang on
I'm about to own this up let me get my
power to live on it's not that the
Gibson yeah I I I'm going with Morgan's
but we'll see no can of ribs yeah let's
see let's get the first color online hey
Justin how are you I'm good how are you
pretty good nice what's up how's Canada
nothing much
kanna's pulled right now actually what'd
you say
cool oh yeah definitely yeah we we make
it up to Toronto as much as we can but
we haven't had the chance to go up to be
see and visit Vancouver but you know one
of these days definitely maybe you're
actually kind of lucky cuz you missed a
lot of wind storms rain storms and lots
of snow actually
that could be interesting yeah we
there's some power I would down in West
Vancouver what are you calling us on a
satellite phone with an inverter in your
car and yeah so what's your question for
us Mike
my question is on what how do you
basically get overclocking to work what
what is what you what do you need to do
to get overclocking to work and what do
you need to know what should you do
tips and tricks basically that's kind of
like a vague topic because overclocking
has actually matured a lot over the past
few years yeah I remember back when we
started getting into this kind of geeky
overclocking stuff and we're using what
pencils and graphite and all sorts of
fun stuff - yeah like some of the old
AMD chips on like the thunderbird core
like the best way to overclock it was
you would just draw a pencil line
between two pens and it up to your your
speed but nowadays there's a lot of
motherboards that support software
overclocking yeah it used to be that the
AMD's were a lot easier to overclock and
they would basically leave the
processors unlocked so you could just go
into your BIOS and then you basically
the concept of overclocking is you tell
the processor to go faster than the
factory settings so for example my I've
got a Barton core an AMD Athlon XP 2500
don't laugh that's actually what this
episode gets rendered on at the end of
the day yeah it gets the job done and
the cool thing about that core is it's
actually based off of an AMD Athlon XP
3200 right they make this big batch of
3200 and then like okay well we need
something for the mid market right right
so they just down clock it right tell it
to down the clock itself or maybe the
ones from the batch that weren't quite
stable enough to make 3200 so they'd
just call it a 2500 or something like
that and I think it's a 3,000 out of
3,200 but basically all you have to do
is go back into your BIOS and be like
okay actually I want you to use this
frontside bus speed or I want you to use
this voltage and this fox speed
I mean same thing with video cards a lot
of video cards you can get hacked
drivers or you know people have made
their own drivers and you just tell it
go faster go faster go faster in fact a
lot of the newer drivers from Nvidia and
ATI actually have built-in overclocking
in the driver used to be at least with
HDI I'm still stuck in the old school
yeah yeah rage 3d comm has great drivers
for like a great hacking tool for HDI
cards and that's what I used to use back
in the day to overclock like my Radeon
7500 9000 clocked it up enough that I
started getting artifacts on quake 3
that's the problem with overclocking is
that you you get that performance
increase but you do it at to compromise
of stability and when it comes to
overclocking especially if you can go
into your BIOS and you know up the
voltage or up the frontside bus speed
what you want to really make sure you're
doing is incrementing it very slowly so
just you know give it a mega heard 3
megahertz up right you want to find that
threshold and then back off of it just a
little bit so you it doesn't blow up in
your face because with the increased
power increased bus speed increased just
general clock cycles you're gonna create
more heat and that's why you see a lot
of these overclockers running
water-cooled systems or Peltier coolers
involved with that you know like a phase
change even like that's what they're
trying to do is they have to get as much
heat off of it to try and keep it as
stable as possible so if you're trying
to go with passive cooling or you know
active just air cooling your envelope is
gonna be a lot lower than these guys
that are saying a lot of morrow into
their cooling system that said though
there are some really good um excuse me
of air coolers thermal take makes a lot
of good ones so does a cooler master and
probably tons of other brands I'm sure
if you went to the hack 5 forum and
posted what people are using to
overclock air wise there's some really
cool active heat sinks that'll do that
what they're really high tech ones but
they're still only gonna take you but so
far I can only move with so much heat
even if it's a pure copper heat sink so
the trick is first go into your bios and
see if you have any any facilities
available to you you know writing your
bios to to step things up check out just
do a search on what bios you have as
well as the processor and see if anybody
else has done it before and what they've
successfully gotten and then start
inching that up and each time you inch
it up food up go into your operating
system I'm assuming you're running
Windows and and just tax the system you
know play some 3d games even run some
benchmarks like 3d mark and see if this
is some stable if you're not getting
video glitches if the system seems table
then inch it up again until you find
that sweet spot and a lot of times you
can find a big improvement I honestly
don't do it anymore
because for me it's all about stability
especially if I'm working in a Vegas
file editing the show I don't want
anything like we're looking for more
stability and not that uber performance
because for what we do our performance
is fine pretty much answer your question
earth yep that pretty much says is it so
I'm assuming laptops are out of the
question their laptops because they
already in my experience I've never been
able to overclock a laptop now I could
you know be wrong it might be possible
and if it is and you're watching you're
going you guys are Nidhi you can totally
overclock your laptop you just have to
add in a water cooling system to the
back your screen and that's really cool
nitrogen in there you know just have it
spray in a couple minutes every day yeah
yep that's pretty much wraps it up okay
thanks a lot buddy thanks for calling
thank you know it's a fun little
anecdote about that we were talking
about chips that are actually rated
higher remember when I bought my Radeon
9500 yeah it's actually a 97 it was
actually 9700 that they down clocked it
and said and sometimes you can even find
ever for that one I even found a
firmware hack and have reflashed the
firmware of my video card that's a scary
thing to do flashing anything yeah yeah
the only good flashing is that parties
cocktail parties so what do we have up
next
stenography okay so as Paul gets our
next caller on the line I want to talk a
little bit about something really cool
called stenography basically it's the
art or science
depending on the us of embedding
something like a secret into like an
image like audio like video but you want
to put it in plain sight but it not be
but not have the question that there
might even be something there I think
that's a little vague description if you
like your audio like the actual audio or
video file would play perfectly normally
right and nobody would be any of the
wiser unless you said you might want to
check this and then like right there and
something and if you check like the code
open up notepad it's gonna be like
what's that exactly in fact somebody had
a question on the forums just a few days
ago about you know say like I had some
secret information and wanted to keep
secure what should I do and everybody's
talking about TrueCrypt and ways to
encrypt it and that's great that's
actually a part of this technology but
but the other thing that's really fun to
do is it's it's kind of like the old you
know hiding the envelope behind the
picture frame you know or the safe
behind the picture someplace that it's
easy to get you but you wouldn't nobody
with everything to look right so in fact
there could even be I don't know hidden
stuff in images on hak5 right now and
you might even you might not even know
so what we're gonna do is take a look at
a program that I really enjoy it's
called it's called stag hide and we go
ahead and pull this up right here it's a
SourceForge project it's stag hide
SourceForge comm and this is a really
great program that allows you to embed
data and that's what we call our there's
there's you know we can embed our
payload into what's called a cover file
or you know an image and an audio file a
video file oh it's it's whatever you
your payload is what you're putting
inside the envelope
the cover file being the envelope what's
gonna right carry that for you right so
I've got a secret document right here
and it's got some some information that
we've obtained from evil server I you
know who would have known yeah I think
he left a thumb drive before he left or
something on it but we got some secret
data and I want to hide this in plain
sight so what I'm gonna do is this image
right here you guys might be familiar
with so let's go ahead and put that
secret data in this file and then I'm
gonna go ahead and upload it to hack 5
org so if anybody's interested in maybe
pulling that secret data out of it go
ahead and have fun with that so let's go
ahead and fire up good old command
prompt and what I got going on here is
its stag guides that guides a really
great program the open source program I
was talking about and it's just very
it's it's really easy to use this
command line all we have to do is to
embed something into it we would use
stag hide tell it to embed right here
and then the - EF is our forget exactly
what that stands for
that's our payload that's the file that
we want to put into the cover file and
that's the - CF so the top dot jpg so
we're gonna use this to add secrets txt
- top jpg I think EF means embedded file
and see if that's that's exactly what it
is so I'm gonna go ahead and run that
and what its gonna do is it's gonna ask
for a passphrase this is a
password-protected file right now we're
not adding encryption steg hide does
have the ability to do like AES and
other forms of encryption in the file
but for right now all I want to do is
put it in plain text and add a
passphrase so you know for you to unlock
it and do maybe a little egg analysis on
that file you know all you need to do to
get this secrets txt out is to know the
passphrase and I think I'm going to use
a password that we may have used in
examples before and that's the only hint
you're gonna get so there we go embedded
secret site Exe into top that jpg done
so now it's it's embed
it's there nobody that does is none the
wiser there's any different exactly so
I'm gonna go ahead and throw this up on
the website and if you're not expecting
anything to be there it wouldn't be
there but it's a like I was like Wes I
got to I got some stuff for you man I
need you to take a look at this file but
we need to keep it on the DL yeah I can
post it in Plainview and nobody would
know yes I do yes it would need you
would need steg height of what you would
do is you would run stag hide let me
bring up the more to get the options
it's - extract and then you would want
to do the - extract you it also tell it
the sky go pile so it'd be stag hide -
extract and then - SF would be our stego
file in ubi top JPEG and I didn't put
another - here we go
live TV there go okay so then I all I
would have to do you know seg - extract
give it the password that we used and
maybe episode 3 of season 1 or something
like that and then you'd people it'll
pull our secret secret data yeah so
right now and it'll just be a plain file
waiting in the scene yeah so I entered
in the password and it's like well the
secret file already exists yeah let's go
ahead overwrite that's the same thing
same thing yeah so that's one of the
programs that I like to use it's able to
embed into image data there's also
another program that I like that will
allow you to embed secret data into
video files and that's really cool
especially if you're doing you know
hacker IPTV cuz what better fun than
throwing in maybe an Easter Egg video or
something in a previous episode good
stuff we will have links for all of that
in the show notes at hack 5 org so as we
go to the next caller I'm gonna go ahead
and upload this new embedded JPEG and
you guys can have fun hacking around
with that and see if you can find the
secret data so yes overwrite awesome
next we have on the line is Brian from
Canton Ohio yeah I'm here all right hey
how are you doing Brian
good how are you all right thank you so
what's your question Brian my question
for you guys was what we mods and hacks
excite you guys and where do you think
the the future is kind of going with
those mods and/or hacks my favorite my
favorite mod is the one that makes the
bracelets stronger you should have seen
Wes I mean Holly you want to throw us
the the Wes Wiimote this is ridiculous
within the first day like within the
first 5 minutes of playing it was longer
than that
well alright anyway but yeah yes thread
this race through play is normal um some
forms have even sir to say that since
like you know there's a fun site I
should pull this up right now because
this is awesome
WI we have a problem calm go ahead and
pull up that what if this is the yeah in
fact this is a picture right here of the
new string that that Nintendo's been
putting out I I don't see a difference
but they say it's stronger thicker what
are you talking about
ok so yeah so it's thicker but thicker
yeah but there's some great pictures on
this on this site let me go ahead and
pull up one of the really nasty ones
they broken televisions yeah we have a
problem is a great site because you get
to see the carnage I mean look at that
look at that rear projection that just
get dominated I don't believe this one
to be true this looks fake yeah the
thought you it's the thought that counts
things pretty hysterical yeah Paul and I
have been playing around a lot with some
of the other wee hacks one in particular
that I thought was really cool was the
ability to to get the web browser going
before they released the Opera browser
if you're not down with the Wii stuff
what's happening is the Wii is going to
come we'll have a browser available for
it from the Wii marketplace or whatever
they're calling I think it's
wiiconnect24 or something we store the
Wiis and it's gonna be the Opera browser
so you can do all your web browsing from
your couch and really if you haven't
played with the Wii the the remote
browsing it's really intuitive so that's
not gonna be available until I think
they said January something really yeah
there's a firmware update on xx we're
hoping it's gonna be on that but I think
it's it not gonna be till January so
some clever people figured out all it is
is HTTP traffic you run your own squid
proxy or any other proxy so that when it
goes to we'd Nintendo comm it actually
Ford's off to Google and then you can do
your web browsing problem is they fixed
it with a firmware update just recently
so that we doesn't not that I know of I
know that you can do it manually you
know it may do it automatically as well
I'm not really sure how I really don't
know yeah the latest thing that I've
seen that's really neat is have you
played with the meze yeah yeah the Me's
are really cool there are these little
avatars you can build on your Wii you
know and in Wii Sports and what not you
can play as your avatar and we've got
something like 50 avatars now in fact we
should pull up this right here our we
number is on the website if you go to
hack 5 org and it's the third post down
it's the sketch release and live show
this is our we number its if you have a
Wii and you add this number to your
system the right here the 609 three
number then you can add us to your
system and then we can start trading
avatars and hopefully down the road
something even cooler but right now
that's that's what it is some clever
people have figured out that the we
actually has it's a Bluetooth device and
it has some internal memory and
there's this feature in there where you
can store your meat on your Wii Remote
or Wii mote or we want or whatever and
take that to your friend's house and
then you know so rather than so if
you've got a friend with a Wii you can
put your your me on there and it was
good really confusing your avatar on
here take it to their house and then
play with your guy all right well since
its bluetooth and there's already a
Bluetooth library that's been built for
this you can pull the meze off of here
and it's just like a 1k file and people
have been opening it up with hex editors
and playing with it so I think there's
gonna be some interesting stuff
happening with the meze initially until
people really figure out how to do
homebrew on the Wii they figured out the
homebrew because the Wii is a is
backwards compatible with the Gamecube
you can run gamecube homebrew and one of
the coolest ones is with an action
replay you can actually run your own
emulators so rather than going to the
the we store and paying $10 for mario64
yeah we paid that much for them and
we're suckers yeah we did it was $10
yeah the nes games yeah well yeah I live
right over there playing it right now
she thinks it's money well spent
it's like five dollars for NES games and
then it goes up all the way you know to
ten dollars for the n64 games mm-hmm but
we'll add its link in the show notes to
this because it's a really nifty hack
you can get your hands on a action
replay device because then you know with
an SD card you can put on all of your
roms and you know never have to pay
Nintendo again so that's fun stuff but
as for the we actually being hacked
hasn't happened yet there's some really
interesting wiki's where people are
already at it but it's just gonna take
some time
sweet yeah that's pretty good
all right thanks guys good night keep
enjoying the show
I think soon we're gonna have to get
Paul he's have you seen the program he's
been playing around with other one yeah
there's the yeah it's a Bluetooth device
and it they've created this program
there's one from Mac and there's one for
Windows where you can actually use it as
a mouse and I really need to get a
Bluetooth adapter for my PC because
half-life 2 with the Wiimote yeah well I
mean rather than you know your micro you
can be all like now yeah it's a gimmick
but it'd be fun that has bluetooth oh I
think I know what we're doing after the
LAN party after the show if we're not
toasted so so I think that's that's it
for this block we're going to take a
quick break I remind you to head over to
hack 5 org slash poles and or I think
it's just slash pol and take the poll
let us know what you think your favorite
uber hacker is and when we get back
we're gonna be taking a look at Wes is
blinking hattie musical but their
musical nice musical I to musical chairs
it's gonna be great
so we'll be back with that and your
questions right after this
when you're able to stop the
exploitation of a child or you're able
to find that one piece of evidence that
an investigator working a homicide needs
to solve that homicide the victims and
the families that that are impacted
sometimes goes
greatly unnoticed but when you watch
their eyes and you see the anguish that
they go through and these crime scenes
and things that I've seen in my years
that's what motivates you that's what
keeps you coming back hey we're back Wow
live shows are fun yeah it's like what
am i doing oh yeah good stuff so uh I
think y'all can probably hear me better
now since my microphone is on that's one
of the fun things of live TV oh I wasn't
miked uh you know I should have been
paying attention diversity because they
would have told us I thought they did oh
they did yeah oh and you see the the
lesson today is always listen to Ali yes
all right Paul do we have our next
caller up sure hello hello how's it
going hey movies how are you you got a
video for us or say again you have video
for nobody over and you suck wow I'm in
Oregon they're in Oregon you guys aren't
familiar with mobic sees the the lame
guy that's providing this beautiful
bandwidth for us to actually stream yeah
and I guess out there and out there in
Oregon they don't have broadband well
they do but they don't have my webcam oh
you just you just don't have enough big
enough pipe or video to write so what's
up buddy what can we do for you
nothing just give me a beer you want a
beer do you really want a beer yeah well
you know what
there it is you can come get it appears
empty awesome I know how many listeners
or viewers we got right now how many I
think we got entered in 60 whoo-hoo no
real beer they're both real beer is easy
let's see how much bandwidth for so zero
is your little server screamin like a
little little punk like a little fish
yeah pretty much
you are kickin it as much as it can of
course they do prison patient do hey you
know what
well we move expand the line for just a
second because I'm gonna be bugging you
for a few things Paul if he can pull up
my screen I noticed an IRC some people
are asking some questions about Linux
alternatives to steg hide and you're
right I should have mentioned that but I
don't have a Linux box that I can get on
the set right now to show you the
alternatives but I can send you to stego
archive calm under the software section
they have a whole Linux section where
you can find a ton of great programs for
doing steganography in Linux so
definitely check that out that's ste geo
archive calm and you know there's a ton
to try out you know some free well it's
all Linux oh I'm sure they're all free
so all new bik's you're a big fan of
steganography do you have anything to
add to that nothing really much other
than just do some research on the open
source versions of it at we do a lot of
it where I work but nothing that can
it's really commercialized so nothing we
can really put out there so use user
commercials
not in your job do you use tag analysis
software we do we actually even do it on
streaming so if you have streams going
across the wire we can check it for
steganography
so like this stream right here that
you're watching we could be embedding
some evil data as well right yeah you
could you could be embedding evil data
with possibly a trivia question or
something like that and we're not one
would know but that would be really cool
we should think about getting into that
maybe it's difficult no I'm not gonna
I'm gonna be very vague okay mo bik's
but for the listening audience that's
not aware
mimics works for some people that take
care of us and make sure that we're safe
is that big enough yeah okay and as part
of his job of keeping us safe is now to
look for embedded stuff in streams is
that more difficult than if you have the
file I mean obviously you have to be
recording it when it goes live but is it
more difficult to actually find the
payload not really you just look for
variations in the in the data just like
you do for normal steganography and if
you know a specific codec well enough
you can really you can get down and
dirty with it and and know the standards
have how it goes across and pick out
what's not right
yeah speaking of dirty codecs yes all
right everybody three sucks have you
seen the latest version of VLC is really
messing this stream up if you use a
previous version it looks great but for
some reason with the vp3 codec that
we're using for this stream on
shoutcaster ice cast it's got some
blocks so if you're getting little
blocks everywhere I'm sorry about that
we tried the vp6 cover deck right before
the show and didn't work but you know
hey that's beta for you we'll work on it
yeah but if you for all the listeners
viewers are going right now if you open
it up and win app it's beautiful really
what amp looks good yo yeah you know I
was a fan of Winamp back in the days of
cue point a but I haven't really gotten
into it since 3 cuz that that was like
the point at which I gave up on them
I know well 5 is I guess a little bit
better but whatever to each his own so
mimics thanks for calling man we have a
beer here for you it's a premium England
traditional lager well so this one was
for you oK we've got more in the fridge
you just got to come down to Virginia oh
you know what yes we are in Virginia no
big secret anymore
well seriously how many emails do we get
hey guys I love your Canadian show Lee
yeah yeah
not anything against Canadians were not
from Canada but we're in the u.s. yeah
or in Virginia in Bladensburg okay so um
Paul what are you trying to tell me man
I'll talk to it all right let's see it
well you wanna get into this yeah I can
get into that but I don't see you away
man I like my IRC I received my friend a
new there's a ton of fun people in IRC
207 people a night I think there's a new
record yeah all right so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that my wife every second
of this and just oh I'll just do it this
way all right like this if you normally
when we shoot we shoot in pieces so we
can redo sets and fun stuff move things
around but you know what not so much
this time we're gonna try to figure some
way out to do this live right but for
right now tonight it's just geeking out
with the hardcore one cam two cam 2
video whatever and you guys still love
us yes I hope I hope I see is everyone's
friend so what do you have here this is
this is some raving monster project it's
really not monster at all it's a lot
uglier than what you might think well
what's going on here is it's something
that moonlit had come up with thank you
moonlit being an awesome moonlit being
member of our forms the owner on the
forums he's a good guy he's part of the
thunderkittens assault force that he is
so don't screw with moonlit but anyway
people were talking about making some
sound responsive lights and this is the
really quick and easy moonlit way of
doing it and it works mostly the biggest
drawback to this one is the fact that
you need to have some horsepower coming
out of your audio to really get these
lights to light up right no right now
I'm just using a you know externally
powered PC speaker and you can see all
the fun this back here oh there we go
yeah he's gonna switch that over in just
a second okay
but no we're using a X like I said
externally powered PC speaker let me
pull the external power up right here
yeah that's good yeah looks fine let me
go ahead and plug this in and it what
I've done is disconnected the speaker
itself right here well right there it is
okay yeah ah yeah a little bit please
here you go all right okay what I've
done here like I said is disconnected
the actual speaker itself and ran
connections over here to this little
terminal block that's what these two the
red and black are a terminal block and
have bridged it over here and just kind
of I had to hack that so I could
actually have both the lights and the
speaker going at the same time if I so
desired because I want to prove to you
that there is sound coming out of this
and so will fire up here cause this
might be a little loud now no I've got
it turned all the way off right now okay
so I will just connect the gaiter clip
right there and we'll play you'll turn
the volume on and you hear there's audio
coming out of that that's all right yeah
that's my little raver music now what's
gonna go on is I'm gonna turn the volume
all the way up and now we have blinking
LEDs and those are blinking to the music
they are blinking to the music if I
connected this right now you would see
every time that there's a bright flash
that's a base hit that's really cool so
what's the technology behind this how is
this working it's really simple it's
working it's working on standard audio
like theory electrical Theory sound is
could is transmitted on a DC current
okay it goes from point A through the
speaker and back to point B and what
it's doing is that there's electricity
running through the wire when he
to the speaker it makes the magnet
polarize in one direction or the other
mm-hmm so and that magnet hitting on the
back of the cone if I turn this around
and I reattached the speaker let me turn
this down but I'll reattach the speaker
turn it back up sound is all a
mechanical wave right so what it's doing
is air gets compressed and then let's go
and that's what our eardrums hear and
that's how we can rock out to a TV
exactly
I like this track this is good it's not
that easy so what's what's going on here
is as the electricity is hitting the
magnet it's it's it's doing like this
it's polarizing and be polarizing so
that it's just a transmitter you were
talking about and it's season one where
you know it's wave so the same the
pulses in the laser can be picked up by
a was the diode it was a it was a
photocell photocell right so the same
thing except instead of using a laser
we're connecting it to these eye LEDs
here yeah
and you can actually use flash light
bulbs too I've actually got one chilling
right over there if you can grab that
real quick prove that it's not just an
LED thing it's any kind of light bulb
that will take a DC current mmm that's
why a flashlight light bulb will work
because it works on the same principle
it's just DC current which is the
requirement if you will so disconnect oh
that's the wrong one
where's that one go beautiful hey you
know go ahead and uh Paul if you can
pull up my screen this is where the
original inspiration came from most on
the forum this is the hak5 forums under
hacks mod encoding you'll see a we
should wear the sticky this would save
thread called mod that do-it-yourself
disco slash Club lighting and movement
says a great job of explaining what he's
doing here and we've just basically real
illustrated this on the show he's got a
video I think he's hooked it up to
Christmas tree lights and I think this
is Wes his work in progress right now
and right this is this is nothing more
than a proof-of-concept Paul if you want
to take that yeah you got it good man
you can see that this is a flashlight
bulb it's not an LED and I'm thinking
this is definitely something that we
should expand on maybe in a real segment
on like a pre-recorded show yeah maybe
some like well Christmas light the house
well the thing is I was actually
thinking about making like cheap DJ
lights oh you know cool now you see
moonlit has that with this approach
right here it's the really like uber
cheap uber generic like well whichever
geek to but actually there's a more geek
way of doing it that is also posted on
that same thread really you can get
really gear oh is this the one with 110
yeah you actually like it what you won't
kill yourself it's only 110 it'll just
tickle all right but but no it use a
hundred and ten volts and a rectifier
bridge so it turns AC into DC and in
what's called a solid state relay okay
and that's the one that works really
really good with Christmas lights if you
actually there's a link to a video okay
yeah sure I'll pull that up yeah pull
that up for me
and oh is this the that's the schematic
yeah that's the general schematic and
you have an audio amplifier which can be
the exact same thing as the PC speaker
that I have here mm-hmm
it goes to the rectifier bridge which
like I said that turns AC to DC or it
will just go DC to DC as well it doesn't
matter and then you've got the solid
state relay that's got four poles on it
and it's
DC in an AC side okay your now you've
got 110 volts down here alright that
plugs into the wall mmm these go to your
lights and these go to your lights and
what the fellow that did made this did
is if you scroll down here Duke Duke to
you right there that looks scary man
no it's not scary at all he just used a
male-to-female three prong two two
problem yeah see I'm I'm down with
soldering a six point five five three
six megahertz crystal to a tone dialer
but when it comes to hundred thousand
eight hundred and ten AC na stay away
from that man but then again you're the
guy that used to do electric works so
I've done all sorts of contractors or
contracting work before so I really is
your house you'll fix your house mm-hmm
and I'll get by it that's right well I
can do that too that's true but no this
is really cool and if you come all the
way down here to the bottom you'll see
oops oops Amy right here there's this
plug no keep going there's a video at
the end and we'll play that real quick
right yeah sure yeah right on the the
YouTube YouTube on the goo tube give it
a second to buffer now he's playing
Christmas music but his Christmas lights
are plugged into his little PC speaker
and they're blinking cool and dere
blinking lights you know if we could
have a Christmas tree in this apartment
we would totally do that but worth
postponed Christmas till February so
when we get the house we're totally
doing that talk about that on my segment
letter right but I mean it's it's a
really simple idea of what it's all it's
doing is the same idea of changing the
voltage right so lights go brighter
lights go dim all right that looks
awesome I cannot wait for you to start
doing more fun stuff with this and thank
you moonlit see the good thing about the
hundred and ten volt is that it's just
sensing the power flow of the
fluctuations you don't have to have it
have you don't have to have a camp that
car amp that you've had laying around
here sits over there that I had a chance
to rig up yeah okay but you see that's a
problem that we're running into here is
if you were to go back to moonlets
videos he's running it off of like a
real home audio amplifier right so it's
getting some horsepower you know it's
actually cranking some voltage through
there or some amperage right whichever
and that's what's allowing it to be so
bright I'm just running this off of an
iPod and a regular PC speaker so there's
just not a lot but there's any iPod
oh the UQ iPod hold on because I still
have that's what I'm looking for I'm not
even gonna okay I'm sorry I'm getting
cheesy again yeah yeah that's not very
getting cheesy on hak5 never okay so you
want to take the next caller we ready
like the next college to your appetite
for the Dare blinking lights I'm sure
you're gonna have tons of questions
definitely send those over to Wes a hack
5.2 word of course and you know we'll
see some more him my guess hey you can
how you doing that hey how you doing
buddy
guilty good doing pretty good doing all
right doing great just bring Ede leg Wow
dude you've got the the Johnny Johnny
yeah he just kind of like Janna let's go
ahead and see if we can pull that up and
get your question on three players again
dump it just go full just go full man
yeah why not so what's up man what can
we do for you ECAM well I was talking to
him before and I was wondering about
that hack that you guys did in Episode
four or three or five or whatever was
involving with what was it they're in
VLC and Apache with the cool wrote hack
they go on there the cellphone remote
hack yes there we go
sure yep yeah what's the question out of
the box
PHP can't launch programs yourself with
the security got shared with the same
that he has to be configured a special
way I know exactly what you're talking
about I give me Jeff second okay so what
he came talking about is back in I think
it was actually episode 9 of season 1
video
excuse me look great man you look like
Johnny Johnny you gonna make us cocktail
we have a bottle of liquor in his hands
lips but yeah an episode man we talked
about a way to control your VLC which
I'm sure many of you are watching us in
right now right here in that fun and
yeah I know well know what I really
loves is doing anything that involves a
cell phone and patchy and PHP yeah um
you dream of Apache PHP I dream in pH
got bothered oh yeah yeah if else so
what what he's running into was problem
where the way that that code really
worked was it was just a PHP front-end
to tell Windows to launch VLC and then
you would use the native VLC HTTP
interface to actually send the
fast-forward and rewind and the the
change playlist and fun stuff like that
what you're running into is the fact
that you can't get PHP to actually
launch a program in Windows and that's
because you have because PHP is not set
up to run interactively on the desktop
when you do a shell command I'm sorry
sagen I can't hear you man whoa don't
eat the microphone just talk into a
buddy that might help how's that do
something okay so you were saying so far
I only know how to do it in Windows I
had to learn in Linux why do I only do
windows you know I said why is it always
the problem why is there always a
problem with Windows because it's made
by my dad that's what they actually
built it that way so there would be
problems and say you'd always need to be
employed yeah okay but if you head over
to my video right now you can actually
see what I've pulled up as services.msc
and I don't have the I think it's it's a
path it's either Apache PHP I believe I
have it in the show notes basically what
you need to do is allow either Apache or
PHP
I forget which one at the top of my head
but you need to give it interactive
desktop permissions so that over on the
logon tab here you'll see log on a
system account
you need to check this box that says
allow service to interact with desktop
if you don't do this
what will happen is is when you go to
run VLC it'll run VLC but it's happening
like in the background you can't
actually see it happening when you check
this box and I've been pretty sure it's
an Apache now not on PHP because I don't
think I had PHP in here as a service but
what will happen is it'll actually
launch the VLC window and you know with
the dash F option for fullscreen
everything should work then so go ahead
and give it local allow services to
interactive desktop and that should fix
your problem ok sure what's question I'm
sorry you gotta talk louder
did you get a child you got to talk into
your microphone without yet imposition
of just keyboard like you guys guys like
so much and it's so it's not so screen
the OS is it's let me just give you an
example
e key you got Windows ME on there well
the problem yeah that's the biggest
problem you got right now
no I'm running ad but it runs like bad
someone's wondering what if I if I put
Linux on here would that run decently
like with with gnome and everything like
that
what's the specs well what kind of
laptop is it and make sure you're
speaking into microphone we cannot hear
you run a wonderful 128 megabytes of RAM
ok in one megahertz processor that
sounds like a great machine for Ubuntu
or any other Linux sister yeah any kind
of any any link Linux BSD might work
fairly well on there I think you're
hitting the minimum processor actually I
think the minimum processor requirements
if I remember correctly for XP is
actually like 400 megahertz with like 64
or something crazy but that's not true I
mean oh no you can't run XP reasonably
without 512 right yeah that that laptop
is actually a very prime candidate for
Linux especially Ubuntu or any of the
user friendly ones yeah have at it it'll
run like a champ if it's your first time
with Linux
definitely try a bun too or appalled
what's what's your favorite man you're
like always doing a live CDs what have
you seen that you like so far pretty
sure I wanna do you put you but I wasn't
sure if we'll run all the gooey stuff
yeah oh yeah it should run the gooey
stuff fine well no more Katie okay gnome
or KDE should run perfectly fine on
there I mean if you can I'd really try
to boost it up to 256 laptop harder our
laptop hours of laptop ram yeah
DSL yeah Dan small Linux is really good
but if you can get the RAM up on that
machine I think you'd have a decent box
I wouldn't say for gaming or photos are
enough photoshopping gimping but you
know it would run all the other stuff
you need but I mean if he wanted to be
really cool he could go strictly command
line with like Slackware or go BSD
that's what the IRC is dude yeah most
people in the IRC are big fans of BSD as
well as Fedora core 6 vs d12 for doris
like like you just just go into pound AK
5 and say what Linux distro should I try
and you'll get more answers than you
need to what are we seeing right here
what is this the hell is this full
screen this what are you showing high
five owns
somebody's go thank you
but does that answer your question is
that good for you buddy yeah oh hang on
real quick this was a suggestion from
Kenny in the IRC he suggests that you go
to Linux on laptops calm I haven't been
there I don't know if it's goatse but
just from the other just from the URL it
sounds like it's probably a good place
to find out what this is gonna run good
on your laptop and thank you
what'd I say Kenny for for being so
clear on that one thank you bastards so
so so you said you had one more question
or is that good that's good okay he's
gone now we're coming up on our next
break when we get back more of your
questions as well as I will be taking a
look at a nifty program called Sketchup
we'll be right back
it started from the beginning pause
everyone make it work I don't know
live TV is fun ready ready we'll be back
right now okay
with two terabytes of transfer and 20
gigs of storage DreamHost mate act 5
possible don't forget to go to
dreamhost.com and use coupon code hak5
for all of your web hosting needs
hello Ducks today how do you know that
name
don't worry
the mr. hunt one whose computer virus
president hundred seven computer systems
caused a seven-point drop the New York
Stock Exchange trust
because the truth is really out there
this Ron said you were looking for
something get the merchandise you got
the flow do you have any idea how much I
can get for this outside the US hired
the UK was screwed till next year I just
stabbed upon to get this if there is a
favor
Hey
don't be flashing that around
now
and we're back welcome back to hack five
lot thank you for so much for tuning in
we greatly appreciate it
big shout out to everybody an IRC way to
go guys you guys freaking rock we love
you you are the hardcore of the hardcore
thank you thank you so much for tuning
in yes this is the live beta and we
really stress that beta because we are
just now figuring out how to do live
while you watch so what a blast
listen a few minutes ago I mentioned
Linux on laptops that sites not actually
the one Kenny over an IRC actually
corrected me it's Linux - laptops or guy
got to pulled it up right here Linux
with laptops notebooks PDAs and mobile
cell phones this is the place to go to
find out if the what Linux is going to
run on your laptop so looks like a cool
site I haven't had a chance to peruse it
quite yet but already there's tons of
linkage and I would definitely suggest
if you're looking to put Linux on a
slower laptop maybe they turn it into a
file server a web server Linux will do
just about anything Windows would do if
not more proxy servers proxy severs are
always really good certain games will
run on a Linux yes or even got Unreal
Tournament 99 running on is Linux laptop
and that's what we will be playing as
soon as this shows over we're not even
on the desktops and we're gonna own some
noobs in UT 99 on a game dot hack 5 org
no on new bat I thought that I will give
you all the details that are to the show
don't flood in there quite yet well
probably rebooting the server right
before we go live to make sure it's good
ok good to go good to go now I believe
we have our next caller on the line no
ok so they don't but that's that gives
us a perfect opportunity to go over and
check out the poll we asked you at the
beginning of the show who your favorite
Hollywood hacker is and our choices were
Dave Murphy of course from hackers we
had was a bishop Martin Bishop no it was
Martin Bishop from sneakers or David
Lightman from war games and already
David Murphy 1% lead Dave my mouth
burning it up in five and that's
read that yeah I can't you know what I
can almost believe that but I'm still I
can't leave Robert Redford he's such a
cool guy
well he's now David lightnings got that
second place 23 percent but I think
already we can see that the landslide
voting is showing the David Murphy from
hackers is your number one Hollywood
hacker I think that's just because it's
the number one Hollywood hacker movie
it's the number one Hollywood hacker
comedy well you know what I mean yeah I
know what you mean because I mean
seriously like zero cool zero cool is it
burn oh yeah dude I wanna
I really wish 65 million psychedelic
colors man I really wish you could like
like like Hollywood shows hacking is
such a glorified thing such a like you
read code as it's like flying by so fast
and it's always like green on black no
line breaks you know no tabs nothing you
know it's like and it always makes as it
goes well either that or like in hackers
when they're like flying
three-dimensionally through the Gibson
dude I don't I didn't know if you knew
this but hacking is actually done number
one hack until people think that you
need like Cain and Abel or nmap or or
Pakistan furs or other fun stuff like
that no you need auto cad if you really
want to get some dried eka he'd ruin
headed yes worm snake is gonna take
money from every bank in the world yeah
how many times have we seen the same
plot in hacker movies it's always like
organ take the round down the the penny
and then we're gonna take that and put
into the Scott and after a million years
is gonna enter or even Superman clone
this space
it was office space it was Superman - it
was it Superman - yeah Superman she's my
time Superman 3 I can't remain your
Superman movie I was the one with the
guy that played in space balls yeah
please gotta have it please cut me the
guy that does the voices oh yeah the
radar leaps the GRU bleep in this weeps
what what the way in the wedding yet
yeah that guy's awesome you know you
can't do it anyway yeah but that's
always been and in fact that's called
salami slicing if you were ever
wondering I forget what the name of the
book that I read that in any way I've
never heard the Hollywood hacking let's
get our next caller on the line
we have hang on just a second so we can
get Oh widescreen that no no I'm smooth
like that yeah yeah yes we want to see
your beautiful face keyboard hacking
boom
yeah his MO no nice to talk to you how
you doing buddy I finally got you
streaming on my computer the first stuff
to show I never solve because I don't
know what's working but this is a lot of
difficulty cut and play it to work and I
finally see you what what was that last
little part I'm sorry I finally get to
see you the first half hour of the show
didn't work I had to install mplayer
you're done playing for me
have you tried VLC maybe or using
winning apparently it looks great and
when amps oasiz new bik's now that's the
problem it didn't run into an amp and it
didn't run and feel C player I'm now
more or less drying and player
okay well hang on for just a second this
is the point at which I need to beg the
audience if you guys know of a good CD
and a content delivery network a live
streaming I've taken a look at a couple
of different commercial offerings where
we've put up our stream and then they
rebroadcast it because shoutcast is cool
it's a geek attacker but we're also
running into problems where people can't
tune in and that's a real sign of
buffering for a lot of people but you
know what so what if you have any
suggestions shout out email forums wiki
problem with I've seen as most of them
are Windows Media Player streaming
servers and oh yeah I know you guys are
big fans of Windows Media Player aren't
you so anyway so so anyway what's your
question my question is if there is a
way to traffic from your keyboard which
is wireless
I did some Google searches and I found
this scope work typing but there's not a
lot of info about it how it's done we're
typing that's that's a new one that is a
new one I haven't heard it but you're
trying to sniff traffic with a keyboard
well what am I like wireless keyboards
you know cordless keyboards you've all
seen them from Logitech in
if you could you know if there now what
when you first have this question what
I'm thinking is Bluetooth okay because
lots of keyboards are bluetooth and
they're blocking
bluejacking exactly our Bluetooth
sniffing programs available that will
allow you to kind of just like you do
with Wi-Fi sniffing you put your card in
promiscuous mode and you see all of the
traffic that's going across the air yeah
right it's the same kind of deal with
Bluetooth and the only thing under pound
right now and I'm sure as soon as IRC
gets ahold of this they're going to send
me tons of links I hope was this
Bluetooth sniffing USB card
we're not card adapter dongle I think
it's a two-way dongle in fact that'll
allow you to sniff Bluetooth traffic now
if you can do that the likelihood that
you could maybe if you're close to
somebody that had a Bluetooth keyboard
see their typing is is higher but
honestly I've never actually seen in the
what-do-you-call-it
war he worked I think more typing yeah
okay so I haven't actually checked that
out I'm gonna have to take a look no I
have somebody that we're acquainted with
is a pretty accomplished electrical
engineer he said he had actually made
something that was do you remember the
fat boy to ps2 converters like I don't
know what you'd actually call it but the
really big keyboard plug like for the
back of your computer and then you put a
ps2 keyboard and into the back of that
you know I'm talking about right that's
that's a that's a physical way it's a
little dongle that goes between the
keyboard and the computer
yeah but I'm saying it was the adapter
that the adapter that looked like almost
like a MIDI right I know exactly what
you're talking about like I always just
called it fat boy yeah the 80 the 80
style thank you board thank you
it eluded me but he'd actually made a
module that fit inside of that adapter
that was a keylogger that's cool a
logged every key that went into it and
every so often it was actually smart
enough to connect back to the computer
but into the computer and email it is
awesome lots of software key loggers do
the same thing the problem with those is
of course you need physical access now
we all know that once physical access
the
zone but with more typing I think what
you're talking about with like sniffing
the Bluetooth or if it's on like a 900
megahertz channel like the old school
stuff then that's then that's a little
bit better because you saw have to be in
the proximity but you know what the
Pringles can you don't have to
necessarily be that close this is the
site that I found real quick as I as I
googled what you're saying we're typing
its we're typing calm they claim to be
the first and currently only site
dedicated specifically to the art of war
typing I haven't heard it's called a
three sorry it's a little bit outdated
2003 oh wow actually it says a oh never
mind that's just today's dates in fact
they've got a warning in PHP right here
they're there on line 33 they got a
length that's not working okay anyway
yeah um I
other than the bluetooth dongle I
haven't seen anything else that's
something that we should definitely
again but there's a lot about right here
is actually capturing the RF signal
register website there used to be a lot
of information about it HBU wireless
keyboards used to be so strong that you
could actually end up typing and it
appears on your neighbor's computer
really yeah wow wow I was complete and I
had did happen to me when I was setting
up a lot of wireless keyboards and I
ended up with the wrong computer
triggered me to figuring out how I took
use it for myself try to use it for less
than legitimate reasons I suppose
educational purposes yes I'm gonna Gore
some purposes everything we do is for
educational purposes only and how to
protect yourself I haven't seen anything
so far all right I haven't seen anything
yet in IRC but we'll post that in our
show notes and and gather as much as we
can it's something that we should
probably research for a future segment
on the show right because it sounds
really interesting and it might be a
good idea to post that in the hack five
forms as well because there's a lot of
bright people that you know do a lot of
fun stuff like that medical exactly but
I have security is really low
it fares very quickly without any
special coats was that the pairing of a
with your wireless epic keyboards and a
mouse to your wireless receiver is done
without actually entering any special
security code right yeah it is easy to
intercept it oh I'm sure it's in
plaintext I'm sure it's right in the
clear I don't think anybody's going to
invest in encrypting the RF between a
keyboard and a receiver but somebody
would you know sniff your keyboard
traffic but yeah that's a great idea
especially for you know getting stuff
that you really shouldn't be seeing and
we're all fans with that so if usernames
and passwords there's always fun there's
a million ways to do this but that's a
that's an interesting way and something
that we will definitely get into the oh
okay somebody's sending us over to the
wiki on blue snarfing that's something
that I heard about before the last Def
Con let's pull that up and see what we
got blue snarking yeah have you seen the
article on Wikipedia about blue snarfing
it looks like a good jump to point
somewhere to start I think what he's
more interesting more in they're
interested in is picking up the RF yeah
type keyboards here we go blue snarf
blue snarfing tool for linux oh you know
he's not talking about bluetooth he's
talking about picking up yeah you're on
this Bluetooth trip no he's talking
about picking up the RF oh like the 900
megahertz like the old-school wireless
keyboards right yeah that's still most
of them we're working on like only the
hi-tech ones are running off the
Bluetooth now that that old Logitech one
that's all yeah um I guess any sort of
RF scanner that you can tune to the
right frequency would work that or if
you had and I did like if you can target
your person and had an identical
receiver and somehow get like your
receiver on their frequency as opposed
to having their keyboard connect to you
yeah looks like a steamer to make sure
both yeah there needs to be some kind of
like promiscuous mode for the receiver
um beyond that like I don't know I
honestly don't know because I know those
receivers hold you know like four or
five different channels in a minute
more yeah like multiple channels are in
those receivers and that's why you have
to connect the keyboard to the den you
always pressing the connect button on
the keyboard and at the same time it's a
connect button on that well then you
understand yeah okay so they look for a
connection all that I really don't know
like I can't help you much on that one
I'm really sorry is that something that
would talk about that in the community
what's that it's fun to produce in the
community yeah definitely like to get
the community out there thinking about
it and working on it yeah if you're
viewing and you've got you know
interested in the same thing or maybe
even have a lead I definitely you know
get on the forums and search happening
and we'll look at what's out there and
see if we can come up with something
definitely yeah
so sorry we couldn't give you a good
answer but we greatly appreciate you
calling in it is fun to be with a beta I
always wanted to be a baby yeah this is
definitely better thank you everybody
thanks a lot okay enjoy the rest of the
show I will alright so I've got our top
that jpg up there so I'm sure people are
having fun with the steganography tools
there but this is a good opportunity
well Paul queues up the next callers to
talk about an application that's been
available in beta for free from Google
for a while but honestly I haven't had a
chance to check it out until now and I
just recently did I've got to say it's
amazing it's called Google Sketchup and
it's a CAD type program for quickly
prototyping things and I think the
Sketchup part is what's being emphasis
emphasized here so what I'm gonna pull
up is a little 3d rendering I did in in
probably I've already got it opened
probably about five ten minutes of our
new house that's right we're going to be
moving here in the next month month and
it's very exciting for us because
actually a month exactly a month exactly
from today so we're closing in a month
that's gonna be really exciting that's
gonna give us the opportunity to get a
much bigger set and all sorts of fun
stuff you guys seen but you guys have to
bear with us while we're in that whole
transition period right but this is what
I did a quick little sketch up of our
new house and
is in Google Sketchup it's really really
really easy to use I mean if you've ever
used a 3d modeling program then you'd be
probably familiar with the four pane
view and whatnot this is a lot different
because you are in one pane and all of
the stuff is really easy to do like let
me show you an example because I did
this house really quickly and the
tutorial I seriously just took the
tutorial that's available when you
download it and that got me started
pretty quickly so I'm just going to go
ahead and make a quick little object
here and draw a rectangle or not it
we're not I love live life is great I'm
gonna create a new file okay come on and
that's Google beta for you okay well I'm
gonna restart the program nice yeah
thank you
here we go all right I'm gonna create a
rectangle and then I'm going to this is
basically this tool up here is the
extrude tool maker studio yeah they call
it the push tool it's basically extrude
we can take that and it's really cool
the way that they do this because you
just get a different view on it and you
just grab a line and everything snaps
here's the snap to the midpoint and then
I belong here
I grab the move tool and then move it up
you know that's all there is to it now
you've got you know your two gable ends
and it's another pitch roof I can make
the door you know and it snaps through
that door
yeah well this is a small house you know
it's a little barn and then push that in
I can grab another square here and make
a window and push that in and that's uh
that's really it's it's so easy to do
this and the textures are really cool as
well if I come up here to where is that
now I'm I'm completely lost give me just
a second
oh the Paint Bucket done yeah so you
pull up the pink bucket and they've got
all these built-in textures already of
course that's not gonna look quite right
that's a sidewalk sidewalk and stuff but
you know you can grab your your colors
in our case our house basically what
you're saying right now is that it's
really good for giving you a quick
sketch up of a 3d model that you might
want to do you know it comes preloaded
with a lot of cool stuff right now yeah
exactly it's you know if you've never
done any 3d modeling before I definitely
recommend you check out this program if
you think you're interested in it
because this will give you a taste of
you know what 3d modeling is all about
and give this a nice little roof and
then this gives your really watered down
a good initial experience of 3d modeling
everything's pretty straightforward
fairly intuitive you grab pull remove
this add that not a problem exactly I
mean it's just as easy as dragging
shapes and pulling them out and now all
the sudden we have a shed right and you
know with another line I can just boom
give that a line pull this up and in
minutes I've got a house with a shed
there's prefabbed
objects in there so you can you know
like I did with the new house file right
here I added a whole little neighborhood
and got a car and all the other houses
and stuff very trees definitely worth
checking out you can even export it to
Google Earth so lots of fun to be had
there I mean it's just hours of geek fun
right so uh Paul do you have our next
caller what's up next
we have an Atari who has that's the
script Atari you on the line hey there
you are oh yeah this is awesome well
we're glad to have you on how you doing
tonight buddy I am doing good
I just wanted to plug the one of the
things I want to plug the the hak5
folding and homegroup we had we're we at
the fa h wiki nic dotnet you can check
it out awesome thank you thank you yeah
the folding at home project if anybody
doesn't know is really cool folding at
home is a shared processor project where
scientists are using it to see how
proteins fold and unfold in the human
body and that way they can better
understand how things work in the human
body and hopefully better treat diseases
and stuff like that so if you've got
some extra CPU cycles you're willing to
spare check out the folding at home
that's right I did hear about that like
launching extra cycles that because it's
such a specialized piece the hardware
more faster faster yeah well I mean
you're talking about you're talking
about something that's really you know
something that you can take your 16
pixel pipelines that you've got on your
video card it's a really specialized
piece of math but and it's used to doing
rendering but it's the same kind of math
and the performance differences between
your general purpose CPU and your VP are
huge so if you've got one of the newer
video cards I'd highly recommend
checking out that software and if you've
got if you want to spare the extra
cycles on your graphics card or your
central CPU please do folding at home is
really cool and you should definitely
join the team now did you have a
question Atari
yeah actually uh is it my wireless mouse
is that the reason I'm getting owned in
in a my first-person shooters that
actually can do something with it
because if your batteries aren't fully
charged then you start losing you get
loss of signal wireless mice tend to not
have as good resolution I mean you
definitely need to be
using a USB optical mouse definitely and
if you're I actually for the longest
time was against the USB optical mice I
was a big fan of running it over ps2
because at least when you would have
like a and interrupt like a control too
late something like that in Windows at
least in the early days USB would freak
out you and have your mouse so I'd run
it over ps2 and I'd use a program called
ps2 dpi where I could actually boost up
to 400 dpi and the ps2 port right
nowadays I just go with a simple this is
just a Microsoft optical and till a
mouse and that does the trick for me I
can't stand to use any wireless mice
because I you know I always see like the
jerking around on the screen yeah so
it's all about the resolution um you can
spend buku dollars on these some of
these optical mice like the razer mouse
the razer mouse goes for like a hundred
and some odd dollars is that really what
it goes for
yes the Razer Mouse is ridiculous just
get yourself just a regular just MX 400
or I mean logitech's got some really
good ones I use I use a Logitech mouse
that I got for like 30 40 bucks it's a 5
button Mouse so there's plenty of
bindings on it it's USB
it's got like a 300 dpi resolution I
mean it's not
that's nothing fantastic right but you
don't need to go extremely I mean like
the 300 dpi with a good twitch you don't
have a problem yeah seriously so you're
gonna be on the UT server tonight for
some moaning oh absolutely
I'll be with his wireless mouse so he
can get owned and ice they have no
problem with it in WoW
well that's because it's the world of
welcome to the world of walking crafts
yes seriously
is you got anything else here is that
gonna do for you that's about it ok so
this is the website it's a hack 5 org
slash wiki slash folding at home if you
just head over to the hack 5 wiki you'll
see it on the main site and this is
where you can get involved in the hack 5
folding project and find out all the
information it's it's group number 51 to
58 and get involved and it's it's a fun
little grip thing to do if you've got
some extra CPU power and want to donate
it okay cause so thanks a lot Atari
thank you for watching hope to see you
on UT awesome thank you bye bye
all right so you want to take a quick
little break will we get back wrap this
up take a look at the poll result stick

we're gonna take a quick commercial
break
thank you so much for your staying on
this long hope you make it all the way
to the end and then own it up in some UT
but right now we're gonna take a quick

down just get right back on and we'll
probably own up some original deathmatch
that's just so we can get on and on you
all definitely ok so I think we're gonna
go ahead and take one more caller one
more caller sounds good and then wrap
this bad boy up
Paul do we have that queued up Dook Dook
Joe Wow guys it has been horrible it's
been horrible yeah what's the sample
fuck man it's it's four o'clock here
merely here you do all I heard was at

it's been a rough week I know right good
to you know hear from you with the
against the black webcam yeah and the
the tubes not going so great to Belgium
right now see senator Stevens is gonna
hate you you're gonna get sued for this
oh I don't care why we're Stevens for
the tube joke hey are you wearing a hack
fire here man yeah nice burn
representing about titties you mentioned
hackers the movie earlier cool still I
have to notice one thing what's that are
you I did did you buy the DVD oh it's
the CD Angelina Jolie's boobies
what about Angelina Jolie did you slide

hackers it's kind of bad you got some
other movie that somebody gave you oh it
somebody gave me but you garden say but
the only movie that I actually own is
hackers and I only bought it because I
have got a DVD ROM and I wanted to make
sure it even worked I was like yeah you
know I'll actually get a little happier
your favorite movie if my husband a girl
many collection of obscure hacker movies
of DVD but some aren't even out yet so
they got like sneakers on DVD and
lawnmower man you know is that even a
hacker movie oh it was like a technology
movie but I don't know if I'd call it a
hacker movie the guy plugged himself
into a big machine and he got also more
like that keep with that this life
hacking yeah live hanging my god machine
but I'm saying like like if you want to
call a lawnmower man a hackers movie a
hacking movie then you'd have to call
like a matrix a hacker movie well no
they just used to be hackers in the
matrix and then they get out of the
matrix and now they can like fly and
stuff hey don't patch on the menu yeah
the first time I love the Matrix series
well thanks for calling Duke well did
you have a question or did you just want
to bullshit with us yeah question and

bluetooth but for anybody interested in
blue - sniffing our friend over at iron
geek calm has a cool tutorial on blue
snarfing so head over to iron geek calm
you'll find it there it's a flash
tutorial on Bluetooth snarfing on with
auditor so looks good
alright want to check that out sweet
dude did you have anything else buddy
nope I'm all them I just want to say hi
virtue you should do this every month
