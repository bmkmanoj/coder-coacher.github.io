gozman founder of Great Scott gadgets an
inventor of the uber tooth one joins us
to talk about his latest radio hacking
project all that and more this time on
hack 5 this segment of hack 5 is brought
to you by team hello welcome to hack 5
my name is Darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
to weekly does to the show without the
Jimmy movement anymore have you noticed
that oh yeah that's right
we don't have the food we know cuz
Paul's in the new control room doing the
lights to new coaster yeah well maybe
maybe like I just do it do it there you
go
oh yeah here here bring us in Shannon
hello and welcome to the show my name is
Shannon Morse yay and I'm Doron Curtin
I'm good okay we'll just do that now you
screw up the camera that's fine I mean
they really want tuned in for you anyway
well of course
actually they're tuned in because I
wanted to see us talk to Mike Osmond
about this awesome new all rockin stuff
but first we have a gift from a fan who
gift me so this is from here you can
take it I have no clue what that thing
is this is from art he says way back in
79 while working with COBOL application
programmer my supervisor gave me this
thing in appreciation for my work either
that or no one else wanted the darn
thing a friend of his gave him several
days and he said they had come from a
dismantled Burroughs mainframe it's been
my pride and joy ever since do you know
what it is
examine the small piece the small space
between the circuit boards nearest the
handle oh ok so there are whoa boos
that's copper just wrapped around a
cylinder it these like is not a vacuum
tube but it's like that kind of era
stuff does you see what it is yeah what
is it it's a bite possibly from a bee
5,000 oh my god this is like how NASA
would like weave bites into memory on
the original like was it at the Apollo
mission somebody correct me on this
victim but yeah there's a way that you
can actually we've instruction sets
memory into like fabric with wires and
but if you get any of the knitting like
wrong you have to like go back and redo
the whole thing and it's ridiculous and
just it's it's yeah they're attack I was
like is this the insides of I don't know
a lock-picking sets well if if you were
aerial I would be like oh it's a comb
and of course Winkle dapper or whatever
that's the official name of course yes
how adorable
well you know what I am really excited
to check out Mike Osmonds brand new
gadget Rio somnus because he has plenty
of really cool stuff you know we need to
get both mics on we need to do a show
with Mike and Mike because my costumes
on he's also talking about some cool
stuff is he collaborating with my
Kershaw on aka drag horn you know him
from kismet yeah and some other cool
ZigBee from fun happy stuff so we may as
well just kick over to that now right
yeah let's kick it over to Mike Osmond
there's one thing you guys know we love
it's packet and packet sonora form and
that's why Mike Osmond what's up Mike
are you doing thanks for coming down
here you're you're out in the Bay Area
for some Shark Week action what's your
best shark that done yeah it's the
Wireshark user and developer conference
awesome
yeah so uh you guys are getting your
packet sniffing going on down in UC
Berkeley oh yeah yeah
and Mike Kershaw who you know kismet
Fame or people probably know him more as
drag horn yes yes yeah he and I are
giving a talk on how to build your own
hardware for wireless sniffing well
you've got some experience in hardware
something last time you were on the show
we were talking about the uber tooth one
the hardware device for sniffing
Bluetooth packets all right so you and
Mike what are you collaborating on what
kind of crazy stuff you sniffing now
well I can't claim much credit for it
but this is a kids this is a prototype
of a board called kiss be and it is
it is a ZigBee sniffer or really 802 dot
15.4 is the standard ZigBee is oh why
tripoli a lot of u protocols that runs
on top of 802 nothing up for this so
this is a ZigBee sniffer that that mike
design and i've helped him with a little
bit and so we're going to be talking
about it and about uber tooth this is a
really cool device because it can run
off of a battery oh yeah and it so you
can just plug it into like a USB power
supply like your pineapple juice hmm and
it sniffs ZigBee using the big antenna
and then using this little little
bluetooth board over here it will beam
the sniped packets to your Android phone
no and you can do real-time mapping on
your phone with a little app and in just
wor drive around or whatever without
having to have any cables or yeah that's
wicked so so you have the option with
the microUSB cable but that this isn't
necessary you don't have to plug
something USB into I mean I guess right
you know you can you can plug it into
your laptop and just use sniffing that
way and not use the Bluetooth interface
if you want but if you just want to plug
it into a USB power supply you can use
the Bluetooth interface to your Android
device and I guess like that's nice
because then it's like self-contained
you can hide it somewhere but then again
you're still within the range of
Bluetooth right right yeah but but so
okay so ZigBee for those that aren't
familiar with it I lean into a recently
here in home automation I've got a
friend that's got like a crazy huge
house place with you know the alarm
systems and the gates and the you know
the all of the light switches and all of
the lights and all the stereo and
everything communicates to each other
over ZigBee and there's this crazy
control for interface to like speak and
it uses Lua
the program really yeah really it's
really interesting it's been fun I've
been having fun hacking with it and it
actually it's kind of funny that you
bring this here because the one thing
that I didn't have to hack it like you
know like trying to integrate like a
gate system that's proprietary not based
on ZigBee and doing you know the stain
like you know using wireshark to sniff
it and replay some packets was able to
get that and try to integrate it but we
had a ZigBee module or even if we could
sniff some ZigBee packets we'd be able
to do some other fun hacking with the
rest of the house all right and it is
becoming very popular for home
automation it's used in a lot of
industrial settings I've sniffed some
ZigBee in my little town and I haven't
even figured out what ifs you be
released for yet it's one of the big new
hotels in Las Vegas reportedly has Sigma
devices in every room controlling things
like this that's the idea of behind
ZigBee though is that it's they a
general-purpose easy to implement
kind of like sensor meets you know radio
where you just need to like make
something Network enabled or network
aware right so like you said like in the
hotel it might have like curtains or a
mini refrigerator if you ever drink
anything from the afraid you're gonna
get like that that's how you get the
huge bill right you know without the
maid going like I drunk all the Smirnoff
charm fifty dollars for each a little
airplane bottle right right hmm that
could be interesting I could see this
being really useful in that like
bluetooth where like nobody was hacking
on it before some of those like security
things were based on the assumption that
like well nobody has like a you know
sniffer or are their sniffers there are
some sniffers but there hasn't been a
popular open-source ZigBee sniffer
available and certainly nothing that's
this easy to use so having that that
application on the Android that you can
use to do mapping right out of the box
is really nice and of course it
integrates with kismet
so if you plug it in via USB to a laptop
is running kismet you can be sniffing
multiple protocols simultaneously and
that's something that that you'll have
to do a spot with my cons yeah a future
because he has this whole new user
interface now that that neutralizes our
centralizes all the information from
different protocols so you can be
sniffing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and ZB and
potentially other things all at once and
it's all in an integrated display yeah
that's last time I was spiking and
speaking the bike that's what he's
explained
that like you know kismet is going from
being just like oh this is the sniffer
that we use for Wi-Fi and we were able
to bolt on some Bluetooth bolt on some
other stuff and now it's just being like
is it Wireless you guys are probably
heard us talking about ting over the
past few months and we are so happy to
report that a lot of hak5 viewers have
already take advantage of their customer
first approach to the sell market ting
their new service they bring clarity
usability and big savings to the mobile
phone users ting has one simple plan
that offers fair and honest pricing
megabytes minutes text messages they are
all billed separately so if you use more
than you just pay for the next tier
there's no ridiculous fees or if you use
less you're credited the difference
there's no BS checkout ting comm slash
hack five and check out their online
savings calculator and if you're ready
to get started you'll get an extra
seventy five dollars off your first
month of service just for being a hack
five viewer again that's ting comm slash
