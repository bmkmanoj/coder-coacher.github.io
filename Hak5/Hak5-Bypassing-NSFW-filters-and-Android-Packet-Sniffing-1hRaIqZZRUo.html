bypassing not safe for work filters and
I get lost looking for packets in all
the wrong places I'm Darren kitchen
you're watching hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by Squarespace go to assist Express got
a great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com it's 77 degrees in a
beautiful sunday here in the east bay I
got 93 octane and my bike I've got my
GPS set and I got the danger zone on my
iPod I mean to do it had five segments
so this begs the question can I have it
all can I do both can I ride the
twisties and get work done yeah well
considering that i am going to to
conferences backed back this week
siggraph and LA which is like the epic
computer graphics conference and well
Def Con in Los Angeles I'm sorry Las
Vegas that is the quintessential hacker
con yeah now is a great time to test out
a new bit of kit and you guys know that
I'm a huge fan of the fruit I mean this
pineapple and I have been getting into a
whole bunch of mischief fun for last two
years and well we're about to open a
whole nother can of worms here in a
couple weeks but look at that he comes
to peppered sniffing on the go well
today that's what it's all about and if
you were rocking Android then you're
just in life
last week i wrote a yield Lloyd again
you can see me do it step by step
through to point a point one on act 5
episode 6 18 or on Android Atlas episode
74 2.1 but suffice it to say it has
quickly become one of my favorite packet
sniffing platforms armed with two root
applications Wi-Fi tether and shark I'm
able to mimic some of the Wi-Fi
pineapple functionality no it doesn't do
the karma bit that is to say it's not
the SSID equivalent of the mirror and
the first harry potter film you know
because it looks like what you want it
to see or you get the idea is not
replacing the pretty good miss any time
but as a basic honey pot hot spot it'll
do the trick Wi-Fi tether allows me to
create access point sharing the 3g
connection on my phone with a handful of
clients there are options for security
liked web or wpa mac address filtering
alike but for this application we want
an enticing open access point even
better the SSID happens to be one
remembered by potential victims I mean
clients like t-mobile were linksys when
it comes to sniffing packets on Android
there are a few different options the
aptly named packets nipper is a root app
that depends on first installing the
command line
em TCP dump which is easily accomplished
if you've got a criminal I like better
terminal it comes with a couple of nifty
options like W get which is great for
downloading the precompiled TCP dump for
Android just set a couple of permissions
and away you go shark on the other hand
is a lot easier to get started with it
sports a familiar-looking icon and it's
a decent packet sniffer it's basically a
front end for TCP dump but there's no
need to drop to the prompt and
installing it in by hand shark allows
you to specify a few parameters
stop-and-start captures and then open
the pcap files with it's very own shark
reader i found the shark reader to be
lacking much functionality so at the end
of the day when it comes to real packet
analysis your best bet is to comb
through the pcap on a real computer
using wireshark or the like
alright well that didn't work out so
well did it well no I followed the
google map I think till the 3g coverage
ran out yeah no coverage no bars no bars
no people gorgeous road I'll give you
that loving the twisties here but this
is not so good for packet sniffing well
maybe maybe this guy wants some free
Wi-Fi
alright no free Wi-Fi for anyone yeah
we're know why I'm talking to anyway
you're a motorcycle
I really need to get the rest of the
cast down here
I was like fun now I know what you're
thinking Android is based on linux the
Wi-Fi pineapple Ron's yoga on open wrt
witches Linux what are the chances that
you also got will run on Android well
unfortunately it comes down to the
drivers robinwood did a hell of a job
putting mad Wi-Fi to open wrt so karma
would run on it a little fawn and act on
router if you will but it's been our
experience that you're only going to get
the packet injection goodness you need
from an atheros based chipset it's not
to say it's impossible from something
like a rolling road calm but for
something off the shelf as it were I
haven't seen it
come and get it
check your facebook obvious I'm not
logging the packets all right taking a
serious break from the segment for a
second if you ever have the opportunity
to come right here and I'll put GPS
coordinates do it oh my god seriously on
a motorcycle feels like you're riding
through the forest of Endor
I think that tree must be like 30 feet
around
so there's a couple of lessons learned
here and I think first and foremost
while the droid is definitely capable of
becoming a Wi-Fi hotspot honeypot little
packet capture and going on I guess like
real estate location location location
while the hills of Oakland are gorgeous
and this beach here in San Pablo Bay is
breathtaking it's not really where you
want to be looking for potential victims
now I can say with confidence though
that in the city it has worked out
really well and i will be bringing it
this week to Def Con and I guess I will
be seeing you guys from there next week
but until then I'm gonna enjoy that
Squarespace is a publishing system for
anyone looking to build a blog portfolio
or any kind of website with blog tools
that allow for iphone updating on the go
hassle-free importing of sites from
other environments robust stats and much
more Squarespace makes it super easy for
anyone to build out and maintain a site
that you could only dream up with other
platforms and if you have coding
experience Squarespace allows you to
delve into the code and customize things
even further tens of thousands of people
all across the internet have been using
square space for years and they're
already great service is only getting
better by the day on July fourteenth
Squarespace announced a huge round of
capital investment that will allow them
to expand at an even faster rate we want
to congratulate Squarespace and are
truly excited to work with such great
people head over to squarespace com to
get a 14-day free trial and be sure to
use the promotion code hak5 hak5 when
placing your order to get ten percent
off the lifetime of your account if I
had a dollar for every single time one
of my friends email me some website
while I was at work at my old office job
and I was worried that it was either not
safe for work or maybe it was a prank
website or something with a bad word on
it something like that well I'd have a
lot of dollars because I'm Way too
curious for my own good but luckily
there's ways to open web sites while
you're at work without getting flagged
by IT the first one I found is well
short short URLs everybody knows about
those if you just lay your mouths over a
short URL it doesn't give you any info
so you go to long URL org plug in the
short URL and find out where it goes
long URL luckily supports all of those
short URLs like bit ly and ping FM all
the popular ones that everybody knows
about and it also gives you a thumbnail
of the website that you're about to go
to just in case but if there's a bad
word or some kind of freeze on that site
that you can't really see from the
thumbnail that's not really going to
help you and that's why we have PDF my
URL com which will turn any website into
a PDF that
you can save onto your hard drive you
never go to the website you just plug in
the website name hit the P and it starts
the download and conversion into a PDF
maybe you're not too prone about saving
a PDF onto your desktop because your
work desktop has a desktop sniffer of
some sort if this is the case you can
use aviary go over to aviary com and add
in any website name and you'll get a
bitmap image of the site without having
to visit it or perhaps in another
example you have a co-worker who likes
to lean over or who likes to stop by
your you know your office every day and
really likes to check out whatever
you're looking for online and maybe
you're being safe but it's just plain
annoying if that's the case there is a
way to get around this as well you can
go to variably SF wsp calm and plug in a
website name hold down your mouse button
and slowly move it downwards to see more
of the page in the little narrow bar at
the top that way your coworker won't be
exactly able to see everything that
you're trying to check out you'll just
have a little bar that they might not be
able to see but you can see since you're
sitting right in front of your computer
so what do you think I think these are
great ways to keep yourself from getting
in trouble at work and maybe possibly
stumbling upon something that you really
don't want to see for pretty much the
rest of your life email me over at
