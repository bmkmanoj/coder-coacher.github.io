Squarespace hello and welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down the
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus I - ninjas I'm your host
Aaron kitchen and today we're having a
little happy ping tips
that's right paying it's one of the most
handy basic tools of network
administration and simply put it's just
telling whether or not a host is
reachable over IP and it's pretty cool
because it does so by sending an echo
request via the internet control message
protocol or ICMP and ICMP is pretty neat
being a core protocol of the Internet
Protocol or IP suite and you know unlike
TCP or UDP it's not actually meant for
exchanging data but rather you know
diagnosing problems and verifying
connections technically speaking ICMP
protocol is actually more than just
pings or echo requests neck replies
there are actually several control
messages like time exceeded or address
mask queries and trace routes but for
right now though we're just going to go
ahead and focus on the practical with IP
version 4 and a little script to make
our lives a lot easier you see the basic
ping command consists of just one value
host for example by ping 8888 and one of
my favorite servers I get network
unreachable because my Ethernet jack
isn't plugged end
whoo-hooo
but if I plug my Ethernet jack and and
do if config a th zero up and then D H
clients eth0 I can ping 8888 there we go
actually a perfect real-world test
I have verification that I has tubes if
you will and when a host responds to you
know every message it just says how many
bytes were received along with the IP
address and the ICMP sequence number and
then the time to live and basically how
long it took to get a reply in
milliseconds this case I'm ranging
around the 30s and 40s
well okay on Linux by the way control C
to stop that awesome key combo okay now
unfortunately the ping command doesn't
by default tell us when those replies or
lack thereof came in now to remedy this
we can actually use the date variable
issuing date will actually go ahead and
provide us with a nice little date and
time stamp and as such the date can
actually be used as a variable by
issuing echo dollar per end date - paren
now fantastic now if we actually did man
date we could see that there are many
other display options supported I'm a
big fan of percentage sign F and
percentage sign T all the different ones
kind of like different formatting and
whatnot but these fmt they give you a
nice formatted numeric date and time
stamp so to use these all we have to do
is echo dollar sign paren date space
plus percentage sign F I'm going to
separate those by an underscore and then
percentage sign T and then close my
parentheses and there we go 2011 it's
913 and it's at 16 o'clock woohoo
now in just a bit we're going to go
ahead and combine both the ping and the
date in one nifty one-line script but
first let's take a quick break

hak5 9 now let's bring it all together
we're going to start by issuing ping
8888 our favorite host on the internet
or whatever you'd like and then we're
going to separate that with a pipe so
it's going to take the output of that
and then it's going to go into a loop
we're going to create so let's create
that loop with while and what we're
going to do is we're going to read the
input of that ping and we're going to
take it into a variable that we're going
to call pong using the command read so
far what this is going to do is continue
pinging our host and turning the ping
replies into the variable pong so I've
got while read pong all right then we're
going to separate that wild statement
with a semicolon and then we're going to
tell that loop what to do with the
aptly-named
do command in this case we're going to
want to echo the the date so we'll do
echo dollar paren date space plus
percentage sign t I'm sorry percentage
sign F underscore percentage sign T get
that nice little date stamp and then
we're going to close that parentheses
I'm going to go ahead and give it a
separator here two dashes I probably
wanted to put those in quotation marks
so let me come back here and do that
there we go that looks nice and dandy
and after it's echo that we're finally
we're going to go ahead and actually
include our newly created variable which
needs to be inside the quotation mark so
dollar sign pong now I can have my
quotation mark there we go and once
again we can separate this with a
semicolon and we can finish our loop
with the command done now your command
should look exactly like this ping the
hostname
piped the output of that into while
which creates a loop read which turns it
into a variable the variables name is
pong what is going to do it's going to
do echo the date what is the date going
to be the date's going to be percentage
sign F and
which we've seen to be a really cool
formatting for the date we have two
dashes is a little separator and then
our our variable pong which will be what
we just read and then done there we go
go ahead and hit enter and a constant
pain complete with the date the time
perfect for debugging all sorts of
boards Network bits so that lends me to
ask what programs commands and scripts
are rockin your world go ahead and hit
