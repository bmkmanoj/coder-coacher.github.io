break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we're using the
history command now all of your old
commands are stored in this file called
bash history which you can search via
the terminal we're going to use a lot of
tools that we've learned up till now to
really get into the history file now
first off to check out that file very
simply use history pipe less and it
shows you all of the different things
that you've done in that terminal this
is going to store at least 500 different
commands if you want to check a specific
listing you can change this with grep
you can do this with history pipe grep
slash USR slash bin for my example and
you can see that my last one was lying
for for history pipe grep slash USR
slash bin because I haven't done it yet
now in this example the number at the
beginning is where it falls in the
history list the shortened this line if
you have a ton of them you can type in
exclamation mark and then the line
number and bash will expand this line
item for you
so if I put in exclamation mark and a
four it'll show me that line item I can
also do number three and it'll show me
that I pulled up the history and I can
quit out of there to go back to my line
now to search incrementally what goggle
which kind of reminds me of a Google
search in some ways you can hit ctrl R
and then type in your search query so
ctrl R and it says reverse tech attacks
search and I can put in history and it's
automatically going to include history
pi plus because that was last time i
typed in history and you can search
inside that search query so you can use
this result by pressing enter or you can
just copy it with ctrl J and you can
also search farther back in history with
ctrl R to quit this hit ctrl G or C now
here are some handy shortcuts for
history as well you can hit ctrl P
and control-n to move back and forth
from previous or the next entry you can
also hit alt greater than or less than
to move to the beginning or the end of
the list control
ou can also run the current command and
then move on to the next one right after
that now after the break we'll see what
the exclamation mark is all about
we're back with history now there are
some expansion commands that you can use
for history and they all start with an
exclamation mark some of these include
two of them like so which will show me
the last thing that I ran the last
command I can also run exclamation and a
number like I did in the previous
information which shows me that number
three line something else I could do is
run a string to do that you just put an
exclamation mark and your string to
repeat a list starting with that string
or a question mark and string to repeat
a list containing that string now don't
use the last two unless you are sure you
know what you're doing because those
will run no matter what they are now
check out the bash man page for more
information on history expansion now how
do you use the history command make sure
