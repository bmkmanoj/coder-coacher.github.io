devices Comcast netflix bury the hatchet
one badass botnet built from security
cameras and the FBI says don't indict
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Patrick Norton and this is
threat wire for July fifth 2016 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and a big
thanks to all the patrons at patreon
calm / threat liar that make this show
possible none of these emails should
have been on any kind of unclassified
system that's what FBI director James
Comey said but quotes in looking back at
our investigations into miss handling or
removal of classified information we
cannot find a case that would support
bringing criminal charges on these facts
quote all the cases prosecuted involves
some combination of clearly intentional
and willful mishandling of classified
information or vast quantities of
materials exposed in such a way as to
support an inference of intentional
misconduct or indications of disloyalty
to the United States or efforts to
obstruct justice we do not see those
things here that said this is the FBI's
recommendation not the final call
whether or not Secretary of Clinton is
indicted is in the hands of the
Department of Justice now this just
means the FBI is finished the
investigation all I'm going to say is
that it's probably better to be a
cabinet member that a member of the rank
and file when it comes to putting
classified or top secret information on
a private email server in short Comey
declared quote although there is
evidence of potential violations of the
statutes regarding the handling of
classified information our judgment is
that no reasonable prosecutor would
bring such a case hmmm one of the scraps
that launched the fight over net
neutrality appears to be over for now
quote comcast and Netflix have reached
an agreement to incorporate Netflix into
x1 providing seamless access to the
great content offered by both companies
we have much work to do before the
service will be available to consumers
later this year will provide more
details at that time that's the quote
comcast and Netflix gabri codes kara
swisher today they've been watching
Netflix and Comcast fight over the past
few years over claims of reduce
bandwidth pay-for-play carriage Netflix
pretty much pulling out the checkbook
the guaranteed quality of service for
users the whole net neutrality fight
these recent suggestions that they might
try to open up set-top boxes in the near
future well the idea that Netflix and
Comcast have found true happiness
together is kind of curious terms of the
deal nobody knows just yet other than
that Netflix will have an app show up on
the x1 boxes later this year we choke a
lot about the Internet of Things being
the internet of lots of stuff that can
be hacked inside of your house so many
devices are using poorly vetted and
rarely updated firmware and hey
unpatched Linux is not your friend even
if it's in a light bulb but nothing
brings that point home quite like in
gadgets right up lizard squad hacked
thousands of cameras to attack websites
which sounds like a joke until you start
reading the article i really suggest you
do which goes on to say quote security
researchers and arbor networks have
discovered that the outfit compromised
several thousand closed-circuit cameras
and webcams to create a botnet that it
promptly used for denial of service
attacks against banks gaming sites
governments and internet providers each
device might not be it individually
powerful as a pc but they add up some
attacks flooded sites with as much as
four hundred gigabits per second of data
meanwhile checkpoint technology says 85
million Android devices have been hit by
the humming bad malware checkpoint
discovered back in February it's mostly
in China but it's nasty it's quote a
persistent rootkit on Android devices
generates fraudulent ad revenue and
installs additional fraudulent apps
apparently it's generating nearly a
million dollars a quarter in revenue
from 10 million devices that are
controlled by humming bet hope they
don't hook up with the guys from lizard
squad there's a link in the show notes
and hey while this might be focused on
China it's a sign that Android security
is something to take very very seriously
