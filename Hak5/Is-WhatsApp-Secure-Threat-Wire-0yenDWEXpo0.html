thousands of MongoDB databases have been
deleted across the web cardless ATMs
sound like a terrible idea and
cellebrite got hacked coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for Tuesday
January 17 2017
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
patrons over at patreon.com slash threat
wire we have officially reached our goal
for a video RSS so I will be working on
setting that up this week once it is
completely finalized I will send out the
link to all of my social media accounts
like at snubs on twitter so you can
subscribe as soon as it is available
thank you again patrons you guys made
this possible really really appreciate
your support and your help and by the
way my voice sounds terrible because I
just got back from shmoocon
it was super fun so first off whatsapp
has a backdoor what okay hold up y'all
before we freak out let's do some due
diligence and see what this story is all
about so on January 13th the Guardian
dot-com published a story discussing a
vulnerability in whatsapp that seemed to
be a flaw in its inherent security
allowing Facebook to read your messages
from the app due to a way that whatsapp
implements encryption many many people
pointed fingers at whatsapp and said it
could be used for government's as a
backdoor basically while whatsapp does
use the signal protocol for encryption
the app can also generate new encryption
keys if you are offline
making Yuri encrypt messages that
haven't been marked as delivered in the
app what's that will automatically
resend the message with new keys and you
cannot prevent it you are only notified
of the change if you have opted into
encryption warnings signal by open
whisper systems does not have that same
kind of vulnerability so some security
researchers say that this is not a
vulnerability but a limitation due to
how cryptography is handled for such a
popular app Ars Technica points out that
you can continue the same conversation
when you buy a new phone because the
encryption key is updated for that new
device for example this is a story of
genius over security if the consumer
gets annoyed with having to verify new
cryptographic keys whenever they change
they may choose to ignore encryption
altogether because it gets annoying
others like myself you signal and prefer
to be notified of any changes in
security
however annoying they may be the main
reason for debate is whether or not this
is a backdoor researchers say that it is
not but it would still be possible for a
government entity or a hacker to
potentially gain control of a new key
without your knowledge I'll be it would
be really really hard to do so if you do
use whatsapp and you are worried about
your key being changed without your
knowledge you can turn on notifications
in settings account security plenty of
web developers know about the MongoDB
databases which are generally used to
store customer information but problems
arise when that database is accidentally
left public and attackers can easily
obtain database information by searching
for it on the website last week many
businesses had a huge headache due to a
new attack that removes the databases
and leaves ransom notes in their wake
but when a business pays up to get their
customer information back they're
completely left empty-handed due to
several attackers trying to get in on
the ransom unfortunately publicly
available MongoDB databases can be
deleted copied or completely written
over causing serious implications for
businesses that use it the ransom note
simply includes an email address a
Bitcoin address and a payment amounts
required to get the data back over
29,000 databases have been erased so far
and according to ARS technica if your
site requires a MongoDB database just
make sure that it isn't publicly
available by blocking port two seven
zero one seven or binding local IP
addresses to limit access to servers and
MongoDB has a blog post available about
avoiding these kinds of attacks
so recently several of my friends have
mentioned that their chief accounts have
had fraud attempt and I wonder if this
story has anything to do with it in a
story by crimson security card less ATM
transactions are being used to steal
thousands of dollars from checking
accounts of users without their
knowledge
a few banks have begun using these new
ATMs that allow a customer to withdraw
money with
a debit card by using their phone
instead that just rre automatically
sounds like a terrible idea
a customer downloads the mobile banking
app and they verify the phone number
associated with that phone
then they approach the ATM and log into
the app the app asks for withdrawal
amount and a seven digit code appears on
the phone or QR code appears on the ATM
which is then entered into the ATM to
get their money out a card and a four
digit PIN are not required so there's it
seems like there's no two-factor going
on here
even though you require a phone so first
an attacker needs to know the customers
username and password for their bank
after logging in the attacker can add a
new mobile number to their account and
change the email address for
notifications the attacker can then
download the app on their phone and use
it at an ATM to get cash unfortunately
as opposed to credit cards ATM and debit
transactions aren't necessarily always
covered and your money does not have to
be covered by the bank they can deny
your claim for a refund due to the
fraudulent transaction so it's really
really important to review your bank's
policies and Federal Regulation II which
is linked below in the show notes as
well as implementing two-factor
authentication if available through your
bank since the consumer could be liable
for the losses and have no recourse the
bank is less likely to fix this problem
that we are sure to see more of in the
near future in cases case they are
simply lowering the withdrawal amount at
these kind of ATM celebrites yeah
they're a company that sells their
services for smartphone data extraction
most popularly known for a device that
they sell called the universal forensic
extraction device which can extract SMS
messages emails call logs and a lot more
from a physical mobile device in your
possession and on Thursday their data
was hacked and given to motherboard
Viacom specifically over 900 gigabytes
of data including customer info
databases evidence from seized mobile
devices and technical information about
celebrites products celebrates cells
their tools to the government agencies
in the US possibly along with Russia
Turkey in the United Arab Emirates it's
just one of the many hacks that we are
to see against surveillance companies on
celebrites websites they said the quote
company is conducting an investigation
to determine the extent of the breach
and goes on to say quote the company is
working with relevant authorities
regarding this illegal action and are
assisting in their investigation thank
you again for being patrons of threat
wire

your own for baby in the show at the
hush puppy perk level like the new ones
that we have this week they're so so
cute I love them thank you so much for
sending those in and keep on sending
them too because I will continue to
