carbonite orange is she may be a little
bit oh yeah large number so we have got
some fantastic emails for you guys this
week just curating all the good stuff so
let's check point 17 alright so the
first email comes from mark he says in
my world the cellular industry we call
those spaces with guardians love the
show and keep up the good work well
thanks so much mark he's actually
referring to if you guys haven't been
following along we're doing a fantastic
series here over a hack tip I'm talking
about Wi-Fi 101 everything you ever
needed to know like channels and the
different protocols and we're going to
be getting frames and you know how it
all works and how to crack wpa anyway so
we were talking about channels here
recently and how you know channel one
and two and three and they all overlap
but then there they're also like five
megahertz apart and I called that white
space but it seems that in actually ray
vo signaling and in audio processing and
a bunch of other things those little
tiny spaces in between the bands are
called guard band so thank you so much
Mark for saying no long i love i love
getting learned up you know yep and we
have a second email from anonymous he
rides i was thinking is there a way to
set up d ban on your notebook to run on
a timer say if you don't login within a
certain amount of hours it will run and
wipe everything can it be done with any
other nuke program um I don't really
know of a way to automate dban I know
that you've played with dman before as a
way to like do that DoD or RCMP wipe on
your hard drive so it's like dead yeah
and I get the idea that you're like oh
no my laptop's fall into the wrong hands
I want it to kill itself right you've
played what what's the one that you like
we're like pray pray yeah right and it
does that one have a remote wipe
function it does not i don't believe
okay because the only thing that I could
come up with is say if you're running
Linux you could you know write a script
here i'm going to less it right now
slash var slash log slash auth dot log
this right here is the log file that's
going to tell you like you know when
logins occurred when they were
successful when they were unsuccessful
the only thing i could really think of
is maybe coming up with a script so that
it pulls that and if too much time has
passed it just does like an RM tack or
I'm sure there's some other Linux tools
for doing secure deletes some other
suggestions on IRC were to embed a USB
Drive you can actually on your laptop
say you've got an external USB port here
if you open it up and look at the pins
on the motherboard you could solder on
an internal and I've done this before on
my eeepc I put a bluetooth adapter
internally and I just kind of hit it
where an extra ram slot would be you
could hide a USB Drive that had like a
specially crafted version of dban that's
automatically set up to nuke your
computer and then set that as the
default boot device in the bio so every
time you turn on your computer would try
to a nuke it if you didn't like you know
hit escape f12 f1 whatever and choose
the right but it's not a perfect
solution i dont i I've kept this one in
the lineup because I want to hear what
you guys thoughts are on this so leave
you know what kind of ideas you have
maybe we could come up with something
really cool so down there in the
comments just leave us in love let's
figure this one out should be good
alright we have another email you have a
lot this week from delmar 1992 he says I
am a German national German sports are
now available online but my computer
knows that it is in America is there a
way of tracking the server in the
computer into thinking that I'm in
Germany so that I can watch it this also
goes for watching hulu in germany is
there a program or a hack that i need
any suggestions are more than welcome
you know they enter this tunneling right
yeah yeah and there's actually a really
there's there's plenty of ways to do it
but there's a commercial service that i
was talking to jen cutter about when
we're doing our e3 episode she
absolutely she wasn't can't have like
nothing they have netflix now but
they're still like the BBC iplayer in
the UK so you can't watch top gear or
whatever it is our or Torchwood I want
to watching torchwood doctor doctor who
yeah the british version tangent anyway
um you can't watch those unless you're
actually in that area so she loves a
service called we topia w itop dia and
they're a VPN service that has they've
got servers all over the world if you
want to connect from egypt from the UK
from germany if you want to make it look
like you're from Canada or Australia or
wherever they've got plenty of these
services I just started playing with the
service they offer ssl vpns they offer
openvpn they offer pptp ipsec all of the
standard you know so all the protocols
you wanted to eat well if you wanted to
say do ipsec it would work on your iPad
or it would work on your iPhone or you
know you'd be able to do it with Linux
really easily so that's one of the
options I've seen a bunch of these
commercial VPN services but i can
actually recommend that because jen
recommended it to me I've started
playing with it and it seems pretty cool
it's like 40 bucks a month they're not a
sponsor anything I'm just sayin like
that's one way to do or hey if you've
got a friend in Germany you could have
him set up a camera set up your and
we've talked about that in great lengths
in the seventh season on setting up your
own VPN server so we'll have some links
in the show notes on how you can
actually build your own if get some
peeps back home that want to do that
nice everybody could just help each
other out in the comments be like a get
on my server okay well stay tuned
