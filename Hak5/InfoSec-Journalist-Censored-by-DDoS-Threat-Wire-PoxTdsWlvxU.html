coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Shannon Morse and this is threat
wire for September 27 2016 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom make sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel to get
these shows before anyone else and check
out our patreon to see how you can help
the show grow patreon.com to the first
story the US Constitution appropriate
that quote Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
or abridging the freedom of speech or of
the press or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble and to petition
the government for a redress of
grievances when considering the freedom
of speech for the press how does the law
secure a journalist ability to get the
news out there when a single handed dee
da sir can censor them in under 24 hours
with pure brute force this is a huge
concern and was brought to light by
Krebs on security this week as brian
krebs site was attacked in response to a
recent article he posted detailing the
for hire ddos operation called be das in
the two israeli man men who ran the site
that got arrested shortly after that
story went live krebs a site was
attacked in what his DDoS protection
provider Akamai said was twice the size
of the next largest attack that they had
ever seen totaling 620 gigabits per
second of data being thrown at his site
yeah that is a lot of data Akamai
decided to cancel their services on a
site to which Krebs then switch to the
free project shield program run by
Google to protect journalists from
censorship online most of the devices
used for the d das against the site were
vulnerable iot or Internet of Things
devices and with more of these being
sold on to the consumer market every
single year we'll distributed
denial-of-service attacks get worse we
need to be in a position to protect our
free speech and keep independent
journalists from being censored do too
angry retaliation we need to be very
wary and keep a very wary eye on io t
devices released to not so tech savvy
consumers who may not know they're
publicizing so much on the internet and
being used in attacks such as this one
as an independent podcaster myself I
know that we too could be attacked in a
retaliatory manner and while no one can
silence us I don't want to see
journalists that I respect being
censored for getting news out to a wider
public on sep tember 22nd of last week
yahoo CISO Bob Lord posted an entry to
Yahoo's tumblr announcing a hack on
their services from 2014 stolen
information included names email
addresses telephone numbers dates of
birth hashed passwords and encrypted or
unencrypted security questions while not
explaining who or why Lord also stated
that they believe this was done by a
state-sponsored hacker but the attacker
is no longer in their servers while the
passwords were hashed some of them were
using oldershaw one or md5 hashing
techniques instead of the stronger
bcrypt because of the hack yahoo is
asking their users to obviously change
their passwords especially if they've
been using the same one since 2014 or
they can also use a yahoo account key
instead this is really bad timing for
Yahoo they're currently closing a deal
with verizon to sell over the core
business for four billion dollars fries
one apparently was not aware of the hack
until early last week which could
potentially mean that Yahoo didn't know
about the hack or that they hid it from
the sale agreement as for Yahoo some of
their hashing certificates were self
signed and very very old with only two
point five percent of them being issued
within the last 90 days these days it's
pretty common to get a certificate that
expires within 12 months or so okay so
why is this important it happened back
in 2014 right now while this hack
happened two years ago having 500
million accounts breached even if it's
just a small percentage of those that
were using older encryption and hashing
algorithms they could be used to hit
users on many other sites given that
they are so easy to reverse-engineer
into plain text and consumers are still
using the same passwords on multiple
different websites which is a really bad
idea so tell your grandma to change her
yahoo email password if she's still
using yahoo
and make sure that she's not reusing the
same one on multiple sites researchers
at Chinese keen security lab were able
to take over some of Tesla's systems
remotely through the vehicles controller
area network they figured out how to
open the doors and the trunk the sunroof
control the in dash display use turn
lights and one of my favorites break the
car while it is in moving motion the
research was already submitted to bug
crowd and they are the ones that handle
Tesla's bug bounty program and they have
already released a patch to fix the
vulnerability a video has been released
demoing the attacks but no specific
details and the video is actually pretty
fun to watch so definitely check it out
so this is a really great reason to just
not by a connected car just stick with
the dumb ones from like the 90s in the
early 2000s because those haven't
necessarily been hacked yet thanks again
to all the fine people who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow the show and in
return we're going to be building a RSS
feed for you yes patreon just released
an audio RSS ability that's still in
beta not sure if it's available to
threat wire yet but we're going to be
looking into it we might even feature
your furbaby in an upcoming episode like
these ones check out the perk levels on
patreon it thank you again for helping
us keep this coming completely
independent and ad free and of course if
you cannot donate you can always
