what does that mean we are sending and
receiving Morse code with our computer
sound card this time on hack five
hello in Volcom hak5 my name is darren
kitchen my name is Jana Morris it's your
weekly dose of techno list welcome we
are finished with our dairy cone episode
I'm very excited about this we had a
fantastic time at Derby con if you get
the opportunity you definitely need to
hit up that conference is so much fun
and lots of really cool things to do
there outside of just going to talks and
parties yeah definitely
including shin and I heard that you I
got my ham license amateur radio license
I guess I should say my from the FCC so
I'm super excited about that yeah and it
was kind of hard cuz I didn't study so I
did fail the first time but I can tell
you right now I'll just take it again
and you might just pass so that's what I
did I took it again and then I tried for
general and I did really good on the
general test but I didn't pass it right
so I was like I'll just take that next
time well hey you got something to work
up to and don't I'm not buying any of
this like I didn't study so you should
have seen her on the plane and the
shout-out to Joel for hooking you up
with the book oh yes absolutely that
book was amazing so my callsign now is
km 6 fpp I might go for of an 81 73 woot
and yes I am very aware that the address
is publicly available that's why it's
the same place you can send stickers to
yeah well how about that come on how
many people looked it up though like
texted me on Twitter and they would like
your address that's public now just
trying I was like dude trying to be
helpful
that's creepy yeah so everybody's
looking out for you and we're all really
excited that you're licensed thank you
yes me too and I am friends with cops
just FYI this means that we're able to
do really cool new things like we've
done a lot with software-defined radio
in the past and we've done the
unlicensed spectrum things like you know
for 33 megahertz or 900 megahertz or 2.4
gigahertz and that's fun because we can
transmit there but now you have the
ability to transmit on frequency that I
can't I do yeah and well before we
really get into like you know learning
how to transmit and stuff like that like
I am so new to this I've done
software-defined radio of course but
this is a brand new territory for me so
I know that we have ham
licensed radio operators out there that
watch this show so if you guys have any
recommendations for places that I can
learn more stuff for specific radios
that I should get into definitely like
how to tutorials like guidelines and
things like that definitely send them my
way because I want to learn all the
things right in fact I even hear that
you're what flashing firmware on radios
now oh yeah I got a little UV 5r I know
that's it's a piece of crap but it was
thirty dollars and people were like yeah
just get started on that one and I got a
programming cable so I can program it
from my computer not from its own screen
which apparently is terrible trying to
do so I'm excited to reprogram that I
also have this it's a Morse code
oscillator hey Shannon Morse that's a
fantastic little toy for you to have
tell me about Morse code yeah so CW
Morse it's not necessary anymore for the
ham tech license but I still figured
that it's still really useful and it's
also really fun to learn and it's
awesome since Morse requires less
bandwidth than voice communication so if
you don't have a lot of bandwidth to
work with for some reason then you could
use Morse instead as an alternative so
for me being this like I'm all about
getting ready for the zombie apocalypse
so I was like I'm gonna be so useful on
a team one day I will be that one who's
like oh yeah I know how to build an
antenna yes yep getting in the hak5 van
I will be ready all the munitions yeah
so that means that Shannon Morse we're
gonna be playing with CW and Linux
that's the obvious next step we you know
excited you need to learn this and what
better way than to like throw in some
fun open-source tools - yeah hacks yes
so let's get hacking what what are we
doing Shannon so I actually found this
really cool terminal program recommended
by one of the licensees who gave me the
test well I was at Derby con and it's
called Morse haha so sudo apt-get
install Morse if you're on like WD
machines there are a ton of options so
I'll show you a few of those there you
go okay so it's great if you want to
learn Morse because there are so many
options in here
so you can slow it down you can speed it
up you can play whatever you type out
which I really like to do I highly
recommend doing that and I like an
interactive mode yeah you can use dashes
you can also like take a test in here so
you can make it send out audio to you so
you can hear it and then you can type in
what you think it said and then it'll
error it will give you a little air
noise if you get it wrong wow I'm just
like hearkened back to like Mavis
teaches typing or something of like that
that's fantastic
assaults show you an example so the fun
thing about Linux programs though is
it's it's everything loves standard
input and standard oh yeah does this
mean that I can like tie this in with
all my bash scripts no because you know
I feel about a bash script right yeah
definitely so for example I could type
in Echo SOS and then pipe that over to
Morse and when I hit enter okay
everybody knows that's SOS does nice
yeah or I could type in let's see let's
see you forgot you forgot the are in
snobs your nerves
one of my favorite things to do with
this is type in Morse code tak I tack em
and again as I mentioned before if you
type in something to your keyboard so
I'll do SOS SOS so it'll type it out to
you and it'll also show you the dots or
dashes because it's understandable that
sometimes Morse can get confusing
because the dashes and dot's can sound
the same so that's I love this program
it is so cool and I figured that we
could take this a step further was
something that you found as well
actually I love also the concept that
you could like pipe text files to this
and then you could read along and see
the dots and dashes and the ASCII text
and that's just that's really cool so
I'm glad that's configurable because I
have a feeling that if we set this up
right and we really lower the words per
minute that we may be able to actually
get this to communicate because I have
over here a couple of programs that will
actually allow me to receive Morse code
right which is a little trickier okay
playboy it really is it's a little bit
this was a bit more difficult than it
needs to be and mainly because things
just haven't been kept up to date yeah
so the first program that I found to
receive Morse code and Linux is called
RS CW and it's it seems straightforward
and it's it's what you would expect its
receive CW through sound card and this
is what it would look like if it was
running
however it's not going to at least on my
machine because I'm running ubuntu 16.04
by the time this is airing and you know
it technically does work but it uses the
older open sound system API instead of
the more common alsa API and that's your
typical sound for linux so thankfully
Shannon I was able to find a nice
alternative that remedies that situation
without having to there's some like
padding programs that you can like wrap
older OSS sound system kind of programs
inside of but that's that's way more
back than I want to do especially not
when there's x-d Morse available check
it out XD morse is a gtk app for
decoding Morse code applications into
text so basically getting started with
this is really simple essentially what
we're gonna do is do a little sudo
apt-get install XD Morse which I already
have installed and once you have that
done you're gonna need to go to slash
USR slash slash dock and you'll see a
new directory in there whoa a lot of
directories but one of them that we're
interested is XD Morse right so in here
you'll find that there is an example
directory and we'll want to head over to
there and in that we will notice that we
have an XD Morse example in fact it's
typically a zip file so you'll just have
to unzip that and basically this is a
dot file that's going to live in our
home directory
so tilde as it were so if I had over if
I do CD it'll take me to tilde right my
home working directory and I've already
copied that here and what we need it to
be named
is dot XD more so we're gonna nano that
dot XD Morse RC and you can see here the
author is actually written quite a few
things about OSS API and alsa and all of
these other things and this is this
honestly this is the thing where like I
found this and I'm like oh my god I'm
not the only somebody wrote comments
somebody understands the pain so
thankfully this isn't painful anymore
all you have to do is follow along
basically all you'll need to do is set
your hardware ID now by default this was
set to HW 1 it could be HW 0 it really
depends on your computer and actually
I've never tested this in the studio so
we'll see if it comes out of the views
of the proper microphone because I open
up sound you know it may vary because I
have an hdmi displayport here and so
it's gonna mess with my input no it
isn't so it's HW 0 in my case and that's
going to grab my microphone the rest of
this configuration is about you know the
the sample rate 4100 is or 40,000 is
great the actual channel front-left is
the default that's great we're gonna do
capture and then the rest of this is
really setting up the the words per
minute so I could actually come in here
and say set this to like 15 and I can
actually set all of the other you know
the the initial demodulation and things
of that nature I'm just going to set
that to 15 and then additionally if you
have some other devices you can actually
tie this in as if you have like a serial
device typically dev TTY USB the rest of
this is for actually transmitting like
if you have a radio and yeah I don't so
what's gonna be fun is we're just going
to use their laptops as you'll see here
so I'm gonna go ahead and save this out
and exit and at this point really it's
just a matter of running XD more and
i'll put an ampersand at the end of
there so it'll just open up I get this
nice little gtk window and all I have to
do is hit receive and it's gonna be like
oh you don't have a you know cat and
it's like yeah that's okay I don't
actually and notice that it's typing duh
duh right so if I if I put in hold on I
wonder what
dad dies Oh so I type T and it actually
is - well now I'm getting teased over
here wait a second yeah you see where
this is going we're going to they're not
even acoustically coupled we're just in
the room yeah and the thing that we
notice I actually have a waterfall over
here on the right so we can actually see
the noise in the room that is picking up
and then our signal input we can
actually take a look at the levels of
the ratios it's pretty cool I have this
set to 15 wpm okay so I'm getting just a
bunch of stuff but why don't you try
sending me stuff on your side oh look at
that hang on here let me clear the
windows so that it's I'm gonna try to be
quiet go ahead and do that again Wow
that is so cool that was so cool that's
awesome right you just transmitted data
from your computer to mine without your
speakers well what's more than what I
really like about that is we didn't use
a network we didn't use disk we were
able to potentially the exfiltrate data
from this machine oh yeah just using
audio right that's and I don't know I I
like it this there's something about
this and we didn't need a license to do
this either right because we're just
using audio so cool right that's really
neat I enjoy that well I'm gonna keep on
using this this Morse program to learn
Morse code and hopefully I'll be able to
talk to you in Morse next time for the
show right now really for anybody that
would try to do something is similar to
this the one thing that we did notice in
setting this up was that we had to
change the frequency cuz Shannon's over
here Jin's over at my laptop going dead
- Dada Dada Dada and nothing's happening
and this goes
dog dog dog yeah I noticed that the the
Morse program the it was it was at a
higher pitch than
voices so I noticed that if I say EPP
like it would pick up s as Morse code
but if I if it did we did it in the
Morse program it didn't pick it up so
then I went over to Morse and you'll
notice here that I changed the word
count for per minute to 15 to match his
and then I change the frequency to 400
because it defaults much higher I think
it defaults at 800 yeah defaults at 800
frequency in Hertz so I just lowered it
by about half and then started playing
characters and it picked up each and
every character so you definitely need
to play around with it depending on your
your own setup cuz yours might vary a
little bit but that's what we found
worked for us Wow you know what I really
want to do just just for fun Shannon
just for fun just for funsies okay so
I'm putting out of this I'm going to
edit that file again and this time I'm
just gonna change that 15 to I don't
know 60 because okay that sounds like
fun
alright I have mine now set to 60 okay
and I just find a 60 whoops alright go
ahead I'm gonna hit receive I don't
think it can pick it up no no you're
gonna have to transmit data very slowly
yeah that doesn't work so well so really
hard well I'm gonna change it to like 40
when we get back I think that there's
some ways that we could transmit some
data a little bit more effective
efficient Lee but first we're gonna take
a quick break I think are awesome
sponsor we are very excited that with
the help of dr. ho stting our very first
hackathon here at the hack 5 warehouse
and as you guys know we have been having
so much fun doing cool things in bash
like translating Morse code and you know
I was thinking about it the land turtle
most of that's actually in bash and we
love doing social things too and talk
club really inspired us to set up
something like code vash Club that's
right we are doing a halloween-themed
open house where we're gonna be breaking
out the land turtles doing a mini
seminar and then a workshop on writing
so we hope that you guys can join us and
bring your laptop and help bash out some
code at the hack 5 warehouse this Sunday
October 30th from 10:00 to 4:00 and you
can sign up an RSVP over at code bash
club and you know what speaking of dot
clubs have I mentioned how perfect of a
top-level domain it is the way I see it
the Internet is all about community and
nothing could be more social than a doc
club so when you're thinking about
starting your next business and naming
your next website consider yourself a
doc club there are a plethora still
awesome doc clubs available and you can
find them over at domain.com slash club
and best of all you can save 20% when
you check out with the coupon code hak5
at domain.com
so until then also send tweet at
domain.com and say hey thanks for
supporting hack 5 all these years and I
hope to see you at the hack 5 warehouse
for code bash club when you think domain
names think domain.com we're back and
it's now time to show you some other
easy ways to acoustically transmit data
right I love the whole concept of like
exfiltrating data without using networks
and out with you without using discs
free space optics you know audio tones
and in fact we've touched on this
briefly in the past and I wanted to
reiterate this because well we did trust
your Technol us in Morse code at 15
words per minute it was a little slow
I think 110 baud might be what we need
and let's go ahead and and set that us
up with mini modem we've talked about
that in the past why don't you be the
receiver okay so what you'll need to do
is mini modem like you have there tactic
Rx and you do you have to do sudo
apt-get install mini modem tech tech our
exes receiving our exes short for
receive tactic ASCII and then 110 for
the baud rate alright so go ahead and
hit enter I'm going to over on my
machine do mini modem make that a little
bigger tactic transmit ASCII at 110 baud
and I'll say trust your techno lust so
I'm just gonna hold this near your
laptop and when I hit enter and I switch
to your computer ah right that's funny
in that awesome now side note on this he
literally had to hold his his computer
right like on the top of my computer
wait to hear it right because if you
don't do that it errors out so keep that
in mind that's also a 110 baud which was
even just way slower than what I played
legend of the red dragon on as a kid
that was 1200 baud at least
yeah i slayed that dragon like twice
still much faster than 15 words per
minute yeah 110 being 110 baud is uh
bytes per ha baud symbols per second
because it's how many times the signal
changes and we're doing 110 changes per
second and we're doing ASCII which is 8
bits for each character so there you go
okay cool yeah anyway fun stuff let us
know what you guys think feedback a hack
5 org and you can also send us cool
things over to the warehouse I know that
we just received one here my care
package recently did yes this is such a
cool care package so when I went to
Japan in May I got to go karaoke and the
only reason I was able to go is because
one of the guys that showed up at the
meet up his name is El Quintero he
brought us out this awesome Japanese
karaoke bar and it was the most amazing
thing it was a great experience but he
sent us a care package from this guy in
Tokyo that's the only reason I knew it
was him right so he sent us first off I
wanted to point this out so I was like
oh he looks like a pineapple cuz he's
got the little thing he's on his head I
had to look this guy up it's from Kamen
Rider gaim henshin and this he
apparently like fights bad guys and he
has this attack called finisher
pineapple arms what and it's it's weird
but amazing so he's carrying a pineapple
and like destroying this guy with it oh
man it's such a thrill I love this in so
many ways it's amazing I love Japan so
much the pineapple suit of armor thank
you
I find the perfect spot for this yes man
you know you're on little pineapple man
yes so we also got AV Tokyo stickers so
we'll put these ones on the set I
believe AV Tokyo is a hacker con in
Tokyo so you know if anybody knows the
people that run this hook me up because
girls got to get her butt back to Japan
it's just saying right no drink no
no drink no hack well that is going on
the set thank you so much I love
stickering up the set and he sent me
some reading material which I will I
totally I can read this but I can try Oh
Laughing Man yeah The Laughing Man so
we'll put one of his on the set and then
he also said Sailor Moon crystal
stickers because I love Sailor Moon and
Pokemon they're so adorable
yeah don't want any got that cuz I must
really appreciate it thank you so much
Alcantara and if you guys want to send
stickers or addresses over at hak5 org
slash address and you can send stickers
there anywhere in the world for all your
hacker clubs and we love to promote
other people's clubs because we love you
guys
hey thank you you know what as you were
mentioning the Pokemon it occurred to me
that people should go and check out the
snubs report because Shannon just did a
recent vlog on Pokemon go I should find
out more at Shannon's Channel true yeah
in fact if you're a hack 5 gorg's or if
ya youtube.com slash hack 5 just scroll
to the very bottom and you'll see it
it's a little playlist of good stuff ah
yes sure thanks for throwing that out
there
and again if you guys have
recommendations for ham radio goodies
definitely tell me about them because
I'm super excited to learn everything
that has to do with him doing the
amateur radio operation and everything I
think it's a really really cool thing
and there's not a lot of young people
doing it so I'm very excited to get into
this all right sounds awesome I can't
wait to see your feedback with that hak5
org is where you can find all of the
links to their social media and what
we've got going on and when you get to
your social media you're gonna want to
tweet with or face blerg or insta Smurf
instagram with the hashtag hak5 why is
that channel is that every single week
we are asking you guys what tickles your
technology you can tweet us Instagram or
face with the hashtag hashtag hack 5 for
your chance to win some awesome gear
from the hack shop somebody's giving
away nano Wi-Fi pineapple Nano fantastic
who is getting the nano I think Mike at
Mike gali deserves a Wi-Fi pineapple
Nana see he did this awesome build he
send my hack five techno less work in
progress as a virtual pinball machine
and yes it has a Microsoft Sidewinder
which is a keyboard for nudge control
that is so cool Wow look at that
brilliant piece of work
good I love some some pen yeah that's
one so Mike I'm gonna get in contact
with you
yeah we'll send up a book - why not hey
if you would like to get your very own a
set of awesome hack five equipment you
can find all of it the Wi-Fi pineapple
and travel the USB rubber ducky of the
book all the other really cool stuff
that we do here hae shop comm and that's
how you can support us directly and
thank you to everybody who has for the
many years and it is just a blessing to
be here doing this
thank you everybody we really appreciate
it haq5 org is where you can find out
all the events that are coming up that
we are involved in as well as any
trainings or yeah lots of great
workshops and some review in Austria
check it out yeah hak5 dot o-r-g and we
will see you on the Internet
no that's the other one that's my threat
wire wine dude right I don't remember
how to podcast but I do remember my name
which is Darren kitchen and my name is
Shannon Morse trust your tech no less
Thank You Shannon
no problem the studio has been falling
apart the studio is falling apart today
we're getting a new studio I'm gonna
bring this studio around all this
podcast over I pulled this on my podcast
around I was driving this studio the
things she thinks is Jeff nice she's
driving technology she's got me you
won't go there she's the one driving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
