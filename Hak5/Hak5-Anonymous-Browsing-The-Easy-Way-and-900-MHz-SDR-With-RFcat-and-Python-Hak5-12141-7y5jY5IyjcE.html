hacking the airwaves with RF cat a USB
radio dongle and a little bit of Python
lovin then I'm setting up a little
counter surveillance rig the easy way
with a live Onion Router distro plus
Portable VPN clients for unprivileged
users
what are your open source options all
that and more this time on hack 5 this
segment of hack 5 is brought to you by
domain.com hello can hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen
I am Shannon Morse you're all
professional today yes all like a robot
are you a Cylon Shh
I heard that you were asking dumbest
nuts tell people that hello blood and
chrome people are along the way there
are no skin jobs in bloody gray or are
there don't
jun-chan did you watch it yes it's so
cool I love it so far I love it and I
also hate that it's like in these little
10-minute doses I know ok no spoilers
but it's no spoiler of that kind so it's
a pet of of blood and chrome are 10
minutes and that just drives you crazy
by the way if you haven't figured out
hack 5 are huge fans with Battlestar
Galactica husband because the inception
of the series about the same time the
high cloud came out so it's very
wonderful to see this show back
you know what else I am a big fan of yes
people not stealing the word Tecna last
what are you talking about we stole the
word technology but you're giving away
like also secrets today yeah and you
know what that that's you just do it you
just did a quote from war games which is
even better because it kind of you know
prompts if you know the the instance of
that quote but uh but yeah I mean techno
list is just it's funny because it's
like in like three frames or something
of the mood hackers which is coming up
on 20 years old now oh my god just
throwing that out there to make
everybody else feel all those born in
the 80s uh I feel really old now that's
pretty bad if you
I haven't seen it cuz this is the case
we went to Island AK 5 meetup a couple
years ago in Toronto and this awesome
kid came out he was like 14 at the time
or something so we couldn't sit in the
bar area and his parents came it was so
cool
and he had never seen war games never
seen hackers never seen sneakers yeah it
was so poor like all the really good old
school hacker movie you know they don't
make good ones anymore but yeah they
don't and fish sorta catch
Paul's calling out swordfish well I
found this Wired magazine I picked it up
cuz it's got Bri on the front and I was
like yeah baby
but just like these they're not open
sourcing what's really sad yeah so then
here who cares about the car right but
check this out um it's not as well it
sponsored if this is it this here look
Carla yeah how funny is it that would
have got here our sponsor this week here
yeah I'll do it right here make a screen
it may cause technology who decided to
put that in there because they awesome
obviously watch either hackers or our
show well it's not really a that much
it's interesting to see the trends of
those those words over time I just I
opened it and I looked at that and the
only time you ever see that word is
whenever we say trust your time lasso
you know why what you know why cuz I
have no idea how to end a show and I was
like let's just pick a phrase or
something you know well it's a good
slogan yeah I think at the time twit and
I don't know if they do this anymore but
they used to say uh another Twitter's in
the can or something they still do this
and then at the end of iPad today we
howl well I did on the last episode sir
went oh and I was like do I - okay I
guess I he'll it was the weirdest thing
but they do that at the end of every
iPad today do they do that on your VD
show as well I love never Vampire
Diaries
that is haha as I found out that that
stands for now okay um we should
probably get into the hacking I guess so
alright so what are we doing today well
I I talked about this last week I'm so
I'm so excited about playing with the
torque on badge I'm very proud to have
our logo actually on it Rex to this
little software company from Redmond
know what they do but we sponsored the
badge and it's one of those things that
I'm super excited about I am I'm really
getting into a lot of software-defined
radio or SDR and the idea of you know
it's actually kind of an extension of
those things that we've been talking
about a lot on hak5 over years in
regards to Wi-Fi and bluetooth and other
fun protocols like ZigBee and the whole
idea that you know packets or packets
and it's just like a different frequency
or a different modulation technique and
so this is not our 101 on
software-defined radio because we're
actually not getting into SDR in that
terms today we're going to kind of ease
our way in with something a little
easier and that's what I love about the
torque on badge I talked about this
recently basically this guy here is I
wouldn't say a software-defined radio in
the sense that like a USRP from ettus or
a the forthcoming hack RF or the or any
of those like TV tuners that you may
have seen that can do SDR do it is
basically a an implementation of this
chip from texas instrument called the CC
1111 or 1110 it's a calculator now Texas
Instruments makes more than just
calculators they make some pretty cool
chips and this one makes it really easy
to do all sorts of different radio stuff
basically it operates within 300 and 928
megahertz it can do for those that are
curious it does the modulation types 2
FS k g FS k MS kask and oh okay and
those are just different frequency shift
keying amplitude shift keying on-off
keying we're not going to get into the
modulation stuff right now but yeah that
sounds like a lot to cover suffice it to
say the beauty of this chip is that when
coupled with the right firmware you can
do some really amazing stuff very simply
using Python and so I'm going to show an
example of that today this is all put
together with an awesome tool called RF
cat and so here's RF cat and so RF cat
is over at code.google.com/speed open
source Atlas and a bunch of other cool
people put this together
and this is the client and the firmware
in the source code that you can go ahead
and put on a supported dongle now the
dongles include the IME you may have
seen this this is a pink pager or I
guess for girls because it's bad you
could use it as a boy to hackers love
these things because they support the
the CC 1111 chip in them there's also
the CC 1111 emk which is a prototype
board from from TI and then the Chronos
has a watch dongle to manage their watch
apps or whatever so that also uses this
and now the torque on badge from torque
on 14 has a CC 1111 in it it already is
set up with the the RF cat firmware is
pre-installed it also has a CC
bootloader on here so you could actually
go ahead and change the firmware that's
on it you can program it with these
these pins right here and here allow you
to like plug in like a good fat which is
a programmer so that's pretty cool and
basically using RF cat you can do some
really interesting things with radio
without having to worry too much about
other stuff there
I got hours left that's interesting you
saying I'll be very good so we've heard
about a bunch of cool stuff that we can
do but what are those cool things
basically anything within those 300 to
200 and our 928 megahertz stuff using
those modulations the RF cat library
makes it really easy to program some
things with that to give you an example
of what others have done here is an
article from Andrew no Hawk about
hacking fixed key remotes so you may
have like one of these remotes for your
keys and he does a great job of
explaining how using software-defined
radio he was able to you know sniff some
stuff off of his key how he was able to
you know decode the captured signal from
is a transmitter and how he was able to
use RF cat to go ahead and retransmit
that so it's basically the same concept
it's the same concept of a replay attack
yeah which we typically do in like we're
used to that in wife
I write like I see this interesting
thing and it does that other interesting
I did this over at my boy Jays house
where he had this light Jay well my
friend Jay he is this really cool home
automation system oh and it works by
over ZigBee oh yeah yeah but there's a
TCP interface over the Wi-Fi and
basically it's the we were able at like
he's got a gate where like if you send a
certain code to it the gate to his house
will open and I talked about this weeks
back where is how we got my boy DS gate
to open it was it the same tool or was
that something perhaps I'm not familiar
with dee dee dee our Hebrew yeah no no
no but in a sense well so we actually
just tied it to the garage door opener
oh okay
so but that was a fun episode go and
check that out but in the sense that
Jays his gate worked on ZigBee there was
this debug code to open it I was able to
sniff it off the Wi-Fi and then I was
able to use netcat I think it was an
echo to just pipe the hex codes to it
that it expected to see to open the door
so that's an example of scarier replay
attack where it's like if you can find
the interesting bit and send it again if
there's no sorts of if that's their
whole security model is send up some
interesting bits and in this case as you
can see on Andrea's blog he talks about
how you know he was able to actually if
i zoom in and i'm here you'll see these
are the waveforms that produce the
unlock for it and so you can actually
see that this is a 1 that's a 0 that's 1
that's a zero we're going to get into
more this as we get into SDR but here's
some source code to give you an example
this is just some basic Python using the
RF cat library where you can set your
modulation you can set your frequency
and your bod right now the things and
then basically use a little bit of
scripting food with Python to do some
basic replay attacks and all sorts of
other fun things too and this the whole
concept of this is to get you thinking
about radio and more terms than just
what we're used to with like Wi-Fi where
the stack and all of the other
underlying parts of the infrastructure
are done for you yeah we can do fun and
interesting things and legally with the
900 megahertz
spectrum which is part of the industrial
science medical bands that the FCC gave
us years and years ago that include 5.8
gigahertz that we use for Wi-Fi and 2.4
gigahertz we use for Wi-Fi 900 megahertz
here in the US there's 433 in Canada 423
here but not in Canada and then there's
a lot of really low stuff as well lower
sob the loafers and mid furs and I first
play with those and we'll get into those
later but the point being this can do
fun happy stuff transmitting and
receiving very inexpensively and the
reason why I'm excited about this badge
in particular I know you're going to be
saying like bummer I didn't go to torque
on I didn't get the badge you know I
didn't get on the hack shop when we had
like 10 of them surplus but what's nice
is here are the hardware design files it
is open hardware anybody can go and grab
a copy of this and build some build your
own torque on badge and given that all
of this basically works on the concept
of using that Texas Instruments chip any
implementation of it will do whether
you've got the pink pager or the Cronus
thing or further hardware which I
understand is forthcoming so that will
be exciting where all of us can kind of
like use this stuff is what I'm excited
about using it for is store-and-forward
messaging at DEFCON so it's kind of like
a bigger working project I have ah so
what's the problem with DEFCON um
don't use wireless well it's don't use
Wi-Fi don't use Bluetooth yeah now don't
even use GSM basically turn off your
computer when you go
but like it's your phone - yeah and it's
so frustrating because if you're like
okay so say like you wanted to tell
dual-core 80 if what you wanted to tell
him like hey the party tonight changed
and now it's at this casino right how
would you tell him oh no I can't find
him I don't want to turn on my phone and
my phone can't send text messages over
GSM what am I going to do
yeah so what you do is you tell ten
people right where's them actually sees
him but then you know that the message
is gonna be construed on the way over to
dual-core and that's actually an example
of store-and-forward that game telephone
that we use playing on the problem with
that user totally right
ten hackers hey when you see dual cord
let him know this maybe you will see him
at the party later that night
no like you're like how cool he
obviously got my message that the party
is now here and he's like yeah cool
story bro I got 12 different messages
and they were all different you know
exactly so I like the idea that using
fun stuff that we're going to be getting
into here on our GP g / PGP series that
we'll be able to do fun store and
forward stuff with the 900 megahertz is
M band specifically this kind of dongle
in that secure messaging at Def Con and
I know this is kind of like out of band
is that secure well it will put the
security on the application there okay
so it's like I'll transmit a PGP thing
and then if we've all signed keys and
everything is all happy and get into
that then it'll be fun uh the the the
difficulty of course as I say that out
of band I mean out of like the regular
bands were used to a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and cellphones it's still only a matter
of time until people like do what they
do a hacker cons and they become dick so
I'm gonna start blood you know the
offing the crap out of everything so
that's always fun when you're trying to
you know core least at a convention and
coordinate things yeah that's good yeah
that's always fun
thankfully we've always been provided
some secure networks yes for that so
just nice thank you for all of the
conference put her honors provide secure
networks for you know sponsors and
vendors and conventional management so
I'm really excited about showing you the
possibilities when you take some awesome
open source libraries like RF cat and
you put it together with cool Python
scripts and kind of give you a taste of
what's capable of being done with a fun
little USB radio like this and we're
going to be getting into setting this up
in Ubuntu 1204 here in just a bit but
first we're gonna take a real quick
break
you guys know we're huge fans of
domain.com they are the best place to go
if you're setting up a new business you
know showcasing your blog talking about
your cat whatever it is to do domain.com
is the best place for your next big idea
and if you're looking for a new domain
name consider yourself a dot-com I
should have gotten calm when I
registered hack 5 regardless you know
why because that's the original I mean
it's best Lobley understood it
immediately lends credibility and you
know no matter what if you're into
buying and selling domains coms have the
highest actor market value and you can
find a new domain name a new com over at
domain calm I know Shannon and I are
crazy about them because they're
reliable they're affordable they're so
easy to use and they make it really fun
to do business with them because they
have an awesome social media presence on
Twitter you can tweet them at domain.com
and get this they're huge fans of hak5
they want to hook you up with 15% off
they're already affordable domain names
and hosting all you have to do is use a
coupon code hak5 at checkout to get
yourself 15% off when you think domain
names think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
