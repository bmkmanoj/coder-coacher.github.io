to Darren he's a wall somewhere in
Europe or France or Geneva I don't know
itu business or something and i'm here
with cat ears and we're talking about
the yuba co all day and more this time
on hak5 this segment is brought to you
by untangle hello and welcome to this
week's episode of pack 5 I'm Shannon
Morse up all of us you're not daring
kitchen no I'm not worried go no I don't
know worry what your up or something
yeah actually he went to know uh what
was it Geneva Switzerland to go to the
world telecommunication I have this I
googled it I was like WTF i don't know
what that means WTF it means world
telecommunication policy forum ah
something having to do with the itu and
they were like hey come out so he came
out sounds very very bureaucratic yeah
it kind of does so Terrans away he'll be
tossing to a couple of interviews later
on in the show but first something we
haven't done in a while a gift from a
fan Oh what we got a gift from a fan I
know oh yeah crazy all right I'll let
you open it cuz that's what we do here
yeah I'll open this and this is from one
he said I figured it's always good idea
to learn a new language so here's
labview yes it also works with arduino
'he's works with are doing it apparently
so holy cow that would make great
segment I remember seeing a lot of this
software back when i was working at NASA
oh my sis really interesting stuff got
some through there ya have to definitely
put this open okay that's like lamb we
got I think it might work on her blazer
dude we should totally try that yes I
don't know you do but we do have laser
here has all sorts of sensitives weaken
the sensors when you get on your head oh
i'll talk about the ax soon soon yeah
i'm gonna make you wait gonna make you
sweat I took you fool I don't think I
battery pack yeah yes nickel me me
alright anyway enough of that talk let's
go ahead and throw over to Darren who's
talking to stina about you be go you
guys know the Internet is something that
is near and dear to all of our hearts
and recently it was posted by Yuba code
that it may be at risk and we actually
have stina hear from you bacot Cena I
saw your blog post thank you for coming
down here why is the internet at risk
because we put everything in this
fantastic creation we put our personal
lives we put our corporations we put our
governments and what we do is that we be
secure this really sensitive information
I mean about our no personal lives our
companies and and things that you really
would not in the physical world you
would not have it you know you know what
you really wanted to have it secure in
the digital world you put a latch on the
door that can be easily kicked in now
that latch is the password so so
actually you'd mention the password
there was a huge article recently by
wired about the the war on passwords or
our passwords dead is that something
that we won't have in the future is that
the direction we're going password
static information including the legacy
username password and credit cards that
also use static information that
technology is dead we know that because
it's so easy to copy anything that is
that it can be copied and misused and so
what we need to do is to move to two
factor you need to have username or
actually we can replace you use me but
we need to have a password and we need
to have a vent occasion method that
generates secure time-based one-time
passcode that only works once and so I
wouldn't say password is dead because i
think you will always need something you
have in your head and something you have
in your hand or on your phone in order
to make it secure so i think about those
one-time passcode and they've been
adopted in like very large industry like
you know government in aerospace you'll
see the RSA tokens or only like really
big and innovative vendors like google
launched their their two-factor
authentication app for Android so what
what barriers do think it there are in
the actual adoption of those kind of one
time you know multi-factor
authentication mechanisms to actually
kind of secure like put better than a
latch yeah or digital I know the Google
Authenticator is great I think that
initiative really proves and it's
getting millions of users it's the
biggest deployment of two factor and
it's so much better than a standard
password you know the static password
however it sort of not really user
friendly you have won a key to one
account and something you have to retype
the code from a device to another device
and it's an app you have it on your
phone and we know with it new viruses
that come now that anything you put on
the phone is at risk and the same way
you put it on a computer so you don't
believe in the whole idea of doing this
in software unfortunately not it would
be nice I mean you could do 10 years ago
it was possible now we're seeing a new
generation security threats that
requires you to move out your sensitive
data from your phone or from your laptop
or from you know any device is connected
to the Internet to an external key and
so why do you think it needs to be an
external key why does it need to be a
physical device now there why couldn't
it be like integrated into the sim card
yeah it can be so i would say could be
in the sim card however then your
identity is tied to your phone and you
may want to have multiple identities and
you do have multiple identities you have
your work identity your private identity
your real identity in your blog identity
or a gamer identity there are there and
it's difficult it is one identity that's
tied to your phone so we currently we
actually have that right now in that you
know i do i've got my gamertag and it's
got one class word and then I've got my
bank and i use a much more secure
password but you talk about identity and
really what we're talking about is
moving that from like the device we're
just that one factor and into multi
factors and not tying it to specifically
like this is my
my phone so I am this on this device and
this is my tablet so I'm this on that
device yeah so the vision that we
outline is that you buy your key which
could be a ring it could be a card you
could be a wiki on 7-eleven or safeway
or amazon just like you buy a prepaid
phone card you take this card to your
home and you tie it to your bank account
to your gmail account to your gmail to
your gaming account anything online with
open identity standards one key could be
used on multiple authentication or
multiple multiple services without one
service having to hold the encryption
keys or control your identity so you
would be in total control of your
identity you would buy it own it and
control it and you could be anonymous
and secure so I think it's really
innovative when and a great step forward
what Google has done at least in
protecting my Google identity with their
authenticator app but I don't want to
have obviously a different app for every
different you know social network or
website that i use and there's already a
several different you know concepts for
open you know there's open ID there's
open Oh auth there's several of these
you know platforms for this none of them
have really taken off we've seen like
the open-source ones like you know open
ID and then we've seen like the past
failed efforts like passport how is your
vision different from this I think these
initiatives with open ID and sam'l and
open ID connect our great initiatives
and they all move in the same direction
it has to be open it has to be scalable
none of them are really taking the
security to a next level enabling
session security you're legally binding
signature is more of a single sign-on
convenience factor than the
high-security factor high security what
are you talking about what's this next
level because if the idea is you know I
type in my password i plug in my yubikey
or whatever it may be that does the
one-time password and then boom I'm into
the system now I man I don't need my
password or my key anymore i'm i'm
logged in right
I've got my session yes so there are 22
security threats that you know their
back-end that needs to be secured and
and with so with these existing
initiatives with a sam'l and open ID
they're depending on one service
providing that holds your credentials
and we all know we see that with RSA and
one of the most secure companies
supposed to they they could hacked and
15 million tokens were compromised so we
really need to look at system where you
don't have one single service provider
that holds credentials that holds
cryptographic secrets that's on the one
side and then on the user side we're
seeing a new generation threads but
actually where the one-time password
technology including Google
Authenticator is not going to be secure
enough a few years ahead and it's the
threats for session security and cookies
you know being hijacked you can actually
log in if you log into your bank account
with a secure token if it's not a
challenge-response interaction between
the token and the service you know
someone can hijack your identity and
start missing using it in real time just
after your login while you're in that
session so that's sort of we've seen
examples like that with like firesheep
you know it's like I've stolen your
session cookie now I'm you I didn't even
need your password you know this is very
much in the vein of what we've been
talking about a hack five recently in
that whose responsibility is it to
secure your data we're not just you know
your login your data all of those things
is it the service provider is it the
cloud service or is it you thinking
about replacing your outdated firewall
your gateway or your UTM wondering how
