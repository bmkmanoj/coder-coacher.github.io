lair that's the sound of shark makes
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by domain.com crashplan and go to assist
when a club my name is darren kitchen
I'm Shannon Morse it's your weekly dose
of technol us and I'm so excited about
my segment yes here it working you're
making a shark i'm making a shark the
sharknado oh no and it's not even shark
week on discovery but it is sharknado on
sci fi what's sure it's like a tornado
is a shark you know I don't watch TV I
mean I have no idea sci-fi movie oh okay
whatever you kids are doing these days
it's amazing you have to see it cool so
what do you update that these days i ear
on crutches in your home from pak-rat
across America I'm on a little bit of a
layover a hike across America getting
everything ready for Def Con and so
we're gonna be like killing it in Vegas
if you're in the Vegas area for defcon
whether you're going to the conference
or not we will be celebrating get this
our eighth year anniversary Wow yeah so
are we gonna have a party we should do
something 8-bit alright agree that was
so fun so I all I can say hey on google+
'as and the Twitter's and those things
so that we can let you know when the
things are happening but otherwise not
really sure exactly what we're gonna do
yet as far as the celebrations are
concerned but we will drink all the
business hack although that drink things
yes otherwise I oh remember did you see
the episode that aired last week or I
guess it was the one in before flashing
like ryno motors but yes yes electric
scape dude I rode that thing it's fun oh
my gosh it's so much fun yeah I was
writing it like in a cute little skirt
and I was going to town like in my
backyard it was so much fun there's
video of this somewhere listen uh it's a
lot of fun I highly encourage anybody
that is gated or not to turn to if they
ever have the opportunity to try such a
thing but keep in mind that there's two
modes there's low which I think it caps
at it like 15 and there's high its goes
to lie 25 I'm because I haven't
skateboarded since I was in high school
well it turns out in between low and
high there's what I like to call the
Wiggles own
and yeah you don't want to go there and
I went there and I I ate it so I'm quite
gimpy now and I'm having I I hope in
about a week Darren I pulled it down and
you know somebody mentioned this on
Twitter that I am NOT allowed to use
power tools and I guess powered
skateboards count as that out so it's
okay Darren yeah but I'm thinking about
putting some you know some some roller
skate wheels on this and promoters you
know what just electric touches hack all
the things okay just keep babies Craig's
just some LEDs okay I'll leave use is
fine uber tooth or something hack RF
yeah really this is a really good expire
great yagi antenna you know like I just
looked like a gimpy person but actually
I'm hacking yo I and that just became a
gift okay sorry about that umm so so
stay tuned let's get right into it and
and stay tuned for this because I'm
looking forward to getting our Sharky
abs goodness on so bill let's see we've
got this shot lined up here on this TV
set I'm just shooting this with what are
we shooting with here we are actually
taking the stream right from this camera
here SDI out for this professional
camera into our abenir mini this is the
latest version of our a venir series
which is smaller faster more capable and
we're ingesting i believe about SDI to
about four megabits through four
different cards one card being AT&amp;amp;T 3g
one be an AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE t-mobile card and
also a verizon LTE card so so let's step
back you're saying that the video signal
coming out of the camera over there is
coming into rejecting hd-sdi right okay
so we've got an HTTP coming into this
box but this isn't just going straight
over to the TV set over here rather
we're streaming online that is correct
we're actually we're actually using a
combination of technologies 3g 4g
bonding
and a Wi-Fi connection so the beauty of
this is when you're broadcasting abroad
and you have various technologies at
your disposal this will actually utilize
all the available broadcast technologies
allowing you to have more reliable
broadcasts more bandwidth for your
broadcasts and obviously overlapping
networks so you're peering and not not
just rely on relying on one source right
all right well soon as the device how
does this how does this guy work so as
we talked about earlier this is taking
an SD feed and right from this
professional grade camera here s cin you
also have the capability to do hdmi and
should you have a prosumer or consumer
brand camera this is being encoded
through our device here called the a
venir mini into our proprietary codec a
CTL 3 so how does a CTL 3 differ from
like industry standard codecs likely to
64 good question h.264 is a fine cuttack
but what we spent time developing is
codec that was designed for broadcasters
specifically offering more variables
over the broadcast color accuracy and we
just found that if we took the best
parts of h.264 and did our own
proprietary codec including our own
technology that we just had a more
robust more professional grade kodak for
broadcasters alright and so how does
just take the multiple sources in and
put it into such a way that you can
actually use this you know use any one
single stream is it is it load balancing
is it it is load balanced we call it we
call it multiplexing and we're
essentially using a protocol that we
developed call LD MP low delay multipath
technology and what that does is I won't
speak about it too much because its
proprietary but it allows us to bond 3g
and 4g carriers and to utilize that
entire scope of bandwidth to multiplex
meaning that we're
not relying on anyone stream at any
given time but actually utilizing all
four of those streams to maximize the
bandwidth and reliability so and so this
takes advantage of more than just 3g and
4g Modi's though I see we've got other
ports here what does this allow us to do
as far as connectivity the beauty of
this solution here is we multiplex not
only 3g and 4g but also Wi-Fi got a
Wi-Fi bud here so if you're traveling
abroad and you have 3g and 4g coverage
or if you want to work out of a van that
has a mobile hotspot connection already
included you can simply just put this in
Wi-Fi mode and utilize Wi-Fi bandwidth
you're not dependent upon anyone
technology also if you're indoors you
are very limited to your bandwidth or 2
3g or 4g coverage you can plug this into
your local lan like we have here and
utilize all your local land bandwidth as
well like example you have all cars
connected and there is also vs out
connected but Layton's human vs at is
seven hundred milliseconds so it's not
going on via sod it's going over 3g cars
LT cars because so fast so as soon as we
lose any LP cards it will switch to
satellite because there is no connection
and I won't have to think about right is
that now it's all automatically error
and it will sense latency it will sense
how much bandwidth you have and will
simultaneously central cars and if
suddenly cards disappear it will resend
pack it on other card that's cool what's
the challenges in getting multiple wins
to all sleep together it's the next box
but I hear ya all right right what was
inside yeah initially we have started
with Windows and Mac OS system but we
found that it does not offer you that
flexibility of Linux so we get poured
all our software on Linux inside there
is Linux and it's it's it does that on
very low level it's not using routing it
send packets directly to interface and
so this way we could dynamically sense
interface up or down the spec it arrived
around
because you have something on the other
end its reporting back right right right
yeah a control signal that this attorney
here's this here's what it's looking
like from each of my carriers basically
basically we know on each interface how
many packets be receiving back and what
is latency for each packet because in
broadcast what you're going for as
opposed to you know like like me as a
podcaster don't care if there's 10
second delay what I want is a you know
an HD fee but in broadcast if you're
doing an interview you really need like
what to sacto seconds licenses right so
and that's the beauty of the protocol is
that be guaranteed to second plate and
see if if some Network cannot deliver to
second place if you don't use it anymore
it goes out a path okay so it's always
always a totally and so what if none of
the networks will offer you to second
latency you just not deliver the stream
or you so yeah that's a good question
what happens is it's still trying to
send audio but video free frame bill
please register dropping video frame
right yeah and as soon as bend is up it
will recover this place right back on it
that's cool is there diminishing returns
when it comes to the how much friends
you buffer and what kind of legacy
you're willing to exams or is just the
more the better yeah more the better to
a degree what happen sometimes all
networks going down if you have the 20
seconds buffer you can actually fire
something else like Wi-Fi spot and it
will pick up right away without any
restart range it will switch to my fi
and streams to lowes you have the 20
seconds buffer is still plays back susan
within a 20 seconds if suddenly let's
start a capping on one of the murder
you have that amount of time to pick up
on another note right ready engineer or
drive an engineer because this does all
of that in the box right it gives if the
time it needs to connect to different
network is yeah and you're controlling
so all of this interface over the iPad
yeah this interface here you also ipod I
won't be on for advice because it's just
web interface is Wi-Fi yeah web
interface so you can so this has done
Wi-Fi how to connect to it and then you
can control to your browser correct
there are two Wi-Fi Wi-Fi cards actually
inside one is using for control and
other is high gain antennas to stream oh
I see so is that what these are these 15
this is additional so you ate itself you
serious ray domes okay that's where the
antennas are and there is one on the
back side so these are for the 3g and 4g
antennas each modem has two antenna
connectors because its industrial grade
in built models i see and so it was kind
of like a beamforming where it decides
right right antenna is best right it's
not beam forming foresight technology
but it picks picks up signal you know on
different imbalance and judy are these
antennas made for any particular because
ryan frequency because a you know
reviewing 18t is going to have a
different you know what are they on the
850 900 there 1720 150 2500 there's so
many different frequent pigments is
right are these antennas going to be
able to handle all of those different
ones yeah on verizon it's kinda a little
simpler it's mostly LTE on a TNT is low
frequency on LTE and high frequency on
3g so these antennas will specifically
optimized for key they will still pick
up signal and broken 3g but it's not a
strong that's why external antenna
provides much better flexibility because
it's much wider range of answers and
also international helps sometimes in
different countries is so different so
you always want to have that option of
external antenna actually connected well
let's see let's see it do some satellite
action okay sure i'll set up to begin
and i'll give that a right here dot nets
are globally known one of the most
popular top-level domains and they
instantly inject credibility so if you
already have a dot-com protect your
brand with a dotnet and if you don't

last week's trivia question was as of
April 2012 what 3d printer was the most
funded technology project on Kickstarter
of all the things and the answer was
printrbot now this week's question is
what Wi-Fi network scanning program was
created by meta geek LLC as an
alternative to netstumbler you can
answer that over at hak5 org slash
