by go daddy Squarespace and CES Chris
alright guys well we're live here at CES
for our live coverage of this absolutely
enormous event we want to thank NBC
Universal for taking the time to let us
invade their awesome booth here and also
everybody who's working behind the
scenes we got Paul and we've got Chris
on some steadicams
event we've done hackathons before we've
done the all-out bring everything we've
done that just bring one cam and this
was some moderation of both this is an
entirely different animal when you
really wait like you think all going to
CES and then you get here and you're
like I want to cry it's like Disneyland
without rides yeah there's that many
people yeah Disneyland for geeks man
it's insane so we got some awesome
products to be talking about today and
having fun doing the live show yeah I
yesterday during our marathon of trying
to find stuff that we were actually
gonna that would interest us and you
guys the viewers I came across these now
these these are views excite but they're
coming out with some new products and
the one similar to this is actually
going to have an 800 by 600 display
inside the eyeballs it looks like you're
looking at a 6-foot screen inside okay
so you put this thing on and you hook it
up and it's 3d as well I didn't mention
that it's tiny D and SD and you put this
on and it projects like a six foot image
that you look at so it's got like the 22
degree you know tilt thing offset so
that things actually look man 3d seems
to be a big trend here it's you got to
get it right though and that's a problem
that some people are having but these
guys did it and basically when you have
this on Darren you'd like to play flight
sense a love flight sim so you're
constantly bitching that you have to use
your hat to look around the cockpit that
being the little joystick Deeley on top
of your deck yeah this thing you can
look up down around its motion sensitive
and it will look around your tongue like
we're in the cockpit just how does it do
that
there are accelerometers inside oh so
it's not basic I don't have to put
anything on my monitor if I remember
these have been coming out since like
the 90s when VR was a catch phrase
remember that yeah I so wanted like a
pair of these like Sony I don't even
remember what it's called but yeah but I
remember like four grand or something
ridiculous like that and I totally
wanted them I don't know how many times
I almost broke down and like bought a
used one off eBay yeah
but they may come to a point a weird but
this these ones is just VGA and USB and
that's it okay so especially the Windows
Mac what's the deal they it is Windows
right now and they also have a bunch of
other products that you could use like
with your Xbox and stuff like that so
but the new ones coming out are the
1440s and they have an 800 by 600
resolution so a little bit crisper
inside the the actual image
it supports output of 1200 by are at
1600 1200 and just down sample yeah I
haven't really seen anything higher than
8 by 6 but if you guys have let us know
because I know that there's a ton of
these but they're so niche yeah yeah so
I mean you know what you should get a
pair of those for your World of Warcraft
addiction all right we're not gonna
bring that up right now
ok well you can put them on and we could
be me offset and CG like we did last
episode or are we done with that I think
we're done we're done we're very done
well you guys have heard of Super Talent
right the USB makers videogram and also
actually came to their company off me
super Challenger talented somehow I
don't I don't know about that now that's
funny anyway well I was I went up there
earlier today and I was talking to him
and I actually picked up the smallest
USB flash drive in the world all lists
so they say yeah smallest one and they
also do custom Bibles customizable ones
which I thought was really really cool
role of that they look nifty they got
ones that look like they're made out of
sort of this rubber type material and I
saw ones that were shaped like a chili I
saw one that was shaped like a little
hard drive USB stick exactly what we
were thinking one so they do some for
businesses and they sell these for
consumers and they're just the regular
price of any other USB flash drive I
talk to their people about their
manufacturing aside from having all
sorts of cute little USB drives I mean
they do custom molds and stuff so
talking about it he gave me some
ballparks it was basically about one to
five thousand dollars for the mold so as
your base for us just to get started I
know right and then that just depends on
how
colors and how complex it is how big it
is most of ones they were talking about
where no no bigger than a little fatty
iPod and after that like I was like what
like a batch of a thousand B that's when
it really comes down to like three or
four dollars a unit right so if you can
get over that I mean an addition sticker
shock those people probably don't want
to buy 5,000 of one item they probably
just want to do a one-off like 3d like
well if you're buying 4,000 one item
it's obviously for a specific purpose
yeah well I mean if we were to do that
we have you know evil server keychains
on the so smallest to gig or 16 there's
no closure it's actually just just just
what you need that's it I think move
exacta came back from Japan with some of
these recently that were yeah just as
small I don't think you can get any well
you got the chips and you get rid of
that yeah it's like it's like good
enough we're gonna have little US Bank
keys that will go inside your USB port
and you'll have to have like a plastic
caddy to pull them back out at one point
it just gets a little ridiculous well
that's what we're here at CES for true
ridiculous stuff did you bring it well
okay you guys know about Paul's problem
yes you guys know Paul our camera guy
you can go over to Paul the camera guy
calm now and get yourself Paul the
camera guy action figures and if he has
you upstairs in the hack house we all
have to share one every morning around
7:00 am-6 a.m. something
it's either NPR macbreak weekly this
week in tech mainly NPR he's behind a
camera like we're lying about it bounine
he's got one of these giant speaker
dailies right he starts in his room he's
like playing the intellect and the
financial marketing blah blah and then
walks into the shower leaves and then
cranks it
I don't know how he can get his like his
lather on with Leo Laporte telling about
the latest tech I just can't fathom that
all I know is if I hear Paul in the
bathroom I know I'm late for work
yes yes yes Elliot well you know we
could get rid of that that morning chime
if we got Paul a pair of these I know
seriously right this is audio bone it's
it's a different kind of headphone right
so it looks just like a normal pair of
headphones except these don't go on your
ears they go right here like on your
temple right well this is your temple
well okay fine but they go right here
right and they use an interesting piece
of technology called bone conduction
that actually translates the sound into
vibrations that it's kind of like do you
know that your bone jawbone the job on
Bluetooth headset yeah kinda like that
in Reverse right so instead of picking
it up as a microphone it's vibrating the
sounds into your skull and and taking
over your brain some way and but anyway
it's it's a pair of headphones that
delivers like 50 to 1,200 Hertz kind of
quality sound so it's all got like an
otterbox or something like that for his
iPod uh-huh that up tomorrow and and we
can get our music on and it's it's got
to be I've noticed that you really have
to have it pretty boost it up so I don't
know if there's like a little mini
preamp or something that we could get
for his iPhone you obviously look really
cool it's waterproof that's the biggest
thing I have a waterproof model there's
a waterproof model right so you could go
swimming with these guys and obviously
then he could be in the shower with
these you know driving us crazy in the
morning with the NPR's and the quit
spots yes we're working in solutions for
you yeah well you know the biggest
problem is actually so like I'm pissed
off that I was just woken up but then
I'm like oh this is weakened media
what's Alex Lindsey talking about and I
get into it and then he leaves I don't
know what now oh you gotta listen to now
I'm like
anyway I digress but that yeah so that
is audio bone these are talked to
manufacture these are actually available
right now I I'm pretty sure the price
point is 189 there abouts so they were
really I think about six months ago you
could probably find them maybe he just
did a quick google for audio bone its
ear free listening awesome so we were at
showstoppers last night yeah which is an
event kind of separate from CES but they
have a bunch of people and just kind of
demo set up and not such a crazy manner
and we walked into the door and there
was this very nice lady and she came up
and she handed us one of these little
acrylic 3d jicama dude it reminds model
of a what is that 4d cube a hypercube oh
yeah like I remember modeling stuff like
that in 3d studio well this is a 3d
acrylic and it's not glued together it
is actually a solid piece of acrylic
that was printed by a company called
shapeways okay and basically what you
what this is is it's a 3d acrylic and
what you can do is you can actually go
to their website it's just Shapeways
calm and they have a template maker
which you can use to create something
like this so if you're no good with 3d
modeling or anything like that
you can actually create dope-ass 3d like
printed modeling stuff with their
website template builder or if you are
good with 3d modeling you get to get
your little gnome on and you know upload
your own 3d image and they will print it
for you
Wow it's about I think that said it's
about four well we asked them for a
crazy quantity because we were thinking
about doing well that's the thing with
like the USB drive manufacturers that
make the customer like aah evil server
USB drives me the first thing we thought
to were like dude we want evil server
keychains or like I how much if we
wanted to print a thousand this isn't
what that's for if you
they've gotten a lot of business there's
people making like model trains out of
this and stuff like that let alone model
train parts and stuff for it like if
you're like one of those enthusiasts
where you need like the perfect on our
bench thing in the guy's hand or the
limitation is 20 inches by 20 inches by
15 inches okay so there is a limitation
on how big it's yeah that's like that
and it's only complex I mean between the
hybrids and so we want to thank Pete
from shapeways who explained to us
exactly how the technology works and
stuff like that and it seems like they
support a lot of different file formats
so if you're getting your Maya going if
you're doing 3d studio Lightwave stuff
like that
you should probably be able to export it
in a file format that then needs to be
happy with yeah so yeah you just go to
shapeways comm all the pricing and size
information that you guys need is right
there yeah that's it I want to make a
little companion cube basically a gold
family of campaign and cubes yes we
could do that Sam we'll put an extra
little evil server sure little mommy and
daddy companion cubes awesome 81 I won't
make them Chia Pets we'll put a little
stuff on them and dip them in the anyway
I would like that if you would I found
something else that Chris actually
showed this is some green technology
it's green technology I love green
technology I'm the person that walks
around at home picking up all the intima
empty bottles and yelling at the guys if
they don't recycle them hi-five live is
really just a session for us to bitch
about us being all roommates and we hope
you guys enjoy that really come for more
of that this is like this
this energy charger is this charger for
like your your cell phone and your iPod
your digital camera pretty much any of
those handheld devices that you always
have to charge up at night because they
always run out while you're walking
around or you're a hiker maybe you're an
outdoorsman who needs something like
this to witness our office
anything that's USB charge okay
pretty much anything like that so how
does this work all you have to do is
pretend like you're walking with this in
your backpack it has to be vertical like
this okay it can't be horse alright so
there's no batteries or anything it's
not just like a minty like plot some
trouble its charges to an elk walking it
works as you're moving up and down it
has this up-and-down movement and as you
can see this iPod you gotta go faster
because it's not there you go this iPod
that I'm charging up right now it's
charging this because I'm moving this
actually it from from what we were
reading and what we were told it's
actually just the human walk yeah he's
all it takes like running isn't gonna
get it any faster but a little bit a
little bit faster yeah but it's
optimized basically for the way that we
walk so you so you could just throw this
you know pop it in your backpack right
that that pocket would be perfect for
right if you've got an iPod or not an
iPad an iPhone like the latest 3G ones
that you can get about 15 minutes
talktime on them now is that what
they're up to I think it's something
like that yeah so you pop that in your
backpack and then you're on your way to
work and then you never run out of a
charge never like as long as you have
this thing in your backpack while you're
running around campus 5 volts power well
that's what USB is and up to five
hundred mill milliamps so mah mah
whatever so like anywhere from like a
hundred to like five hundred so and
that's the max five hundred so that's
gonna really lightweight it's not gonna
add a whole bunch of pounds here already
you're just going over yeah yeah you're
not gonna feel burdened carrying this
thing along you know trying to be green
it's it's actually yeah this is the same
technology that you see in those
flashlights that you have to like shake
up and stuff it's the exact same thing
except and wasn't when I first saw this
it was like why doesn't this exist
already and it does really happy about
this and the coolest thing
it's great for consumers coming out yes
it's coming up for six months and it's a
little bit over a hundred bucks so I
think that's pretty good investor
doesn't cause the kulaks they'll bring
and make sure that your Z is it's like
half an iPhone I'm always about going
green so you can check this out at Green
&amp;amp; Power calm and see what you see if you
like it sweet all right let's say okay
so we're at the sands and Paul found
something that just had me rofling and
all that fun stuff okay is and I've got
b-roll for it cuz we didn't get one here
this is called is the fast finger
keyboard okay it's um fast finger
keyboards calm and basically you take a
look at it and b-roll it's a hunting
pack a keyboard for one finger typist
right it's optimized for noobs okay so
basically yeah the letters are arranged
in ABCD efg so it makes it very easy to
okay sees at the end of the alphabet so
high-vis is going to be at the at the
bottom of course blocks
now is there a mode that you can switch
eyes see the button yeah I guess if you
really wanted to go back to quit see
it's a learning keyboard yeah we know
the best part about it is it's got a key
that says WWE you press that and it's
yes it does it's it's the proverbial
long key in fact it may be deeper for
the little lol action on one I
understand about it's like a main
keyboard I understand about things being
convenient yes okay I get it I don't
want to blah blah blah blah blah but
really WWWE listen this is for pure
ownage kids right the low fall tag
lolled newfag loyal kids I'm sorry no
and everyone I love pure ins you guys
know that but unbelievable anyway who's
that up there okay
and you've gotten cry ham I have a
really interesting product here this
product is called the quick key it looks
like a credit card swiper
pretty much all right the quickie is
basically an encrypted what's up I was
like I was about to pull up I will bucks
and then I'm like Ritchie here's my loss
basically what it is is it's a mini
encryption device that syncs up with
quick keys website and basically as soon
as you swipe their card here that they
provide you a card and you provide your
master password before you know
two-factor security app okay and
basically what it does is it logs in to
their system at wherever data center
their app and as soon as you swipe
things like a credit card or you know
anything else
it comes encrypted out of the USB cable
so it's not like I know you could do USB
sniffing or anything like that it's a
fun stuff it's encrypted right out of
this device okay
do you know anything Christian like what
kind I don't know the specifics of the
encryption on a here but all the data is
sent encrypted to their servers and then
authenticated back down to you so you
install their application they have like
plug-ins for Firefox and things like
that and what you could do is set up
your favorite you know websites and
everything is synced across multiple
computers so you are on your laptop
you're on your desktop you have the same
set of bookmarks that you have anywhere
else but the nice thing about it is it's
it's password storage that's it's secure
okay so the like one pass yeah so you
swipe your thing and you can tell it to
fill in your username and password and
then also when you swipe if you're gonna
like shop online and you do a quick
swipe of your card lets automatically
fill in all your information so it's
like it's like Amazon's one click to a
lot of other websites yes like it all
right and I saw just just left thing
here and again I don't have it here
we'll have to see in b-roll but
basically this thing is a it's a USB
Ethernet dongle from Sun rich technology
that's actually the manufacturer
and from what I understand they have
some some people that are bringing it to
market now so you should expect it in
about six months or so okay to hit the
street but they make a whole bunch of
USB devices that allow you to plug in
them into Ethernet they also have
parallel and serial over Ethernet it's
basically have you seen HDMI over
Ethernet yes okay this is the same
concept except what we could do is say
like we could plug that webcam into our
into our little adapter here right plug
it into our Ethernet put it on our
switch right because see like we've got
an inconvenient place I want to add a
third camera to the HACC house like in
the kitchen right so we don't have to
put a computer up there we just put it
on the network then on another computer
we install windows only there's software
that finds it on the network all right
just like some Mac's can Deeley right
finds this guy and basically Matt's that
is a virtual port so then you install
your like logitech webcam drivers
whatever what have you and and your
computer as far as its concerned is
plugged in directly to the device but
it's gone through your switch oh it's a
little so basically another reason that
you could use this is I'm out of USB
ports at home I wouldn't use it for that
jit he's just gonna USB hub honestly
this is for putting it in weird
locations as well with that Jesus at
least that's the way I see it so I got a
couple of gripes with it though it
maximum 100 megabit hello gigabit so
that could be I'm just saying that could
be like a big determining factor for you
because when I saw it I was thinking
dude let's add another camera use one of
these guys because the wind just routed
through the network closet but if it's
doesn't work they really need a gigabit
and no you know no no we have a gigabit
network so our switch does auto-sensing
I'm used to slow this is why he's on the
show smart one
pretty one just saying that's how we do
this here somebody's getting some
noogies later all right
before we get out of here I do want to
thank profusely both our sponsors and
NBC for letting us invade thank you yes
we are we are here in the NBC Universal
stage if you will yep and rockin CES oh
thank them gotta say all right yeah a
little bit more studio space a little
bit I don't think it's possible for us
to have any to ask for anything less NBC
we can couldn't thank you have enough we
also want to thank Squarespace you can
go to ww-wait comm slash hack five to
get your awesome website building action
on use coupon code hak5 to get 10% off
the life of your of your service with
them plans start at $8 a month it's a
website building application that's so
different than anything you've ever
tried I mean blogs like WordPress are
great don't get me wrong I love new
stuff that WordPress is doing but that's
like a traditional front-end back-end
system right right
this is like web 3.0 I think I just made
some web 2.0 company die by saying that
but basically instead of the backend of
being something that you log into and
then there's a bunch of forms that you
fill out to create a post and you hit
submit and then you see what it really
looks like then you go back and you
you're like I need weeks and you back
and forth right the backend is in the
front it's like totally it so you click
a button and then your website just kind
of moves around like you can drag things
around like how you want them and you
see it in real time exactly how you want
your website to be so I think it's
awesome we're using it on our hack 5 LAN
party page and you can check out
