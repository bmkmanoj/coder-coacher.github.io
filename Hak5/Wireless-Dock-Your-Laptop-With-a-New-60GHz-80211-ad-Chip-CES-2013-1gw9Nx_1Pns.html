go further for hak5 I'm Darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 checking out the latest
in wireless docking are you Jorge
so Wireless talking this is kind of the
new technology explain to me what is it
in this in this technology that allows
us to be able to what extend our display
or our UI o or USB everything so this is
a new technology it's called a tow 2.11
ad can run up to 5 megabits per second
and basically we are connecting the
computer to that have and everything is
done wirelessly so basically all the i/o
on the computer can be connected on the
half and they wirelessly connect the hub
into the computer that is so cool
tell me what you guys have velocity has
teamed up with qualcomm atheros you guys
put together some chips here what is it
about this chip that allows us to do
that with our docking station over here
so basically what we do is we have a one
module that has the 11 n or 11 AC and
the 11 ad technology in the same module
so basically you can work at 2.45 and 60
gigahertz so for this docking solution
we are using the 60 gigahertz the five
gigabits per second and of course for
other other oil solutions we are using
just regular Wi-Fi so our audience is
probably very familiar with attitude and
11 B G and a C tell us about ad if
they're not familiar with the 60
gigahertz stuff what are kind of the
throughputs the the caveats that we have
in that case and things of that nature
so a total of 11 ad is the first time
that we move to a new frequency band so
instead of using 2 point 4 &amp;amp; 5 we moved
to 60 now the bandwidth that we have in
60 is much much higher so instead of 20
40 or even 80 megahertz we are talking
about two point one point seven
gigahertz so then the throughput of
course goes
way way over what you can get in two
point four or five the spec itself the
protocol is pretty much it's very
similar it's not the same but it's
similar there are some changes at the
Mach level but it's pretty much
comparable so with over a Giga her of
bandwidth in the 60 megahertz spectrum
what kind of throughput can we expect to
do do you know what kind of the you know
the regulations are on the the wattage
that we can actually use with this and
what kind of range we can expect so we
are talking about in the first
generation almost five gigabits per
second this pack gets up to almost seven
gigabits per second in terms of output
power you can get 243 DBM ERP it's like
20 watts so I think it's more than
enough in terms of range the higher you
go in frequency so walls will become a
blockage for the signal so that's why we
call will usually talk about in room
coverage but in terms of range you can
get to 30 even 50 meters without any
problem but as long as you have you are
inside the same room so you say that
things change on the mac level but for
the most part is just just not an
extension of the existing AI Tripoli's
8o 2.11 spec do we see the same kinds of
things when it comes to you know
management frames and control frames and
things of that nature yeah the main the
main change I would say is that when you
go to higher frequencies the antennas go
much much slow small er so that allows
us to use an array of antennas so in
order to overcome that physical
challenges that 60 gigahertz impose we
are using beamforming so we are able to
steer the beam and overcome obstacles by
just reflecting into walls or ceiling or
anything else so there is a piece of the
protocol that is related to beam forming
how to do the training how to track the
other side etc that this is kind of new
and it's the multiplexing technology
kind of the same stuff that we've seen
in the last two generations of Wi-Fi the
orthogonal frequency stuff yeah so there
are two mold same as what it was 11
be so you have single career mode there
is an OFDM mode and it's up to the
implementation of the the different
chipsets so let's talk about the
implementation because what I find
fascinating about this is okay so you've
got a set up here with this new Dell
Latitude that's launching today and and
you've got a wirelessly synced with your
reference design hub over here what is
it that the operating system is going to
need to know in order to work with this
technology so in this case we are
talking about the Wallace bus extension
this is pretty much Wireless PCI Express
so the system is connecting to a bunch
of controllers that are on the other
side we don't need anything as long as
the OS supports PCI Express we appear to
the system as a PCI Express switch
anyways that supports PCI Express has a
PCI Express switch driver bridges driver
so we don't need anything we do have our
own driver just for management to
establish the connection to check debug
to configure the cards of course but for
the data transfer it's completely
agnostic we just use so it will work on
Linux it will work on Mac OS it will
work for some windows etc so that's
exactly what's gonna ask if this is in
fact just an extension of my existing
bus and the operating system is none the
wiser obviously it needs to be able to
speak to that bus traditionally a
thorough store now qualcomm atheros has
been very supportive of the open source
community with velocity now part of the
picture is that going to continue and
you have the same kind of abilities as
you do with previous generations of like
atheros gear you know your your 980 h5k
a th 9k gear where you can do the
promiscuous mode and all of those other
fun things with Wi-Fi does that change
when we start getting into 802 11 ad no
it doesn't change there are two modes of
operations for these chipset one is the
Wallace bus extension that it's the
Wallace PCI Express the other one is
networking it's Wi-Fi over 60 gigahertz
and for that case the drivers are
already in the mainstream Linux
community so ever anybody can go there
and look what's going on there that
would be awesome I can't wait to get my
land party action on
little 802 911 ad where can I find this
as a consumer am I just gonna have to
wait for this to be embedded in my
device or can I actually pick this up
off the shelf so right now these are
going into computers we are working with
a couple of ODMs in Taiwan that they are
basically fabricating these these boards
I don't think that right now there are
available in digital or any of those
places I assume it will be shortly
available there also so this is so great
thank you so much for hey I really
appreciate it
we continued coverage of all things CES
2013 be sure to head over to revision
three.com NPR has a great public radio
app that is compatible with Ford SYNC
athlete this means that when you're in
your car and you're on the go and you
don't want to touch your phone you don't
have to you have all your favorite
playlists all your favorite NPR shows
right on your phone ready for voice
commands hourly news I'm Louis Giovanni
house Republican leaders are challenged
though if you want to listen to your
favorite shows like morning Edison and
all things considered you just have them
right there in your new Ford car thank
you again to Ford for sponsoring this
