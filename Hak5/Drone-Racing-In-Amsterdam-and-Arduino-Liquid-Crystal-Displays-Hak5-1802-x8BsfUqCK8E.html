by domain.com hey everybody and welcome
to this episode of hack 5 this is your
weekly dose of Technol us and my name is
Shannon Morse welcome to season 18 you
may notice that there is no Darrin
kitchen over here Darrin where are you
maybe he's hiding in the warehouse okay
maybe he's not he's actually still over
in Europe hack across Europe calm that's
where you can find all sorts of
information about what he's been doing
and where he's gonna be traveling to
he's actually having a meet-up coming up
on February 27th I believe yes so this
Friday you can catch him over in Dublin
go over to hack across Europe calm to
find out about that and to sign up so
they know how many people are going to
be RSVP so he's having tons of tons of
fun he'll be back pretty soon I believe
in like two weeks or so so he'll be back
on set with me in just a few moments but
first off I'm gonna go ahead and cut
over to him for his segment because he's
doing lots of really really fun stuff
with fpv zan drones so let's go ahead
and check it out what what hey so get
this we are in Amsterdam we're at the
Technic hackers space and what would be
better I'm so excited to do some fpv
racing have you a lot of experience for
this yeah I've got some a few experience
but actually not racing experience well
your first time racing okay me too yeah
I only just met the bay area TV racers
and I haven't even had a chance to
really like get too much into like I do
know that we've got awesome air game
here and bunnies and I mean what could
go wrong right nothing except your craft
I think you've got me on on a couple of
issues here first of all you're using
fifty thirty props so you're generating
a ton of thrust and what are these like
1,300 kV motors
2,300 okay so you're generating a hunnit
for us considering up at 13-under kv
mode your 20s
okay what's your all up wait oh yeah I'm
like 300 that's with the Mobius yeah
we're both rocking Mobius so we can both
record so we'll have great footage and I
say we just fly yeah cool all right
he's also going on the frickin he's got
me on the remote because it speaks to
him so how are you liking the Tran us
because that uses the open-source CX
open - yeah the Devo 7e it also has an
open-source deviation firmware on it but
I'm getting not merely I don't have it
look at the the size of those anyway
here we go we've got a TV monitor for
you sub so you can see through that and
I'm just gonna power up these fat charts
the more race the video interference
because as soon as I plug my name I've
got a problem if my video transmitter
and will overheat in like 10 seconds
what so if I plug it in I have to fly
immediately okay oh that's that's an
interesting yeah it's interesting thing
it didn't used to do that but now
suddenly just overheats and yeah after
all this crash you
that's my house my wife is home you can
see
they're careful with those branches yeah
we feel the branches and I'm like oh
yeah yeah okay that's uh yeah because
the trees yeah I think yeah well that's
the thing they're they're trying to race
around the trees yeah you've done an
obstacle kind of I guess and there's
still things
oh yeah
oh you don't hate pits were so terrible
I just could barely take off it was a
little hole okay something referring to
stock sort of like
setting floated
are you sad oh no so the good news is I
brought spare a complete spare frame set
so it's just a matter where it goes too
far forward and so then it picks up by
going too far backwards and then just
repeats itself over and over so if he
lessons it it gets squishy
and that's not good you want it to be
just on the edge where it's kind of
tight yeah so is this yeah it's okay
I have a spare as long as the motors are
okay that's the biggest concern oh yeah
there we go
oh whoa are you kidding you fly with
that what are you kidding duh you're
gonna whomp me look how fast dude you
can get that thing damn near vertical
holy crap okay well
that's very nice that's nice and smooth
yep yep work so it's fine I just need to
fix this which is okay because I have a
spare back up and running I'm afraid I'm
gonna get dusted oh yeah this is so much
more agile agile okay go
where are you okay you okay you want to
unplug something now you guys should
both be in the air here and fly from
here yeah yep look look here she does
this full fly around - that's probably a
better one oh so damn pose
keyboard keyboard and yo-yo
I'm so much for flying over to water
yeah I'm so much difficult I know
journey
yeah turning and I've actually the
problem that I'm having is like slowing
down coming in yeah I'm like okay
because this is where people are and I'm
like you go get with him yeah take a cup
of tea
oh I just call you job
yours is quiet yeah that's why I brought
this one because it doesn't upset people
the fifty thirties I have a club with
fifty thirties and then I just do that
right out of the sky you guys suck
careful getting close to each other
alright
he's happily behind you almost
nice save
yeah
oh shit I'm missing a few props in there
I mean you're missing a problem oh shit
yeah here and there this is not fixable
just front react spaceman I got another
one
shit I flutes you hi hi wrench
okay so Thomas I'm not sure who I can
call the winner considering you just
about lapped me yeah and then you
crashed well that was like what a good
six laps of you just like being five
seconds out of me six seconds out of me
seven seconds ahead of me until boom but
then again I failed in just the the
trials breaking a arm so you've only
lost props that was so much fun f1 car
yeah I need you know I needs to be in

I am back over here on the hak5 set I
really wish I was over there racing
drones with Darren because that looks
like so much fun but I'm actually having
a lot of fun myself with my Arduino
again this week now you may notice if
you can see it here on set let me go
ahead and show you guys uh I have a
little LCD on here yeah that's called a
liquid crystal display so you can see it
says hak5 FTW with a little heart
because it's you know frickin adorable
so why not so I decided to have some fun
with liquid crystal displays so this is
a standard one that you can buy
it's an alphanumeric LCD display the
size of it is sixteen by two so sixteen
characters across and two columns the
LCD display is compatible with hitachi
hd44780 so this is the one that I'm
using for my Arduino because Arduino is
automatically able to figure out how to
transition data over to this type of LCD
and I'll have that in the show notes so
you know exactly what kind of musing so
this one basically has sixteen different
pins on the top if we take another look
at it you'll notice up at the top and
I'll do another close-up picture so you
can actually see all these I had to
solder on a whole bunch of little wires
to this and then connect it to my
breadboard each of these little 16 dots
that you see up here that I soldered
they all do something different so the
first one way over on this side it's
called VSS so that one's just ground and
then you have VDD next to that and that
stands for five volts so of course it's
a five volt supply vo next to that
allows you to control the contrast of
the screen with a pot or potentiate
potentiometer so for example with mine
if I turn it down it just looks like a
blue screen so it's pretty boring and
then if I turn it back up now you have
all my different characters across here
all the different bits of data are
completely highlighted so it doesn't
really look very fun if I turn it down
about halfway you see that it says hack
five FTW with the little heart at the
bottom so pretty cool that I can do that
with a potentiometer so now RS is the
next pin next to that that'll do
register select so that basically means
you can
commands or different characters to the
LC clearing the display or setting the
cursor somewhere on the screen would
also be data so that's run through the
same pin next up is printing text that
would be characters of course RW is the
pin next to that that you'll see that
means that it's going to just read data
from the LCD or write to the LCD so you
can actually read data from the LCD
that's kind of interesting hmm I wonder
what we would do with that hmm next up
of course you have e e''z for enable
this pin allows the arduino to see if
there are other pins that are being used
and then it does the correct command
based on whether they are high or on or
low or aka off now d0 through d7 so
that's the next eight pins that you're
going to see this is eight pin parallel
data ports so all of those eight
different ones you can actually use for
your parallel data ports so aka if you
think about it eight pieces of data that
would be ones and zeros with computer
speak aka ASCII art Hey so ASCII is all
the different alphanumeric characters
that we can use each one being a letter
or a number ha ha now it makes all sorts
of sense and then of course the last two
pins on there a and K so that's anode
and cathode for the LED backlight of the
LCD screen so those are going to be able
to light it up or just turn it off
entirely okay now that we've gone
through that part whoo-hoo fun times
everything you want to write to the
screen can be done with the Arduino IDE
they have everything already
pre-installed for you so next up of
course we have my schematic you see a
bunch of wires on here going all over
the different place there's a ton on
here I'll go through those and I'll do a
couple of close-up photos so you can see
exactly where I put them all but
basically VSS over way over on the side
the first pin that's connected to ground
VDD is connected to positive positive on
my breadboard is run over to 5 volts
vo goes to my middle pin on the
potentiometer so it goes over here and
then our W goes to ground II so enable
pin goes to pin 11 on my Arduino so that
goes over here right there pin 11 and
then you have D fourth
d7 those are connected to pens five four
three and two over here
anode is connected to positive over here
and cathode is connected to ground and
then my potentiometer over there that's
connected on one side to positive and
the other side to ground and then ground
of course on the breadboard is connected
to ground on my Arduino because well it
needs to be grounded doesn't it now my
LCD screen had to be soldered as well
with the sixteen different wires that
thing is called a pin header strip so
that's what I was including with my LCD
screen so that way it gives me the
perfect connection between the pins and
my breadboard so very very important
basically if I didn't solder it it was
gonna flash on and off because it wasn't
able to get that perfect connection now
we have D 3 and D 0 so you might be
wondering why I didn't connect those
pins the reason I didn't connect those
is because I'm operating the LCD in
4-bit mode so instead of sending 8-bit
commands for character values
instantaneously I send it in to half
bytes or a nibble so this saves the
extra i/o pins for other things that I
might want to do with those pins later
on and I'm gonna control all of this
with an Arduino super super fun so let's
get into my code I actually have it
pulled up on my computer here we go
so first up at the very very top I do
want to mention that if you go into
sketch and you want to import a library
down here is liquid crystal so the
liquid crystal library is basically
what's going to tell the Arduino that it
can speak to the LCD so it includes all
the information that the Arduino needs
to be able to compile characters and
numbers onto the LCD so you don't have
to memorize it all yeah it makes it
crazy crazy easy so you always want to
include liquid crystal H so that library
up at the top next step I also wanted to
mention that there's some examples down
here if you go to a liquid crystal and
this is where I got a lot of my
information and learned how to do this
is from all these different examples so
I definitely suggest going through those
and learning about all them all of them
so you know how to use it
so now we're going to initialize the
library with the
face pins so this is going to include 12
and 11 and then my deep in so 5 4 3 and
2 on the Arduino under there I'm doing
something kind of fun this is actually
creating a custom character so the way
that I figured out how to do this was
through this website so it's Mike Mikey
an see Mikey and see something like that
comm he made this LCD character script
where you basically just create what
kind of character you wanna make so I'll
make a little smiley face click it there
then oh this is so much easier with a
touchscreen there we go so when you
create your characters on or off so on
being the dark ones it's going to give
you the code right over here so you can
actually copy that code straight over to
your Arduino IDE and be able to use it
so I created a heart so it's bite heart
and then eight for the eight different
lines and then these are the different
lines so the top one is completely off
the next one has two on bits so one
there and one there
the next line under the meat that is
completely on another completely on just
the middle ones on and then just the
very center one on the rest of them are
zeros I'm sorry about that there we go
so the rest of them are just zeros at
the very bottom and then I close off
that script underneath that we go ahead
and set up everything that we want to go
so first off we need to name off what
our columns and rows are so this is in
sixteen by two LCD screen so I have 16
characters by two different rows now
we're printing a message to the LCD so
this is automatically going to print on
the first line if I want it to set to
the second line automatically I'll need
to add an additional code above that but
if you don't it'll just print to the
first line also if you want to you can
include a line that just lets it clear
out and that would be print clear I
believe LCD bring clear I'll have to
look it up I don't remember exactly but
we're gonna just print and we can let it
say whatever we want and we're also
going to notice that even though this is
a kind of a special character it's
included in that
Munir alphanumeric alphabet so you'll
see it show up on my LCD screen right
there
so LCD print hak5 FTW with an
exclamation at the end and then we're
going to print the heart that I created
up at the top so to do this you want to
use this special library called create
car
CH AR this is going to be a 1 so one
character or one line and then heart and
heart is the name of my bite right there
right heart 8 after that we want to set
the cursor to 0 1 so that is going to be
line 0 and then line 1 so this is
basically telling it that it's going to
put the cursor on the second row as
opposed to the first row and then we
write 1 1 being the heart all right
so if all goes well once you initialize
and upload this and you'll notice down
here there's nothing in the loop but I
also included it because if you don't
it's gonna cause errors so after I go
ahead and upload this to the Arduino it
shows me hack 5 FTW with the little
heart at the bottom
now that we've already done that I also
wanted to mention that yeah this is
pretty simple there's not too much going
on on my screen but there's a lot that
you can learn from this too I could make
my hearts go out all the way across the
line or I could make a little person
dance on the screen that was one of the
examples that Arduino shows I could make
the text scroll across the screen if I
went to or I can just make a whole bunch
of different special characters another
example I saw was making it increase in
second so it would count up on the
screen depending on how long the screen
has been on so it would include every
single second from line zero so there's
a lot that you can do with an LCD not
just you know print out one line of code
and just let it be but you can create a
loop so you can have a lot of fun with
it
so this is one of the more interesting
things I've done other than the cylon
which was probably my favorite I had a
lot of fun with the LCD I hope you did
too
learning about it I know I did of course
I'm sure that there's tons that I wasn't
able to research and a little bit of
time that I had
set up the segment so you know
definitely email me with your feedback
feedback at hak5 org and we'll be right
back
coming up on tanked things Shannon's
others show what's in the box we got a
secret package from Motorola arriving
6:00 a.m. on Wednesday plus we got an
idea from a viewer about a better $200
PC
this one's upgradable plus we're going
to talk about audio gear that doesn't
crush your wallet all that more coming
up on tech thing this week well that
about wraps up this episode of hack 5 I
hope you loved it I know I did I had a
ton of fun with my segment I loved
watching their in segments too which is
kind of a first don't tell him I said
that but first off I want to end with
trivia so last week's trivia question
was in which decade did the first
transatlantic radio broadcast occur and
the answer was the 1900s and this week's
trivia question is who is largely
responsible for breaking the German
Enigma codes and for creating a test
that provided a foundation for
artificial intelligence that guy sounds
kind of cool
you can answer that over at hak5 org
slash trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack 5 goodies and of course
again if you guys want to if you want to
check out what Darren's doing over in
Europe go to hack across Europe calm for
all the trip announcements events
updates and everything else all the
meetups like the one in Dublin of course
also we value your feedback so email us
feedback at hack 5 org let us know what
you think of this show and what you
would like us to cover in the future
hack 5 dot org slash follow to find out
everything we're doing over on all of
our different social networks like
Twitter and whatnot and hack shop HEK
shop comm that's where you can support
us directly with everything that we're
doing here that's how we were able to
move into the Square house and grow our
show from the ground up so we appreciate
everyone who has supported us throughout
the years and with that I think I'm done
here I'm gonna go hang out and figure
out what else I want to talk about on
the show I'm Shannon Morse
that's Darrin kitchen wherever is over
in Europe thousands of miles away we
miss you and of course we're reminding
you to trust your Technol us see you
next week
that
that about wraps up this week I was like
which show am I on I wasn't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
