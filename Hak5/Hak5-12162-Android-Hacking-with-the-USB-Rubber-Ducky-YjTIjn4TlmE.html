by domain.com so i found this really
useful blog online called up Ubuntu and
it has a whole bunch of useful
information for a boon to users and here
are some really handy features that you
can use to speed up older versions of
the OS or older computers that have
older versions of Ubuntu on them the
first one is daemon now this is a daemon
called pre load its stores commonly used
apps in the background in a cache so
that they can be called up quickly with
faster load times it monitors
applications that users run and by
analyzing this data it fetches those
binaries and their dependencies in the
memory into memory for faster startup
times to install this of course it's
really easy sudo apt-get install and now
once you have that installed if preloads
default settings are really good but if
you want to update those we also have a
link to the upper blue tube blog in the
show notes so you can go through those
directions it's pretty easy to do the
next one is Auto clean it you can auto
clean your app cache with this command
it's sudo apt-get
auto clean now what this is going to do
is clean up all of the old files that
are in your apt cache now why does it do
this old package downloads store caches
in the apt and this cache will grow over
time this is going to take up tons of
space and it's going to slow down your
computer overtime as well you can also
use sudo apt-get clean to clean up all
of your cache entirely now one of the
other things you can do is disable some
of the startup applications this one's
really easy you just go into unity - or
you install the boot up manager to
disable all sorts of services so if I go
in here
and I look for startup applications so
I'm not running many things in here at
this moment but if I were I could choose
one pretty much anything in here and I
could add remove or edit its startup as
a startup program the next thing you can
do is check your used SWA penis space
now this is over in for example all you
have to do is cat processes system VM
and then look for sloppiness and it
tells me that I'm currently at 60 now
this parameter controls all the
processes that are moving from physical
memory to a swap disk because disks are
a lot slower than Ram this can lead to a
really slow machine the default value of
course is 60 and to change it all you
have to do is edit this particular file
now in this file you're going to look
for a line that says V MDOT soir penis
equals and then you can change it to
something like 10 so I'll look through
here real quick
now if you notice that it's not in here
you can also add the line and then just
put in V m dot soir penis equals 10 as
well after that you just have to save
your file and exit and you're good to go
now why do we do this changes are going
to take effect once you reboot the
system and the higher the value the more
the system is going to swap the values
are between 0 and 100 so if you choose
100 the kernel will always find inactive
memory pages and swap them out so next
off you can turn off hibernation with a
really simple command its sudo G edit /
et Cie /
resume and once you edit this file you
can comment out the line that says
resume equals UUID equals start start
start start by adding just a simple
pound at the end or at the beginning and
then you just save and you reboot next
up disable grub 2 now this might sound
kind of weird but follow with me so
disable the boot menu by add editing the
file called pseudo G that's it
gosh Grubb and then you want to search
for Grubb underscore timeout equals zero
and you want to make sure that you
change this to zero now you can hold
down the shift key while we're booting
to show the grub2 menu if you need neat
need be
since Grubb loads its configurations
that start up it can be a little slow
when your machine is first starting up
so hence why you want to maybe close it
next off you can optimize a PC with low
ram by using z Ram which creates a kind
of compress block device mimicking a
swap disk but compressed and stored in
memory to reduce the disk thrashing all
you have to do is run these simple
commands all about the commands
so you're gonna add a repository PPA SH
not SIL Z Ram let's go ahead and add
that enter to continue of course and
this is going to take a moment to do it
and then after that you're going to put
in sudo apt-get
update to update the app get
and give this a moment to run
once that's done type in sudo apt-get
install Z Ram enabler ZM swap enabler
and as you can see I already installed
it on this machine that's it
it'll run in the background and will
make sure that all your memory is faster
next up remove those visual effects
using comp is compiz config settings
manager now you can get this by just
typing in sudo apt-get of course install
compiz config settings manager and once
you have that you can start it now and
head over to the effects section and
then disable all the enabled effects to
do that just go into your dash and look
for compiz settings manager and it's
going to bring up a nice big list of all
sorts of different things in here so
there's a lot of customization that you
can do and I can turn off all these
crazy effects that I have going on
animations and whatnot once you're done
just close and you're good to go very
easy one next up use the system Ram for
the temp readwrite operations to do this
put in sudo edit G edit et CFS tab at
the very end of the file you're going to
add two different lines
so the first one's going to be temp FS
backslash TMP TMP FS and after that
defaults no exact no Sui D 0 0 so what
this is going to do is move all those
temporary files over to RAM and
hopefully make your computer much faster
and last stuff but definitely not least
changing your desktop environment
there's tons of really fast ones out
there there's xfce of course I'm sure a
lot of you guys already use that one
gnome KDE one of Daren's favorites LXDE
another one you could also use something
like Pantheon I've never personally used
Pantheon but you know who knows it might
be pretty useful and you can also use
cinnamon desktop environment another one
that I've never actually used myself
well if you guys have ideas on how to
make my old PC a little bit faster with
Ubuntu I'm gonna reinstall a boon to of
course but I want to find out from you
guys what you do every day to make sure
that your PC is running a top notch even
if it's you know two three four years
old you can always email me feedback at

domain.com time was again for the
Technosphere oh of the week this week's
photo is from fox nakamori he shares his
hack top and his land tap with us and
those are pretty awesome I gotta say I
love seeing the land taps I'm always
like yeah whooo soldering skills yeah a
professional yeah Jason's got a guy
soldering iron where he says that I got
to get him on here chosen cool stuff off
but basically it's like it senses the
density of the metal and based on that
chooses the heat like it's cool so if I
put it on my skin would it still burn me
and you like you want to try it and I'm
like well you know I am Darrin yeah it's
true always break your pinkie or
something all right well if you guys
have photos you can always share them
over at feedback at hack 5 org just put
in the subject line tech no less photo
we should have like a what is it called
an Instagram hashtag or something
because Instagram is somebody else's
network and then all of its content is
owned in the thing but you know
Instagram email though open-open no
turnkey service on email okay anyway yes
so trivia trivia trivia so last week's
trivia question was can a z68
motherboard run two GPUs in sli mode
Nvidia or crossfire X mode for AMD if -
x16 physical slots are built onto the
board and the answer is yes but haha
trick question
but the two cards will run in dual 8x
mode so there you go
I wonder if anybody actually got that
one right man I feel so much smarter now
that I know that I know it's like this
week's question is early CGA color
graphics adapters displays gave the user
what kind of two graphics choices I know
this one
yeah I know this all I mean I was so
envious cuz I had a monochrome on my PC
XT and my friend had a PC 80 with a CGA
display and then and then things got
