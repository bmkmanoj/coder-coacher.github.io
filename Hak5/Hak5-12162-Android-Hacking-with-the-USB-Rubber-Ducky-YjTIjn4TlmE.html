by domain.com so I found this really
useful blog online called up ubuntu and
it has a whole bunch of useful
information for boon to users and here
are some really handy features that you
can use to speed up older versions of
the OS or older computers that have
older versions of ubuntu on them the
first one is damon now this is a demon
called preload its stores commonly used
apps in the background in a cache so
that they can be called up quickly with
faster load times it monitors
applications that users run and by
analyzing this data it fetches those
binaries and their dependencies in the
memory into memory for faster startup
times to install this of course it's
really easy sudo apt-get install and now
once you have that installed it preloads
default settings are really good but if
you want to update those we also have a
link to the up a boom tube blog in the
show notes so you can go through those
directions it's pretty easy to do the
next one is auto clean it you can auto
clean your app cache with this command
it's sudo apt-get
auto clean now what this is going to do
is clean up all of the old files that
are in your apt cache now why does it do
this old package download store caches
in the apt and this cache will grow over
time this is going to take up tons of
space and it's going to slow down your
computer over time as well you can also
use sudo apt-get clean to clean up all
of your cash entirely now one of the
other things you can do is disable some
of the startup applications this one's
really easy you just go into unity dash
or you install the boot up manager to
disable all sorts of services so if I go
in here
and I look for start-up applications so
I'm not running many things in here at
this moment but if I were I could choose
one pretty much anything in here and I
could add remove or edit its startup as
a startup program the next thing you can
do is check your used swap eNOS space
now this is over in a for example all
you have to do is cat processes system
BM and then look for sloppiness and it
tells me that i'm currently at 60 now
this parameter controls all the
processes that are moving from physical
memory to a swap disk because disks are
a lot slower than ram this can lead to a
really slow machine the default value of
course is 60 and to change it all you
have to do is edit this particular file
now in this file you're going to look
for a line that says vm SWA penis equals
and then you can change it to something
like 10 so I'll look through here real
quick
now if you notice that it's not in here
you can also add the line and then just
put in vm dots wah penis equals 10 as
well after that you just have to save
your file and exit and you're good to go
now why do we do this changes are going
to take effect once you reboot the
system and the higher the value the more
the system is going to swap the values
are between 0 and 100 so if you choose
100 the colonel will always find in
active memory pages and swap them out so
next off you can turn off hibernation
with a really simple command it's pseudo
G at it / ET c /
resume and once you edit this file you
can comment out the line that says
resume equals uuid equals start start
start start by adding just a simple
pound at the end or at the beginning and
then you just save and you reboot next
up disable grub 2 now this might sound
kind of weird but follow with me so
disable the boot menu by at editing the
file called pseudo G exit
osh grub and then you want to search for
grub underscore timeout equals zero and
you want to make sure that you change
this to zero now you can hold down the
shift key while rebooting to show the
grub to menu if you need me need be
since grub loads its configurations that
start up it can be a little slow when
your machine is first starting up so
hence why you want to maybe close it
next off you can optimize a pc with low
ram by using z ram which creates a kind
of compress block device mimicking a
swap disk but compressed and stored in
memory to reduce the disk thrashing all
you have to do is run these simple
commands all about the commands
so you're going to add a repository PPA
SH not SIL Z ram let's go ahead and add
that enter to continue of course and
this is going to take a moment to do it
and then after that you're going to put
in sudo apt-get
update to update the app get
and give this a moment to run
once that's done type in sudo apt-get
install z Ram enabler 0m swap enabler
and as you can see I already installed
it on this machine that's it it'll run
in the background and I'll make sure
that all your memory is faster next up
remove those visual effects using comp
is comp is config settings manager now
you can get this by just typing in sudo
apt-get of course install hump is config
settings manager and once you have that
you can start it now and head over to
the effects section and then disable all
the enabled effects to do that just go
into your dash and look for comp is
settings manager and it's going to bring
up a nice big list of all sorts of
different things in here so there's a
lot of customization that you can do and
I can turn off all these crazy effects
that I have going on animations and
whatnot once you're done just close and
you're good to go very easy one next up
use the system ram for the temp read
write operations to do this put in sudo
edit g edit et CFS tab at the very end
of the file you're going to add two
different lines
so the first one is going to be MF s
backslash TMP tmpfs and after that
defaults no exact no su ID 00 so what
this is going to do is move all those
temporary files over to ram and
hopefully make your computer much faster
and last stuff but definitely not least
changing your desktop environment
there's tons of really fast ones out
there there's xfce of course I'm sure a
lot of you guys already use that one
gnome KDE wanted errands favorites lxde
another one you could also use something
like pantheon I've never personally used
pantheon but you know who knows it might
be pretty useful and you can also use
cinnamon desktop environment another one
that I've never actually used myself
well if you guys have ideas on how to
make my old pc a little bit faster with
ubuntu i'm going to reinstall a boon to
of course but i want to find out from
you guys what you do every day to make
sure that your pc is running a top-notch
even if it's you know two three four

domain.com time once again for the
technology auto of the week this week's
photo is from Fox nakamori he shares his
hack top and his land tap with us and
those are pretty awesome i gotta say i
love seeing the land taps I'm always
like yeah whoo soldering skills what or
if you get the pro when it's just like
yeah professional yeah Jason's got a
soldering iron where he says that I got
to get him on here to show some cool
stuff off but basically it's like it
senses the density of the metal and
based on that chooses the heat and I'm
like cool so if I put it on my skin
would it still burn me and you like uh
you want to try it and I'm like well you
know I am Darren you yes true you always
break your pinky or something all right
well if you guys have photos you can
always share them over at feedback at
hak5 org just put in the subject line
technol s photo we should have like a
what is it called an Instagram hashtag
or something such a brilliant idea no it
isn't because Instagram is somebody
else's network and then all the content
is owned in the thing but I like email
Instagram email though I like open open
no terms of service on email okay
anyway yes so trivia trivia prove your
plans so last week's trivia question was

sli mode nvidia or crossfire X mode for
AMD if 2x16 physical slots are built
