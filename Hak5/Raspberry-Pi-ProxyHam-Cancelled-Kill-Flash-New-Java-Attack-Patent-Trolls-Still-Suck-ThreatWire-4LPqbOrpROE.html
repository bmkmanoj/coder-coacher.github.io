and DEF CON is sad the first zero day
Java attack in two years and yes people
patent trolls still suck all that coming
up now on threat wire greetings I'm
Patrick Norton and this is threat wire
for July 13th 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
internet freedoms a huge thanks to
everyone watching this show three times
a week and supporting us the news well
it's a Monday people so brace yourself
for impact remember last week when it
turned out that the data that from came
out of the hacking team revealed that
400 and something gigabyte file reveal
the flash vulnerability we talked about
it here and on tech thing as well well
on Friday night Adobe revealed that they
had found yet another exploit in the
hacking team data set critical
vulnerabilities while there's too many
of them to lists they've been identified
the Adobe Flash Player 1800 204 and
earlier for Windows Macintosh and Linux
score all the platforms successful
exploitation could cause a crash and
potentially allow an attacker to take
control of the affected system time to
remove flash from your computer go out
to tech thing from last week to find out
how to do it seriously people it is time
kill it or at least turn it off except
when you don't need it a try no security
tweeted out effective immediately we are
halting further dev on pound proxy ham
and will not be releasing any further
details or a source for the device and
then they said the DEFCON talk was
canceled and if you go to DEFCON 20
threes presentation page the proxy ham
crew is definitely not going to show up
seriously bummed that would have loved
to have heard Benjamin's talk on this if
you haven't heard about proxy ham CSO is
a good write up proxy ham it was a slick
raspberry pie powered premade proxy in a
box that could connect to public Wi-Fi
and then we'll use a 900 megahertz radio
to connect to a Wi-Fi network up to two
miles away and quote blend in with
traffic on that spectrum so if the
person using it were to be tracked via
IP addresses to a physical location all
anyone would find in that location it's
a proxy ham box which pre-made would
cost about 200 bucks well apparently
somebody didn't want pound whistleblower
pound and an image that happen
I'll just stare in the general direction
of the White House right now our studio
manager Paul points out that I could
have just pointed to the White House
right up there while we're in the whole
DC area behind me security week reports
of the first job a zero-day attack quote
reported after nearly two years unquote
took place on a quote NATO member and
the u.s. defense organization well
apparently the attack was by pond storm
and it was fishing man so they sent out
emails I could say the links to
malicious domains hosting a Java exploit
the exploit would launch a Trojan
dropper that drops a payload that was
detected as spy underscore fake MSC to
the login user folder tons of detail on
the Trend Micro blog that this report
links to and we have a link to that
Trend Micro blog in the show notes
Ars Technica has a great write-up on the
latest study from united patents that's
a group that helps companies deal with
patent trolls patent lawsuits are up 11%
over last year according to the report
and brace yourself a full 90% of tech
patent cases are filed by patent trolls
and quotes other industries average
closer to like 68% patent trolls aka
non-practicing entities are essentially
companies that own patents with the sole
goal of suing other practicing companies
ie the ones that make things for
royalties the stats get pretty sickening
at this point the top three companies
that follow these suits are all
represented by the same law firm Apple
the richest company in tech and probably
the world is the top target and at least
one of the trolling companies is
receiving patents or variations on
patents that have already one of its
main pets that it's making variations on
it's actually been invalidated by the
courts
patent law so much fun have any thoughts
on today's stories do me a favor leave
them down below before I skirt and want
to give a huge thanks to everyone that
have supported threat wire so far on

goal to make that happen with a rotation
of Darrin kitchens jam and Morris and
