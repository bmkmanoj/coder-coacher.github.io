by jack threads on the hunt for another
bootable CD with lots of fun tools
here's one that has always been a
favorite for many it's called hymens
boot CD aka HB CD it's a free bootable
CD that contains a load of useful tools
that you can make use of in a variety of
situations like analyzing recovering and
fixing your computer even if the primary
operating system cannot be booted it
features tools that are helpful to
partition backup recover and work with
the BIOS the website says that this is
for people who have problems accessing
the downloadable programs that can help
them fix their computer if you have
hyerin's boot CD you don't have to
download all those programs you can
repair issues like hard drive crashes
viruses password recovery tools are on
it and data recovery as well so it's
very very handy on the website I started
following these crazy directions where
you had to download the USB disk storage
format program and grub for dos and the
newest version of hyerin's busi after
getting like halfway through I had this
really like dull moment and figured out
that there's an ISO in the boot CD
folder so I'm just going to use unit
Boonton and install the ISO onto my USB
Drive so I formatted my drive into fat
and I installed the ISO on it now it's
time to boot up and see if this actually
works wish me luck
also in regards to the install I guess
if you have issues trying to just stick
the ISO on the flash drive you can try
the Hal two on hyerin's website they
also say if you are getting the grub
loader error or if the USB booting is
halting with a blinking das window or if
you're facing a similar situation
try using syslinux to boot grub for DOS
to do that download syslinux dot zip
extract its contents run-run me dot bat
inside the extracted folder and follow
the steps
alright let's boot up so I'll go down to
us be generic flash disk and yeh ok it
gives me the unit boot and online screen
there's a ton of stuff in here that I
can choose from
there's a specific one that I want to go
to I think it's this one yes okay here
is hyerin's boot CD there's tons and
tons of different tools that you can use
there's partition tools gparted which
everybody knows about backup tools
there's even one for a CD seagate
discwizard in here Clonezilla which
everybody loves of course password in
registry tools such as con boot hmm
though honestly I don't think that combo
works on this program right now just
because I'm 64-bit one day I'll get comm
boot to work
there's also recovery tools testing
tools hard disk system info there's
custom menu and under here there's a
whole bunch of other things you can do
norton ghost for example there's a pc
check so basically pretty much anything
that you would ever need to recover your
machine is on hyerin's boot CD although
this bootable CD is super cool and it's
really easy to use I do have to mention
that some of the tools I found then here
are not free to use you have to have a
license to legally use them so you may
not want to use it that said I really
like hyerin's boot CD it's combination
of tools and programs for any kind of
recovery is very useful and I've been a
fan of it for many years although
hyerin's is an older tool it's been
updated and fixed periodically new
versions have been coming out all the
time it's been released all the time so
