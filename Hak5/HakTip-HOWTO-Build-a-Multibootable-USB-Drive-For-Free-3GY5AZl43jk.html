Hostgator web hosting welcome to hack
tip the show where we break down
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers network gurus and IT ninjas I'm
your host Shannon Morris and today we're
creating a multi bootable USB from
scratch I've done a few bootable USB for
but I've never tried out a multi boot
installer so today I decided to try
something new you me aka your universal
multi boot installer is available over
at pendrive Linux com this tool can be
used to create a multi bootable USB
flash drive containing multiple
operating systems antivirus utilities
disk cloning diagnostic tools and more
now there are two ways that you me can
boot an operating system it either uses
sis Linux or grub sis Linux is a suite
of lightweight boot loaders for starting
computers with the Linux kernel it comes
in multiple flavors first of all there
sis Linux for booting off of a fat file
system like our USB file drive that I
have here
then there's ISO Linux for booting
cd-rom ISOs typically these are used for
live CDs PXE linux is for booting off of
the network and EXT linux for booting
off of linux file systems and last but
not least there's mem disk which is used
to boot older operating systems like DOS
which would be awesome if I really
wanted to play legend of the red dragon
because that game is amazing oh so cool
anyway similarly there's grub which is
short for GNU grand unified bootloader
it's sort of the de facto standard for
booting multiple operating systems or
different versions of the Linux kernel
you'll normally see this if your dual
building save Windows and Linux on two
different size now you me doesn't use
grub unless it really has to if an ISO
won't boot with syslinux it'll chain
load at using grub chain loading is
where running program is replaced with
another it's a pretty cool process but
outside the scope of this hack tip so
let's go ahead and get started
building our first multiboot USB with
you me first off you need to download
view me from the website in our show
notes and you need to run you need ATO
Oh point 1.5 GHz and follow all the
on-screen instructions which are pretty
simple choose your USB thumbdrive for
numbers for step number one which for me
after I agree is going to be my D Drive
you can also format the drive and remove
any kind of installed items off of the
drive during this step as well which is
very handy if you need to Reese why Pitt
and start a brand new multi boots USB
boot loader underneath step 2 choose the
tool that you want to have on your USB
if you don't have the ISO downloaded you
can also check the box that says
download the ISO zip or tar for example
I don't have
crunchbang so it tells me I can visit
the crunchbang home page or I can
download the ISO automatically now after
adding the program that you want to boot
run it again to add more ISOs to the
drive and as usual please make sure that
you have chosen the right drive letter
for you USB Drive not your operating
system really important alright so I'm
going to go ahead and create my multi
boot USB and I'm going to put Puppy
Linux because it's one of my favorite
districts
I'll hit create and it will extract it
automatically for me ok now that I have
Puppy Linux installed onto my multi boot
loader I'm going to go back into it hit
next add more ISOs and distres now and
I'm going to go through the process
again choosing another thing to boot off
of my USB Drive and this time let's
choose where is it D bad ok so it's in
green it says that I already have the
ISO and it found it automatically for me
I'll hit create and when it's done I'll
hit no because I am done I don't want to
add anymore because I kind of have a
small USB Drive so that's all there is
to it to create your Drive after the
break I'm going to restart my pc and my
that it works post gator can get your

revision3 at checkout okay now let's see
if it works you'll have to restart your
PC and choose to boot from your USB you
may need to reconfigure the boot list by
hitting f12 or some kind of similar
button to get into the BIOS so I'm going
to go into my VM so I don't actually
have to restart my computer and it
should boot off of my USB okay so I see
my you mean multi boot USB menu and it
asked me if I want to continue to boot
from the first HD which would be my
Windows box which I don't I also can
choose other operating systems and tools
system tools which I have dban under and
I can choose directly bootable ISO s or
my Linux distributions which I have
puppy under here so I'm going to choose
puppy run puppy from USB yes okay so I
just need to wait until it boots up
well apparently it worked that was super
easy to make and I'll just fullscreen
this right here so you can see it oh
that's so cool if I want to exit out and
try another tool all I'll have to do is
restart my computer and try another now
stay tuned in for the next hack tip but
until then I want to hear your feedback
