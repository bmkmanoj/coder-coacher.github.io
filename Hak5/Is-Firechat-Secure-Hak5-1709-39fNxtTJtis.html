by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen my name is
Shannon Morris if your weekly dose of
technology welcome to our humble abode I
am very excited why because this is one
of the last episodes a lot less echoey
hopefully yeah I guess I was slightly
echo I was just down there there they've
taken out the racks we're putting in the
sound walls we're making all of the
things that's so cool
soon we will all know the power of is
fully operational by our house I am
excited for the fact that we're gonna
have room to actually set up everything
I can't wait to have like a drone
section and a 3d printer section a laser
cutter section and an antenna section
it's gonna be so awesome
half pipe half pipe no I don't think
they insurance people would like that
moving on to the place we have we're
doing something interesting that has
been in the news lately oh yes this is
why the port pilots aren't here yet so
what's going on hey viva la revolucion
and props to all our peeps in Hong Kong
that's why this kind of hit our radar
recently as they are you know going
through the protests and stuff and as
such it that governments they don't like
the protests too much never knew
sometimes electing you know Arab Spring
style turn off the internet and or
otherwise just disable certain services
like in this case what was the social
network Instagram Instagram why turn off
Instagram it's just full of selfies they
turn it off instantly okay so people
were using Instagram to basically chat
back and forth to converse right right
to get their nonviolent protests on
which is okay red ultra evasion
so as an alternative means of
communications and we've touched on this
briefly as we've talked about like
alternative internet internet
infrastructure and stuff there's project
Byzantium and a bunch of other awesome
ways to create mesh networks and sorts
of things where if my phone is near your
phone why do we need a cell tower to
talk to each other why should we have to
go through the Manas
were and open garden is a project that
has done a lot of awesome messy stuff
previously and it's gotten a lot of
press because their fire talk
firefighter chat chat application fire
chest yeah fire chop is an application
for both iOS and Android it's completely
free and it's made to allow you to chat
with everyone around you and also people
around the world
it requires no internet but it does
require internet to actually set it up
in the first place it's got a couple of
flaws it does it have two caveats to
this so you can download fire chat from
open garden comm slash apps or you can
just go to the Google Play Store and
search for fire chat as well yes it's
it's the idea is if you for example
don't have an internet connection you
know or you're in airplane mode and then
you've gone and then thus re-enabled
your local radio stuff like Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth it can use those radios to
seek out new life and new civilizations
and basically other people that are also
running the app it uses you know Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth basically you can this to
say okay I'm running fired chat and then
it creates a really cool ad-hoc network
messy style where it's kind of it's
pretty good the thing is cool
it's cool because it's got steward and
forward capabilities it's got
capabilities where like if I want to
send a message to Paul and Paul's you
can't see but Paul way back there right
and then I'm like hey but what's up dude
and then you know you it goes to your
phone and then your phone sends it to
Paul and then everybody's happy right
peer-to-peer except it's not an open
specification right this this fire chat
stuffs about but it's getting a lot of
press which is good because it gets
people thinking about the fact that this
stuff is possible and then hopefully
it's it will either morph into something
that is actually open specification and
can be used by lots of other things and
or just gets people thinking about the
possibility and then something Universal
does come around which would be really
freaking cool but until then it serves
as an awesome platform to demonstrate
cool technology yes it does so we
actually ran across this blog post over
at Bri
entropy dot org and it's by a nameless
poster he actually figured out that you
can use blue cat which is basically like
net cat but it's for Bluetooth to see
what is going on when you open fire chat
and converse back and forth with another
person that also has fire chat is this
the only reason why you like this
segment is because it's got netcat it
might be yeah what can I say I really
like net cat and I like the internet
news for cats and now to be centralized
with Bluetooth luke blue cats a really
cool device I'm learning a lot about RF
calm and I'll about the way that
bluetooth actually like the
communications protocols really
interesting with the channels and URLs
and then usually bluetooth is encrypted
so you can't really see what's going on
like if you connect to I don't know your
car whatever it might be but for this
use case scenario you can see what
people are talking about oh yes I love a
protocol that's totally out in the open
okay fire three okay so we have it both
on our phone yeah my the setup process I
must say I tried to do this completely
anonymously as it were that said this is
not a burner phone by any stretch the
phone anyway so so I tried to do this
wall in airplane mode kind of simulating
what a burner might be and it could be
you can't even get it through the setup
process yeah you actually have to be
connected to the Internet's to put in
your name which they asked for your full
name but it can be whatever you want it
to be your user name and then your email
and you can just put in fake credentials
because it doesn't check it does I send
you an email I tried it there so I
wasn't able to create the account to use
the functionality of the app while
offline the the just signup button was
not available so it wasn't even until
like I went okay out of airplane mode
connect back to the internet that then I
was able to do that and then funnily
enough it decided that foo at
example.com had already been used so
thankfully you don't have to actually
get the email and do an activation thing
for your account so you know there's
that so when you first start up firechat
just make sure that you have
an internet connect ability so you can
actually sign up for it and then you can
log in you can either chat with everyone
and in every one channel near by channel
which will just be people in your
200-foot vicinity I think it is or you
can join other random chat rooms
basically like coding there's one for
Linux there's one for coffee you know
you know what I love though it reminds
me of AOL in the 90s lol holy AOL so
basically you get everything set up and
then you can disconnect from your Wi-Fi
after you have it all set up and after
you've run your first chat yes and we
used this to chat in a nearby in fact
I'm gonna go back into let's see
airplane mode and I'm going to go back
and turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi I'm not
connecting to any Wi-Fi networks right
you're just yes so there we go so now
both of those radios are available okay
and I'm gonna disconnect from any of
mine networks that I know of on Wi-Fi so
I'm just connected from those and I'm
gonna turn on airplane mode so right now
just bluetooth is on and you also want
to to make this work with blue cat right
we're going to set our Bluetooth from
only visible to paired devices to
visible to all nearby abilities
reminding me yes
so now visible to all nearby devices and
then under settings you can set the
threshold normally it's like two minutes
while you're pairing your Bluetooth
headset visibility you can I set that
visibility at least an Android to be
forever and then everyone can always
track you from your bssid wherever you
go it's fantastic okay and then you want
to download blue cat so blue cat is over
at blue cat dot sourceforge.net slash
blue cat and that's spelled BL you see a
t so you've got a download download that
and it's just a simple zip file so you
just get the zip and then run it yes so
you've got that on your sure awesome
yes alright good so now that you have
this set up there it is okay there we go
we got I just wanted to give props to
the cute almost ASCII looking kitten
very good stuff soft art cat with
okay so first off type in your terminal
blue cat devices aha
also if you do just blue cat you can see
again cute little ASCII cat just want to
point that out
so devices yes okay and there is no
bluetooth adapter powered on right hang
on I need to unplug my faithful USB
bluetooth adapter and back in and reset
that okay and it is unhappy with me and
through the magic of turning it off and
on again we bring you back to your
regularly scheduled segment so where we
left off we were trying to get blue cat
to recognize all of our Bluetooth
devices within the vicinity and we did
with Bluetooth blue cat services so our
blue cat and device excuse me so when
you type that in it's going to search
for the local devices and it should pick
up both my phone as well as Darren's
phone since we both have Bluetooth on
there's my Nexus 5 and then the GPE one
that one is your phone my Sony there you
go okay so after that you want to copy
one of the unique identifying like a MAC
address yeah the MAC address from one of
them so okay okay so you'll cup in the
nexus 5 1 so then you type in blue cat
services and then that nexus 5 number
hit enter so we're looking for all of
the services from that device exactly so
you're gonna see like my Google Play
services you're gonna see one for
Pandora probably you know the real world
wait a few in fact so here's the Nexus 5
and we've got all of these services
available
Pandora laying ok yeah map SMS Android
network access point we've got a headset
gateway hands-free AV remote ok so we're
gonna be six sync do you drive a Ford I
do so you didn't see but you didn't see
fire chat right no I did not see if I
don't you fire chat in this list right
but you do see it for Darin I do see it
on mine so this is if I scroll up some
this
is the GPE device and okay so mine very
similar but you don't see four distinct
on here because I don't drive a forward
okay so I'm gonna try to reopen firechat
and I want you to try running that same
command again okay alright go for it go
for it go go go and I'm gonna send a few
texts out just to see if that might
trigger it we'll see
hey hey I see it now you see it yep got
to go these two are new because it used
to end at sink proxy and now it ends
with two additional fields alright so
that first one it doesn't have a name
it's just blank and then it's on Channel
15 at the very end the second one that
you see down there it's called fire chat
so this one is basically just a call to
action if you want to call to begin
saying okay I'm ready care chat and that
one's on a different channel like mine I
believe it's on channel 6 or something
yours is on 8 mine is on sex
ah okay hey I think they switched back
and forth pal interesting right so now
that you know what channels they're on
you can listen to those channels with
another command okay so for this one you
want to type in blue cat mm tack URL BTS
attack URL space BTS peepee colon slash
slash and whatever my ID is and then :
15 so channel 15 when you hit enter with
this and I'll type in some more chat
messages alright what's the heck five
rules and send me some chat messages to
chat with me dude I know yeah this makes
for great great TV you know what I love
this is my favorite it used to be like
and now it's like okay so you got some
information in there so let's go ahead
and look at your computer okay so you
can see my username is this number Iser
where no user : this number Iser nice
you can also see I'm using fire chat
nearby is the channel and then the name
is Saturn so that's my user name Saturn
aha and then under that you'll see yeah
you'll start seeing different texts so I
sent you what's up and I sent you hack
five rules so it's it's showing you
whatever I was sending out but it's not
going to show you anything that I
receive back you know what's interesting
about this
what doesn't seem to be any bit
authenticated exactly so would that
would that imply that for half
scary perhaps seeing that this is in
fact just net cap for Bluetooth
essentially we could I don't know say
inject this then and the make messages
appear from whoever we want them to
appear from as if it was the 90s and we
were abusing SMTP servers actually I
think you can so according to this log
this whole blog that nameless created he
tried something similar to that he
actually put in a whole bunch of
information from his laptop so he made
his his phone think that his laptop was
a fire chat client okay
and then he wrote in a little message
and it's sent to the fire chant client
that he was talking to fantastic it
works
creepy so what no no well okay so it's
creepy and it's awesome because on the
one hand well because networking is hard
and let's use raw sockets so no I mean
so i on the one hand like i don't want
to put this because it's yes there's an
obvious flaw here but the fact that the
meshing technology even works it's
actually really cool i mean would you
not say that when okay the service
notwithstanding we like needing to be
online to sign up and want to hear your
real name and not having any sort of
authentication or authentic authentic
checks or using any sort of encryption
or you could simply do you know
different exchanges for the things and
then use PKI where you've got the you
know crypto is hard so a lot of people
just don't use it and as we found out by
our chat doesn't use it which kind of
opens you up to a whole bunch of bad
things that could happen if somebody
were to I don't know impersonate another
figure that was trusted in some sort of
scenario of of protests or whatever have
you where these things are most useful
no I didn't notice one thing when we
first paired my my phone with your
laptop mmm-hmm it had to ask me if I
wanted to pair with Darren's laptop yeah
we should say that because we had to do
that before we did the segment but the
thing is you could just change the name
of your laptop to something like fire
chat and then yeah I'd be like oh yeah
pair definitely mmhmm yeah okay and
that's that social engineering
it's best yep I love this I hats off to
all the geeks involved and this is
fantastic and it's a great use of both a
really cool meshing technology that will
hopefully grow responder
I don't spawn ideas of other cool things
that will do it better there are other
options out there though oh yes we
should well okay so there are other
options that rely on an internet
connection and if you're going to do it
I recommend using tor because it's as as
far as what we have as citizens probably
our best defense against censorship and
things of that nature
even though people check those nodes
okay sure sure you know like one of the
commenters well it's look it's the best
we got right now right like you know
hacker satellites notwithstanding this
is pretty cool or chat to roll your own
infrastructure so we've covered bit
message and then there's also a torch
hat but yeah bit message was the one I
talked about OTR is pretty good so
that's a great protocol if you want to
see something that has lots of different
clients implement that I think that OTR
is a fantastic bet and I would love to
see OTR adapted to some sort of mesh
networking technology like this because
while I've seen other projects that
require different physical hardware for
users to have people don't have that is
a card when when they need it then that
can be able to get it so using like
what's built into your phone
I love Bluetooth and Wi-Fi kind of
awesome and beacons and believe it at
that and bacon
no beginner you can totally abused those
things as you can fit so much payload
into a beacon let us know what you think
over at feedback at hack 5 org and until
then I think we got a sponsor for this
oh yeah let's let's take a quick break
yeah we'll be right back
