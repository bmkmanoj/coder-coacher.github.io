Gerren kitchen my name is Jan Warner if
your weekly dose of Tekken was welcome I
know how to do it guys thank you thank
you what I did I don't know it's just
one of the various holiday shirts from
the back across from your trip to
Alderaan gonna get back to that let me
get back to you on that one
Oh still doing some research okay but I
hear it's beautiful this time of year we
are going to find out what is better
than what the pineapple I would say a
lot of Wi-Fi pineapples let's find out
hey everyone I am back with dark matter
I am super excited
you probably remember dark matter from
last year when he had set out about 12
different boxes with Wi-Fi pineapples in
them all over the Convention Center
specifically to collect data and pretty
much share it with the convention so
they could learn more about what was
going on at the con this year you've
been running around with the strange
contraption on your back and I'm just
sorry we have to talk about this because
it's nuts and it looks so heavy okay
what is going on
well first off hashtag Wi-Fi cactus
basically it's 50 Wi-Fi pineapple tetras
or excuse me 25 which gives us 50 total
radios to listen on 50 channels at the
same time so we're doing 2.4 and 5
gigahertz wireless monitoring all
passive and so it's like the ultimate
war walk we explained that to me because
I saw it with Wi-Fi channels you just
get 14 but legally you can only use some
of those in the US and then the 14th one
I believe is for Japan so how are you
getting 50 so there's the 2.4 band which
is the 14 year old 12 channels plus the
illegal ones and then there's the 5/8
5.8 gig or there are 5 gigahertz which
includes some special regulations to
build a broadcast in the lower half of
it and then also the upper but if you're
passive listening you're not
broadcasting so we can listen on all
those channels without a problem and so
there's actually 81 total channels that
are available some of those channels are
40 megahertz wide and also 80 megahertz
by the default 802 11
is 20 megahertz channels unless you're
using the extra bandwidth to be able to
get more speed and so this device will
capture on all those channels 50 of
those 81 at the same time so it allows
us to get more data without having
fragmented packet with packets or
without losing data so that was a
problem in past years with past projects
definitely I'm sure welcome to Wi-Fi 101
so what kind of data are you collecting
with these 25 different Wi-Fi pineapple
tetras so we're seeing a lot of beacons
we're seeing just the environment of the
how many people are using their Wi-Fi
you know I mean it's everyone's
recommends to turn on airplane mode and
turn off the Wi-Fi this year though is
interesting Def Con said the Wi-Fi was
safe so it'll be interesting to see you
know what comes out in the data from
that with the project this year but yeah
I mean we're also looking for attacks
right because there's a lot of things
going on this is the most dangerous
network in the world and so it's like
last year we were able to validate a lot
of that by seeing the types of attacks
this year though there's a new type of
attack that's pretty sketchy with a
broad pone attack where it affects the
Broadcom so if you want information on
that that's basically the Broadcom
chipsets which are in pretty much a huge
percentage of the cell phone devices
that are on the market today so your
smart phones at home are probably
running on a Broadcom chipset and
basically broad pone allows somebody to
send out packets to your device and gain
admin or root credentials basically and
even if you put your your phone in like
airplane mode without NFC Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi turned on because your phone is
still sending out location services via
GPS and via Wi-Fi and things like that
which I didn't know until my co-workers
had told me about yeah it's pretty scary
it's probably one of the most scary bugs
it was released to the vendors earlier
this year I think in March and they've
put out a bunch of patches like Apple
10-point 10.3 iOS 10 points and
addressed it and fixed it Android also
released a fix but Android typically
takes a long time to patch
it's pretty much handled by carriers not
opposed to a company and so there's
still a lot of vulnerable devices out
there so that was actually publicly
released at blackhat on Thursday I was
at that talk also I talked to the guy
who found the vulnerability found out
some of the signatures worked with drew
Gorn who's behind kismet and he made an
IDs signature that we're running here so
we can see if anyone's actively
exploiting it so as far as I know we are
the first ones to do active
identification of broad pone and that
was one of the things I was seeing on
Twitter that people were just like
blowing up about and being like that's
going to be a huge thing that happens at
Def Con this year and it's going to be
interesting just look at the data and
see if it showed up or not so I haven't
analyzed the data yet it's early in the
con so hopefully maybe by tomorrow I can
have some data and report back so yeah
definitely let us know on your Twitter
I'm assuming or just like send me a
message and let me know if you've seen
anybody using broad pone because I
really want to know if that's been
happening here so you mentioned drag
Oren and kismet
are you running a new version of kismet
or what's going on there actually I'm
running literally the bleeding edge of
it like I'm running get head get head
master and so it's been kind of scary
he's been pushing a ton of updates for
me like crazy he's moved from the
traditional command-line interface to
this new web-based interface also we
have remote capture devices which means
that you can now take a Wi-Fi pineapple
for example hook it up with an Ethernet
cable to in my case the Nook and be able
to push information as if it were like
plugged in USB it looks like a raw
device so I'm actually getting all that
data able to aggregate it directly on
the Nook I have everything in one kismet
session so as far as I know yeah that's
going to save you a lot of
labor-intensive work afterwards because
you don't have to aggregate everything
onto like one machine you already have
everything happening on that one nook
and you showed me earlier physically on
the Wi-Fi cactus is that what we're
calling it hashtag Wi-Fi cactus you
should be earlier that you basically
have all the Wi-Fi pineapples running
into a network switch physically and
then you have that running into the Nook
what about power is there any kind of
power issues that you've run into with
this or how are you running it
it's about 200 watts of power and heat
transfers up and so I've got some
thermal images of the of it and we
definitely are getting hotter at the top
and I talked to said because let me back
up a because I can't hack five obviously
sponsored this project and huge thank
you for making it happen because I
couldn't done it without you guys but I
talked to said and Darrin about what the
maximum running temperature is and we're
like just barely under the maximum
recommended temperature we're about at
68 degrees Celsius so pretty toasty at
the very top so but Yolo right yellow so
one other thing I wanted to ask is
obviously I think this is the biggest of
the biggest that you can need for for
sniffing all the different channels at
one time is there any reason why a
company would need that many Wi-Fi
pineapples dismissed channels or could
they just be good with wine well I think
that one just doesn't give you the
coverage that you need you're going to
miss information if you have a savvy
attacker that's switching channels on
you and doing some things you're just
going to miss it
yeah channel hopping you're going to
miss it because you yourself will be
channel hopping too and so it's hard to
identify the signature or imagine you
know like a large building where you
have hundreds of access points on
coordinated channels throughout the
building and you want to validate that
things are working how you expect you
need a device like this that has full
Travel Channel coverage so you could
troubleshoot each individually otherwise
you may get fragmented packets pieces of
information that don't give you the full
picture and then you're left wondering
is it actually the wireless devices is
it the clients who is the problem
because you don't have the full picture
so so I think we pretty much covered
everything with the hashtag Wi-Fi cactus
is there anything else that you want to
shout out about this project just I'm
going to post a full write-up on my blog
pal Shack org and then just follow me on
Twitter and I don't know what's going to
be next because this is this is out of
control
yeah I was going to ask you like where
do you go from here because this is
pretty insane okay so you're running it
off a car battery how much does it weigh
we're about 45 pounds 260 pounds
depending on the battery I choose the
rack itself is about thirty pounds so
it's definitely the ultimate war walking
rate at this point seriously well I wish
you luck I'm sure you're getting some
like serious workouts while you're here
I wish
I wish I could burn that many calories
out of convention
thank you so much dark matter it was
awesome chatting with you about this I
think it's amazing what you're doing and
I seriously cannot wait to see what's
next I know it's gonna be incredible
buddy
anyway
what do you do on the internet what do
you say a consulting and training we
just are training walk
our document and always on the physics
poly physio that's jail for just
straight-up ready run see a zombie board
yes yeah the one that comes in person
very clearly if you're close all that
what's that's gone I'm back
with that yeah we had a little dedicated
mobile phase going on everyone that's
really awesome I'm kind of I'm actually
really jealous of your setup back here
because the light and the background
looks incredible and you can like hide
behind it and have your little green
room yeah yeah so nice I like having the
addition of
I'm going to kill you right here
really well for lighting yeah it's
pretty hot is sexy bad news
people find the show hacker warehouse
spot TV
you can subscribe to do amazing work and
have your warehouse is awesome they feel
like every gadget that you would ever
need
intersection we're happy of course if
you're interested in world hahaha of
course Treasure Island yes oh and
Garrett made the first electronic badge
that I got at the convention this year
so cool
no more contoured it works what yeah
honestly like this is the most
responsive bat that I got and I'm going
to turn on the real one
now
if there's a bunch of stuff on the
screen of course but I like I like the
others here we need dollars
and it looks like I'm having a party
back here with my PC a one-bed we will
do a parallel later like a party news
where
I think I think that tacwise and have to
warehouse to make badges that like pops
each other like they have to get both of
them I don't know something like that
what do you guys think let us know got a
great idea
bring it to the web do a review and head
over to domain calm we've got a slick
domain discovery system and any of you
check out process so your site will be
online in no time and the domain.com
guys have been supporting hack 5 for
years and they want to celebrate with a
massive promo code use a JK jumbo for 35
percent off new domain registration now
for November 30th
it's a limited time offer so when you
think domain names think domain.com for
more from Def Con and B slides Las Vegas
today I am talking to somebody very
interesting John naívi P at synergistic
he actually did a whole bunch of
interesting talks 1 FB sides LV and then
social engineering village which happens
at Def Con all about humans human
interaction with technology and why the
heck do we suck so much at risk
management so John I thank you so much
for joining me today thank you for
having me thank you so first off I
wanted to just ask you why in the world
do humans suck so much at risk
management with security and privacy
specifically absolutely so a very good
way to see it is those of us who've
worked in technical aspects of security
for a long time spent 10 years doing pen
testing so I've been a tech head I've
been looking at at all the technical
controls and I felt like I'm in
Groundhog Day like I'm Bill Murray
you know I the same things over and over
again and I started to wonder why so I
that about two years ago is when I
started to wonder why and that's all
I've cared about for the last two years
now figuring this out and I think that
it is the human element and the reason
is that we as an industry really as a
society but as an industry don't accept
people for what they really are we have
like imposed rationality and
reasonableness on
to people we have biases unconscious
biases that we automatically think about
whenever we see certain kinds of people
for example and we make automatic
assumptions yep regardless of whether
they're conscious or not in fact they
mostly aren't you know and it might be
something like you don't like somebody
that eats meat it very well could be
that I mean I don't like me
yes I do too but that could very well be
like an unconscious bias you know you
just go out to dinner or someone and
they order a steak and you are instantly
grossed out by that person and then it's
hard to listen them this is an example
so how does this end up affecting people
that are working in InfoSec whenever you
fall into these biases absolutely so
with InfoSec we have tried really hard
to put in all of these very complex and
well-thought-out controls and processes
and and methods for handling things well
all of them are based on two things
technical solutions and the rationality
of the people using the computers and so
we've have built in industry on
assumptions that are wrong we're not the
attorney wants to do this change all you
gotta do is look at economics you know
or interrogation or a million other
avenues of approach they all did this to
begin with for hundreds of years so for
the longest time we've been believing
that these different factors work
especially for humans but in the long
Scenario case these things actually
don't work at all is that what I'm
getting exactly and it's a lot of the
missing story we're missing the story so
if you think back to like junior high
when you learned about the five W's in
the h who what when where why and how
all right which is the thing you think
about for journalism so I'm sure it's
something you've thought of but that is
what we need to start telling our users
and our peers this is not limited to
just users being unreasonable all people
are including your co-workers and that
is really important so if we can start
telling that story we can tell them you
who is attacking you why are they
attacking you you know why should you be
careful what should you look out for
what are the methods they use all of
these things then it becomes a real
issue to the users rather than saying
bad guys are out there to get you we've
been using fear you know we believe
scare people into not wanting to do
things right never agree to work very
well because it's it's not going to make
people happy to do their job at least in
my case it doesn't so I prefer being
able to ask those questions freely so
that I can get the answers that I need
to be able to do my job better and I
think that really helps with InfoSec
especially a really great example I saw
just yesterday on Twitter was some some
people who were at the pet conference
that was right next to blackhat there
was a party trance yeah they have a
giant armored what it's called it's a
giant conference where like pet supplies
right at the exact same time is DEFCON
and last couple of Ernie blackhat I'm
sorry the last couple years right there
at Mandalay Bay well they posted some
pictures of people in there like turning
they were telling them to turn their
phones off to disable their Wi-Fi there
was people literally wearing tinfoil
hats I know it was joke but still you
know that that's a sign right there
these are non-technical people who are
scared to death right they're so scared
that they're like turn it all off let's
not use it that's not the answer I think
the answer is more is more esoteric than
that so you were talking about telling
stories to really get the point across
to people is that something that you
think inputs that professionals should
be doing or the career the people that
are hiring them should be doing when
they're training like who are the best
people that should be doing this or is
this something that everybody needs to
be paying more attention to I think the
last bit right there so this is
something that should permeate permeate
all of our industry and this does not
rely just on security all of IT yeah not
limited to just InfoSec and by telling
stories which there's a phenomenal book
by Annette Simmons called the story
factor that I highly recommend all of
you it's like five dollars on Kindle
just get it perfect you will learn so
much but she was the scientist
who went to a storytelling conference
and was blown away by the power of the
simple you know these people were
telling fables simple stories but if you
think about human history we have
carried down all of our beliefs all of
our stories all of our knowledge up
until maybe a hundred years ago purely
through story through word of mouth and
through story and that has faded and
we've gone into all these technical
explanations and checklists and and I
mean that stuff's important technology
has that but we need to tell the story
behind it we need to make sure the
people and this does go all the way back
to training a brand new person in
InfoSec yeah to talking to the person
who works as a cashier in the cafeteria
Oh totally I have to make all understand
it I've done the exact same things when
I was working at Domino's Pizza I
wouldn't even I would train people with
stories so I would tell them like hey
the reason why we have to follow this
rule is because it's dangerous if you
touch the oven or some even simple
things like that sometimes you need to
create those stories to help them really
understand so do you think that common
sense exists in people's minds or is
just a complete falsity so I have a
whole slide about it and I could talk
for days but essentially a common sense
does not exist it is it is a false
conception that and basically what it
comes down to is that no one person is
sees the world in the same way right
very easy for us and in fact by default
we as people imagine and expect that
everyone else is like us at least in
most ways we see the surface differences
your hair is longer than mine or
something like that but we assume that
they see the world in a relatively
similar way the truth is that they don't
you think about it their beliefs their
their perception yeah their you know
what they've learned their their
education their family they go home to
different people every night they
probably watch different TV shows I mean
all those things make up that person and
make them so much different so to say
common sense is just ludicrous because
there is no commonality not to that not
to that
extent so that's something we need to
stop saying period as an industry no
more common sense we need to approach it
from you know what makes sense right is
competence and of course I think it goes
without saying too that things like
memory play a huge role in the human
factor with risk management because of
things like your example which was
passwords how it's very hard for
consumers to remember passwords or
employees too so we end up with very
simple ones or we write them down and
they're very easy to find things like
that
additionally play a huge key role in
InfoSec so other than storytelling do
you have any other ideas on how we can
do better and how companies can do
better with InfoSec and also I do want
to ask - what is risk management because
I know a lot of our viewers are going to
ask you anyway absolutely so I did I
actually did a master's class in it was
a risk management master's class about
about two years ago right when I started
getting into this and it was the most
boring class in the world risk
management is not as at least in its
like knowledge form or it's you know
educational form is not very interesting
but I think that's because we're
approaching it wrong essentially risk
management is looking at all of our all
of the possibilities all the possible
bad things that could happen to you or
an organization whatever you're applying
it to and then figuring out which of
those risks you should take steps to
avoid okay or to mitigate or to deal
with in order to pass off and through
insurance so there's a lot of ways to
deal with that risk but the problem
we're facing is the way that we approach
it because most of the people that are
analyzing and assessing that risk work
for the organization or getting paid by
them and therefore do have a personal
impact in seeing that risk well our
brain exactly our brains are
specifically built so that we do not see
all the dangers that we face constantly
if you think about it I mean every time
you get your car you could die I was
holy start thinking about that you get
super paranoid or you'd never go
swimming or driving ever again because
you might die but our brains purposely
had that that block it's like it's a
good thing
we have it but when it comes to things
like risk management looking at the
dangers that we face then we start
running into a lot of problems so how do
we buy how do we do better John because
it's going to be really hard to take my
personal opinions out of it saying
they're not good you're not gonna no
matter how hard you try and neither am i
all of us we're biased ain't going away
but what we can do one thing that I've
seen a huge improvement with is just
simply having peers review it having a
second set third set fit set the more
sets of eyes that you can have on
something the more likely they're going
to see it from other angles right so
that's important and then another thing
we need to look at is is the you know
the algorithms we've assigned all of
these algorithms to to deciding things
and we often get stuck in dealing with
just those algorithms where there might
very well be a better approach or a
better way so we kind of need to empower
our people looking at risk people trying
to understand risk to use their brains
and we also need to give them more
resources you know and these and you
should not always just be another risk
person doing these periods taking of
course it should be let a manager look
at it let somebody who works at the
helpdesk look at it they very likely
have seen things you never thought up
yeah totally not so that's a big one
peer review I think you got to think
outside that box John is there anything
else that we should cover before we go
ahead and let you go off to do whatever
you like to do in the afternoon
oh let's see so it's I mean it's a giant
topic there's there's a need for more of
us there are there's actually probably
about 20 or so of us out there who care
about this stuff who are looking at
decision theory and game theory you know
like Selina Kyle's a good example okay
so there's a lot of people out there
doing this but we need more we all need
to be involved I think all of us need to
be looking at this and and trying our
best to understand it as you approach
the world as it really is not as we want
it to be this totally preaches back to
the talk that Darren and I gave that
authored where we discovered that if you
take 100 USB rubber
to a information security conference 62
of them will be plugged in and that's a
very high percentage and it's it's
because I don't know maybe maybe InfoSec
professionals are missing some of that
common sense sixty-two percent oh it's
crazy John thank you so much for
speaking to us about this I think it's
really important where can people find
more information about what you do and
what is your Twitter handle yes so on
Twitter it is at end is nigh nya all one
word underscore comm so engine i
underscore comm and you will be able to
find links to all the things I've also
got articles on peer list and at our
synergistic website synergistic calm
I have blogs floor so and please reach
out to me let's talk about this let's
grow it yes I agree yes everyone please
reach out to John Knight and John thank
you so much again really appreciate you
chatting with us that just about wraps
up this week's episode of hack 5 but
before we get going Shannon what we have
received a lot of stickers didn't we are
you jealous of me or were the mere fact
that I got to where the Wi-Fi cactus I
I'm so jealous of that it was so cool
that thing weed so much that I had to
lean forward or else I would have fallen
back Wow it was yeah it weighed a ton
but it was cool talking to John I about
you know why we suck so much at risk
management so that was great a lot of
things great interview now this week so
thanks guys for being on the show the
great Def Con and we got tons of
stickers from Def Con as well I got so
many oh we got a besides Raleigh we did
get a besides Raleigh besides Las Vegas
besides Tel Aviv gotta love the people
of you Earl Grey tea Earl Grey hot chef
there's a hacker that makes piece called
the devotee usa.com nice yeah nice
fanty-tale renewed good stuff I love
uh-oh
Jekel oh yeah BJ Jack there we go I'm
loving the new Paul calm hack naked
stickers yeah good be nice it's so great
yeah I love it
I had charities of course oh that's one
of my favorite yes I love just how
simple this is good this called that's
called good design guys
called hash cat yeah it's also called
this one's going on my side of the set
right get the hash cat love right there
well I think we'll start a little bit of
a time-lapse while we stick all these
stickers up what do you say let's tickle
the things the entire thing is covered
with stickers sticker all the things so
cool yeah hey I wanted to remind you
guys that if you'd like you can support
hak5 directly over at HHS shop calm and
that's where we can find all of the
awesome gear that we were having event
at Def Con including our new field kit
which includes this awesome book the the
field kit guidebook gets you started on
all the tools the plenty of the turtle
the ducky if you see typos in the bass
20 area is because I didn't get a chance
to edit it but that will be fixed in the
next run if we have to do a neck we have
to do another run here okay guys I
already and I read all the grammar stuff
and marked it up so I'll send you that
all that info this is how the things
happen behind the scenes yeah thankfully
it still compiles even if it's
misspelled I go figure really that's the
risk that's like since when yes if this
were code oh I work on know better if
you had watched threat wire you would
know that there were some issues with
the note npm javascript library where
people were uploading misspelled live
libraries uh I think repositories or
whatever is called I'm not a cutter but
they were doing that so that they could
get developer credentials hmm whenever
people were installing these library are
you calling those libraries from NPM
there's so many problems with convenient
that that actually prepackaged
convenience and security because because
NPM is amazing because it's convenient
but then any system that makes something
that simple like I don't have the time
to check the every line of code on
everything running on my box nor do you
but cool attack also I'm just going to
point this out in in as I switched your
camera I realized
