crap this is an awesome episode gmail
procrastination badges in PHP extracting
Windows executables from packet captures
winning the Easter Egg contest and
special guest 80 from dual core is on
this nerdcore episode of pack 5 stay
tuned
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by frost brewed Coors Light the world's
most refreshing beer clicking her ticket
and go daddy hey there I'm 80 from dual
core you're watching hak5 joined with me
tonight or my special guests Darren and
Shannon it's good hello thank you guys
for meeting so much for bringing us on
I'm very very excited to do this with
you and Kirby for the third week in a
row oh yeah it was bad she's becoming
kitty whore it's excellent I don't know
she's a little cat waiting to happen she
really we are not panting her there but
she's gonna ends up they're just gonna
ask you to remember season one where she
was such a camera whore she would like
jump on the table the middle of segments
and make she's become complacent I'm
gonna try that later if that's okay
joking to do that so uh for those are I
guess we should introduce you right off
the top though because for those that
aren't familiar with the man the myth
and eighty so well tell me about your
music tell me what's going on um a lot
of stuff's going on actually we're
working on our fourth album said you
guys know we're in the group dual core
and we make a nerdcore hip-hop which is
a lot of fun and we are in the middle of
our fourth album it's going really well
and we're just having a good time
playing a lot of shows and doing good
stuff I love this stuff man yard cause
we're dad right Thanks I agree and it's
not single threaded man its dual core
yeah this is true mmm yeah how about you
what's what's new with you guys I just
got a new flip phone okay camera own
it's a camera it's a oh they should put
a phone in it because you know how like
for a while they were putting cameras
and everything it should go backwards
and then start putting like phones and
everything and then you can have a phone
camera but okay yeah it's pretty cool so
I can just do like you know backstage
recordings and then post them up on
youtube with a simple little USB switch
thing anyway I'm still checking it out
see if I like it it's pretty nifty
little device I like it and Darren just
got a motorcycle yeah that's fun then
you know that was a serious yeah well I
was wrong like a like a like in 2005 I
got a rebel 250 and that was a lot of
fun but it is just you know
um something about that nighthawk 750
really spoke to me so it's a pretty sexy
bike got that 4th gen 95 model yeah I
was excited I have a 9700 court special
edition yeah we like nice anyway now but
um there's actually a new one of ya ya
HD one yeah but um I gotta be honest
like I really like the the first I've
sick that second gen because it's got
user replaceable batteries yeah dude I
love that just slides off there's
nothing that that pisses me off more
than these uh these gadgets that get
this notion that Oh we'll just throw a
USB cable in there and they'll charge
our gadget off 5 volts no give me a real
charger you know I'm not waiting yeah no
she just need bag batteries that's all
you need in so sad that so many devices
don't give you those anymore yeah
lifehacker just had a DIY segment on
building a solar charger for that well
I'm after that specifically but you do
it yourself solar chargers for a while
there when I forget what project advisor
is that the mid season 4 I was looking
into getting solar panels themselves and
they were actually really cheap like
just just the panel itself but it's when
you start getting into like voltage
regulator and the battery and stuff but
if you wanted to you can get these just
it's just a big you know you tell it
what size you want like you know they'll
give you a sheet and it's got two leads
and it gives you voltage it gives you
how much voltage it's getting though and
when it's not getting any sunlight
anymore it's not going to you jack so
right I can play with them yeah Oh
excellent show for you guys tonight if
you've been playing along at home with
the Easter Egg contest we will have the
answer to that at the end of the show
out of 230 contestants if you will for
have one so I'm gonna go ahead and up it
and give all all four of them you know
awesome stuff bachelor and all that fun
stuff congratulations those of you who
are getting baby mat here yeah what is
preferred clone your own you know matt
home kit hmm yeah it's a mad science a
little Dewey support scientific uh
learning and allowing your daughter to
work day after science so um Haley
mcnett brought some really interesting
stuff for us a little later on we're
talking to pack at capturing and
executables yep awesome and I guess
before we get too much into that though
I want to talk about the the PHP contest
that we had last we are the week before
where it was build a procrastination
gmail badge for for your blog or your
website whatever so that people can seal
it like specifically people like me that
are absolutely swamped and always behind
you can see how bogged down I am and
then when you notice like right here and
it's like you know 701 messages on red
kind of get an idea why I haven't gotten
back yeah I was wondering so you didn't
reply to my spam you you uh you program
a lot of PHP that right on not as much
as I used to but I have yeah mm-hmm
these are some really cool like we've
had about 20 submissions and I have two
for you today I'm still going through a
lot more of like some of them get really
involved like our boy Eddie is actually
requires like a sequel database handles
multiple users does like graphing and
charts and stuff for like you know how
your your procrastination level is over
time I feel like there should be some
sort of like manna and hit points now
yeah I mean as long does it have its own
social network oh yeah tax stalkers calm
awesome yes but I wanted to take a quick
look at one of these here i'm showing
off two in particular one is by hunter
and one is by milan and i gotta give
props to Milan for you know delete a ski
at the top of the file but basically
like a lot of them do we're just using
the the imap status function built right
into PHP this was a PHP contests and GD
yeah you know great image library easy
to get going and there we go now the
other one is is and this is what it
looks like you get this is just an image
that is created by this code it checks
it gives you
number one puts in a star maybe we need
to do a little touch up here on the font
there's actually the truetype font with
the GD library you have to actually put
a fun with it so you've got a truetype
font that maybe we could have a little
smaller or something because as you can
see over we have over 99 yeah or maybe
you could just catch up on your gmail
this isn't this is the info hak5 account
so yeah mine's only at a hundred and one
right now I'm looking for results not
excuses okay okay well okay this is the
other one this is hunters and I thought
hunters was very unique because most of
them had would basically you would have
to open the configuration file or open
the PHP file and at the very top of it
you would specify your username for
Gmail and your password this one kind of
cool just passing those variables in the
URL I thought that was kind of a nice
thing not very nice of you know you're
going to just pop it right on your
website right like that you know people
do a little view source we'll talk about
that at the end of show sure and um and
grab that but there's ways in PHP where
you could just call this image that
wouldn't show up in your source yeah
yeah but but this is pretty neat so if
we take a look at the code here whoops
alright you're basically you know the
index PHP is actually all this sweet
little JavaScript and they're actually
themes available for this so different
PNG's Wow things that can be said so
this is a fun one to tweak and then it
just calls this mail dot PHP that
actually does all the dirty work uh-huh
but what's cool is you know like on the
web server here it's just the directory
like it's an index at PHP and we go to
slash hunter / and you put ? u equals
you know your username your password
lame password here and what's cool is at
the very end tee for theme right now
we've got plain and we'll see evil
server found you know and when we
refresh it actually shows when it
refreshes people servers hacking your
inbox there we go and we can actually
change the theme here too kitta
excellent yes and I'm sorry but Lowell
cats win me over every time do you want
yes does want ken has any way one of
those things I know that
not really in depth of technical but I
did want to show off two of those really
cool ones and I'm going through a lot
more of them so we should be seeing a
lot more later on I will have all of the
submissions posted on the new hak5 blog
hak5 org and I would love to see what
you guys think of them as well and I
don't know if I mentioned this in pre
show or on the show but I can't come to
a conclusion I'm still coming to to you
know big winners but everybody that is
submitted and I'm not taking any more
submission we still have a lot to go
through i'm just i'm setting everybody
goodies awesome yeah so it's like Little
League yeah you get the trophy third
grade it's my smiley face and feel good
yeah all I mean the thing is like I feel
bad because some of these like they
worked and then they didn't work or they
don't work out of the box and I've been
trying on like a windows server to linux
servers and I'm just going to take you
know I'm just gonna what is it called
benefit of the doubt benefit of the
doubt that the code worked before you
send it to me I'm assuming they're so
there you go so for future contests just
submit any crap you want it'll make it
that's finer than Ryan figures out this
is why we don't have contests no I'm
just kidding anyway coming up we were
going to be taking a look at how we can
extract windows executables from packet
captures but first I'm gonna head over
to Shannon and see what's going on this
week month in the land party hey guys i
just wanted to give you a quick little
tidbit about this month LAN party we are
playing goldeneye source yeah that's
right finally we're playing over at GES
hak5 gorg on Saturday May thirtieth and
if you're interested in more of our
games you can sign up and vote for your
favorite games or over at hak5 land
squarespace com and i also really want
to mention our wonderful sponsor click
it or ticket i am a personal huge
supporter of the click it or ticket
campaign and if you are interested in
some of their information you can go
over to NH t CA gov and find out some
interesting facts and all sorts of
things about the campaign
like it or ticket a couple of things I
wanted to mention we all know that
seatbelts save lives but did you know
only one in four Americans actually wear
a seatbelt regularly I mean come on guys
it only takes like 30 seconds to put one
on I've gotten into a routine from it
just because I almost got in an accident
when a deer ran in front of the car if I
wasn't wearing my seatbelt I could have
flown out the front of the window back
in two thousand seven seatbelts saved
fifteen thousand lives and it could have
saved five thousand more if those people
were wearing their seatbelts during
their fatal crashes I mean it's a huge
importance to me and it honestly touches
my heart I really want you guys to check
out this campaign it's click it or
ticket at NH t CA gov check it out and
next up we got some interesting
information from 80
have you ever thought it possible to
sniff windows executables over the wire
maybe get your man in the middle on well
80 knows exactly i was going to share
with us that's that's the basic gist of
it right is where we're taking the
support man in the middle thing right
yes well it's not really a man in the
middle right well not in the attacker
were sense but the like malware like
network tap kind of like sysadmin the
white hat side right so what we're
seeing is we're going to see a traffic
come through and in that traffic is
going to be a Windows executable and
we're going to take the pcap and we're
going to extract the standalone windows
executable file out of that packet
capture okay so when it comes to
sniffing the wire I don't know how many
times we've said it but we love
Wireshark great for packet captures is
this something you can do in conjunction
with that is this something that you can
write a filter for it what software we
use in here you actually can use
wireshark and extract it manually in
this case I'm just going to use TCP dump
to get my packet capture just plain and
simple real easy ok so we issue I'm
assuming I know before we get into the
who's in the house and what but why
would we want to do this well for me
it's a particular interest because when
malware comes down I need to know what
it's going to do and I need to be able
to develop network-based signatures and
host-based signatures and so this is
great for getting the network-based
signatures out off the door and then i
can take the stand alone binary load it
up in something like Ida or if you have
a different sandbox environment that you
want to use to pull it apart but anyways
loaded up pull it apart and then from
there it will reverse engineering a
little crack me stuff I like that yep
and then extract a host-based signatures
for it so this is one of those things
where if you I like you know the the you
know host 0 or whatever your your first
infected machine on your large corporate
network something like this and you're
like oh what the f was that right and
you since you've got network tap on some
of these things you get that and then
you can distribute that so that the ids
is the firewalls and stuff know when
they see this to totally reject that
executable yep I like that idea now how
do we go about doing this you said we're
using TCP dump right what other tools do
we need once we've got our
packet stream captured with TCP dump
we're going to use a tool called PCP
extract okay and TCP xtrap essentially
can pull out a number of different files
but of interest to us is Windows
executables in this case so from the
config you can see by default it comes
with stuff like JPEGs gifts and at the
end of the config it's got zip in Java
and what I've done is I've gone ahead
and added signatures for it can to
recognize 16-bit and 32-bit executable
files so like the old ms-dos or TMZ's
and the in the new PE new with pd files
okay so explain to me a little bit about
those headers what is you know I see a
lot of Acts license numbers is it what
what what is this right so these are the
bytes that identify the file header so
in this case when you pull a part of
binary almost all the time you'll see a
windows 32 binary you'll see 45 a which
comes out to the letters MN z capital m
NZ ok so it doesn't matter if this was
built with boreland c or visual studio
or what it if it's 132 executable that's
at the top of it right and then that's
that's for the 16-bit ms-dos format and
then with pease you've got this for byte
sequence of 50 45 and then tune in to
sound like super question with a p/e a
PE PE stands for portable executable
that's the format of executable files on
windows whereas on Linux itself gotcha
so how do how do we go about doing this
now that we have like you know we've
added the signature what's the next step
basically I've just set up a very small
lab here so we've got an XP guest VM
it's going to kick off of an ftp session
up to the ubuntu host it's going to
transfer some executable files and we're
going to be sniffing with TCP dump on
the host once the transfer is done will
let TCP extract pull the executable
files out of out of the pcap and and
then we'll we'll verify that we got the
right things but but that's pretty much
it it's actually a pretty simple step
but it's a good first step when you're
trying to all right let's start our now
let's see how it's done alright so let's
see so first off we've we added the
signatures
so what I've got here in the windows
guest is we're just going to transfer
the calc see a simple simple binary of
course it's always calculator so I've
got a directory here on my desktop
called calc and I copied up the original
calc dot exe and in this directory I was
kind of curious so I also packed it with
a upx on low compression and then high
compression which you can see here with
the dash one in the dash nine respect
either way it's still even though you
packed it it's still an executable
correct or so basically if you're
running this on your IDs in your file or
whatever you can see every executable
you're probably going to see a lot of
not bad executables bunch of like
setup.exe s and stuff like that just
people downloading regular software from
legitimate places yeah yeah so this kind
of ties in with like say you've got a
host that kicks off some other kind of
indicator and so you need to investigate
that hose if you can also see what
traffic has come down to there you might
actually catch one of these like a new
binary coming down that you hadn't seen
before in the and that's where
signatures come in all that fun stuff
yep precisely and so that'll allow you
to develop new signatures all right so
how are we transferring calc we're going
to use FTP I've got an ftp Damon running
on the moon to host and then we're just
going to use the standard ftp client on
Windows so what we'll do is we'll we'll
kick off our sniffer first so as you can
see basically we're not going to try to
resolve the domain name if there is one
for the IP we're going to listen on the
bridge interface snap length is zero so
we try to capture all the bytes in the
packet and then we're just going to
write the pcap out to this file in the
pcap directory as you can see I in my
directory here I made three different
directories clean is going to hold the
files as they come up from ftp pcap is
going to hold the the pcap and then
extracted is going to hold the files
that we pull out of the pcap right
because we're seeing everything over the
wire not just not just real and we're
seeing the handshake on the ftp and
everything yeah that's what your program
does is differentiates those headers and
says oh hey now we're looking at the
school that's so cool it's like a
chapter markers precisely actually says
those words specifically if you used a
dash B flag nice I'm just kidding oh
that's a good dude you there's some cute
you know like that like the cutesy stuff
in the source
yeah that stuff app tap install new and
stuff like that okay so we've got the
sniffer going alright so let's go ahead
and get our ftp session on so we're just
going to move over to that TCP extract
directory and situate ourselves in the
clean directory great and now we're
ready to push our binaries up so we'll
upload all three that we have cool all
right so all three went through okay now
it doesn't matter which way it's going
though because it's just easy hbu dump
right right precisely we're seeing the
packets move so we've got we've got our
pcap we can stop sniffing so what I want
to do first is make md5 sums of all the
clean ones just so we can use those to
check later sure granted this isn't a
realistic scenario you know like I'm not
going to know what binaries coming down
to begin with but in this case just to
verify that it actually did if you
really wanted to like check with the FTP
or the HTTP where it came from you could
maybe go back like I mean you know
unlike sorts of boards or something
you'd find the md5 s but yeah so so I
just had a very small one batch
one-liner to create the md5 sums and put
them in these md5 files so that's that's
all well and good let's go ahead and I
just change ownership real quick of the
the pcap file it just kind of makes it
easier so so I get less errors okay okay
so now we're going to run our pcp
extract app and we're going to specify
two options to it the first one is the
output directory which is our extracted
directory that we mentioned earlier up
to share hop and then the second one is
the dash f flag which is says what file
do i need to look at mm-hmm oh and this
is from the configuration where we said
the executable yep so we're just well
we're looking at the which pcap file
does oh ok you can actually specify
separate config files as well though if
you wanted to so if you had my just my
PE files config and I had just my jpeg
files config or something like that you
can do that as well so we're going to do
our extract now and it's finding the
files in the traffic
okay looks like it finished up now tell
me how does it know where one file began
in one file ended I know that it was
pretty simple as just ftp but there's
some other ftp stuff in between and we
don't want some superfluous data at the
end of our files right so you know
essentially if you if you go low enough
like tcp for example is going to using
the sequence numbers is going to get all
the packets in order okay so we know
that the file is going to come in order
like we'll have it on the disk in order
or in memory in order and so in the
stream you know that if you start if you
find the file header you can follow that
path all the way to the end of the file
and you've reached it right but how do
we know is the end of the file oh that's
just a windows file format I mean that's
that's the doors they're just like he's
always at the top yep I love that
alright so we've got so we've got our
files extracted alright so we're just
going to change your ownership again and
let's make md5 of the new files oh cool
because now we're going to check them
make sure that they match yep or see if
they do matin because i forgot to set
the mode to binary oh right we just sent
over executables and ascii yeah yeah
that's okay hey gone watch this I got I
got a magic trick that I know what was
the it's just tack what you know in ftp
just say what mode space is just just
binary just word binary yeah okay what's
this amazing huh yeah magic of editing
so now that we've done it again this
time with binary let's take a look at
the md5 okay cool so this time
everything should work um so the files
all got extracted again words this time
everything should work trust me know
okay so we've got our files let's go
ahead and do our 11 liner on that yeah
and generate our md5 that's why we need
to use my return to that oh right
ownership it helps okay
hey hey work that time oh you know what
it made too many how many'd you make you
got em d fives of mb x is that yeah its
tax all right okay so this time there we
go excellent we've got em d fives okay
cool so now let's compare all right so
first off let's take a look at the clean
md 5s case oh there are three all right
calc daddy XE calc upx one in calc you x
9 okay and then we'll take a look at the
current ones the extracted one day right
i say okay so kind of a bigger list
there it pulled out it matched a couple
different things but so i see here eight
to nine e and up at the top i see a to
990 okay go so we want 008 let's see
what else i see 389 two and three 892
now of course the way that this is we
don't have the file name right right if
we wanted to go back in the log we could
tell where in the packet capture this
file started and maybe look around there
and probably find it potentially if it
came down say like via FTP or like HTTP
you might be able to see something i can
get requests or or put put you know form
ftp additionally exe files have all
kinds of interesting metadata sometimes
you can find out when they were compiled
what compiler was used stuff like that
so you might even find additional
information in vendor all that fun stuff
okay so it looks like we wanted 0 and 8
and then I think looks like for real
winner also okay so let's let's grab
those files and bring them back up
windows well since we've got the ftp
there sure in binary in binary you again
okay we'll set binary first this time
okay so we're going to go to the
extracted directory this time sure and
we're going to get at one two three four
five six seven eight they're 80 yes I
know I know I do the same thing four and
eight were the other ones I think we
wanted so and as you notice these are
popping up with the cow with the icon
yeah yep because that's built right into
the exe so hopefully it looks like we
got winners the checksum is matched
which is you know obviously
a good thing well double click the exe
that mean it's the most fun thing to do
on windows right yeah I mean us I can't
help it i mean i get emails with them
all the time I just like love clicking
I'm oopsie so there we go calculator and
it works even the stallion versions and
three sorry now okay I think it's
amazing that we can do this that we can
sift the wire and then pull that kind of
stuff out and it's not just executables
right so you can't actually do that like
that's a really cool program for getting
all sorts of I mean you could imagine
when you may be having a little ARP
cache poison fun on a wireless network
that unencrypted and do it with every
jpg sure had a hotel but furthermore
what other kind of stuff can you think
of doing with this I mean what what
where can you extend on this well for me
the extension occurs in once I've got
the standalone binary okay because then
I you know pull it up in ida and and
we'll take a look at it will develop
signatures off of that so because in
your business this is not calculator but
it's now we're right precisely and and
so we're you know we're trying to find
out how people are getting in and how
they're how they're keeping a foothold
in any organization so that when we were
mediate we can lock everyone out but
yeah I mean it's you know think driftnet
but on a bigger scale if you've ever
used driftnet mm which will basically
just same same deal if you can sniff
other people's web browsing sessions you
can feel down with driftnet you can put
on images that they're browsing and then
kind of create a collage same thing here
as far as pulling down the other files
except you've got an extensible
framework to use or an extensible config
where you can add your own header
information pull down different files
yeah and you know what I like about this
is you take a look at something like
well I mean you just did it with ftp
here right and that would set off some
alarm bells on most you know lockdown
systems anyway but then there's things
like fast track have you played with
that where they actually open up debug
dot exe yeah right don't like stuff yeah
and then just dump the hex code and
everything just dump the binary file
right into the console yep well guess
what they're dumping the your your ex 47
all that or whatever it is yep yeah
that's awesome yep
executable files are going to have that
same header and then with some
potentially evil stuff if you can read
this and see that it's an executable do
you think there's potential there that
with some poems maybe you could
intercept that well as going through the
wire and then use your own Packer to
maybe add some extra fun data to the
executable yeah so maybe maybe you
wouldn't necessarily need a packer but
you could use like you could take
advantage of potential code caves or
other opportunities to inject your own
code and patch in stream which would be
kind of interesting you know 80 we're
gonna have to have you on again because
you get me thinking all sorts of crazy
stuff I like it and we hope you guys do

internet announcing to the public

hanging out with fans signing every
autograph is shaking every hand I've
been out promoting the only way I know
showing off my flow while I'm blowing it
my shows I'm not on stage live ripping
the set it's only because I've been at
work chained to my desk I've been
stressed about my talent and capacity
and if this new album could compare to
Las reality truthfully I've been
wondering if we finished I've been
living a dream and I'm loving every
minute what's up Internet what's up hak5

totally the place to be and as always in
keveth's at Def Con and I'm sure we'll
be back in now you keep saying us but I
mean when are we gonna see like UNC 64
yeah that's what I really want to see I
know I I want to see it too did he have
like the tables and like you guys I
that's cool he um you know just on the
other side of the Atlantic Ocean so its
source yet right now um he's in he's
probably at home in in the UK oh the UK
okay but he and his girlfriend are
actually going on holiday and as they
say yeah yeah to Italy and my girlfriend
I went to Italy so we're like feeding
all this stuff like like hey go here and
check this out and stuff like that says
it's pretty cool his girlfriend's a
hacker that's nice I've ever anyway
she's quick on her feet so uh so you got
some easter egg stuff we started this
contest and I had no idea how how much
response there was going to be with it I
mean we did a hunt back in like the
first season and you know what my fault
for not doing one again we are gonna be
doing some more Easter egg hunts that is
for sure they are so much fun yeah what
was it like 230 countries 230
submissions of which we had one winner
and then after last episode went out
where you talked about steganography
there were three more so lucky yeah well
that's the thing i like the idea
I mean you watch HAC 522 love you watch
hak5 to learn and it's good to be able
to stretch your technol us and make it
happen so you know just drop to the
prompt and you know have some fun so you
know don't think that this is a passive
experience any bit because you never
know what gift on the website or what
open port or what series of ports that
you may have to knock is just going to
lead you to the next rat hole hmm you
guys want to see how it's done yes I
will walk you through the entire Easter
egg hunt don't wake and show you how
it's done for those that didn't make it
past checkpoint 2 but first I do want to
thank one of our awesome sponsors and
that is this episode Coors Light let me
tell you may 15th a cold front is coming
nationwide cold front the the 8 10 12
and 16 ounce cold activated cans are
coming and to celebrate there is a
massive 30-foot cold front taking over
the waterways of Seattle la New York
Lillian yeah and do check it out cool
the cold front org is where you can go
and find all the times and locations to
just get your groove on it's gonna be so
much fun um at the course and listen at
Coors Light they've made cold beer their
policy so when the mountains turn from
white to blue haha your beers as cold as
the Rockies that's awesome so you can
already get your cold activated cans is
you can before May fifteenth yeah but
may succeed that's one the 8 10 12 yeah
and 16 ounce so you know we're rocking
the it's love ounce come by mmm cheers
and thank you course for sponsoring this
fine programming so uh you want to jump
into the shell and what okay cool so
here's how you do it basically the only
clue you had starting out with arty T
dot hak5 org that's it now if you write
for a while you know we've talked about
nmap and now I'm not going to bore you
with that so let's just get down to it
the end map that you find out that port
23 is open it also just talked about
netcat so let's just go ahead and issue
netcat RTT hak5 dot org and if you and
mapped it you found 23 is open you go
there and you get a look a lot of lovely
ASCII characters but oh yeah BAM there
you go your clue is and you
get a whole bunch of gibberish and I
actually had to put this note here
because people were trying to
brute-force this ftp there's no user
account associated with it so no good
luck trying to get that right but what's
important here is it says order a sample
from microsoft pharmaceuticals they've
decided to open additional factories
worldwide to meet this great demand okay
well the thing is if you google I'm
sorry use that as a verb Google that's
okay all of us do there we go Mike chef
articles open open additional factories
right you are going to find new bloob
com alright and what you want to do is
order a sample okay now unfortunately
due to high demand especially among halo
3 players they are completely out of
stock okay well this isn't good at this
is okay so all along the Easter egg hunt
there are checkpoints in their codes and
this is how I verify that you have
actually made it to the next step now
let's go back to the gibberish here
right so we've got this this junk here
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense
right yeah so what we're going to do is
we're going to take that and we're going
to pop that into and I just use a simple
web-based but there's plenty programs
they'll do this convert rot13 which is
basically saying gimme you know offset
offset everything by 13 characters 26
letters in the alphabet you know rot13
it twice and it's back to its aim so
evil server is proud of you you've
reached checkpoint and you got a code so
you take that code you pop it into a
special website which is hak5 org slash
RTT by the way RTT is egg and rot 13
yeah oh yeah I see what you did there
yeah yeah so so you continue to hunt
evil server once a song in a treat well
here we go so we have googled that and
we found new bloob and here's what
really threw people for a living they
just had to use nmap they hit used
netcat these rot13 right and then now to
this page it's real simple they just
view source I know right it's like 1996
and you're trying to get a jiff off of
some anime fan site all over again so
we'll scroll down here and
like oh hey keeps going look at that
scroll bar and you know nothing to see
here move long and then right there at
the very bottom we've got more gibberish
and hey could you imagine what this
might be go ahead and copy that back to
Marv inverter yeah and it says it was
our smiles you know you get the next
checkpoint yeah got it right well what's
also in this source here is a URL to
Paul the camera guy com / images now
normally I would pop in HT access or
even a blank index file and you know
keep everything all pretty but here we
go we get a directory listing now these
images are no these gifts not that much
fun what's important though is remember
you'll server wants a treat he wants
cake well yeah I mean who wouldn't want
some cake that's a tree cake so we take
a look that's not a lie oh yes a lie so
this is as you might imagine an Atari
2600 cake acquired with fair use off the
internet and it is awesome dude I would
eat this man that's what it started on
right I don't know if I could eat that
is so beautiful yeah so what's important
about this image and and if you watch
last week's show you know that what we
need to do here and let me just double
you get this real quick I think I know
so we've got the cake it's not a lie
let's go ahead and use Steg hide and
just like Shannon showed you it's just
with Steg hide and extract dash SF
source file and it's cake.jpg and oh hey
we need a passphrase now real simple we
just come back to our converter and we
take the code from the previous
checkpoint kasi is the password I know
huh and there we go we've got yes txt
week at es and we have the next little
bit and what's cool here is clear this
list it convert it
all right he's proud he's happy you're
quite resourceful and your reward is
this code okay so we've got a new code
great so we pop that into the thing now
the final code he lets you know that the
final code is the name of the song it's
very important so what's the song
obviously and you know what in
retrospect pleasure should put the song
at a different URL because some people
notice that there was a song in a treat
and I guess it wasn't clear what order
but if you some people start a brute
forcing the song god zip and that's not
the yeah so anyway I've made a big
lesson learned doing these contests in
the future yeah and that's one of the
reasons why this technology second got
pushed up to to this anyway but I think
we have let me grab song real quick come
on alright so song zip all right what
was it unzip song zip okay so we need to
pass or guess what it is guys then I
guess it's the previous thing okay so
we've got song dog right and
there we go okay now here's a digested
to write so what's important is not that
it's song dog that's not the name
there's no metadata in here there's no
like I b3 hear any stuff like that right
what's important is what is the name
name that tone right name that time and
anybody that grew up in the 90s with the
Freak scene or here's another little
hint mmm 2626 hundred it's it's the tone
hell yes blue box or you know the the
Cap'n Crunch wishing yeah so anyway that
is is the fourth answer maybe it
should've been more specific maybe I
should have said you know the the last
answer is four digits but yes hey you
know that's that's smart very smart I'm
learning a lot about about the way the
questions that people ask on this hunt
and I gave no you no preference to
anyone and everybody like I just repeat
the answer that they got from evil
server but next time I do this I got
some crafty ideas about how to make it
fair make it not not ridiculous and
still challenge so I think it's cool cuz
it's a good way to like learn some of
this stuff yeah they're naughty
steganography for example I find that if
I don't actually practice you know what
I do you know you gotta practice like
you're preaching on it that stuff
awesome thank you for showing us well
it's a little more fun I do not have the
names at my disposal at the moment and
if I pull up a secret website yeah how
dude are you kidding they're gonna be
late plastered all over the place it's
gonna be great if I wow they're probably
one right there for people out of 231
right there Wow congratulations to you
