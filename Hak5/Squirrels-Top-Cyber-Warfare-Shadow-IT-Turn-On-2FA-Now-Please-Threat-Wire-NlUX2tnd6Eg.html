rise goodbye internet explorer kind of
Cisco's shadow IT tools and ponies all
that more coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Patrick Norton and this is
the first threat wire of 2016 January
thirteenth 2016 to be exact your summary
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom and hey quick shout-out
to all our supporters at patreon calm /
threat wire I love me some perspective
especially this early in the new year so
let's talk about cyber squirrel won the
title on the Washington Post article
about cyber swirl one says quote are
squirrels a bigger threat to the power
grid than hackers and it's a great
question since the crew of researchers
behind the cyber squirrel which exists
to point out one fascinating thing for
all the bluff and bluster about 21st
century cyber warfare we must protect
mirka critical infrastructure spy on all
the people Thank You Diane Feinstein
there's been one case of a hacker taking
down a power grid and that was in the
Ukraine but squirrels chewing through
power lines happens all the time
constantly seriously look at the map on
cyber squirrel 1.com that mass of orange
pins you see that's just 2015 and yeah
it includes birds Coon snakes rats and
on beavers along with squirrels on the
list Russia and China get the big zeros
the US has I guess 1.4 Stuxnet it's hard
to tell but seriously cyber squirrel one
has a point don't believe the hype they
got a great quote from john c english
former deputy director of the National
Security Agency you says quote I don't
think paralysis of the electrical grid
is more likely by cyber attack than by
natural disaster and frankly the number
one threat experience to date by us
electrical grid is squirrels now we just
need to convince Congress to do things
like um stop spying on the American
people and fun government agencies like
the OPM so they have property IT
staffing to secure critical data and
maybe maybe then we can talk about going
house to house and wiping out all the
squirrels let's see that bill make the
floor and people this is sarcasm don't
SiC PETA on me I don't have time for it
we hope to talk to the Cypress 401 crews
soon they've got an interesting story to
tell shadow IT well it sounds like you
came straight from a bad TV show about
hacker
cisco's new cloud consumption as a
service which launched this morning
promises to help IT monitor the use of
tools that aren't deployed by IT that
have become critical to employees think
doc sheets gmail Dropbox this is all an
interesting report by Business Insider
the shadow IT concept also covers things
like well YouTube consumption Spotify
and pretty much anything else you might
run on the network that I didn't put
there or give you a password for why
well imagine if you are dealing with
medical data and you need to figure out
if anything anybody's doing their
network will violate HIPAA regulations
or if you want to monitor bandwidth
consumption track potential mal well
vectors or malware as most humans would
call it any case you might be wondering
why you should care about strange IT
tools that live in the cloud to make sis
admins lives easier look anybody that
doesn't already understand that you
pretty much have no rights on the
internet access in the office you need
to know that and with tools like this
it's even easier for anything you do in
the corporate network to be monitored
and potentially hey engineers that want
a patent owned by a corporation now
Cisco says a typical company with 5,000
employees has 1200 shadow IT apps
running though that might be a bit of
fun from Cisco given that IT pros
estimate the number is around 90 or it
could be that Cisco knows a lot more
about what's moving around on your
network because there's Cisco it's an
interesting read check it out and
remember kids don't put anything on the
network at work that you don't want to
share with your boss or at least the IT
staff Adobe and Microsoft dropped a
modest flurry of patches on yesterday's
patch tuesday at least compared to the
flood the veritable flood of updates the
hit in december the biggest one for me
though was ms 16 dash 001 that's the
cumulative security update for internet
explorer which is the brace for impact
people last update for internet explorer
8 9 and 10 on windows seven so if you or
any of your family friends or coworkers
are way behind the curve on IE it is
time to get them updated to IE 11
because that's the only one that's
getting patches moving forward as in any
flaws that are found in older versions
of ie are not going to get patched and
since IE is a part of Windows yay not
something you can uninstall that's a big
hole you want to make sure it's plugged
sophos is naked security blog and some
good write-ups on this and we've linked
to them in the show notes and from the
seriously people it's time to turn on
dual fat
authentication department here threat
wire motherboard has learned that
several personal accounts and the home
phone number of the Director of National
Intelligence James clapper have been
compromised by the same group of
self-proclaimed stone teenage hackers
that broke into CIA director John
Brennan's email account last year or
more accurately John Brennan's AOL email
account says a lot right there look AOL
as far as I know does not offer dual
authentication options for their email
but just about every other email
platform does and seriously it is time
to turn on dual factor authentication
you may not be the head of a major
government agency but it's not a bad
idea to lock your stuff down if you go
to two factor auth org you'll find an
amazing resource for figuring out what
tools online do offer you a chance for
an additional layer of security
two-factor authentication dual fact or
whatever you want to call it that
basically means like to get into this
you also need access to some sort of I
don't know text message from your phone
a key fob a special account number but
something that requires two layers one
of which is not accessible on the
computer to get into your account not a
bad idea and something really more
people should be looking into foolproof
no better than nothing absolutely I read
your comment today comes from Marquis
Richardson up on YouTube who in response
to the five biggest acts of 2015 says
quote nothing against patreon but they
were hacked also the hak5 teen to set up
a Bitcoin accounts where people can just
contribute okay Marquis you think the
Bitcoin secure and I'm with you on that
the math seems pretty good the problem
is all the mechanisms between Bitcoin
and buying a sandwich or a can of cat
food if you think those are secure well
that's cute because well let's see we've
had exchanges collapse wallets that have
been hacked and of course there's the
whole volatility of the exchange rate
which has been stable for a while but
it's an exchange that exists in a
virtual world which makes it even less
sort of well stable I think than the
ones in New York City seriously it's a
possibility but we're going to have to
talk about it team threat wire before we
even go anywhere near that direction
thanks to comment Marquis if you have
any thoughts on today's show please
leave them down below and seriously
everybody does contribute on patreon I
really really appreciate it if you enjoy
the show kicking some cash to keep it
going become a patron at patreon.com /
threat liar and we may even feature
you're adorable fur babies I can't
speak today people like this one this
one that one that one right there and if
you are a pet person send us a picture
of your favorite car truck or Ethernet
connection and will feature that right
there too seriously patreon lets us make
this show completely independent and ad
free if you can't donate a like share
and subscribing goes quite a long way to
you combine all our episodes links to
our social networks in other ways to
contribute over at threat wire net with
that i'm patrick norton and i will see
you on the interwebs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
