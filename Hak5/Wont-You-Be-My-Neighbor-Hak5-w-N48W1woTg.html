your neighbors Darren takes a trip
around your network using nmap one to
obscure your OS fingerprint make a
windows box look like a printer I've got
just the thing and that takes a first
look at in a para and 24 smart gigabit
switch all that and more on this episode
of hak5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by Netflix Go Daddy and Squarespace hey
guys we're back in the kitchen last time
we were here we were doing a little bit
of cooking chicken noodle soup I wasn't
feeling so well today feel much better
but guess what I'm not feeling like
cooking some having a beer there you go
that's all there is to it and speaking
of last time we were here in the kitchen
we were doing a little bit of online
brute-forcing using TS grinder to you
know take advantage of some windows
terminal services stuff and in that
segment i mentioned i will just find our
target using nmap and this is a
reoccurring thing throughout the show
we're just like I is not n map but we've
never really you know dive into it and
so this show is pretty much dedicated to
the network right so we got some stuff
on obfuscation on some cool switches and
i'm going to show you guys and some
examples of how to use n map because i
find it's not this isn't meant to be
like super comprehensive but as an
introduction and you know learn by
example this is kind of fun way to start
talking about poking around your network
seeing who your neighbors are so i guess
the big question is why would we want to
scan our network and so how and how do
we go about that well first of all as a
systems administrator it's really
important to know what your assets are
the mac address of the IP addresses the
descriptions of all the printers and
servers and everything else they've got
littered around your office and that's
kind of important because you don't want
some rogue device showing up and maybe
just as a grey hat or something you
might want to you know poke around
someplace that you've just showed up and
you know look for services and open
ports and other fun stuff like that I'm
not going to get too deep into that and
then just as you know regular user say
look you're on a public Wi-Fi or you're
you know in a dorm you want to make sure
that the guy next to you isn't like
bleeding malware all over the place
because you know that perimeter firewall
did you nothing so take care of yourself
know who your neighbors are so what are
we going to need to do this obviously
nmap it is arguably the best security
scanner available it's on the command
line it's open source and you can get it
for you know linux bsd Mac os10 even
windows and for those alike gooeys check
out the Zen map it's cool front end GUI
for it you can learn by example there
but I'm going to just go ahead dive in
here in
backtrack 4 I guess before I get too far
maybe I should explain a little bit of
the theory but please understand that
too much a lot of the theory is outside
the scope of this short segment here if
you want more of that just email me but
basically the idea behind this at least
on the TCP side is that we're taking
advantage of the three-way handshake I'm
saying he's my target there are 65535
ports available i'm going to send a syn
packet to each of those and now that i
get an acknowledgement or an act packet
back then i know that there's something
there that's really like the back of the
book or maybe even the side of the book
version i got some links in the show
notes some awesome books and some some
white papers you can read if you're
interested in the theory but let's just
go ahead and dive in to some examples
and then you know figure it out from
there so i'm going to go ahead and I'm
backtrack 4 beta here and I'll just fire
up and map and if you don't have this in
your liking to buy in its apt get
install an app really easy and we're
going to go ahead and just scan our
subnet here which is 1010 Oh star and
let that run I can just hit enter here a
couple of times and see how it's zero
percent done all right this is great so
we've got a whole bunch of results here
and if we scan through them we can see
we've got some interesting host we've
got some interesting ports but really
it's not in anything that we can really
easily read through and get an
understanding let's go ahead and target
our network and say like we're
specifically just interested in
microsoft terminal services so we'll do
this again and do nmap dash p for the
port 3389 because we know that's where
that runs and we're going to put it on
1010 Oh star and this time we're going
to use the OG for old gangsta option
actually it's an output thing that's
capable and we'll make it rdp to txt
great alright so now we're done and
we've got the file our DB to text so
let's go ahead and take a look at and
there we go we've got a ton of you know
ports but some of them are open some of
them close some of them are filtered and
that's not really all we want so the
cool thing is in this format we can just
go ahead and pass it to grep and say
we're only looking for open and now
we've got a much prettier list we see
we've got three potential targets here
but what if we wanted
the IP address is because we can do some
cool stuff we can actually send it back
into nmap we're going to pipe that to
cut make our delimiter a space and say
we want the second field and you can see
there we go it's just the IP so we
wanted the first field or the third
field that's kind of cool but we just
want the second field our ip's so let's
go ahead and make a file add that to a
file called open rdp text right so just
make sure that that's their open rdp yep
and there they are so we can actually
send this right back into nmap so it's
going to save us a little bit of time
you can imagine if we were doing a
gigantic network how this could come
into play so for these three hosts here
I'll just run and map and I'm going to
use the tack Oh capitulo option here and
that's going to give me an OS
fingerprint I'm going to find out what
operating system that target is actually
running because you know if I want to do
a little online brute force it's going
to bear it's really going to matter for
me at least in this particular service
whether it's vista or XP depending on
the version of rdp the ring so i'm going
to go ahead and give it tech I capital L
and our file that we created there and
we should be good to go so let's go
ahead and let that scan so we're we have
it we've got a scan of just those three
IP addresses and with the tech oh we can
actually take a look here at the
operating system we can see that this
one is running windows server 2003 we
can come up here and see that this one
actually is a little unknown and whatnot
so and then this one is windows XP so we
can actually also use this to detect
kind of the what the services are so I
mean I know you know the 3389 is most
likely the Microsoft normal service but
let's go ahead and Cory it anyway so on
this of this host here the 10-1000 180
let's go ahead and run nmap with a tech
s and we're going to tell if we want
port 3389 on 1010 Oh 180 and there we go
we have verified that port 3389 is open
and it is microsoft RB rdp or Terminal
Service if you
well so there you go real simple just a
couple of commands to get you started
the best way is to really just start
playing with it alright guys so this
month's LAN party is two games we've got
a zombie smorgasbord for you we've got
left for dead and zombie panic you can
hit up the game servers all month long @
zp hack 5 org and l4d hak5 org we're
gonna be playing saturday februari 28th
at three p.m. eastern you can find all
the details about our land parties and
upcoming land parties at hak5 land
squarespace com where you can also
recommend your own game that you want us
to play with you for the hak5 land I
have no idea why I'm doing this with my
hands but it looks awesome right which
reminds me we want to thank our
fantastic sponsor Squarespace with
squarespace plans start at eight dollars
a month and you can get ten percent off
the life of your contract by using
coupon code hak5 you know we we talk
about simplicity with squarespace all
the time however if you really want to
get into the nitty gritty there's a
feature called wireframe mode which
allows you to edit the CSS directly and
create and craft your website as you see
fit so if you're really good with CSS
and you know the XHTML and blah blah
blah blah all the other languages that I
stopped learning about back when I was
in eighth grade you know go ahead get
your wireframe mode on and get ten
percent off the life of your contract by
using the coupon code hak5 we're going
to be checking out a brand new nuh para
n24 switch this is going to be the first
video review that you're ever going to
see on this amazing network security
switch all wrapped into one and Shannon
is coming up with you know hiding your
OS identify fire or something like that
uh I don't know Shannon take the way
Darren's over there right now hacking
into a bunch of Windows machines next
door I run a windows box I'm a little
paranoid so I downloaded this nifty
little tool called OS Fisk a 0.3 by our
helpful friend iron geek basically what
this tool does is obscure camouflage
your Windows machine to look like
something completely different you could
come up like a
linux machine our freebsd doesn't matter
it's up to you you have to remember that
different os's they do networking a
little bit differently these tiny minut
differences in the registration keys
they're used to detect different os's
through and map or any other kind of
tool like that this tool it's not
foolproof it's not a foolproof method
whenever you use it you have to remember
that it's not going to keep Darren from
getting into your machine if he wants to
he could still go in there and find out
that you're actually running a Windows
machine so I suggest at the least get a
firewall or something like that
especially your if you're on a hostile
network like say Moo cons network not
saying it's a bad network or anything
it's not but just in case so let's go on
to how you're going to actually run this
tool ok so the first thing you're going
to do is pull up your registry editor
like so and you're going into your
parameters folder this is the folder
where all of your modifications are
going to happen as you can see these are
the different keys that are going to be
changed so you're going to go into your
parameters and the first thing you want
to do is export a copy of this just in
case you need a backup which I made a
backup already right here so I'll just
replace that one for now but all my
computer is popping up as if it's a
windows machine which it is right now if
you go into one of these registry keys
going to modify and click on decimal I
currently have the TCP window size value
data is up that is three to seven six
seven now if I wanted to go into one of
the OSP skate profiles say I'm going to
go into novell their window size is
16384 so there's a big difference right
there already if you wanted to you could
probably do this manually just going
through every registry key and changing
everything by hand but a westview skate
is going to let you do this in a couple
of seconds just a couple of clicks
that's all you have to do
so you're going to go up to choose OS
profile to apply and I'm going to go
with novell of course click apply it's
going to ask me to reboot before I
restart though i'm going to show you
guys the TCP window size difference now
that I modified it so I go in here to
modify click on decimal you can see that
the value data is now like a novell OS
press ok and restart my computer so now
that i've rebooted let's go over to
darren and see if my computer is showing
up as a Nobel machine alright so as you
can see my computer isn't even showing
up with an OS n map is not even
detecting what kind of os it is it has
no clue that I have a Nobel now it has
no clue that I'm a windows machine but I
do have to stress how important it is
that this isn't security its obscurity
it's not going to completely protect you
from Darren hacking into your Windows
machine but it might make him bypass it
and if you want to check out more of
iron geeks awesomely cool tools you can
check out his website which I will have
in the show notes and you can also email
me some feedback in questions at snub
stock snubs at hak5 org or shannon at
hak5 org next up we're going to talk
about some nuh para but first we got
some trivia for you alright so it's time
for trivia and I gotta confess I really
hosed it up last week oops it was just
about as lame as the security and the
the password there so anyway I've
actually given the responsibility over
to snubs who is much better at managing
that kind of stuff than I am so look
forward to awesome new trivia goodness
as always you guys can just go ahead and
pick up the little hints there put them
together assemble the password and punch
it into hak5 org slash trivia to find
out how you can enter to win awesome
hak5 swag gifts and all sorts of other
fun stuff this week we are giving away
our Astra's for taos awesome hacker
documentary hackers are people too so
check that out now before we get going i
want to thank our sponsor godaddy get
reliable secure web hosting without the
long term contract go daddy's hosting
plans are bigger and better than ever
with 99 percent uptime three twenty four
seven support and no
newell commitment Plus as a fan of pack
5 you can get your dot com domain for
749 when you check out with code hack 3
so next up let's go check in with Matt
and see what's going on with that panera
switch it turns out it's an ax paris
which well i'm hungry so let's check out
the new paris which alright guys so
today I'm going to be telling you about
the new para and 24 now about a week ago
I was offered a chance to participate in
the new pair up beta program there's a
hundred small to medium size business IT
managers who have now been shipped and
haven't had a chance to play within
ampera and 24 a little bit of a
background before we actually get into
what the device does the new para is a
network switch it's a gigabit 24 port
switch interesting sidebar it has a hdmi
cable for an uplink but funny stuff
aside what we're going to do is actually
take a look at why this switch differs
from any other switches you can possibly
Bob now in Windows XP service pack 3 and
Windows Vista there was a feature
introduced called windows nap stands for
windows network access protection which
allows devices on your network to be
able to tell if your computer has been
you know upgraded recently if it has its
stuff turned on if it has the firewall
if it has antivirus and all that other
good stuff so why is this important well
if you're managing a network you don't
you know a small to medium sized network
you don't have all the resources that
you know some global conglomerate has
security resources things of that nature
it makes it a lot easier to manage you
know who's connecting to your firewall
or excuse me to your network and
basically goes through and you know
verifies that they are up to snuff to be
on your network so what we're going to
do is right now we're going to go ahead
and we're going to take a look at the
new para and 24 this is the first video
overview
/ review that you guys are going to see
on the internet I can promise you this
much an impaired it into go beta which
is what we're actually a part of is a
very slick web cloud / local on the
switch kind of software it's a loud
which hopefully could be fixed with a
bio some pretty cool what I'm going to
show you actually is then a parrot
interface now this isn't stored in the
cloud but what you can actually see here
is an overview of the switch which our
ports are you know unprotected are
protected great the nice thing is we can
actually monitor health of the devices
connecting to the switch much like we
you know said earlier I am plugged into
I believe port 11 so here we can enforce
health now what is health let's go ahead
and say health is your firewall is
turned on your anti-spyware OS updates
and everything is current great these
are things that people and clients
should have turned on and updated if
they're connecting to your network so
what we're going to do is we're going to
go ahead and enable the health
monitoring for clients so we're going to
hit save actually first we're going to
require health diagnosis we're going to
hit save so now if I come over here and
click Devices IBM lappy is what I'm
actually connecting on we're going to
delete this we're going to go back over
to the switch just to make sure that
port 11 is enforced and if I try and go
to boom what do we have here we have a
portal which is telling us your computer
health has been undiagnosed you're a
newbie I don't know who you are and I
don't know what your is containing
so what we're going to do is we're going
to actually download the enabler which
is 161 kilobyte file I've actually got
three copies up here because I've been
testing the crap out of this segment
health enabler we're going to run health
enabler and what this is going to do is
it's actually going to turn on about
five or six different services
is that are actually going to then
report back to the switch so once the
health enablers run it's going to enable
the nap it's going to monitor the
firewall and anything else that you guys
have installed that the switch requires
for you to have access now until you
actually run and authenticate and you're
healthy with the network switch it VLANs
you out of the entire local subnet no
pinging no nothing so now we come back
here after we've run the enabler and we
click refresh Oh guess what because I
now meet the health requirements of the
switch we have full network access we
can continue and there is google now
some of you are saying why exactly are
we going to use a switch to maintain
health values for our pcs well if you
have people coming in and you have
people connecting to your network this
works on wireless you can plug on 200
different devices into the switch and
have them all monitored it's very easy
to set up I set it up in about 10
minutes beyond that you're going to have
a level of you know I can breathe easier
knowing that people's firewalls and
everything else is turned on now you can
also enable guest access so that people
can access the internet but none of your
local resources on your intranet nuh
para is you know a new company was
founded by one of the dudes who did some
crazy stuff with watchguard but beyond
that it's a different way to look at
network security and i highly recommend
you guys check it out no para calm the
product is the n24 and I will go into
perhaps a little bit more detail as to
turning different stuff on and some
other features in impera besides health
monitoring so right now we are going to
wrap up the show and it's been a great
one I you know everybody's sitting down
and they're pumped about this episode so
let's wrap up the show and get you guys
out of here and let's take a break
cheers guys cuz you know we would pound
fists but then we'd look like some other
show that's already been done we just
pound beers here we go yeah well we
pound peers without clinking with each
other pow what mmm how no I rude beer
dot H little C++ jokes to my mofos Oh
delicious oh my special duty a block to
I forgot what it was do you know we're
supposed to be teasing a bunch of stuff
right yeah that's lock is all designed
for it's good to see you guys though it
definitely yeah season five you excited
I am NOT for the table that I have to
build though well see they don't like
we're getting a new table yeah well
roly-polies falling apart and up Eddie
which is the name of the glass thing if
you look on amazon you can find your own
for about 120 i actually had somebody a
spitter like where do i get the table Oh
amazon.com get a search uppity yeah see
we're not that podcast it just goes and
gets the ikea table we would step it up
a notch we went amazon good enough for
ikea we had to go with amazon i don't
want to drive to woodbridge Oh meet up
in DC or richmond anyway someday right
soon i guess when it's warm it's warm
out now yeah if you're in the virginia
area it's a big area we're thinking
about going to meet up I've been hearing
a lot of stuff on Twitter and IRC and it
turns out there's a ton of you guys
Greater Richmond Hampton Roads Northern
Virginia let's kick it man yeah uh we
have wait a blast you know last week at
shmoocon and yeah meeting everybody was
absolutely insane there were so many
people signed a bunch of stuff for
people i never thought i would sign
boobies and that guy had big ones too
well you know we was the kind of smelled
keep going anyway there was a picture
online of a I forget her name actually
but she was supporting hak5 I'm real
estate you can check out to twitpic
something to it that yeah yeah yeahs
errands to it back sorry
I remember her yeah that was fun party
um we probably should actually do what
we're supposed to do in this thing so
why don't why don't we have some actual
viewer questions for you guys that we
will get to in just a moment but Shannon

art and images in photoshop illustrator
and other cool applications you can
catch full episodes every Monday noon
eastern nine Pacific on revision 3.com
so I think we have some questions cuz
they do we have a question yeah oh we
have two questions especially the first
question is from Brian Brian rights I
know I can tell my Windows machine to
shut down from a batch file by using the
shutdown command is there a way to make
a computer go into standby or hibernate
instead you know i have actually
recently have a similar issue with my
computer of horse
you did well you see there's this thing
I got the stamp printer daily and it's
totally legit 2 3 d barcode scanner
printer dealies printer not a sweeter
that's gainer no Anna facts olive oil
gadget porn but anyway so um anyway that
might when his machine won't shut down
or I'm sorry I won't sleep or hibernate
if this thing is plugged in such a pain
I gotta and then I found googling with
all this other fun stuff anyway it's at
the bottom of the screen run that and
suspend from the command line or run
that hibernate from the command line
hook it up yo ah yeah second question we
have a second question Oh Christian is
from zeroth f and he's asking evil
server this question his query is kill
all humans ? so many new options so
little time windows live messenger I
think he's in hotmail so uh you know I
prefer to all humans after torturing
them with the marathon's okay of Titanic

crab why we could get steps down are you
thank you guys for tuning into season 5
episode 1 we appreciate your feedback
headed up act five forms or on the wiki
or on everywhere else Twitter and
charities gonna take my mic set building
a new one we will see you next week
trust your technica stuff Oh what slaps
what camera do 150 on where it start we
all start this is awesome show for the
next ten minutes you and me all about
kittens and you know I know that you
will keep watching because died again do
this ready one take my name is one take
