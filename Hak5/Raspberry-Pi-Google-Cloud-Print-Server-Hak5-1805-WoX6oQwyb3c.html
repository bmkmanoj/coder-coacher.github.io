by domain.com hey everyone and welcome
to this episode of hack 5 my name is
shannon morris and he's not here this
week again he's gone he's down at South
by Southwest he's actually hanging out
down there for like 24 hours and I'm so
jealous I want to go to South by
Southwest I've never been but anyway we

this week I decided to take a step back
from all the hard way no mods that I've
been doing even though it's super super
fun but it's also very complicated so
it's nice to take a break now and then
well Darren brought up this question to
me so we have a whole bunch of printers
here and they're all connected on the
network but we wanted to set up a Google
Cloud Print with a server on a printer
but not have to keep a PC on all the
time because in order to have Google
Cloud Print running you have to keep its
owner printer or its owner PC on all the
time for others to access it through
that PC so we didn't really want to deal
with all that electricity and all those
issues so he was like well can we
connect this through a Raspberry Pi and
I was like sure of course we can well
apparently you can there's actually an
awesome tutorial by how to geek it's
called how to turn a Raspberry Pi into a
Google Cloud Print server so I decided
to do this on my own and I ran into a
few complications with it so I figured I
would go through it and just share some
of my experiences with you guys so you
can set it up on your own machines and
on your own network so first off of
course we're doing a Raspberry Pi so you
do have to download the raspbian wheezy
image you just stick it onto an SD card
with win32diskimager power up your PI
and then you give your PI all sorts of
SD card space and additional storage
because you'll probably need that you
also want to enable SSH when you first
boot up your Raspberry Pi which I can't
go through since I already set that up
and then you would just want to boot
into the desktop make any changes that
you want to specifically for your own
profile and you're good to go
of course you do need internet for this
because it's supposed to be on the
network and you want to do a couple of
little simple scripts sudo apt-get
upgrade and sudo apt-get update and then
we want to do this thing where we add a
program called cups so cups is for any
kind of Linux UNIX operating systems
it's called the common UNIX printing
system aka cups so to install this it's
very simple sudo apt-get install cups
and then you want to create an new user
once it's finally installed if you're
using a Raspberry Pi it does take a long
time so just go grab a soda or something
and wait for it to install once you have
it set up and I'll show you this on my
Raspberry Pi you do
to put in a couple of commands so the
first one is going to be sudo user mod
so we're modifying the user's tak a tak
capital G tech capital G I hate this
keyboard LP admin and then PI so pi LP
admin that's going to be our group in
our user for this Raspberry Pi that
we're going to be connecting to a
printer once you have that done you want
to actually edit a config file so this
one is going to be found in / Etsy slash
cups slash cups SD con for a conf and in
order to get into that you'll do a
second command and this is going to be
sudo nano and nano is how you're going
to be able to edit it let's see slash
cups slash cups decon when you open that
you'll get this lovely little material
here so there are a couple of different
things that you need to edit here first
off you want to only listen for
connections from the local machine so
you want to scroll down and find that
line here it is
listen localhost colon 6 3 1 port 631
you want to edit that little part right
there so you add port 631 631 is going
to be what's actually the printer so
you'll be able to find the printer on
your network after that there's just a
couple of other things you want to add
in you want to scroll down a little bit
farther and find location restrict
access to the server so let's scroll
down there we go alright so restrict
access to the server we're going to add
order allow comma deny under allow at
local order allow comma deny again and
then under what is this one restrict
access to configuration file order allow
comedy night again and allow at local
and scroll down a little bit farther and
the last one you want to look for is
auth type default require user a system
so we find that one oh it's up here
and we also out order allow comedy night
as along with allow at local now once
you've done that you also want to
restrict the access to the configuration
files and add in the order allow comedy
night allow it local and save exit and
you're done with that so in order for me
to get out of here I'm just gonna hit
ctrl X cuz I've already saved everything
and then we're back at our regular
screen now in order to get into cups
from other computers you're going to
know need to know the IP address of your
Raspberry Pi you can just find that with
I have config on your Raspberry Pi and
then it'll give you whatever your I net
address is so when you open PI on a
different computer it's going to look
like this so mine is 10 not 73 31 208
colon 631 there's that port again 631
and this is cups this will give you
administration levels to all the
printers and all the jobs that are
currently happening on your network from
your linux computer so first off we go
to administration we want to add
different computers so you go through
the process of adding a computer you
basically want to look for your specific
printer whatever it might be in my case
we added a local printer and then put in
the IP address of our local printer
after that you want to add the driver
and add the manufacturer of your printer
it and then just click OK and it should
come out just fine I also noticed if
you're using an HP printer you might run
into an issue with Linux machines
because it requires additional drivers
luckily HP does have those drivers
available and I'll put the link in the
show notes for that but unfortunately
with the Raspberry Pi you may run into
memory issues or storage issues with
that actual PI and the SD card so I
wasn't able to get our HP running on
here but I was able to get our thermal
printer for the hack shop running on
here just fine so once I had that
actually installed I can go into
printers and you'll notice all the HP
ones that I was testing on here but down
at the bottom we have zebra too and this
is the one that I'm going to be using
for my segment so now that I have my
printer set up I can go ahead and go
into Google Cloud Print and install
chromium so this also involves the
Raspberry Pi so we'll go
there once you install promi chromium
and it's just a very simple sudo apt-get
install chromium - browser you'll be
able to access all your different
printers on your chromium browser so
we're gonna go into the settings and it
takes just a moment to load since it's
very slow and then we're gonna scroll
all the way down to where we have
advanced settings click on advanced
settings and scroll down to where you
see Google Cloud Print now down here
right now it says disconnected printers
as you can see disconnect printers and
also manage print settings now when you
first start this up you'll be actually
able to see connect printers instead of
disconnect printers so you want to
connect all your different printers and
this is just a very simple thing where
you read through what it says on the
website and it'll bring you to this page
where you see all the different printers
that you currently have set up on your
Raspberry Pi to print through Google
Cloud Print now my zebra should be able
to print from any computer in the area
so let's see if it works I'm gonna go
over to my test email address which I
use for all my test stuff and I'm gonna
print and you'll notice when you change
your printers it's going to show up down
here under Google Cloud Print so I'm
gonna choose zebra - I'm gonna hit print
and this should take about 12 seconds
for it to actually connect to the
printer and print out now you may run
into a couple issues as well if you're
trying to print directly from your
raspberry pi did you hear that printer
my printer printed so it's not set up
correctly on the website but my thermal
printer is working and it printed out my
email address yay I'm so excited about
this so lastly I did want to show you
one more thing on the Raspberry Pi if we
come back over here I noticed that a
couple of times when I was trying to
print to the zebra it wouldn't work
through the actual GUI so I actually had
to go over to my terminal and then I had
to print out straight from the terminal
so I had this test file that I wanted to
print out and in order to do that I had
to go over to my
let's see I think it was on my desktop
let's see yeah there it is
so I'm gonna type in LPR tak p4 print
zebra oops whoa
European keyboard so confusing zebra and
then test dot txt since it didn't work
in the GUI I found out this command
would actually print it in about 12
seconds or so I'll actually get it to
print out so I I thought it was a nice
little actual tip that I was able to
share with you guys since I ran into
that problem and who knows you might too
now lastly if you do want to share your
Google Cloud Print printer with other
ones you will need to walk through the
tutorial from Google's website also
share that it looks like this where you
can share individual email addresses so
you don't have to be logged into the
same exact account every single time you
want to print something from that Google
Cloud printer and luckily it will work
for you that's about it of course if you
guys have questions about this I'll have
the links in the show notes and you can
email me feedback at hack 5 org I'm
gonna go ahead and throw it over to
Patrick to find out what's happening
with tech thing hey everybody probably
hear from tech things Shannon's other
show we got some good stuff coming up
how to make an older PC run faster how
long will the data last in your hard
drive what does Shanna think about the
new pebble watches and quite a bit more
go check it out please a tech thing com
I think Greg is done with the show today
he's pretty much had it he's fed up he
doesn't like being here on the set with
me I don't blame him
sorry dude alright so that about wraps
up this episode of hack 5 I hope you
liked it if you didn't or if you just
want to compliment all the awesome
things we've been doing with raspberry
PI's Arduinos and drones feedback at
hack 5 org hak5 org slash follow to find
all of our social networks and figure
out what the heck we're doing every
single day and find out when Darren's
not gonna be here on the set
since he's doing it South by Southwest
and of course don't forget bit ly slash
capital B capital
Oh capital L reunion for the buzz
outloud ten year later big show reunion
over here at the hak5 warehouse we hope
that you guys can join us for that it's
gonna be so much fun we're super excited
and can't wait and lastly of course if
you want to support us directly hhe shop
comm that's where we sell all of our
Wi-Fi pineapples and all the cool new
bags that we have for all your hacker
items so definitely check it out
I love the new hacker bag I took it to
East Bay bike party the other night
where you just write around for hours
around this entire loop around the
entire East Bay it was so fun and the
bag was perfect for that so I don't know
you might get some use out of it so I
think that's about it I'm Shannon Morse
that was Gregg Darren kitchens that way
and we'll see you next time trust your
Technol us and three two
