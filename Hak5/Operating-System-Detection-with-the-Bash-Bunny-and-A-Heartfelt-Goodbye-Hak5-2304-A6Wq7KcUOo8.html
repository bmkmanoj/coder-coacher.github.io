and a little 90s nostalgia all that and
more this time on hack five you've got a
great idea you should do what Shannon
and I do and head over to domain.com and
register your domain bring it over to
the Internet using this super awesome
discovery system that brings domains
from your mind onto the web over at
domain.com they've got a quick and easy
checkout process and they've been
supporting hack five for years you can
also tweet Adam at domain.com and say
hey thanks for hooking up the guys and
they've got a special treat just for you
you get to save 20% off I check out over
at domain.com using the super secret
coupon code is it spelled hack five and
it's just between you and I all right
I'm tell anyone okay when you think
domain names think domain.com hello
welcome to hack five mini in his daring
kitchen my name is Shannon Morris if
your weekly dose of Technology that's
right it is and I'm having some beers
today me too
cheers guys hmm Cheers
- to our fallen fallen soldier I did not
know you were going to do that just tip
in one for the homies tip and one for
the homie you know I have to clean up
the studio I'll clean it up in a bit
okay I think we should go right ahead
into the segment that's I'm excited
because until this one's all about
trolling but it's also a bit of 90s
nostalgia and it's a little bit about
like bash in some education a little bit
of nmap scripting I like that yeah so
sometimes you just need to troll your
friends I know I did way back in the day
just to show them that they are loved I
don't know about you but back in college
I loved setting a screenshot of the
desktop as the Windows wallpaper and
then disabling the icons and then I
would just watch them double click
everywhere and they would freak out
because they would think that nothing
was working well or you can flip the
entire display upside you know what was
that like windows all control left and
right ahead
yeah it was one of those I was a fun one
way back in the day so to celebrate this
mainstay of computing and love we are
featuring a novel cross-platform bash
money payload that's sure to make your
co-workers day or completely ruin it and
you definitely hit the nail on the head
with that a special word cross-platform
and I
that aspect of this because today we're
actually building on our discussions
from the previous week I know last week
we talked a lot about extensions because
you know reloads are even cooler when
other people can use your work and make
it all you know easier for them and
today we're looking at a really cool
technique for OS detection which would
actually make a really cool extension
okay so what do you mean by OS detection
it's your breeding system detection well
you'll probably remember actually I'll
just come over to this payload here
let's see under library and recon I'm
here on my bash bunny there's an nmap or
payload it's a really simple payload
that I wrote here all open to breed me
and you can see basically what it does
is it scans the target with and map
right here whatever using the specified
option then it saves the to save the log
to mass storage it's a really simple
payload now by default it's configured
for Windows and if you you know so it's
like set up for RDA is and if you want
to use if you want a target Mac and
Linux machines you just have to swap the
Ethernet to ECM Ethernet so it's like a
bit of common set of Rd is exactly
there's a line of code right here see
where it says it says dududududu use our
NDIS for Windows Linux and Mac's use ECM
Ethernet so you can pretty much just if
you know that's your target on comment
that comment that whatever Bob's easy
but what this and map payload actually
does is whatever your options are and
the options that I set by default are
taco TAC TAC fuzzy and end up I mean
it's kind of your go to port scanning
utility as well as many other things can
determine what the operating system is
will make an educated guess about what
the actual target computers running
whether it's Windows Mac Linux cue
Knicks rightio s whatever okay based on
different fingerprints like you know the
what Porsche has open you know like a
Windows machine might have port 139 open
or 443 open yeah poor for anyway might
be yes so it's pretty cool that you can
do OS detection with nmap
okay right okay so depending on what end
Matt finds you could add some additional
intelligence to your payload to run
different things if the target is a Mac
or a Linux box right exactly actually
this pinhead in particular could make
use of what we're about to get into
because it is useful yeah it is here let
me give you a little example so that the
reason that I actually have in this very
this is a very early payload for the
bash money it's kind of one of your like
I guess you would call it like a launch
payload it's a it's the next example oh
yeah here's one of the simple things
that you can do right kind of like what
I show up on hack tip all the time
totally and this is just one of those
beautiful things we're like hey just
make it show up as an Ethernet device
okay and then just scan the target and
save the results it's a good like as a
template because you're like oh cool so
this is you know like this function
right here makes your loot directory
based on the hostname actually that
should be put into a this actually
really should become a snippet a
extension yes you know like a a make
loot and hey loot snippet or something
that would just you know you see what
I'm saying is but anybody can just you
know copy and paste this and use this
thing but this particular payload you
know I have to say like okay hey if
you're attacking Windows use R&amp;amp;D is
Ethernet and if you're attacking
attacking Linux and Mac you got to use
ECM you tonight so why is there that
difference there right so the bash money
emulates USB Ethernet if there's two
different primary standards for USB
Ethernet so the different operating
systems don't use the same standard you
would think they would because that
would make sense
a little backstory on it basically the
first standard to come about for using
Ethernet over USB for the most part was
made popular by Microsoft with their own
proprietary protocol called our NDIS it
stands for remote network driver
interface specification and okay and
it's proprietary to Microsoft but
basically on you know all those you know
wind I think it's Windows Vista and
above you would plug this in and if it's
had that USB descriptor and said hey I'm
R&amp;amp;D is device then windows would be like
cool network interface cools you've just
stopped dedicated by telling me what you
are yeah and the door I'm gonna double
assign a cape it's like the drivers
built-in it's like when you plug that
keyboard in that Mouse into the the new
keyboard mouse you got for the end-rig I
didn't know I didn't need to know the
admin password I was just able to plug
in the keyboard and mouse and they
automatically worked
yay USB rubber duckies well yeah any
device that has built-in drivers yeah
absolutely you know again like inside
this box are editing rig over there does
not use like used as a regular Windows
user account doesn't run as
administrator' because you shouldn't be
running his route yes that's simple yeah
and Shannon was able to upgrade the
keyboard and mouse without needing that
and similarly you could plug in a bash
bunny with if it was set up as our NDIS
and would just be like oh cool your
network yeah now where this differs is
since that's a Microsoft's yeah so
Microsoft uses their own proprietary
protocol mind you a lot of people have
reverse engineered it and kind of come
up with our own variation of it that
works similarly enough to just work yeah
so actually while I say ECM Ethernet is
for Mac and Linux or a lot of Mac and
Linux boxes will actually understand or
NDIS oh really yeah yeah like your more
recent versions of like Ubuntu for
instance but to cover your butt whenever
you're working with a bash money since
you don't know specifically what
operating system your target might be
using you probably want to specifically
state if it's gonna be ECM or NDIS right
yeah exactly because ECM or Ethernet
control model which is the Linux
specific one will always work on Linux
and Mac you know that so they have that
driver installed by default sometimes
they have the are NDIS driver installed
Windows boxes since well Vista have
always had our NDIS drivers installed by
default and very rarely have ECM drivers
installed at all so that's why it's
important to just know your target okay
what so then it brings up the question
of like okay cool but what if you go to
your friend's house to troll them and
you don't know what they're running so
basically what you're saying is this
payload tries
in Linux first since they both use and
speak ECM which totally makes sense and
then if that fails it switches to our
NDIS in case it's Windows box right yeah
basically here looks like a look at that
payload because I'm novel a really novel
technique so let's go under prank and
it's called 193 we'll get into that in a
minute and check out the rank yeah it's
in the prank folder so all of the all of
the bash Bunny payloads in the library
are categorized by like if they're for
gathering credentials or doing over at
execution or doing some exploration
things like that
pranks are my fave and pranks are great
like 90s mode we've talked about 90s
mode it's a fantastic prank but this one
I think of all things of all things for
it to be a prank and yet there's some of
the most in ingenuitive I'm out of words
today I'm having a tough one now I'm
also having a beer yeah um we're looking
at payload txd here and basically what
this does here is it has multiple stages
on this first stage right here is just
gonna go ahead and you can see here it
sets the attack mode to ECM so it's like
hey okay cool I'm I'm targeting a Linux
or Mac box here it sleeps for three
seconds then it uses the get extension
to get an IP address okay then it says
yo Dawg if you did not get an IP address
so that's what that tags E and the F
statement is yeah if you didn't get an
IP address then it actually echoes out
into a log file which is pretty cool it
creates a log file and it says hey no
target IP then says checking if it's a
Windows host that's the led to special
set the attack mode to our NDIS Ethernet
actually hang on that's a typo our Oh
finished it fixes do you think he did
that on purpose do you mean like how
sometimes people will put uh-huh like
what is it called typos yep on purpose
yep - like prevention I feel like people
sometimes you're leet hack sores put
typos into their code to make sure that
script kitties aren't just copying and
pasting but I don't like the word script
Kitty because I think everybody starts
somewhere and in order to figure out
what you're doing wrong at least I did
when I was
learning HTML way back in like middle
school I would copy and paste and then
if I had an error I would have to go
through and find that error yeah and you
would have to google it or in your case
you would have to Lycos it because we're
talking about you know in the 90s for me
I would just have to figure it out
myself because I didn't understand
Google at the time yes or yeah you know
whatever there was at the time I was the
script kiddie I was a script kiddie - I
needed t-shirt.this as I was a script
hitting we were on you know here's to
the kitties here's to the kitties
I agree getting back to the payload here
now I don't know if that was on purpose
or if it was just a type of either way
what it does here is it switches over to
and actually beautifully enough I can
just fix this and then submit a pull
request and then it gets fixed you know
beauty of open-source github so it sets
the attack mode R&amp;amp;D is you throw net
wait three seconds then checks for an IP
address and if it doesn't get one then
it just does an LED fail and exits which
is brilliant because you're like hey if
you didn't get an IP address if the if
the if the victim computer that you plug
the bash money into didn't get an IP
address from the bash bunny over ECM
Ethernet or rd is Ethernet you're not
you can assume that it probably won't
run on that specific nothing's happened
to Gary yeah yeah it's not gonna work
you could and you could actually
recreate that by just like plugging this
into a USB battery pack oh right because
it obviously it won't run on the battery
pack it's not gonna have that battery
pack gets an IP address from the bash
bunny blocks out yeah next on Auditing
anchor power supplies oh are you getting
pwned so anyway you can see where this
is going basically it once it finishes
the first stage it goes ahead and
lunches that scan and then it grips
through that scan right so it actually
in in stage two it switches over to an
attack mode hid to start injecting
keystrokes and it actually uses grep
patuxai on that log file that it created
and it looks for the word Linux right
and if it sees
the word Linux then it goes ahead and
you know says that in the log file and
then sets Oh s equals Linux okay
similarly if it's Mac actually funnily
enough it has to do something funny here
for the Mac it has to do a CREP with
attack V with MAC address before it
actually pipes that to grow up again so
what does that do I
grep - V or TAC V is saying hey like
grep that out like ignore that Oh
everything except for because it's going
to see MAC address like all throughout
the code so obviously you just want to
know if the operating system is a Mac
yeah so it's in this case looking for a
Mac isn't a Macintosh rather than Mac is
in media access control ok Isis got it
either way real simple it then goes
ahead and says hey if all that worked
out if it gets this then go ahead and
set oh s equals Mac and then down here
you know it also does the same thing for
Windows and if it sees Windows it sets
Oh s equals Windows and then boom dollar
sign OS that variable says hey in this
case Linux or Windows or Mac host
detected and then appends that with the
wawk wawk is here into your log file
it's not really coolest this actually
has a log file NIT and there we go that
then it goes into the third stage where
it can actually start executing so
there's first 93 lines you know except
for the comments basically are figuring
out what the operating system is and
then assigning it to a variable called
dollar sign OS in this case so I feel
like okay hold on so I think that's
really cool but doesn't the get
extension work that way like you say get
target IP and then it exports target IP
variable with an address so I could
imagine that this code being put into an
extension that could just like export
the OS for you so that you don't have to
include those tons and tons of lines of
code in your payload right yeah that
would that would work that's kind of why
I'm bringing this up so you for you are
you telling our viewers to make an
extension maybe I could I could probably
just put this in
some things and make it a little
prettier but you know that's that can be
useful though that could be super useful
like for other for other payloads too
not just this one specifically for the
193 payload but if other people are
looking to target a specific operating
system they could use an extension that
says like get OS or get operating system
and then run the payload depending on
which OS it is so that way you have an
extension totally similar to save
yourself some writing you know how the
run extension will say like you can
specify a Windows Mac or Linux and then
depending on that you it will know how
to execute that command say that command
is a website you could do run when a
website or run OSX a website and then
it's going to inject the keystrokes that
are appropriate for that operating
system this would be kind of the inverse
of that and then hey a couple of those
together and you really got to school so
I'm bringing this up because I would
like to see this finessed some more I
know that there are definitely faster
and more efficient ways to do this so if
you're watching at home and you have
some ideas on how to improve this please
chime in we'd love to see an OS
detection extension okay yeah so now
that this payload has detected the
operating system I want to know exactly
what it's going to do because when 93
sounds fun but I'm not really sure quite
yet okay so busy status shown all right
all right so here we are we're finally
in stage 3 right and what it'll do here
is it says you know it goes out to the
log file that it's starting it and then
if it actually uses a bunch of if
statements here instead of like a switch
case I don't know I've used a switch
case it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
okay that's a beautiful thing I think is
there's a million ways to skin a cat
yeah anyway if the OS equals Mac then
it's going to go ahead and run OSX hey
there's the run extension opens up the
terminal and then tells it to open
windows 93 net and then use this this
little OS a script to full screen it
similarly on if it's Linux if the OS
equals Linux it will go ahead and well
it'll actually open X term and then the
muse chromium browser so
this and with the incognito and a new
window and start full-screen parameters
so if you have chromium installed it's
gonna open that full screen to windows
93 net its I gotta say I would just use
I I would I would do it this way I would
actually say run Linux or unity and then
just the browser be and then I would
just do like a sleep one or like a quack
or sorry not quack but yeah quack delay
1000 or maybe 2000 you know it's two
seconds there we go and then and then I
would do F 11 because on most browsers
every browser I've ever seen f11 does to
full screen either way it pulls up this
website goes full screen and similarly
actually says here if it's Evo s equals
Windows then it just does a fail and
then says hey it's not supported for
Windows yet I could actually say that's
actually really simple just do run win
duh there you go
that's that's actually all you need
although however I will say I study XE
tak K you would have to put this in
quotes of course and then you would have
to perhaps never know if you have to I
don't know if you have to escape the
forward slashes I don't think so
basically find out when we try to run it
all Windows machines have I explored dot
exe on them unfortunately but it has a
TAC K option for kiosk which doesn't
fullscreen for you that's funny so I'm
just saying okay there you go and then
the last bit is to just clean up and
sink the logs but I want to run it ie we
run it I guess you know what I actually
want to know we can but you know what I
actually want to do I want to just pull
it up because I'm feeling lazy yeah I
don't feel like you know rebooting my
bash money I've got some other stuff
on it right now but I only just
discovered windows 93 net due to this
payload and will you get haha actually
it would be with F 11 right oh man
that's so good and this is basically
like what Windows 93 would look like
like halfway between Windows 95 and 311
I think you should double click on
hamster and pull up the volume oh yeah
oh yes oh that's so good this is
terrible we're gonna get we're gonna get
kicked so bad playing that file the
audio they're gonna get mad at us oh
it's so good so good
okay let's keep reruns ish yeah I was
terrible at this game growing up what
else is on here they've got there
there's so much good stuff on this idea
I need to get rid of I got a running
defrag defrag oh my god that's amazing
that's so funny I love this so much the
IFSP ready where this came out and it
was you think this is a version of
minesweeper where you can only ever die
yeah that's so fun I'm actually really
impressed by the by the Wolfenstein 3d
clone it's it's actually pretty on Mars
what yeah I don't know what man oh and
the Facebook other control isn't I need
to remap the keys but you guys get the
idea man there's so much good stuff in
here like this is so beautiful yeah I
just want to run
I can't wait to prank an inside that I
should run virtual pieces I can't prank
anybody that watches the show they know
exactly what's going on you guys get the
idea I can drink my husband though oh
you're gonna love this show yeah is this
an ongoing thing now is like oh my
husband doesn't watch the show I can I
can prank him you can pretty much do
whatever I mean
[Laughter]
so great yeah your significant otters
should definitely not watch the show no
definitely not no significant otters
allowed yes
so I actually know what can make this
even better is we got a comment from
Chris Evans on episode 2301 and he
recommended a very specific command that
would add an additional feature to this
Oh No
you want to spell it out yeah yeah yeah
this is a this is a really good one
this is picking up from that episode
where we inadvertently discovered that
there is a nyan cat just gonna say
payload and then cap package for Ubuntu
or Roper you know they're apt yeah and
also it would make a brilliant payload
for trolling especially if you add in
this command if you do X input Xin PU T
list you can see these are all of the
different you know I've got a a touchpad
and I've got a o screen and I've got a
synaptic touch right here so I see what
it's doing it's it's giving an ID kind
of like a pit yeah number two each input
device that you have plugged into your
computer whether it's a touchpad
keyboard or mouse right and well you
could do you know all this fancy stuff
here to get the ID number out like in
this case 14 for my particular 80
keyboard 80 translated set to keyboard
which is what they will all be listed as
because the 80 and if you know what that
means it's not having to do flowers yes
it's a dad's or 80s jeez if you're a fan
of those no it actually has to do with
my first and favorite computer but I'm
gonna leave that as a caught as a
discussion for the moment write your old
love dat
I'm actually not old I just got like a
really crappy computer the one you're
talking about I think my dad had one of
those in my nursery
yeah PC 80s were awesome and the
keyboard port was insane it was like the
size of my head you would like to have
to like use to do like plug it in and
have these pins are we here now
basically what you do here is you can
use X input and you can basically just
save
this so I've got my ID here and actually
you can replace the ID with the word
eighty translated but I'm just gonna do
fourteen here and I put the sleep
statement in to have it sleep for ten
seconds okay and then I have it also do
an X input enable 14 because if I don't
I'm going to be very upset because here
I'll just go ahead and run it so I'm
pressing the Windows key and you can see
you know pressing super brings up this
menu right yeah so I'll go ahead and run
this and now and oh no I'm jamming on
that key Shannon and it doesn't do
anything it's completely disabled your
keyboard completely disabled it that is
so funny oh yeah and now it came back
now it works because the ten seconds
elapsed but uh-huh that would be that's
not serious do that to your friends yeah
send them to windows 93 net and then
disable the keyboard input you would
have no choice but to either reboot your
computer using your mouse this is a pain
if you have a lot of documents open that
you see even all those things that's so
wrong or you could open up a help file
with your mouse and then find the find
the letter X and copy that and paste it
into the terminal and find a letter I
and copy that and paste into the
terminal and you see where I'm going
with this I hear hamster dance it still
plays I'm just gonna hit the little you
could type in X and click enable there
we go whatever your thing is you're
eighty translated cents awesome
by just copying and pasting letters from
the help file so do we have something
special for oh yes absolutely in fact
let's check this out because this
payload as they all should it comes with
readme dot MD file and it says that the
author is glad so we're gonna go ahead
and get ahold of glad and hook them up
with $100 giftcard yeah over at so that
they can get their own hack five gear
awesome there you go hopefully your
emails in github
I hope so otherwise get a hold of us in
the feedback at hack 5 org that's how
you can get a hold of us well than
anybody would be able to and then it was
gonna say hey I'm glad and then we're
gonna say hey put this key inside of
your github and if it exists we'll give
you the code and if not there you go
yeah this is very
PGP key yeah like that it's ridiculous I
know PGP keys a hack five door gosh keys
well mines on key base it it's
affordability vases oh it is yeah oh
yeah
he made the website actually keep them
on the hack guy's dad org site as well
you can find all of our gear as well
just click on the store the gear up at
the top and it's where you can find out
information about all of our events as
we will be having an event a big event
of very exciting event in October talk
don't tell them the date we don't have
the date yet it's either the 20th the
first we have we'd if we have not
scheduled the venue yet we get in we
will post it on the website
and on all of our social network yes so
pay attention and if you're in the San
Francisco Bay Area and want to see this
awesome new hack fun here then come to
our event once we secure the venue and
we will release the details yeah you
could get yourself for instance a Wi-Fi
pineapple like like I've got this Wi-Fi
pineapple attached right here or you can
grab it nano yeah and here's a fun thing
about setting up any of the new Wi-Fi
pineapples I don't know if you know this
Shannon but inside every Wi-Fi pineapple
is a little Easter Egg oh really
yeah every single pineapple that's ever
been made or at least the
sixth-generation
at the setup so after you flash the
firmware this is gone
but it lives on on every fresh unit
which is if you go to one seven 2.16 to
42.1 : 14 71 mm-hmm slash Kirby where it
might be Kirby JPEG you get a lasting
memory of Kirby a faithful companion of
hack 5 and our cat our cat 4 for like 16
years who is now gone to Kitty heaven
yeah she's over the Rainbow Bridge
well this is the first time I cried on
hack 5 ok we should bother keep it in
cuz yeah sorry
we miss you girl yep I ran out of beer
but I'm gonna cheer her anyway to Kirby
hi Kirby
interesting to be saying goodbye to the
maker be to the studio yeah the studio
as it is yeah but we will be bringing
you a studio 2.0 and all its glory
hopefully we have it all set up by the
time with you we'll give you what you
want
and I think Herbie is going for the new
position as awesome as IPTV kitties so
lab rat Smith and doing your heart out
who's you on the other side half-life
