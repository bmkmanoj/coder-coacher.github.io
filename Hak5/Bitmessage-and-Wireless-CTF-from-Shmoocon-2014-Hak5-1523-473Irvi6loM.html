by domain.com hello welcome to AK 5 my
name is Darren kitchen and this is your
weekly dose of techno list we have an
awesome show for you guys this week
Shannon is coming to us with a tutorial
on bit message it is an awesome
decentralized encryption messaging
protocol and then I have a report from
Luke on in Washington DC where I checked
out some rather innovative CTF
challenges for a wireless so let's check
it out hey guys first MOOC on 2014 I'm
here with Rick at the CTF Rick what's
going on so hey we're doing a wireless
CTF for shmoocon this year we've got
about 16 teams competing in in the room
here we're doing some SDR challenges
we're doing some Wi-Fi challenges and
then we're doing a full-on penetration
test challenge to stop tell me about the
SEO or software defined radio challenges
what are those involved so the first one
is without giving too much away because
there's people listening they're
actually playing the first one over here
is a bug that we actually pulled off of
a customer site it's broadcasting in a
specific frequency over our radio they
need so into in doing a sweep of one of
our customers we ran into some issues
that we found we do we do on a regular
basis we do work with signals in general
as well as tsum scam tempest scans as
well as some some other types of our F
attenuation scanning to her to find the
bad guys this particular one we found on
a one of our better customers sites so
we wanted to use it here to use real
world actual bugs for people to find and
so this is just like your traditional
cold war-era like like it's not cold war
anymore
but yes absolutely hundred percent
that's correct and nearby correct and so
now what is the idea is using
software-defined radio to become correct
so what we did was we wanted everybody
to be able to get involved in this and
there's about five teams here that have
never even seen an SDR before and
they're already scoring points we're
doing a lot of teaching as much as we're
doing the SDR challenges themselves this
particular one we want to give somebody
a real-world capability this can be
found with the rtl-sdr show me that
you're talking about the realtek dongle
the realtek dongle for 20 bucks that
everybody loves cheap easy works
directly out of pen to out off the shelf
worth with the way that pen twos built
they've actually compiled everything for
it plug it in GQ rx and you're up and
running this will show the bug
immediately you can what they need to do
is they need to come up to us with their
headphones they play the play the play
the file for us as it's going and we
give them the points ah that's the music
next day exactly so that that music is
actually also part of one of the other
challenges running off of the Wi-Fi side
so people can take that over and play
whatever they want
along with taken over the chromecast
which they can play whatever they want
awesome so we're giving people some
options so I take it you can't tell me
right now that is correct but what it is
in a the GRC and starts leaking around
until they see something that you get
exactly exactly scanning across and you
look for the bumps and and start to
demodulate so we're getting people to
actually learn how to do this stuff in
real time cool so one of the other ones
that we're doing we actually have two
raspberry PI's that have been have been
pinned out of the number for GPI you
GPIO port we've changed the frequency
around we're actually transmitting over
the PI in specific frequencies with slow
scan TV we're transmitting some audio
and we're also transmitting a couple
pictures Wow so they need to demodulate
that what we told people to do is to go
to the rtl-sdr site pull down some
example waveforms and then come up and
give us the answer so the idea is to
actually pull those pictures out exactly
off of off of a 25-dollar pi we're used
to doing this but we're used to doing
this and it totally different exactly
exactly that's really novel what about
the is
source available for that so so drag
horn yes Michael Osmond and Ross all
worked with us to get this done
basically yes exactly made it made it
into an arm I can find out if we can
make it available those are the rtl-sdr
challenges we are doing some testing
right now with some hack RFS with some
some transmission off of some other
dongles and I think that covers all the
rtl-sdr yeah if you go to the shmoocon
link shmoocon events Wi-Fi CTF that
takes them right to our page we update
that for every CTF we do we thank so
much better absolutely it doesn't matter
whether you're a syn and AK or a syn ack

and it's time for the trivia question of
the week last week's trivia question was
what TV show first introduced virtual
reality as a plot device and the answer
was and this is one of my favorites
Doctor Who the original not the
reformatted version now this week's
trivia question is what is the oldest
known analog computer in the world you
can answer that at hak5 org slash trivia
for your chance to win some awesome hack
5 goodies you know sending encrypted
messages have always been really
influential in a lot of my recent
segments and this week I'll be taking a
look at one that was influenced a lot by
Bitcoin of all things it was updated in
2013
it's called bit message and it's
available for Windows Mac and Linux
machines now before I get started I'm
gonna go ahead and send a message over
to Darren and use bit message to
transfer it to them and I'll explain why
I'm going ahead and doing this now in
just a little bit so I'm gonna go ahead
and go over to send I'm gonna send him a
message from my address one of my money
and I'm gonna load Darren's
address hey Darren send me a message
back when you get this okay thanks
send okay cool so I went ahead and sent
that out and we'll see how long it takes
to get out there now bit message this is
a p2p platform that is designed to send
encrypted messages from one person over
to another deaf p2p and from one person
to several people if you want to and
that's called subscribers there is no
inherent trust needed which is so cool
it uses open-source Python code which
you can actually download and you can
research yourself and by the way if you
guys are looking if your security
researcher there they're actually
looking for a security researcher to
independently audit their program so if
you want something to do if you're bored
check them out because I think that
would be really cool so it uses public
key encryption between
to different people and this can be used
as an alternate to PGP email
communications if you want to your 36
character address is what defines you
who you are two-bit message so--but
mice's uses this address and then plus
your computer's processing power to
exchange messages between the two people
hence why it is loosely influenced by
Bitcoin now each message requires about
four minutes to be sent and received but
because of all that processing power
that goes on behind it so let's go ahead
and take a look at the program itself
when you first get started it's a little
bit weird you can create your identity
on the identity tab so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you what that looks like
so you go over to identities and if you
don't have any setup yet you can click
new when you click new you can create
either a passphrase or a random number
generator so for this segment I've
already gone ahead and created a
passphrase for mine so you click on that
and then you type in whatever your
passphrase is going to be so mine would
be I don't know I'll just write this one
in oh cool
see that I just got my message from
Darren so it did take a little bit of
time I'll get back to that in a second
after you create that it'll also show
you how many addresses to make based on
your passphrase so the normal default is
eight and then you click OK and all of
your random number generated passwords
are created so the reason why I wanted
to use a passphrase for open bit message
is because I can use this same
passphrase on different computers to log
into my same addresses so I don't have
to create new ones every time I get onto
a different computer so your addresses
will be created and then you can use
these to send and receive any types of
messages now your bit message client is
going to connect and look for no nodes
and if any notes that it connects to are
bound for your inbox you will see them
show up right there so let's take a look
at my inbox which is the very first tab
over here so you click inbox anything
that you've already read like this test
1 2 3 1 will show down here and then
anything in bold are your brand new
messages up at the top so now I want
move on down to the bottom corner this
is going to show you a little bullet
that is either red yellow or green now
if your indicator is red that means that
you need to open a new port on your
router for your computer's IP address
now my bit message port is 8 4 4 4 which
is the default so I've opened up that
TCP port to allow data through it if
it's yellow you can only have up to 8
connections at once but you can still
connect this also means that you are not
currently connected as a node so you're
not you helping the bit message system
transfer messages from each other for
all the different clients that are out
there and the other one which is what
mine is right now green that means that
you are good to go and you are now a
node so other messages can be streamed
through your connect connections so
you're basically helping the bit message
protocol with all those different
messages that are flying around in the
atmosphere now I sent Darin a message a
few minutes ago and he did reply to me
it just took a couple of minutes and it
usually takes about 8 minutes for the
entire transfer between one person
sending a message the other person
receiving it and then then replying and
sending you a message and you replying
back so I'm gonna go ahead and click on
his message in my inbox right here hey
Shannon I'm in your internet messaging
your bits oh that's odd so if I
right-click I can choose reply and it's
just like an email thread it it looks
just like Gmail pretty much so Doge so
Wow nice send huh so easy now if you
ever want to send your messages first
off you just get your some address from
your friend and then here I have two on
mine so if I go to my address book over
here I see that oh nevermind I deleted
the other one so this is Darren's right
here this is his address and it's pretty
much a public address anybody can send
him a message there and if you want to
add new people from your address also
you can go to add new entry and simply
label it whatever you want so I labeled
mine Darren and then put in their
address just copy and paste it they're
super super simple now from here if you
want to
to send the message you should just put
from yourself and then to whoever you
want you can copy and paste straight
from your address book and then just
write your body and paste every time you
send a bit message it's going to create
this thing called a proof-of-work a p o
w the proof-of-work will show the nodes
and other clients that your computer is
not spam and that it is a legit message
and that it's actually you it's
basically just their notification that
you are who you say you are you can also
send messages to a subscription by
checking broadcast instead of just to
one person so to do this if you wanted
to you go over to your send messages and
you just choose broadcast and then we'll
this will broadcast out to everybody
that subscribes to you so you all you
have to click is from and then your key
and you can just leave this part blank
so super easy really good idea for you
know bloggers or organizations that
really need to send out news to
anonymous users kind of cool I'm
thinking we should do this for the hack
shop it's kind of awesome so is this
something that you would use it's very
easy to set up it is open source not to
mention it is free which is great I wish
that there was a mobile version of it
and that it was a little bit faster and
that I didn't have to worry about
opening a port on my firewall if I
wanted to be a node but alas there is
not a way to do that and there's not a
mobile version unfortunately it is kind
of comparative to tour chat in some ways
if you've ever checked that out which is
another chat client that's open source
and it's much better than many other
ones out there so email me your thoughts
and whichever chat claims that you
decide to use especially if it's open
source I think that's super cool and I
really like this one it's pretty cool
I'm probably going to keep it forever
anyway you can email me feedback at hack
5 org and make sure to check out my 36
character address in the show notes
below
and now it's time for the tech no less
photo of the week and it turns out that
Darren is in this week's tech no less
photo of the week we went to CES and he
was chatting with dk 40 smart glasses
exhibitor when Patrick fell in hi yes I
did mention you of Bloomberg so that's
this picture and it ended up in
Washington Post and also the
Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper which
our viewer Brian decided to send in so
thank you Brian I appreciate letting us
know about that that was really cool if
you guys what to him here he comes back
with his Google class are you taking a
picture of me are you taking a picture
of me that's how I feel about you and
your glass glass wall if you guys want
to share your pictures you can sit share
them with feedback at hak5 org and use
