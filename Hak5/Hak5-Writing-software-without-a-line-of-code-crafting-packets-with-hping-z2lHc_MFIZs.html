ER all that and more this time on hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by goto assist express support smarter
with go to assist express the Motorola
Xoom and domain.com
your next big idea starts at domain.com
hello welcome my name is Darren kitchen
and I'm Shannon Morse
this is your weekly dose of technology
do all sorts of fun things like what o
including voiding warranties and writing
code and doing things involving packets
actually we're gonna have a lot of fun
with packets later oh yeah in the mobs
it's pretty it's getting a lot prettier
I didn't feeling sometimes I left it's
nice yeah well that's the prototype up
on the wall we've got the second one
that we're gonna be making a lot sexier
I used to have things like this in my
car in your car yeah way back in like
the early 2000s you know like everything
yes
you know bump to the music no yes you
had one of the like what are you rocking
what was your little mild Ford really
sad say first car a second yeah ok no
yeah so I'm gonna be you know cleaning
up the rest of the casemod adding some
features that's a great feedback on that
and I hear it and then I'll be playing
with some packets Stephanie here you're
doing some programming I am doing
programming though not really there's no
script normally we have Jason app Obama
here and he shows us how to get into the
IDE and set up for development
environment and the variables and loops
in the wild statements um yeah no dummy
which cases I'm gonna show you how to
script without scripting and create your
own little programs yeah looking forward
to that go ahead and start it off right
with the hacker headlines you guys know
the last week reported nearly 60 nasty
Trojans hit the Google Android
Marketplace and Google responded by D
listing the publisher and using their
infamous app remote kill switch on the
affected quarter million users well when
I was actually released a security tool
to clean up the mess well security tool
has been found on an unregulated
third-party Chinese marketplace injected
with some delicious botnet code yeah
well and it actually has the ability to
send text messages we've seen stuff like
this it's no fun oh so there's this
group of hackers that has figured out a
way to scam Microsoft Xbox Live Points
by producing working character strings
like the ones you get on the back of the
place cards yeah exactly
they released the scheme on to a website
that would generate the codes for you
which is kind of cool but Microsoft lost
about 1.2 million dollars in points and
they have since locks right which kind
of stinks
that's basically counterfeit I mean that
is counterfeit but the brute force
counterfeiting you can't do that in the
RL and you know you can't like here in
the states it's all about the secret
service yeah
so they don't have a way of knowing who
did this and they'll probably have to
redo the entire algorithm to fix it well
maybe when they fix it they can come up
with a point system that makes it sense
that would be awesome because know how
much you place them really expensive and
they're crazy okay we're getting off
ramp let's get back on track okay
obviously Microsoft not so secure but
your Linux box might not be either a
router routing bit of malware has been
discovered once run the malware posing
as an e LF file route
forces Network routers now it's
successful the malware will actually set
up an IRC backdoor on the system now
this router Rooter weird about router
it's the rear rear now calm is just once
after the Chuck Norris botnet what
basically attacked machines with routers
using default passwords Chuck Norris
will own your router well yeah if your
link says password is password or
default or admin or administrator or
yeah be careful and also be careful if
you visited George Hoxha's web site
between January 2009 and now because
Sony you may know about it not good in a
decision last Thursday magistrate Joseph
Sparrow grants at Sony a subpoena they
can see the long something's wrong with
you sometimes so I may also they granted
on the subpoena for YouTube and for
Google and then you know George Hotz
provider Bluehost they've actually been
asked to turn over server logs IP logs
and just about anything pertaining to
the jailbreak massive Yankees actually I
think we're gonna be talking about this
a lot more in the future because where
you post your stuff is very important
yes
now what can be more fun than Garry's
Mod how about playing it with a Kinect
John be used open ni to gather skeletal
coordinates from the Kinect and pass it
through the Garry's Mod so that it can
play the physics fun or getting some
exercise how about some Garry's Mod
music videos next time huh dude yes with
little baby kitten what with what now
what nothing baby kitties that's right
as you guys know we had a lot of fun
this Sunday with the crack the code
challenge sannen why don't you tell us a
little bit about those that completed
the challenge did you have what it took
to compete in our crack the code
challenge brought to you by goto assist
express these fine hack five viewers did
less sunday mad props go out to paul
stork richard raging cake jenkins and
john and joey as well as our returning
champion
naturale Leo and Tristan a big thanks
cool to all that participated join the
live stream and the chat and of course
go to assist Express for sponsoring our
hak5 lab network we had an overwhelming
reception with more participants than
virtual machines however we'll be
increasing our capacity this week as
well as getting the Thunder kitten of
salt force involved
stay tuned for info on the next even
bigger crack the code challenge and be
sure to tune in next week as well have a
detailed walkthrough on how the
challenge was completed so now let's
take a moment to thank go-to it's just
Express for making the challenge
possible if you provide technical
support to clients colleagues friends or
family have you found an easy
cost-effective way without being there
in person
well the best way for me to provide
technical support is to do it online
with go to assist Express go to assist
Express lets you view and control
another computer online so you can
quickly resolve technical issues I've
used it to help friends learn how to use
new software or even fix family computer
problems without being there in person
yeah you know what I'm talking about

if you're new to coding where you're
just kind of not into starting
everything with Boyd main pound include
here dot H you need to check out this
product from radical breeze and here to
show us all about it its Smurfette known
excuse me
Smurfette maybe no you know what go I'm
sorry but I'm Smurfette no that's not
gonna work for me go shave go shave that
thing that you have going on right here
so radical breeze made this really cool
program called illumination software
creator now I would love to have the
ability to make my own software
applications without having to know any
kind of coding language but it seems
like even to do something as simple as a
HelloWorld script you still have to know
at least a few lines of scripting not
anymore with illumination software
creator from radical breeze you can
write software apps without the code by
using a unique easy interface so there's
a couple of requirements first off if
you're using Windows you need to have
Python installed and it can work on
Windows Linux Ubuntu Mac Android and
this thing called flex so I wanted to
give you a nifty little demo of how this
works it's pretty easy once you get the
hang of it so you just go to the website
download it like usual and follow the
directions on the requirements page open
it up after you've extracted it and it
asks you at first if you want to
register it and I don't so I'm just
going to hit cancel continue trial
starts you off with an application that
is launched and it gives you this ending
box for quitting your application so
over here I'm just gonna do something
really really easy
I'm just going to make this thing that
says hack five rules it shows some nice
little text and then it quits after you
hit OK so that's pretty easy right yeah
I thought so so first off you want to
click on a new project which I've
already done and you want to add your
boxes so I want to set up this text so
what I'm going to do is add a set set
text box and then add a variable that I
can reuse for several different commands
so go down to the text and drag over
your box
nice little GUI interface and I'm gonna
set a variable for this text box over
here under variables variable name I'm
just gonna call it hack 5 rolls because
it totally does right ferial type is
text and the default text is going to
say hack 5 space rules were awesome and
then press ok under set text I can add
the hack 5 rules to the custom text line
and then for the message box I can add
the variable for hack 5 rules so I'm
going to add a user interface which is a
message box drag my box over here and
I'm going to use the variable hack 5
rules and same with this one variable
hack 5 rules there you go now with
illumination software creator you also
have to make sure that you connect each
and every different piece of the script
that you put together in this in this
box so I need to drag a line from each
box having some issues with my boxes
there we go and stick the other one down
there okay so I have it all set up nice
and easy so hopefully when it runs it
will work to test the running process
you just go over up here to run click on
python desktop and it should ask me to
save it so i'll save it as hack 5 nice
and simple press save and it should pop
up i hope it works
yeah it worked so it gives me a little
text box that says hack 5 rules i press
close and it quits the application nice
and simple you can learn tons of
scripting through this cut and you never
have to actually well learn any java
code to write a little hello world you
can just stick in the little boxes and
there
oh you're good to go if you have any
questions about this or if you have
another program that is nice and easy
like this one email me at feedback at
hack 5 org I love to get your feedback
and now a brief word from from Darren
from Darren ok hi to give me a grade up
go and get a beer now we've talked about
screen we've talked about packet
sniffers but today we're going to put it
all together with a new tool for
crafting our own packets now hp3 is a
tcp/ip packet assembler it's modeled
after the unit's ping command but it can
do so much more
not just ICMP this thing you can craft
TCP UDP even raw IP packets so here on
the top you can see that I've actually
in my screen I have TCP dump dump
running and I'm taking a look at the 0
so if I issue say the ping command to 66
11 227 169 I can see there are my
packets going through at the top I can
see with my results at the bottom that's
all well and good but say I didn't want
to just paying a server say I figured
hey I wonder if there's an HTTP D demon
sitting over there waiting for me to
make web connection to it well then we
could do what's called a half-open syn
connection so for that let's just go
ahead dive right in
I'm gonna go ahead and issue H ping 3
taxi 1 for 1 packet and then tack if0 is
my interface tack s for the source port
in this case I don't know anything 1 2 3
4 will work and then tack P now this is
the port of the server on the other side
we're going to say 80 and then again
that address to 66 11 227 169 and if I
run that I can see that I had a 0%
packet loss I actually sent my sin I got
a syn ACK back but I did not complete
the three-way handshake with us making
it you know an open how re a half-open
syn connection now just as an example
I'm gonna go ahead and run the same
thing but this time we're going to
change the destination port 81 so come
over here change that to 80
and you can see that I have a hundred
percent packet loss because there's
nothing running on port 81 so you know I
know that that's just scratching the
surface of what is possible with a
traffic generator like a CH ping and a
debugging setup with TCP dump on top of
in a different screen and of course I'm
looking forward to hearing about your
favorite packet assemblers
so what's rockin your world you get any
tip send them by tips a hack five org
we'll be back in just a bit for a quick
word from one of our sponsors the
Motorola Xoom is the first tablet
powered by Android 3.0 honeycomb with a
10.1 inch HD widescreen display 3d
experience and a one gigahertz and
dual-core processor it's fully flash
enabled for video rich web with tabbed
windows for multitasking and chrome
bookmark syncing with Google Maps that
you can tilt rotate and zoom in in 3d
with photo real Street View its 4G
upgradable so you can leap from 3d to
Verizon 4G LTE and the mind-melting
upper limits of speed
last week we started the casemod picture
frame thing on the wall because well the
boards are beautiful and they should be
on display we got a lot of great
feedback and thank you guys so much for
sending that in I love to hear about
that and I'm sure I will be doing more
of these and making them even better and
that's kind of one of the things that
we'll be doing with this part two as we
really finish off this one so we can
hang it on the wall and I have a couple
of questions here I figured I would just
go ahead and address off the bat
JT writes in that he'd like to see some
slick cable management on the outside of
the cases for power and Ethernet and
avoiding a cable splitter you know
really if I were to do this again like I
said I would put an actual Ethernet jack
here but you know power over ethernet
maybe through doing like a smaller board
that would be really cool also I think I
talked about how it'd be neat her to do
a Wi-Fi dongle if this wasn't a server
that was going to be doing gigabits of
data
he was also wondering about the CPU
temperature of the stock cooler and if
that was going to be an issue in the
Benz yes that actually is that guy was
running for the crack the code challenge
on Sunday and I actually just kind of
propped it open the other one I didn't
however and it didn't get too hot so you
know that's all anecdotal but I will be
putting in some vent holes today another
wrote in tricky voice from England he
says I love in the picture frame casemod
I have a machine that runs a low power
media server and it's been bolted to the
wall for over two years and has had
little use because he likes his virtual
server more and he goes on to say that
it's actually the guts of his old
girlfriends laptop whose cat shattered
anyway so basically he gutted a laptop
put it on the wall
that's really cool because you've got a
lot less components a lot tinier power
supply all of that good stuff
Wi-Fi built in that's pretty neat way to
recycle thanks for sending that in
tricky also amp writes in to say hey
Darren I just watched the picture frame
casemod I saw that you joined all of the
wires at the same length
if you intended to put the heat shrink
around them you could have a huge bulge
maybe offset the joints and he's gone
ahead and actually put together
check this out an image showing how it
should be done
then it would look a lot better rather
than having a big bulge of of crimps so
yeah that's actually a great way to do
it the other way I was thinking was the
OL just twist the wires around each
other pop some solder on it and Thrones
my heat shrink we'll be talking about
prettying of things in just a bit thank
you for sending in the diagram aunt
that's a good technique and then Luke
wrote in to say let me just get started
by saying that looks incredible I've
such a simple uh it's such a simple idea
but it looks good he would prefer to do
LEDs himself maybe even like RGB LEDs
like doing different colors I talked
about this with my roommate Dave about
how would be really neat to change the
color depending on like CPU load or
something like that you walk in your
picture frame is red and that means that
all hell's broken loose that'd be pretty
neat maybe a follow-up project I think I
could do it was a serial port and an
Arduino little crunch cron job and some
shell scripts that'd be fun he'd like to
know how the back board has the
motherboard mounted to it stays in place
and he says they saw the little metal
tacks here these little tabs that hold
this board in that they just bend in and
hold it in place you just wants to know
if if there's any concerns about it
falling forward about falling off we
actually have it up here on the wall and
it's not falling forward it's holding on
just fine you know and pretty much on
the back of these guys you can see it's
just a wire and there's just you know a
screw on the wall and pretty much comes
down here grabs that and I get out the
level tool and make sure it's not
crooked but yeah I know right so Thanks
for writing in about that Luke but so
far so good with those if I was really
concerned I guess I could reinforce them
but I don't I don't think that's gonna
be an issue and then finally Alex writes
in to say Darren in your photo frame
casemod I noticed that there really is a
lot of airflow from the heatsink is it
good enough for the karez the cracks
good enough to or the heatsink from the
processor anyway he's just talking about
it being really really hot
basically yeah like I said it got warm
but we're going to alleviate that today
so here's what's on the agenda now I'm
going to get rid of this ancient piece
of deprecated technology
we are going to be putting in holes for
ventilation also for power and Ethernet
so we can actually plug this bad boy in
and then we're going to do some pretty
intense glowing orange actually these
are white I figured it'd be a little
classier with the red bezel and all that
good stuff so we'll see so let's just do
the easy stuff first cold cathodes are
really inexpensive used to get them from
like direct ron but there are plenty of
retailers online that'll sell these or
if you've got a cool computer shop in
your town might want to check there you
can get them in varying colors and with
like little boards that will like
pulsates of the music and stuff like
that
this I wanted to go simple white I found
the ones that sell just one at a time in
their own little with the inverter if
not necessarily this was my backup if I
was going to do a third I think I'm
going to do a different case mod for the
third one but I did find a dual Deepak's
so we're gonna go ahead and set one of
these guys up and pretty much everything
you need to get started is in here they
just kind of tie into one of your
existing molex and what I like about
these is that they come with a backplane
for your PCI which will allow you an
on/off switch that's nice for the most
part this thing is going to be on but I
can I can imagine some circumstances may
be circumstances in which in which case
the the server might not be lit up I
don't know we'll see so I'm just going
to unscrew some of these
and these are just going to plug right
into your mullets in fact they're in
line if we had something that was
already plugged into this guy and then
that plugs into the little blue
transformer and then there's ports on
the side for both of the cold cathodes
now if I flip the switch to turn this
guy on
instant rave action or something I'm
just I guess now as far as fixing these
are concerns they actually provide you
with the essentials Oh crow
I love velcro I love velcro so much
someone agrees with me it was included
in a cage
all right so I've got the mounted I just
kind of put them in the center somewhere
you won't be able to see them so much
because of the bezel and now it's time
to get working on our cable management
and also prettying that up so I'm just
going to pull this and let's start at
the beginning a good place to start with
our ATX connector here this was our
little 12-volt guy that we did earlier
another thing I haven't done is this
stupid cat5 cable I really should have
put a jack over here but next one and
I'm gonna get my power supply out this
time not motherboard as I mistakenly
said several times last week and hard
drive now my first order of business is
pruiting up this cable here of
multicolored goodness and if this was a
more expensive power supply it might
have like a nice sheath over it or
something like this might be modular
might not have excess cables that I
don't need that'd be great but
considering we're using this Avia ITX AP
250 W went to save myself 10 mils right
there it it's kind of ugly
so what you can actually get from the
same vendors that I was just speaking
about before there's some of this loom
goodness and we're just going to put a
little bit over the ATX connector and
that's going to make it look really sexy
now this stuff you'll probably have to
order I haven't been able to find it in
a store and my roommate Dave has been
gracious enough to lend it to me so
that's nice we got a little bit of that
stuff going on however there's a rat
Shack in your area you can just find
yourself some generic loom it's plastic
it's goodness it doesn't look as sexy as
that but we may actually use a bit of
this later on see that looks nice it
pretty much just unravels and you if you
run the cables through I might do that
here for this 12-volt this way use a
lots of different materials now what's
nice about this is it opens up quite a
bit I can actually shove this in here so
what I've done is just put the ATX
connector inside of here and now I'm
just going to trim up some of this
excess
before we attach it all down you'll see
you're probably wondering aren't you
doing that backwards
and well kind of you'll see now the
trick is to take the modders other best
friend wire ties and so we have at the
front of this going straight into this
like a snake and I'm going to go ahead
and put one of these wire ties around it
and with that tightened up quite a bit
what this is going to allow me to do now
let's see figure out how much I need I
need about yay much now this will just
open up on the other end and go inside
out and it's kind of like some of those
Chinese finger traps all right how about
that that looks pretty good I got to say
you know you're not gonna see this
phrase stuff because it's at the bottom
and if I were to go back and do this
again I probably used a little bit more
say this was my own computer cool case
side window cuz it's 2003 then yeah I
definitely would have given to myself
some more looped it around again and
used the modders best friend so with all
that done last week as opposed to the
way that our first one was done we
actually ran our 12 volt extended the
wires and and random other under the
motherboard and unfortunately I did not
offset them so that I do have a giant
bulging thing of crimson nobody wants a
giant bulging a thing of crimps like ask
around believe me on that so what I'm
gonna do here is take just a bit of this
stuff which is very similar in fact I
could use this for consistency but I
really want to use some of this good
loom stuff and really it's just a matter
of cutting the parts that you need and a
loops around like so what I actually
used to use in my like former case mod
life back when I was a Unreal Tournament
Star you know back in the land party
days of yore I was big into actually
going over to your auto parts store and
finding some of that big thick loom that
you use on like cars okay you know this
is a good demonstration of the
difference
doing this good stuff and this and why I
should have taken aunt's advice and not
and then staggered these so I didn't
have a bulge and that guy sitting happy
there
let's now tidy up the rest of the cables
our cold cathodes thankfully they both
are on their own individual strands and
they just kind of plug into this little
inverter guy here so I'm going to set
these down and get them in place and
then worry about all this junk right
thankfully I do have a little strip of
velcro around here and what I want to do
oops is take this entire mess just kind
of bundle it up because nobody will ever
see it that was half the idea of the
bezel the inverter itself will actually
voco it to the bottom here so I do want
to just test fit these wires and make
sure that they fit
all right with our little package
bundled up here I'm going to go ahead
and plug in our SATA Drive now finally
the last thing that we're going to have
to do here is deal with one how are we
going to have to plug this in and get
the ethernet out and two how are we
gonna get any ventilation going on here
and for that we have this tool now
there's a million different ways to go
about this basically the way that the
power supply is set up is that it's
budding up against the side here of one
of our photo frames and really we just
need a hole in fact the more thing about
modding construction enniaa is just a
lot of boolean addition and boolean
subtraction and unfortunately I can't
just shove another poly in there and you
would remove so I have to use tools so I
have a bunch of different tools I could
all potentially do it like this guy
however I guess the MDF or whatever this
stuff is made of and the speed of this
and all it really was just causing a lot
of smoke here in the studio another
option is to use that's on this guy and
I should not be playing with it anyway
but that's not caught that's not
creating a pretty cut I'm not happy with
it so I'm just going to resort back to
one of the ways that I did the first one
my beta one if you will and that is to
use a hole saw now I've used a bigger
I'm going to use a bigger hole saw this
time because it's going to make a much
bigger hole that I'm not going to have
you know problems getting the eighty
power supply connector in however I will
say if I were to do this again I would
probably as Jason mentioned here put a
panel like a well like a like basically
a wall plug you've seen those where you
can get a wall plug you can also get a
wall plug with modular you know
different Jackson it whether it be coax
or cat5 so that would be kind of a neat
thing to have here as long as it's not
like biscuit color it's literally just
to move this aside and then drill hole
it's gonna get fun voila check that out
now I'm going to go ahead and make my
first cut and though we are in a garage
technically I do want to kind of keep
this set area a little pretty so for
that I have a hose connected to a vacuum
cleaner however I don't have three hands
so ladies and gentlemen Justin Applebaum
thank you I really appreciate this the
helmet isn't necessary the goggles no
one's
all right that's one happy hole now for
a second pour the event coming off the
heatsink or the power supply that is and
also why not
Jason vacuumed up a screwdriver I'm not
making this up
I'm not making it up one of the eighty
bitty ones we're gonna continue the show
that wasn't supposed to break okay I'm
gonna be honest guys didn't come out
beautiful came out a little bit better
than this guy but still oh yeah Paul's
agreeing with me here that I should
definitely on the next one try to do
something like a an actual Jack maybe
it'll take like an extension cable and
like mod that or something so that you
can plug into something on the side
rather than just cutting a hole for the
power supply I agree you don't need to
email me about it I know all right well
it is functional though and honestly
people that are admiring your
motherboard aren't necessarily peeking
around the side to see your well maybe
they are I don't know
I'm ready to put the rest of the stuff
in that's where I'm getting at did I
mention that the really long cat5 cable
was not a great idea I wouldn't
recommend doing it this way either
well hey would you look at that it all
fit
next on hack tips how to point your
Paris play it and would you look at that
it all just kind of comes together I'll
just slide this over and would you look
at that I am very happy with the way
that this guy came out I mean all things
considered I still could have prettied
up this side a little bit better I still
I'm gonna have to go back and put some
holes in for my ventilation and I'm
thinking either the top or bottom is
really best for that and really it just
comes down to using a one inch hole saw
and some of these guys now these are
great because you couple that with a
couple of screws and boom it just I
don't know adds a little something to it
I don't think I'm gonna need to use like
a 16 millimeter fan or something like
that honestly I was running this for the
entire hack the crack the code challenge
for like three hours straight
didn't have any problems with it but
we'll see I'm gonna put them up on the
wall I'm gonna run some tests maybe all
I'd save one prime95 or something like
that but this is a Linux machine so I'm
gonna have to find something to just
figure out PI for the rest of its life
and I'll tell you I'll tell you what I
run into heat wise so that's all the
time we have for today to finish up the
case mod we may come back to this at a
later point to add some doodads but for
the moment I'm gonna say man does that
not accomplish the goal I'm saying hey
technology is beautiful let's mount it
let's put it on the wall let's just
admire all of the countless engineers I
mean we're talking thousands maybe
millions of engineers over the course of
you know the computing history to bring
us to where we are today and this is
just gorgeous stuff so should be up on a
wall anyway that's it for the modding
segment I look forward to your feedback
of course you guys know send that over
to feedback at hack 5 org

know we got your emails I gotta give a
shout-out for sending up some goodness
check it out that is some goodness he
says I hope you enjoyed this guy's
thanks for all the memories windows for
workgroups I was like five who when
these came out I'm gonna stall 6.22
that's some good stuff anyway I started
on dos 3.0 but yeah this is good stuff
oh thank you so much for having fill out
our okay that's cool yeah check in next
week with our four friends on there

tried it I have no idea I've never had a
Vegemite sandwich nor have I ever had a
Victorian okay I guess we'll have to try
it go on to emails that's doing this
Jamie writes please please tell us all
the parts you use for the cluster nodes
in Episode eight twenty three please and
he loves the show how did I dressed it
last episode they ate the power supply
that we use that's warn you that
everybody's crazy about seriously was
just like the cheapest power supply I
could find it fries there's also a
smallest as an ITX tak AAP 250w from
eight via as far as the mobo and
everything else I'm pretty sure I
covered this but the motherboard is a
yes is cut into so thisis pH 8 867 tak M
le it's the least expensive asus
motherboard that I could find it also
has that chipset that was recalled but
considering I'm only using one
SATA drive on here it actually doesn't
affect it any the chip on here the CPU
is a this is one of the new Sandy Bridge
hives so I believe it's the 2500 or
2,500 K and then just whatever the
cheapest four gigs of RAM you can find
is and ended up with a two and a half
inch 250 gig Western Digital Scorpio
blue with really anything work coalesce
around some virtual machines so really
fast about the CPU in the RAM very nice
in this instance yes he's nice initial
hit writes you guys should work on meta
tagging your episodes based on what is
covered and then have a search function
for that I'm having all sorts of issues
finding a few older episodes I remember
on Android as I'm just working on one
and I want to play with it now okay I
totally agree with you we actually do
tag every episode but dude I've got a
great picture for you guys on the new
site Paul is actually helping us out
with this putting together all of the
old segments into individual searchable
catalogue that's gonna go under like the
gaming and the hacks and stuff like that
give me anxiety some other stuff if you
go to the website you see more of my
stuff it really hasn't been populated
it's a project I tried to do yeah I
think there were like two things in
there so far all is saving us in our
website Thank You Walter we love you yes
it's true
never more rights after the last crack
the code challenge I realized that you
could brute-force steg files a lot
faster if you created multiple
concurrent threads to do the work so I
wrote my own script to do just that it's
definitely faster than cipher and script
though not as pretty I don't have a
website or blog so I paste bits bend it
at pastebin.com slash venture words oh
and I'm really looking forward to the
next one dude thank you so much my love
it when everybody shares code with it
that's awesome
yeah thanks for giving your code we
don't care if it's not pretty
yeah anything else yes we have one more
tim writes hey guys i have a question
about a possible dropbox alternative I
have been using Dropbox for about a year
now what for my paranormal research
group that is really cool I'm sorry it
goes Turner's fan I just totally
fangirled it has worked great for
sharing case file paperwork evidence
collections awesome etc I would invest
in the pro versions to hold more space
but due to a security can
each member of our organization has
their own account and each person
depending on their position in the
company gets access to certain folders
if I got Pro for each person I would end
up spending thousands of dollars a year
yes they have 20 members so his question
is would there be a better way of
sharing files and syncing file versions
instantly between users he's tried micro
suck SkyDrive but he's also using some
Linux machines which counts that out
okay you definitely need to look at this
project it's over at github and it is
called lip sync and it's an open-source
alternative to Dropbox that basically
does the same sort of thing using some
fun open-source stuff go climb upon the
past open SSH and our sink our sink is
awesome why have we not been a feature
on that that will basically do the same
kind of thing as Dropbox they have some
big plans to add versioning and stuff
like that I don't know how far along
they are with that but basically they
will allow you to build your own Dropbox
alternative forget paying those for all
those users yeah roll your own that's a
lot yeah hope that helps me too and now
for our technolog so
oh you're so excited yay I saw it and
it's really awesome isn't it the guy
with the the truck and the dresses the
technology of the week is from Drew he
sent us these photos of his GPS rig that
