by Toyota Barack 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2014 and i am taking a look
at the geo not we looked at this last
year when it was just in its prototype
phase and we're actually looking at very
close to the final product this is a
really exciting action camera here but
it's very different from most action
cameras in that actually takes a 360
degree field of view video that's right
it actually has three eight megapixel
cameras attached here it's got a like I
said 360 degree horizontal field of view
and about 150 degree vertical and what's
really cool is it actually stitches all
that video together in the camera so
what you get out of it is actually a
something like 2048 x 1024 pixel h.264
file nice AAC audio and all of that
stuff it's a really novel concept
previously you could actually hack
together something like this using say
six GoPro cameras in some ridiculous
mountain you'd look awesome I'm sure
this doesn't look any more ridiculous
and Google glass so you know what
happens that's the price of being a geek
honestly and this is pretty cool they've
got some mobile apps that actually allow
you to play back these video files and
just kind of like either use the
accelerometer on the you know iOS or
Android device to kind of tilt and pan
them around with or you can just touch
around them you can import it into
they've got like of course as everyone
does a cloud-based ecosystem where you
can import your videos into there and
all your other friends can see it or if
you just want to put it on YouTube you
can actually just export the file bring
it into any regular video editing system
and it you can kind of see in a little
bit of bowing at the bottom where it
stitches it together but doesn't seem
too bad it seems like a pretty cool tool
if you were to say just want to record
and not have to care about where you're
pointing the camera right now Sarah
knows that she's pointing the camera at
me in the future she could just put the
camera on a stick and not have to worry
about it and then we'd be able to pan
around you'd be able to see Sarah and be
like wow look at those awesome camera
people at hak5 I don't know seems pretty
cool they're actually demoing it with
oculus rift so that's kind of cool it's
not actually available at this very
moment but they do have a reserve right
now if you go to their website you can
go ahead
and reserve yourself a unit it is kind
of pricey at 500 bucks but there's
nothing really else like it and seems
pretty cool two hours of battery life
and otherwise just seems like a nifty
gadget you know what I love nifty
gadgets so check it out geo thanks once
again to toyota for sponsoring our CES
