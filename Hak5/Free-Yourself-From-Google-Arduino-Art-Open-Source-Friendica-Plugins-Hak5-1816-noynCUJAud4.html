open-source friend to cut plugins
getting the most from your 4 terabyte
hard drive and building art with
Arduinos all that and more this time on
hack 5 this episode of hack 5 is brought
to you by domain.com hello welcome to
hack 5 my name is darren kitchen my name
is Shannon Morris your weekly dose
effective loss welcome everyone to our
humble abode hey well we missed you
welcome new viewers that may have also
noticed little hack 5 stickers on the
backs of laptops dude that was so cool
ok so I don't have cable or where's that
show even at so Silicon Valley
apparently there was a hack 5 sticker on
a chick's laptop during one of the
scenes in the second episode
yeah it's the new season season 2 of
Silicon Valley but now everybody
understands why myself as well as Rob
fuller aka mu bik's and Colleen and a
bunch of other friends ended up getting
to go to the Hollywood premiere of this
TV show because it turns out sometimes
sometimes Hollywood doesn't want to be
that stereotype where they're like
totally your hack into Gibson you look
at my hack some totes hacking actually
Paul if you pull this out I'm gonna show
you guys how you can be an uber leet
hacker right now one command you typed
it free and you do this just go oh yeah
thoth acting so we've had the awesome
opportunity to be technical consultants
and as such we've been rewarded with
little limoges to hack 5 on a TV show
which is fun kind of like the Superman
comic book from like your second year
whoa that's old-school way to bring it
back oh it's going all right
I learned that so anyway that was fun
there was also another really good
reference but you know what I'm gonna
save that one for next week because we
are gonna have to respond because the
toy makers are talking about gauntlet
but rules we'll save that for next week
yes this week we have an epic show
though wow so much cool stuffs has been
happening and we're going to talk about
how you can free yourself from the goog
getting off the giggles speaking of
freeing yourself though
have you heard we do this show called
threat wire yes we're a threat wired net
it's our news show we just posted a new
episode today actually you can find it
over on YouTube as well youtube.com
slash hack 5 so there's some big stuff
happening with the Patriot Act right now
in the USA Freedom Act so we've been
reporting on that in this little short
form show threat wire it's like three to
five minutes long and you can check it
out over at threat wired dotnet as well
as support us over on our patreon
patreon comm slash threat wire yeah
anyway it's fun to do that weird it's
really cool too because it's a
collaboration between myself and Shannon
and Patrick Norton
and it's good to get multiple
perspectives of stories of the week and
I think of that nature so you know let
us know what you guys think and very
thoughtful very factual it's really cool
it's a good show yes it's nothing like
this show which is so laissez-faire we
have no idea what we're doing we're
flying by the seat of our pants coming
up on ten years of that so that's that's
a lot of 10 years worth of pants well I
think we should probably get started
well okay I know why don't you start us
off because I know that you had epic
computer struggle in fact if you had you
know what this is a perfect opportunity
for another promo we're just gonna
back-to-back promo sheena built a gaming
rig on tech that we knew is my new
gaming pc i built it over on my other
show tech thing which is at tek king.com
and on that show i listed out all the
specs i had a budget set and everything
so we built the computer out really good
episode definitely check it out but one
of the problems that I had was I
installed my hard drive and it was a
four terabyte hard disk drive and then I
had a 250 gig solid state drive so of
course I'm putting windows on the solid
state because die I want it to boot up
fast and yes I did say Windows don't
freak out there's reasons for me having
a Windows computer as well as the Linux
machine so it's called gaming like you
don't build a gaming PC to not get hot
though although I will give steam a lot
of credit yeah it's really come a long
way they have yeah so yes it's a Windows
7 machine and then the four terabyte
which is freaking huge and I'm not gonna
fill it up very quickly but that's gonna
be for
all my data pictures games except for
the few that I want to boot up first and
then like you know all my videos and p3
stuff like that I said the same thing
like what 15 years ago at my first LAN
party with a 30 gigabyte hard drive
right and then you learn that the hard
way how easy it is to fill those up with
web sees this is an epic opportunity to
learn cool things about like the
constant limitations that we keep
running into and expanding like we're
running into that with one of our
machines that's I can't believe there's
still a 32-bit machine in this warehouse
but you know the 4 gigabyte limitation
for RAM there's always these limitations
where you have to say like ok we're
making a new file system or okay we're
making or whatever have you exactly yes
where's this gonna scale to I discovered
a limitation so I installed Windows
solid-state data is going on the hard
disk drive turns out there is this
really weird problem with hard disk
drives on Windows where it has problems
supporting hard disk drives over 2
terabytes so it turns out Windows wrote
up this support column over on their
website support.microsoft.com so windows
support for hard disks that are larger
than 2 terabytes if you scroll down on
this website they have a whole section
that pretty much explains it really well
so apparently when you're using MBA the
partitioning scheme called Master Boot
Record that one limits you to 2 to 2
terabytes so you want to use a different
partitioning scheme called GPT aka GUI D
partitioning scheme so that one allows
you to do up to like this is that a
bytes or two something like that a lot
more is that a byte yeah it doesn't have
that same limitation with it so the
problem I was having because they were
like oh well it's really easy no matter
if you have a data one or a bootable one
you just open up your disk management
and you see this little window that says
initialize disk either as GPT or MBR I
was like ok but I opened up mine and I
didn't get that option why well it turns
out because Windows 8 you yeah cuz
Windows hates me so it turns out when I
had installed Windows on the solid state
it also installed a
like a recovery partition on the hard
disk drive without my knowledge even
though I didn't like I was installing
the operating system so I had to go back
in and like I tweeted my frustration I
was like I'm having a beer I'm angry ah
so I tweeted about it and everybody was
like oh well it's you know plug it into
a Linux Drive of course yeah and then
they were like use a yeah jeepers to use
gparted
that's like well yeah I could do that I
could just install that on there but
then I need to get internet blah blah
so I reinstalled Windows cuz I was like
ok if there's this recovery partition on
the hard drive that I didn't went there
in the first place
maybe if I reinstall windows I can get
rid of that so I reinstall windows I
just unplug the hard drive drive and
just you know pretend we're not here you
know so I just don't plug the hard drive
install windows on the solid-state
replug in the hard disk drive do all my
updates and all that and then I get back
into Disk Management doesn't let me do
anything with it no it's just like crap
so then I decided to try this part which
is a command-line utility program that's
built into Windows so you just go into
your CMD type in disk space part and
then you can get a list of all your
different hard disk drives and solid
states you can also look up like how
much space is available on all of them
and then you can do some other things
that you can't necessarily do in Disk
Management in the GUI so I clean my disk
luckily it was successful this time
around since I did the new install
windows and then I go back into Disk
Management and surprised that Windows
popped up so now I was able to turn my
disk into an NTFS formatted drive under
the GPT partitioning scheme as opposed
to MBA I know that was a long story but
I don't know epic it was really hard to
find any information regarding data only
drives with a fresh install of Windows
and having that issue with that recovery
partition that's very specific I can see
why Windows would want to do that
because it's like hey I'm being
installed and look there's another hard
drive and I want to put some recovery
data somewhere but just in case the hard
drive I'm installed on fails oh look
I'll put it over the
they didn't tell me didn't tell me a
thing and it just crapped all over my
harddrive and I was just like Windows
that's enough for me we have to accept
oh you know proprietary stuff where we
don't have those sort of choices and
that's okay figure it out I was able to
reformat my drive I have access to the
entire four terabytes as opposed to just
two unallocated sections which was very
irritating you know if you wanted to you
could get yourself a file system with a
maximum limitation of 256 zettabytes
that's as Adler Webb has pointed out on
IRC ZFS it's a to combine the file
system and logical volume manager it's
by Sun Microsystems and unfortunately
you're not gonna find a whole lot of
support for the windows but if you're on
the Solaris and BSD and Linux stuff yeah
you know otherwise I'm I keep just going
with ext cuz that's what I do
I don't know if I should feel bad now oh
I had mentioned IRC hey guys guess what
it's Monday and so we're recording hack
5 and that also means that you can tune
in live now just like we used to do over
at the hack house top quiet org slash
live you can see the live stream
including IRC and multiple cameras from
around the warehouse you can join us in
chat IRC hak5 org pound hack 5 and
that's where you know we can see all
your beautiful faces yes it's been too
long since we did this it's the house so
I feel like I need him we missed you
yeah it's a cheers to the hack
housewares picture I think last time we
saw you guys in front of our faces well
the recording was like 2008 mmm we
figured it was time to bring it back I
missed hippie and velcro and archiver
and sub no forget the sub kind of guy
he's he's a troll you just stay away
from that guy okay
yeah that's rad yeah I was able to fix
it myself without doing all the you know
crazy other installations how would you
love to now fill that 4 terabyte hard
drive
with what
with all of your data from Google that's
right Google you know what gotta hand it
to them they're the kind of transparent
when it comes to a lot of things and
they give you the keys to like listen if
if you feel like you're in a codependent
with relationship with Google and maybe
you want to walk they give you the means
to do that and I felt like now would be
a good time to bring up one of the
things that I've been using recently
because we're working on a we're working
on our 10-year anniversary hack five
year book and so I'm trying to like get
all of my photos and I've been using
Google services for so long between
Picasa and Google+ and the auto backup
stuff which is cool but I want those I
own that material you know I took those
photos on all of my phones and cameras
and I upload it to their servers and I
have since lost it or whatever happens
so it's nice to be able to know that
Google offers a service called Google
takeout and so check this out Google
takeout is basically they're like hey
dude this thing's go hard you say it
yeah they're texting me right now as I
mute my phone there's they're like hey
you know it's your data yeah download a
copy so you can actually go ahead and
check the boxes here for all of the
stuff I'm gonna say select none because
this is a ton of stuff but all of your
plus ones you know all of your bookmarks
your calendars everything you haven't
drive all of your photos all of your
hangouts some hangouts that I definitely
don't want to read again you know all of
your places on Google Maps all of your
videos and everything on YouTube it's
crazy that they just let you take the
stuff and walk I know Facebook does the
same thing too but what I've been doing
is just selecting Google photos and then
you go next and you can download
yourself a copy now here's the really
important thing okay going along with
what you were saying about Windows yeah
I would really recommend doing this on a
Linux box if that's your jam because if
you're like me you've got like a ton of
material up in the Google cloud if you
will you're not going to be very happy
with either of these two options so
first of all you have to choose a file
type and since they're going to be
sending you a ton of files they're gonna
archive it up and the most simple way to
do that is with a zip everybody loves a
zip file right well except hey speaking
of limitation
zip files have a two gigabyte limitation
two gigabyte yeah ah but of course back
in the 80s when zip files were cool 2
gigabytes was like a measure like who
would ever think to gigabytes right so
yeah and I'm sure that also has to do
with a lot of other file systems so it
is stuff well was it dividing it up into
like hundred two gigabyte when I
actually went to go and do this the
first time it was so hilarious the text
I wish I had taken a screenshot but
Google says basically for your
convenience we've split up all of your
photos into 68 individual zip files oh
my god you have to authenticate to
download of each and if you're like
myself and you use like an 80 character
password as well as you've to type in
your password every time password every
time and your two-factor authentication
code every time so it's like 68 of those
you probably don't want to do that
thankfully they do give you an
alternative you can do a tar gzip right
tar.gz yeah GZ grab yourself one of
those you'll get the you'll get it the
link by email and you can go ahead and
then create that archive it takes kind
of forever
yeah I'm sure okay so here's another tip
if you're gonna do this on Windows not
only do you want the tar but you do not
want to use your standard 7-zip or
WinRAR or whatever have you this gooey
based file extractors when it comes to
this tar.gz said if you're anything like
myself you have you know your data drive
and then your system drive and your
system drive is probably small and it's
probably an SSD because you just want it
to like boot your OS and maybe a few
core utilities like for me Adobe
Creative Suite yeah and you wanted to do
it fast well this is gonna fill that up
I've got something like I don't even
have I haven't a clue how many gigs and
photos that I have a lot so what you'll
want is grab yourself a copy of tar for
Windows you can find this at new win32
dot sourceforge.net and this is
basically the open-source GNU
ooh tar that you would find on Linux but
it's a version for Windows because if
you don't do this what's going to happen
is 7-zip or WinRAR is going to keep even
if you try to say on your D Drive or
your external hard drive extract all of
that data that drive it's going to first
fill up your C Drive in your your
temporary folder as it's trying to do
that so you're gonna end up filling your
disk you probably won't even be able to
extract this the only real way to get
around this if you are going to do this
on Windows is to just go ahead and use
tar for Windows which is a command line
app so once you've got that installed it
will put itself for instance mine here
I've installed it to deprogram files and
in the bin directory you'll go ahead and
setar and boom there you go it works
exactly like tar polemics tech tech help
and you can see it's the exact same
thing so you would do like tar tack z x
VF to extract tar gz verbose and then to
specify the file which would be like t :
to access download just backslash my
google stuff tar gz or whatever whatever
file they give you and then specify a
path where you want it to end up it is I
think what we've actually demonstrated
here is kind of the crazy workaround
stuff you have to do to be in that
Stockholm Syndrome relationship with
Windows so but you know some people are
forced to use Windows either at work or
wherever so this might be really
important information for them yes or
you may be a gamer or you may be a gamer
yeah I mean I do have a Linux PC as well
so yes I don't know if you know about
the servers that just came in start
playing some land games we've got some
game servers coming into the hack 5
Network we're actually looking for
awesome moderators to help out with our
upcoming let's see we've got a skull tag
coming up we've got Unreal Tournament 99
we've got minecraft yes so we are going
to use all of those 65 something stat
public IP addresses that we got with the
half a half a gigabit of bandwidth that
we got here so yeah hopefully we'll find
you an IRC and if you're interested
we'll get to set up with the SS H's and
all the good stuff so that we can get
epic LAN party is continuing that'll be
so much tied to those with some of the
open houses but anyway enough on that
very excited about all of that we should
take a break because we have just
basically demonstrated all of the
terrible stuff show and tellings that is
Windows I need I need a breather I need
to get let's when we get back we're
gonna be in bash okay we're gonna be
bashing it up if you've been watching
act 5 for a while you know how much we
love domain.com we use them whenever we
register new domains and the other day I
was thinking about all the projects that
we're doing the ethic stuff at the hack
5 warehouse between you know open source
distributed social networks and indoor
competitive drone racing and so many
other cool things and then it really got
me thinking about this new thing
domain.com clued me in on called dock
club it is the coolest thing so many
amazing sites are being built on this
new top-level domain and I have to say
I'm so on board with this so this summer
you're gonna see a lot of hack 5 stuff
being built on dock club because it's
kind of perfect I mean a club it's it's
universally understood its global it's
not just here in the US either so if
you're building a new business site or
coming up with a startup game or
something like that it's kind of perfect
I mean I really it's like any business
can be kind of considered a club I mean
the Internet is all about community and
collaboration so in essence it is a club
if you see I'm saying it's the ultimate
social domain so this summer get ready
for hack 5 and dock club and in the
meantime when you think about your next
website consider a doc Club and if you'd
like to grab one you can head over to
domain.com slash club to register your
da club domain they're only $9.99 a year
and there are thousands of options still
available so when you do that make sure
you use the coupon code hak5 hak5
that'll get you an extra 15% off and
then our friends over at domain.com will
know that we sent you and it'll be epic
in fact if you like you can just tweet
me at hack 5 Darren the doc club that
you registered and you know send you
guys some mad props so with that when
you think domain names
think domain.com she unless i'ma tell
you in the warehouse you were making
rainbows come out of a cat's butt so if
you guys recall I have it pulled up on
my computer I did a hack 5 episode where
we took a nyan cat and stuck it with
this Arduino and a big old breadboard
and then stuck a bunch of LEDs on it so
it lights up and it turns into a little
rainbow so I had a few problems with it
first off I didn't have anywhere to
really put it so then you were like you
should put it in the frame and I was
like that's a good idea
but the problem is the thing it's the it
sits like this on a table so I had to
figure out how to wire it so I can just
stick the breadboard behind it and
actually put it in a frames only what
what was the technique to wiring it like
that it was very easy actually look so
putting electronics in shadow boxes and
frames I think that's a great idea years
ago we put together a computer inside of
a shadow box frame and it was pretty
amazing I feel like technology is
beautiful it should be up on the wall it
should be lit with cold cathodes it
should be you know celebrated so what I
did with mine if we look at the little
close-up I had the breadboard back here
and then luckily my bread board had
stickers on the back so I was just able
to paste it onto the LEDs and I used
really long male-to-female connecting
connector wires to put it right in here
now I know that I could have used a PCB
board and probably soldered on all the
different components you wouldn't get
all the pretty wires I like how they
told me I'm kind of like all the
colorful wires so then we plug this into
the Arduino instead of using the 2 volt
adapter for the wall that we had right
here we plug this into one of our hak5
batteries that we saw in the hack shop
so when I light a toggled I was at 12
volt yes okay and that's kind of yeah
that's the same thing that the pineapple
uses so we have extras and that looks
all so now we have it running the
correct way and then what I'm gonna do
with this I'm gonna velcro bleh
because you had rainbows going into the
cat's butt yeah and they had to come out
of the cat's butt okay it wouldn't look
right well he would be flying backwards
I guess and then what I can do cuz this
is magnetic so it closes up nice and
easily and we'll just hang it up on the
wall like that that's fantastic you
should probably also point out and she's
not showing it to you but could you not
find any string that's a gutted Ethernet
cable yeah yeah it's there okay
well it's really well I love it it's got
so much technolo we love Nicolas we
celebrate technology here and if you
have done creative projects where you
would like to you know celebrate
technology with us you can use hashtag
techno list right Instagram Facebook all
the social thing is tweet Shannon she's
you me not yes okay you wanna get to
doing server stuff you know we probably
should okay I can watch me and cat all
day but instead we're gonna get over to
our friend acai right yes you will
recall social doc five org is the URL
this is our social network it's our
distributed decentralized open-source
alternative to the Facebook's and
Twitter's and it's so great because
every I must give so much credit to all
of you guys that have joined up on our
node and added us as friends from other
nodes and I just think it's so great
that we can like have you know something
that's not our own little social network
so it can get better though to see this
is the beautiful thing about it being
open source is that you can like extend
it and make it better a lot of this is
like PHP and Python and other languages
that you can open the source right and
so up on the predicate github you'll
find a ton of add-ons and it's pretty
cool you should check out this list
basically had too many it just gets way
janky you know what I haven't added
enough to see how
how much the Janka fication is a friend
iike i hope it's not too much me I'm
just gonna install a simple one just to
show you guys the process because
they've made it really easy so from the
github I'm actually looking at a
Gravatar plug-in here and we can go into
here you can read all about it you're
probably familiar with Gravatar avatars
yeah it's you know if I can type in do
they have a search create your own
Gravatar I think I already have one but
yes Darin at hack 5 org ponies and kids
yep it's already there ok well anyway
it's just a way for me to have my
thumbnail my presence online which is
tied to my email address is pretty cool
so we would like to add that to our
friend to cut and this plugin makes it
super simple so let me just go ahead and
show you how to do it on your server so
if you're running a friend of kin node
I'm going to pull up our virtual server
which we call our yes here we are on our
I believe it's an Apache server yes yes
it is as of last time we downloaded it
right because nginx was for the other
server anyway you're going to go ahead
and in your VAR WWE HTML the root of
your Apache web server where you have
your friend akka installation you'll
just go ahead and create a new directory
called add-on that's it so once you have
that directory you can now go ahead and
grab yourself any of these plugins and
just add them to that folder so right
here you're just going over to the
github and you're gonna get the the
master download of all the gravity I'm
just gonna get this one and you can read
all about how to you know set it up and
all of that if you want to get fancy
with it but just from the root here if I
go to Gravatar I'll find my Gravatar tar
gzip okay copy that
over and I don't think I have the
clipboard going yeah I don't so I'll
just do it the old-fashioned way
I'm gonna go ahead and just double you
get this okay
hang on there we go oh ha cannot write
you know why cuz I didn't do this as
rude pseudo pseudo bangbang that's what
I did
pseudo bangbang did I know I didn't okay
so from there I can see I've got my
target easy and it's really just a
matter of doing it our z x BF just like
I was talking about using tor on Windows
it's the same thing okay and pseudo
bangbang because I keep forgetting to
run that as route and if I LS now I can
actually remove that Gravatar tar.gz
okay uh why do i pseudo yes I know how
to use routes oh man and that's it and
now it's there and that's pretty much
you know as far as like activating it
now I just go back over to here I am in
hack five social and from here and the
admin panel under plugins it's really
just a matter of checking the box for
Gravatar support your plugins list there
you've got the opportunity to configure
them as you you know feel do there's
really not much with this plug-in other
than you know yeah it just carries over
your avatar pretty much right and if you
don't have one you get the choice like
making a monster face or a
computer-generated face or whatever have
you but they also have additional
plugins as well on the github page for
things like Twitter integration as well
as other social networks so there's a
lot that you can do with it not just you
know changing your avatar there's an IRC
integration which we could integrate
with actually don't find that org so
it's it's the same download for any of
those and that's the same place where
you'll find all of the documentation if
you feel you don't like writing your own
you can do that right I love open-source
