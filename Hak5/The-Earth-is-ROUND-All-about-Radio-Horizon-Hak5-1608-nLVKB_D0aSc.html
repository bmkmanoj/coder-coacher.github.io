line-of-sight this time on hack five
this episode of hack five is brought to
you by domain.com hello and welcome to
this week's episode of hack five my name
is Shannon Morse and I'm Rob Dunphy this
is your weekly dose thickness welcome
Rob
you know I heard that we had a gift from
a fan so we might as well start it off
with that yeah let's start to get
friends other than the whiskey other
than the whiskey give me two seconds
time I'll be back hey it's a kitchen
from the kitchen dude it's a Rob Dunn
free otherwise known on IRC as archiver
dude big fan er has been for years
thanks for coming down to the States
yeah sure do later cool so I'll leave
you guys do your stuff I'm going on
stage see this is what makes the show
worth doing I totally agree yes we have
a live audience yeah and we have drums
today in the studio if anyone says that
we don't like drones mm-hmm we do in
fact actually let's clear some of these
because some of them are just not gonna
serve our purposes for today definitely
not the ar.drone that's just gonna be
Wi-Fi hack
not the crazy bulldog uh the Cujo quad
is it work
no the iris I would love to because it
does have open source firmware use this
however all we're having some problems
with it so we're working with 3d
robotics to get that sorted this in fact
this little guy here is the beginnings
it's kind of like a ninja turtle okay I
was going to go with a pineapple drone
but anyway that's that's a little bit of
foreshadowing in fact we may not be
using that guy today either depending on
frequencies turns out he operates at 2.4
gigahertz and so does this guy and guess
what we're putting in the atmosphere
today right now pineapples in the sky
yes yeah it was gonna be a good one
because so are we not are we not dumping
it on top of a parrot ar.drone to
destroy it this time no that is not in
fact what we
are doing instead we're gonna be using
it to seek out new life and new
civilizations and mostly abs be beacons
from snow plans kind of like finding
Cylons kind of like yes very similar in
fact you see what happens is the
airplanes send out these beacons and
they are bacon right these abs be bacon
tells them the icao designation um you
know little numbers on that it was able
to track them on my 80s be sharp Reagan
it's like a dradis but for software yes
right and so we are going to in fact
network our drones are Cylon seeking
drones here we're going to be able to
see aircraft far away how far would you
say well this is its what brings us to
the topic of today's conversation as we
talk about the horizon and reveal
horizons and distance and line of sight
is there something else on there might
be a little bit of geometry
yeah math yeah well but there's math
with drones and vault and we're going to
a mountaintop okay as long as there are
drones a mountaintop yes honey I found
the Pens we can actually start the
segment proper here we go
so as we've been talking about in this
radio series we've been talking about
our e/m waves oh now I can start the
segment proper alright I mean if you
insist so why don't you work on that
well will I work on this 9 a.m. doesn't
matter it's which means it's plus 8 in
Ireland so anyway as we've been talking
about on this series we've been talking
about electromagnetic waves or in our
case now we're really just talking about
our radio signals and as they travel
they're impacted by so many different
things we've been talking about you know
atmospheric interference with a mainly
absorption of like the air molecules
we've got reflection of different
objects we've got the fraction and
refraction and I'm not going to get into
all the maths of those but essentially
if I want to talk to you and there's
something in between us it's it's really
gonna kind of get in the way right and
so what we'll be talking about today is
the line-of-sight propagation so as an
example here there we go just pull this
off my hacker
you're welcome I just do a little bit
okay no that's great it's great we can
factor this in okay and that that's not
a math joke so here we go it's lawn
chair lawn chairs lawn chairs okay so
the thing about this is if I wanted to
test your blood alcohol content or
otherwise just annoy you for for being
drunk on the set and for those that can
tell I don't know how well you're gonna
come out on the show but I am pointing a
flashlight at Shannon could probably see
on her cam there and so as you can see
we have great line-of-sight here but
we're gonna have a problem here if
there's a oh that was no good see as the
whiskey gets in the way as it tends to
do we don't have proper line of sight
and so what we're going to have to do in
this case is actually if I if I want to
reach Shannon is I'm gonna have to raise
my flashlight or in our example it's
going to be an antenna so what we're
gonna do is go to the mountaintop yeah
yes and then the drones are involved
because of interesting regulations or
lack thereof but we will be very
responsible and it will be fun and I'm
not going to drink the rest of the
whiskey in this particular instance
because we will be flying a little later
okay you will yes I will now I say that
there's that line-of-sight thing but
it's actually not necessarily the case
when we talk about radio waves
turns out anything below about two
megahertz actually is what we consider a
ground wave and really anything between
one and thirty megahertz are what we
could kind of consider sky waves right
yeah I know it sounds all steampunk and
stuff and essentially what we're talking
about our waves that are reflected by
the upper ionosphere so somewhere
between 85 and 600 kilometers which is
pretty high up there when you kind of
consider to put that in perspective that
the International Space Station lives
between 330 and 430 kilometers altitude
so it's really awesome that we have an
his fear we were talking about this
earlier about how like I wouldn't
everything be easier if there wasn't an
atmosphere and this was just a barren
Rock yes
turns out not the case if we're using
those high frequencies that can just
kind of bounce around and then that's
some good feedback about that as well
right so they're not limited to the line
of sight they can actually bounce around
the atmosphere which is how you can get
halfway around the world with them which
is really cool but we're not doing that
today we're actually talking about
higher frequencies we're talking up well
in our case when we're doing a DSP and
we're just trying to find airplanes in
the sky we're talking about a higher
frequency and any obstacle is going to
block those and it's gonna be limited by
our radio horizon we're talking about
1090 megahertz here and so a radio
horizon is really the furthest point of
propagation now it's really also going
to depend on the transmission power and
also the antennas used because for
example around 100 megahertz is where we
FM radio that does a decent job of
actually getting through trees and
buildings and then there's other you
know you we've got cellular you know
we've got our 900 maker GSM stuff and
that actually takes advantage of a lot
of different I'm gonna throw out in
terms a multipath that's going to
actually allow you to get cell service
you know within what is it the canyon of
a city with all the buildings and
everything and anyway not to not to get
too much into a tangent but this is what
is going to lead us to a really fun
interesting thing called the Fornelli
yes
so the for now no I think he's French
I'm not really sure so Shannon this is
your antenna right here okay it's a
great-looking antenna thank you
yep and then here's my antenna right
here and we were like oh hey check this
out
we've got a really wonderful stream of
ants in between us but it's actually the
line-of-sight and so our two antennas
can see each other but oh no look wait
there's like a really poorly drawn
mountain in between us but we can still
see right you're still tall enough right
but the thing about this fernell zone is
it's this
of elliptical shape that is in between
our two antennas that depending on the
frequency like you know if we're using a
low frequency it's gonna be pretty wide
and if we're using high frequency is
gonna be pretty narrow but essentially
it's gonna be all like a football oh but
wait wait a part of it is going through
the mountain yeah a part of it is and
that is kind of a bummer and so what
this is actually going to do is it's
going to degrade our link quality you
know we're we would we would ideally
like less than 20% of this Fornell zone
to be obstructed in this case we could
have as much as 40% and what will happen
is a radio wave will hit this and bounce
right and math is involved and there is
a bunch of refraction and reflection and
other stuff like that right essentially
it bounces and it's no good and ends up
looking like the verizon logo I don't
know why how that ended up happening but
it's like oh no these are no good and
what happens is they kind of scatter
around and that same signal right it's
gonna get to the source but it's gonna
get at a later time because it spent
more time going through the air and
stuff and that is an example of a
multiple path or a multi path where our
signal sure it went this way straight
across but it also kind of went this way
and it also kind of went that way and
it's gonna bounce off stuff and it's not
even just vertically - like if we have a
link between us between two buildings
yeah there's a building off to the side
fresnel or Fornell zone going to the
sides yeah it's like this big doughnut
shape where my balloons I need my
balloons
so so in this case it's actually going
to cause some obstructions and this is
in fact why in the case of what we're
trying to demonstrate today by raising
our antenna see we wouldn't have this
problem if you know my antenna
here's Darren's antenna well Shannon's
antenna you could just raise yours up a
little bit and then suddenly your friend
ELLs own would be totally different our
our line would be across here and okay
your four nails I wanted to be something
like
that and we would have a better chance
of actually hearing each other's
obstructed from the mountain yes
everything gets there almost at the same
time yes so we have to take into account
obstructions like that and different
like I said different frequencies are
going to be impacted differently by you
know things like trees and buildings and
we also have to take into account the
horizon because it turns out the earth
is not in fact flat wait I know I know
as much as google maps which show you
otherwise it's more kind of spherical
ish so is would that explain why
whenever I look into the ocean its kind
of curved at the end you can only see so
far like a it looks like a boats falling
off yes in fact goes far in fact
speaking of the ocean how tall are you
that's crazy I am seven feet tall that's
all you really five five five well then
let's go to the beach for an experiment
oh boy

we're back and it's time for the trivia
question of the week now the last trivia
question that we had was what affected
the turbo button have on early personal
computers and the answer was
surprisingly that it slowed the
processor it's kind of weird but I'm
glad some of you guys got it right now
this week's trivia question is who
coined the term pyrokinesis that's a
pretty good one
I know the answer myself and if you do
you can answer it over at hack 5 org
slash trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack 5 swag good luck
yay it's the beach look at this yes
is it
where's the blue buffs when you need I
know we're let's send it to 2600 you're
gonna have to forge the river before we
got dysentery Airy that's a girl's name
it's
hello I'm pointing it the wrong way
that's this way there you go Wow all
right
and now to measure the snubs nope Sam
still you are you're actually just add
about five feet a little bit over anyway
close enough for government work you
don't even live in that direction but
can you see the base of the Golden Gate
yeah there you go and so the old adage
goes that a man standing on a beach can
see three miles and it may in fact be
why there is the the notion of like
territorial waters and three miles out
because that's what you can see when
your average man sitting not familiar
with this friend of yours I don't really
need to know any more than that it is
actually a case that the old sailing
ships they would have the crow's nest it
would be like up really high the idea is
that you know you could see yeah have
you really I forget what it is if you're
like 25 feet you can see 14 miles
there's an equation actually and I have
a stick so let's make some maths alright
let's get a better stick so this is the
earth yes earth round and if you are
standing here you can't really see very
far so what you want to do you want to
get yourself up a little bit right so
get yourself a nice tall ladder yes
boom so get our antenna up a little
higher and this would be H for our
height and then check this out we can
see further D for distance and there is
an equation in fact that allows us to
figure out because the earth is in fact
round it allows us to approximate in
perfect conditions what that may
possibly be and it would look like H
would be it's actually the square root
of H and we multiply that by four point
one two four and that will get us our
distance and this is in the case of our
radio horizon and then we can kind of
figure out how tall we need to make our
antenna and what's beautiful about this
is in this case you're just seeing to
the end of the horizon but you could do
the same thing over here with H right
and now essentially what we have is
across the horizon and we can
essentially multiply whatever this
distance is times two for our total
distance between our two points there we
go yeah let's fly drones No so as you
can see the higher we get the further
our horizon distance is we can see yeah
and it's very similar in terms of radio
waves just like your you know actual
line-of-sight as you as a human with
your eyes and perception of light and
other fun energy is concerned and so
what we're basically going to do is say
well if we can get higher that we can
see further I mean that's pretty much
all we're talking about here so let's
get higher in fact mountain Diablo is
right is it I don't even know so how do
blow is at about three thousand eight
hundred and forty eight feet or so says
Google's so thank you google for doing
the maths for us that comes out to about
eleven hundred and seventy two meters so
it's radio horizon is actually going to
be somewhere around eighty eight miles
right not per hour because that's not
and has nothing to do with this but just
have something to do with speed of light
but that's a different conversation
hundred forty-one kilometers in the
radio horizon if we are standing on the
top of Mount Diablo
here's what's also really cool so here's
us here's Mount Diablo right and we're
standing right here I'm really excited
I'm also much bigger than the radio over
the then the our mountain here is you
can see and there's also an airplane
here's my airplane I'm gonna give it
some wings and its got like a tail a
hotdog we've got we've got some guns and
they're all like right so it's trying to
shoot it but whatever anyway so there's
my there's my ad SBB canoeing airplane
right and it is an altitude of let's
just say 9,000 meters right no none over
sorry
not over 9,000 but 9,000 meters which in
fact is around twenty nine thousand nine
hundred feet or ladies and gentlemen we
are now at a cruising altitude of 30,000
feet but I lied because we're actually
at 9,000 meters because that's just for
our example and it is going to in fact
have a radio horizon of 432 miles that's
pretty freakin cool that's a long way
off this 391 kilometers for for the
metric speaking in the audience and
that's going to mean that between us on
the top of the mountain and that
airplane we're gonna have a total line
of sight distance of 331 miles because
we add those two together and that gives
us 532 kilometers if you're if you're
doing the math at home for the metric
Utley involved and that means we're
going to see airplanes potentially 331
feet away that they're miles right sorry
miles
no we should probably duck or it might
be a little too late yes loud immersing
yes all right here's where it also gets
kind of fun in that the the AMA has
these recommended guidelines for there's
a there's these you know model aircraft
folks and they've come up with these
recommended guidelines for model
aircraft or I've heard of this if it's
like a certain size you can't fly it any
higher than a certain amount or
something actually no until September
30th of 2015 there are no such crazy
regulations for non-commercial
which we are demonstrating today or even
that is subject to some controversy at
the at the moment and essentially going
by the guidelines we are recommended to
stay under a altitude of 400 feet so
again we talked about how our mountain
here is at 3,800 feet so that's 3800
right well the thing beauty about this
this recommended 400 foot altitude is
it's actually not above sea level it is
a GL above ground level
exactly oh really ya know above ground
level so 3,800 feet dot that dot that
dot up here got a little drone okay I
see what you did there there's there's
my real that's my head crab which is
also a drone carrying a pineapple
carrying and a software-defined radio
carrying this awesome antenna that we
made and and took out of its case
because it's gonna have to be super
light I mean I think we have like a
maximum payload capacity of 300 grams
for this experiment um essentially we're
going to be able to take this 3800 and
turn it to 4200 which is kind of
fantastic because it has the numbers 42
in it I can tell yes there's freaking
out so it's going to in fact increase
our radio horizon it is it's just going
to I mean it's math it's gonna do it it
makes sense
yes let's do it in fact hang on real
quick if we could keep going even just a
little bit higher imagine a squiggly
here with like two lines throat 2 to
represent that we're actually going a
little bit higher there is this other
magical line around the earth and it is
called the Karimun line which I'm
pronouncing incorrectly Carbon yes like
Carmen Sandiego come but it's got some
ticks and I'm not really sure how to
pronounce it but this Charon line right
yes it is at 100 kilometers or 62 miles
and it is depending on who you ask
in fact the border between
earth as we know it and space we are not
going to space unfortunately however
some fine folks are already in space and
they hang out in this place called Leo
which has nothing to do with the TWiT
network and it in fact stands for
low-earth orbit and it is these here's
here's my really bad drawing of a
satellite oh wow that's terrible
whatever that's an awesome satellite yes
and so this low-earth orbiting satellite
hangs out at around 160 kilometers so
it's radio horizon is in fact about a
thousand miles how freaking cool is why
is it on fire there's no counter space
Shannon it's not it just has a tail like
a phoenix okay well in that case awesome
others yes there were no lambdas here so
we will come back to this later but that
is the idea the higher you get the
further you can see and that's why we
have satellites which are awesome and
soon to be what is that where they
called atmospheric satellites very very
very thin and light oh those are not
aliens hang out around 60,000 65,000
feet yeah that's what the name of the
company there's a new company that has
these totally freaking sweet drones that
are covered in solar panels right and
then they can hang out at 65,000 feet
right and at that point they can see
like a ton of Earth right below them and
they can see like the person you can see
two other of these autonomous high
flying drones full of solar panels that
can hang out in the sky for like up to
five months straight carrying payloads
of like 50 pounds to 250 pounds imagine
how much Wi-Fi equipment that is this is
these guys are really exciting because
like they can see so much and they're so
high and oh the into your bedroom yes
and the FAA does not regulate airspace
over 60,000 feet yay
so if you learn something new every day
a company that Facebook either just did
or almost did acquire so that that is
that's all 60,000 feet this
sixty-five thousand feet this is the big
fu FA a space where it's like haha I'm
over your country and you can't do
anything about it unless my name is Gary
Powers and you shoot me down that's I'm
divulging into a lot of different stuff
I'm on a tangent
in fact math jokes okay we're done let's
go fly okay let just about reps of this
week's episode of hack five I know we
cut it kind of on the beef here because
next week we're going to pick it up with
some awesome drone action going up to
about 4200 feet above sea level should
be really fun and we've got a whole
bunch of awesome drone stuff coming in
the future so without further ado I'd
like to thank you guys for watching and
of course comment below or send feedback
at hak5 or we do in fact read all of
those and we've been guaranteeing some
amazing stuff thank you for all the hams
that have pointed out some really nifty
stuff I can't wait to kind of do a quick
follow up with a lot of the stuff that
we've been learning and anyway otherwise
shop hack five org is not a place you
can go to hack shop comic JK shop.com is
one where you can support it directly if
you so desire as well as hack five dot
org slash followed to find out the
places to find us in social media and
then you'll be able to find out cool
stuff about like for example the Bay
Area hacker brunch that we had on Sunday
the sixth which was amazing and I hope
to see you all out at the next so stay
tuned for details on that and until next
week i'm darren kitchen trust your
Technol us
that's what we're going to do on the
beach okay so let's go do that if we
haven't already
