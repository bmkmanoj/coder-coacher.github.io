dirty open VPN server build all that and
more this time on hack 5 this episode of
hack 5 is brought to you by domain.com
hello welcome to hack 5 i'm darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
that's Kirby that is Kirby is this gonna
get you a baby Oh Kirby odd setting so
long so we wanted to to say hello to
everybody hey we're gonna be talking
about protecting our packets we are but
first I wanted to thank everybody for
coming out to our hack 5 open warehouse
thing that we held over the weekend it
was a lot of fun so thank you everybody
who showed up for that it was pretty
epic I can't begin to describe how much
fun it was and we will for sure be doing
this again in fact we're kind of
developing something really exciting
because so many people were just really
enthusiastic about some of the
interesting things that we were doing
with with micros and nano quadcopters so
that's for tuned for that and I also
want to mention of course thank you to
everybody who has been supporting us on
threat wire which is our show about
security privacy and everything that's
happening with Internet freedom this
week we already found out that there's
another yet another flash of ulnar
ability there's a zero day exploit that
was found in Java and 90% of the patent
lawsuits that have come out so far I
think it was in the last year where from
patent trolls of tech losses yes crazy
yeah patent trolls you can check out
threat wire on the hak5 youtube channel
as your source for security privacy
Internet freedom and thank you so much
for helping us reach our latest
milestone goal very epic is brought to
you guys by you guys and it's completely
independent ad free I love that thank
you so I'm just excited to be doing this
because we haven't gotten into a VPN
server building quite a while so we're a
little overdue for this one so this one
is like really quick and dirty because
you know VPNs are really great for
protecting all of your internet usage
your Internet traffic whenever you're on
untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi or
maybe the Wi-Fi that you find over at
your favorite coffee shop for example so
many times it's really thrown around as
advice to just get a VPN as people say I
mean even we have said it too but where
should you get an actual VPN I mean when
you're signing up for one
that's like 10 bucks a month from some
random VPN service in the cloud from
some internet service
you're basically handing over money and
the very same information that you want
to protect which are your packets or how
do you know that they're actually going
to be securing that stuff I know they
could probably see everything that
you're doing not that we know any VPN
services run by your friends with the
shiny shoes but today we will be showing
you how to protect your packets with a
quick and dirty VPN server build that
you can run on a virtual machine at home
so so theoretically if you trust your
internet connection at home then you
could trust your internet connection
when you're out and about using the VPN
yeah so let's go ahead and get started
with this we are going to be using all
open source for this build so for the
operating system we're using Ubuntu
14.04
because it's the current one that's LTS
long term support and then the install
is really similar if you're using like
CentOS or Debian open SUSE or Fedora to
yes and for the VPN server we're
actually going to be using a version of
Open VPN called access server basically
access servers essentially it's a pretty
front-end for Open VPN it simplifies the
setup it's got a nice little web GUI
just to get everything going and it has
a ridiculously easy set up for the
clients so be it Windows Mac even
Android and iOS
and of course Linux yay ok so first
we're gonna start off with installing
the ubuntu server should I do that on -
yes you go ahead and if you've been
following along with our Citrix builds
here we've been playing with Citrix the
Zen Center which is another piece of
Awesome open-source software it's a
virtual machine hypervisor that allows
us to run multiple machines we have a
couple of these running a Kali box a
Windows box a couple others and so in
fact we just used Zen orchestra to go
ahead and use a nice little open-source
front-end so that we can manage it all
over the web which is super nice so
let's create a machine ow
so which machine should we put this on
actually let's go ahead and create a new
virtual machine so from the drop down
from our Zen server test guy let's hit
that drop down and say new virtual
machine did you do creepy em alright and
are we gonna use a template for this yes
we are well to 1404 14.4
thar name of our new VM what do you want
yeah OpenVPN is fine okay no description
CPUs ram all that looks go that looks
good yeah okay any changes that you want
to make nope no just need to use that I
so um doesn't let me click on ISO so oh
there we go and we are are we using a
AMD 64 and 1404 we use dot 2 server yeah
so we want to use the server 1 yep okay
all set all right great Veeam item list
oh yeah and this would be pool eth
series vm creation started okay great
now that we can bolt the console
and I'll hit play on that it's an Ubuntu
server install ok I chose my language
location keyboard what do you want to
call it I don't know VPN is good ok use
your account
I'm gonna call it's nerves Shh your home
call act I've yeah alright fine we're
creative snubs account later when we do
a VPN user name for the account yep ak5
ok password um that one star but cut JK
law and then yes timezone correct yes
let's do guided yep virtual disk 18.3
gigs so we're gonna keep it at 8.3 gigs
right changes to disk yes you will need
a proxy oh we don't we don't need a
proxy ok and we do want to update
automatically install security updates
automatically and we're going to check
mark OpenSSH server none of the other
ones do we want to install grub yes
installation is complete so we can
continue from here ok my job is done so
now once it reboots I'm going to log in
as hack 5 and run the ifconfig command
so this is hack 5 and my starbuck
password JK law ok yay we have a server
we want to run ifconfig ok so now we
have our oh good IP addresses 1070 331
what does that say two four zero two
four zero okay I'm going to SSH in as
hak5
at ten seventy three thirty one to four
zero shins wonderful password and there
we go
I am on now on our server so I'm going
to go ahead and set up the access server
so you name tak a and I can see here we
have a 64 bit version and that's
important because if I go over to the
downloads you'll see that there are both
32-bit which are shown as I 386 as well
as 64-bit which are amd64 s and so like
I said so this is SW update Open VPN
calm okay /a s and that's where you can
download the latest version and we're
going to gain just that onto our server
using W get because why not and as you
can see here actually there's you know
Debian and fedora new boon to and open
SUSE and CentOS so you know there's a
lot of support here so let's just go
ahead and grab the latest version
and once that's downloaded I can go
ahead and LS tech LA and whoops LS tak
la and I can see there's my file yeah
and I'm going to go ahead and install
that Deb by using dpkg tak I for install
and then the Open VPN ah I have to sudo
that cool now at this point we are
instructed that we need to run past WD
Open VPN because we need to create a
password for this new user that is
created so cleared screen sudo pass WD
Open VPN and give it a password and so
if I scroll up here we'll actually see
that it tells me that here's my admin
interface and here is the client
interface so I'm going to go ahead and
select aim for zero yes so I'm going to
copy this and head over to my browser
and of course I will get an error saying
oh no scary it's using you know its own
certificate I haven't bought a
certificate yet so okay to proceed and
login is Open VPN that user that we had
just created and I'm going to accept the
EULA and there we go we've got an open
VPN access server running it's really
pretty simple to setup from here I'll
want to go to general under
authentication and for simplicity sake
and we'll touch back on this later I'm
going to choose local it saves settings
update the running server and now I need
to create a user so user permissions I'm
going to go ahead and create a user
called snobs herbs and I'm going to
check allow auto log-in we'll get to
more that later save those settings so
if I go back to user permissions now and
click show next to snobs I can go ahead
and give her a password which is her
cat's name yay that's so hard right save
settings and then update that running
server and that that was it as far as
the setup is concerned which is kind of
ridiculous crazy now we're you know
really just going with a lot of defaults
here and we're going to lose
back around and do a lot more kung-fu
with this later but go ahead and get on
this beep okay now Shannon so so HTTP
colon slash slash it's ten dot 70 3.31
dot two four zero four zero four one
nine four three and then this time don't
do the slash admin right because and you
have to do HTTP Dom two three four two
and four zero
dang it lines four three nine four
thirty there it is
I understand good yeah I know now login
it's nerves all lowercase all lowercase
so now I want to click here to continue
and you get a fancy executable openvpn
mm-hmm so in this case Open VPN access
server has actually already just
detected that you're running Windows and
offer you the most appropriate if
download if I do the same thing here and
go to ten 73 31 to four Oh was at 9:43
as a user oops on HTTP and proceed and
logins snubs it can't detect
automatically what OS I'm running so
it'll actually offer me to download Open
VPN Kinect for Windows for OS 10 for
Android for iOS and of course even doing
the set up for Linux you know follow the
instructions here to install it for
fedora boon to or whatever have you okay
so once I have it downloaded the little
icon appears in my little Windows bar at
the bottom I can click on connect and
yes is unverified yes and then I'll
connect me to the VPN there I am okay
you're connected has been established
very cool isn't that rad so that's great
now you have an IP address on that
OpenVPN a s server that we set up on top
of blue to 1404 and of course we should
probably mention like obviously
what I'm on the same network not much
right now but we did get it installed
quick and dirty and really the next step
is to do a little bit of port forwarding
and get it so that you can access this
from outside it's really just a matter
of 443 TCP I believe and then there're
no 4 for 3 TCP and then there's also
another UDP in lates
we're going to get more into awesome fun
gymnastics that you can do with Open VPN
and you know I should also mention that
Open VPN access server kind of cheating
because it's not quite open sources I
it's free as in beer but not freezing
speech but you can test it out for free
for up to two concurrent users you can
take a look here basically these are the
difference between Community Edition and
access server and so you know if you're
looking for something with full LDAP
support and stuff like that it's got a
lot of really nice features I really
like the GUI the web interface as we
showed you makes it stupid simple but we
can of course do the same exact thing
with the open-source community edition
later and we're going to be of course
getting into more fun things that you
can do with this but I wanted to show
you guys like hey it was that easy yeah
that's awesome
so you've got no excuse now let us know
what you guys think what kind of fun
things are you doing with Open VPN
what's your favorite VPN maybe you're
all like no I'm Adam Sully's and PPTP at
rocks with mschap v1 don't do that we're
gonna take a quick break
