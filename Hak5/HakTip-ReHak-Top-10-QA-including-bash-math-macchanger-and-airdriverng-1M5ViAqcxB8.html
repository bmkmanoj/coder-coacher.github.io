midphase hello and welcome to hack tip
the show where we break down the
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Aaron kitchen and today I mourn the
loss of the active partition of my
solid-state drive and also I have a
hangover from e3 but I figured this is a
great time for us to go over a whole
bunch of the comments that we've gotten
so far because there's a lot of good
nuggets in there some QA a little bit of
tips and then we'll continue on with our
series of the fundamentals of well we're
using WPA encryption braking as our
example here but basically we're doing a
whole lot of fun fundamentals so let's
just go ahead and kick it off with PC
warrior 55 who writes this is great for
short passwords or Dictionary passwords
of course he's talking about when we
were speaking about John the Ripper but
what about randomly generated passwords
longer than say 8 characters and numbers
it would take you years potentially even
centuries to crack any suggestions for
more efficient methods to break this
kind of password
love hack 5 by the way and this new and
this new thing that you guys are doing
is great wish you guys wish there was
you know a new one more often though and
I understand you guys have tons of other
things behind
besides this well yeah we do but you
know thank you so much for that feedback
you're right
it would take forever to do with say
John the Ripper brute force is not the
most elegant approach to it and here
soon we will be talking about tools to
do things with well not just your
general purpose CPU but say your GPU if
you've got one of those awesome graphics
cards for gaming you can put it to use
cracking WPA we'll be talking about this
a little bit later here but it's pulled
up pirate here and that's a wonderful
tool we'll get into a lot more about GPU
cracking but first I figured why don't
we go ahead and and practice the skills
that we learn in the first hack tip
about piping stuff and actually do a
little bit of math as far as how long it
would take to crack a WPA key if we were
only trying say 400 keys a second so
what I'm gonna do is echo quote 26 so
we're just gonna pretend 26 characters
just the lowercase alpha alpha
that you know not even numeric right so
26 alpha lowercase ^ 7 just a 7 chairmat
a character max password and this is
what you should be using long passwords
still that divided by 400 tribes per
second so divided by 60 seconds in an
hour 24 hours in a day and if we pipe
this to BC which is short for bash
calculator we can actually see that it's
going to take thirteen thousand nine
hundred and forty four days yeah that
might be a while so anyway I thought
that was a little fun one and you can
use that all the time when you're in
bash and you're like wow I really need
to do echo quote 2+2 quote and then pipe
that over to be seeing early that's four
how great is that okay well anyway next
comment up here is from h je r PE 88
beauty I'm gonna butcher all your guys
names to be honest I love the long
episodes it gives so much more relaxed
feeling than the short ones just because
it doesn't feel like just another
tutorial when it's more like a show it
feels much more of you know put together
much better to put it on the TV sit back
on the couch have your favorite drink
but that's just me that's not just you
and from the get-go hack 5 proper has
always been a long-form show and I feel
very greatly towards the whole variety
thing because there's a little bit of
something for everything hack tip we're
trying something new and of course I
knew that we were going to get some
mixed feedback here so thanks for
sending that along you are in the camp
of long-form and that's fine that's
totally cool got another one here
opposing that 770 had it right I like it
for far more than the long shows just
because it is concise and straight I can
watch the long form shows hack 5 just
because it contains so much more junk or
you're saying you can't watch act 5
because it's got a lot of junk justice
opinion which you're all entitled to I
don't think it's junk
anyway so there's both sides of the camp
I just figured those are two good ones
to kind of throw out there as people you
know
again but hey thank you because we're
figuring out what we're doing alright
next one here is spike Segal who writes
in to say Darren what's the model the
Wi-Fi adapter used the the Encore one
that's the model number hope that helps
anyways there are a few raah link
chipsets that don't completely suck and
that's one of them that's good
so anyway Cori writes in and he says
about the show on let's see oh he says a
lot of tutorials on YouTube prompt him
to use the command Mac changer and then
tak tak Mac and whatever MAC address you
want and then the interface but it seems
a lot easier at least he says it seems a
lot easier to do if config like I showed
w land 0 HW ether and then the MAC
address well like I said that's another
way to do it do they do the same thing
absolutely they do the same thing I
personally like using the ifconfig
method but Mac changer will work just as
well in fact if you man
Mac changer whoops not Mac changer F Mac
changer you see there's a whole bunch of
different options tak are right there
for random will just give you a random
MAC address so if I do Mac changer tak
RW land 0 I don't think I have I don't
think it's anyway it would give you a
random MAC address another comment here
by Hydrox 24 does your MAC address reset
on reboot absolutely it sure does
is there a way to change your IP address
from grunt laces well yeah sure the if
config command can also be used to
change your IP address if you're saying
on a you know a a land that has a DHCP
server that's doling out IP addresses
you can release you can renew you can
try to get it a new IP address you could
just set yourself a static address if
your say typically at home like with a
cable or DSL modem those residential
services usually have dynamic IP
addresses and that is to say that it's
not the same one every time it's not a
static and usually and this is just in
my experience just unplugging the cable
modem for an hour plugging it back in
will get
new IP address so I hope that helps you
out there one more ace are at Asus point
a set point goes ahead and writes I
thought Paul had fixed figured out a way
for you not to have to wear a hat hat
anyway another one here from Bryant
mm-hm yes massacre I should have read
these ahead of time anyway he writes who
plays the music in the back those would
be our friends Pro no bozo Dale chase
and dual-core supply great music for the
show you should check out their awesome
a nerd foreign electronica albums okay

finally our last tip comes from our dear
friend move it's who writes in about
finding out the chip setup say your USB
based wireless radio here I like to do
LS USB or D message but he points out
that if you actually do air driver tak
ng space loaded you can actually find
out what driver you have loaded if it's
the Mac 802 11 like I have right now or
if you're gonna switch to you know mad
Wi-Fi the

techno so you have good stuff go ahead
and send it by tips at hack 5 org also I
want to go ahead and give you guys
homework for this week as we continue
the series of the fundamentals of wealth
in this case WPA cracking which is just
you know kind of an adventure of like
lots of fun technologies along the way
if there's a technology that save and
you use all the time and you'd like to
know more about hit us up in the
comments let me know what it is that you
