several online retailers are hit with
malware and Zuckerberg will testify in
Congress about user data and privacy all
that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I am Shannon Morris and this
is threat wire for April 10th 2018 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom our patreon
is over at patreon.com slash threat wire
and that is always the best way to
support the show and will help us reach
our next goal so if you want access to
exclusives check out the patreon link in
the show notes below and now onto the
news so first off we have some stingrays
we first heard about stingray devices or
IMSI catchers many many years ago around
the time of Snowden's leaks back in 2017
the Department of Homeland Security
wrote a detailed overview answering
questions that Oregon Senator Ron Wyden
brought up in a letter they stated that
quote the DHS and the national
protection and programs Directorate
has observed anomalous activity in the
National Capital Region that appears to
be consistent with the international
mobile subscriber identity catchers NPPD
has not validated or attributed such
activity to specific entities or devices
now on March 26 2018 the Department of
Homeland Security penned another letter
to standard or Wyden in which they
explained that IMSI catchers are a real
and growing risk so to reiterate this
quote the DHS has explained that while
they have reported odd activity that
usually is along the lines of a stingray
device they have not determined who is
using them or what the exact devices are
with that said though according to
widens letter to the DHS back in
November of 2017 several years ago the
FCC created a task force that does not
seem to be committing to any actions as
they have not posted any reports about
the topic of IMSI catchers the FCC
originally created this task force
because IMSI catchers were failed in the
DC area in 2014 near many government
buildings now Wyden was concerned about
the threat of foreign adversary
using stingray devices especially in the
DC NCR area since many political leaders
in America commonly do business in the
nation's capital
obviously the answers that he received
from the DHS and the NPPD
were not exactly clear but they did
indicate activity usually attributed to
IMSI catchers in that region of the u.s.
now this does matter even if you aren't
a political figure because IMSI catchers
could intercept your data as well if you
are in the vicinity of one of them
according to the ACLU law enforcement
and federal agencies in the u.s.
currently use these devices in at least
25 states and trying to catch foreign
stingrays in use around the country
would require additional funding and
lots and lots of hardware upgrades which
is probably why we haven't seen that
happening so will we see less of these
devices being used in the future
probably not since they are sold
legitimately on US soil to authorities
for surveillance and even foreign
governments have IMSI catchers set up in
embassies chances are slim that the DHS
would receive funding to find and
capture let alone publicly disclose any
unauthorized foreign use Oh from
September 26 all the way to October 12
of 2017 Delta Sears Kmart and Best Buy
customers were susceptible to having
their name address and credit card
number exposed in a breach of the chat
service that each of these companies
uses for online customer service and
support the chat service is run and
provided by a third party called 24/7 AI
and some malware was tucked away in
those services during those dates no
databases were breached just the chat
service but even if you never use the
online chat functionality to talk to
some representative if you completed a
transaction on any of those sites during
those dates chances are that you are
affected there is no indication that any
customer data was stolen by a third
party only that it was exposed now
according to Delta hundreds of thousands
of customers may have been affected
Sears and Kmart estimated less than 100
thousand themselves and Best Buy has not
stated how many were affected total
other
companies that use 24/7 AI have not
reported if they were affected by the
malware or not but 24/7 AI states that
only a small number of client companies
were American Express and farmers
insurance both of used 24/7 AI both
state that they were not affected the
companies are offering free credit
monitoring and 24/7 AI has notified and
is working with authorities on this
breach Facebook our best friend in the
world just kidding they continue to face
a ton of heat about privacy of its users
last week news broke that Mark
Zuckerberg is allowed very different
security and privacy than other users on
the platform when looking at Facebook
messages to and from Zuckerberg three
different sources found that his
messages were completely deleted from
their conversations and inbox while
their side of the conversation still
existed basically making it look like
they were just talking to themselves for
months and months according to Facebook
this was done after the Sony 2014 hack
to protect executive communications by
limiting retention of messages the
problem is they never disclosed this was
happening to the recipients of
Zuckerberg messages or publicly T users
know if a user chooses to delete their
messages those only disappear from their
own inbox not other parties so
Zuckerberg of course is receiving
special treatment for privacy on the
same platform since messenger has 1.3
billion users that's B billion it's
alarming that they were able to tamper
so much with a user's own inbox on both
sides of conversation not just on one
side of that convo now due to Facebook
being caught red-handed abusing this
power they then explained that they are
planning a new feature for all users
that allows them to unsend messages and
they won't allow Zuckerberg to retract
messages for the time being I guess he's
in timeout and auto delete feature is
already available for encrypted chats
over messengers but that is completely
opt-in not turned on for users from the
get-go now Facebook is also under fire
for their search function which allows
anyone to search for a user by typing
their mobile number or email address
into the search bar to find their public
profile data this is now disabled since
Zuckerberg said
malicious actors took advantage of the
search functionality to scrape public
profile data from all of its 2.2 billion
users all of them
now last week Facebook also started
rolling out a new feature should we call
it a feature to some users to show
whether or not you have been affected by
the Cambridge analytical accessing your
Facebook data the information is not
alive for all of the users just yet but
Facebook did start implementing it on
Monday of last week you will receive one
of two different notices either one
saying that the quiz was banned and your
information may have been misused with a
link or you will see a much shorter
announcement that just says how to
protect your information with a link but
it does not mention the ban at all
now Facebook also announced via their
website that they will be giving
academic researchers access to
anonymized user data to study the role
social media takes in elections the
initiative which will be funded by
several different foundations aims to
provide credible research about social
media in elections as well as democracy
as a whole now while the research will
be conducted by independent parties and
peer-reviewed Facebook will have no say
whatsoever over the data before anything
is published according to the post any
data requested from Facebook will face
some scrutiny from the privacy and
research review teams as well as the
institutional review board and all data
will be anonymized and aggregated at
least that's what they say the company
continued to try getting back in the
good graces of its users by releasing a
blog post about pages in ads they posted
about the previously teased information
on introducing add transparency pages by
clearly labeling them as political ad
and paid for by and the name of whoever
paid for it pages with large numbers of
followers will need to be verified as
well lastly Martin Zuckerberg will be
attending Congress hearings on the
privacy of user data today day of this
posting and tomorrow April 10th and 11th
in the afternoon on both days at the
hearings echo berg will be answering
questions about data privacy issues that
americans face now since this video is
posting before the congressional
hearings start this afternoon tune into
