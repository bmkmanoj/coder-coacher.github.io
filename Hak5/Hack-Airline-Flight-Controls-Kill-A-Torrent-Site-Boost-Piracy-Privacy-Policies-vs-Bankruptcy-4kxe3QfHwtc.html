piracy be careful about how you disclose
security vulnerabilities aka the first
rule about hacking planes in flight
don't tweet about hacking planes in
flight and what happens to your personal
data when a retailer goes out of
business all that coming up now on
threat wire
happy Monday people I'm Patrick Norton
and this is threat wire for May 18th
2015 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom if
you're new to threat wire on the hack 5
channel this is the show we did for a
year on tech feed and now we've brought
it back and we are so stoked that you
are out there and watching now in news
that won't shock anybody that's been
following the war against drugs for the
last four or five decades yeah guess
what people shutting down pirate sites
doesn't actually stop piracy no really
the European Commission joint research
center did a study I'm gonna quote this
online copyright enforcement consumer
behavior and market structure basically
they look at what happened after in law
enforcement in Germany Spain France and
the Netherlands worked together to shut
down key no tio they arrested more than
a dozen people they raided homes and
data centers and to sum it up they wiped
key no tio off the map and what happened
while Kino users privacy they tracked it
dropped around 30 percent after Tina was
shut down for about two months while the
use of licensed movie platforms quote
increased by only 2.5 percent and by the
way after that two months drop the
piracy went back up again
basically the ideas of this
investigation and the cost of the trials
might have actually cost a lot more than
movie producers recovered from the
shutdown of the site and predictably
several news sites popped up to replace
Kino tio apparently if you're into
whack-a-mole something like 22 or as the
report dryly notes the streaming piracy
market was able to quickly recover from
the intervention it was a really great
article on this also that was torn freak
I figured a wire coat at UK they
fundamentally asked did the raid do any
good the report falls short of saying
not at all the Kino tio site was shut
down way back in 2011 before wired at UK
notes there were many quote legal
streaming alternatives in Germany
frankly
let's face it watching video on the
Internet's has changed a lot in the last
five years or as the report puts it okay
four years or as the report puts it
quote the results of these anti-piracy
interventions may be very well different
in an environment with more and better
licenced offers available to consumers
it's an interesting conversation because
the reality is is now they have 22 sites
to try to shut down instead of one or
alternatively one place to market to is
turned into 22 in any case lots more of
info up on TorrentFreak and wired UK
props to Wired for going in deep on how
the data for the report was generated
it's kind of interesting hacker hijacks
playing with nothing but laptop is an
awesome title especially if you've got
those really cool fear generating
graphics that Fox is so good at but the
story of Chris Roberts who yes has used
a modified Ethernet cable to tap through
the in-flight entertainment system of a
commercial airliner to freaking access
the flight control system is a little
messier than that first up he tweeted
about it which led to him spending some
quality time with the FBI not arrested
not charged just talking about you know
how he quotes and I'm quoting the FBI
here he had exploited flaws with the IFE
systems on aircraft while in flight he
compromised the IFE systems
approximately 15 to 20 times during the
period 2011 through 2014 IFA being in
flight entertainment which oddly enough
in this particular airline in this
particular airliner led to being able to
control the flight systems no really at
one point according to the FBI getting
into the thrust management computer on
the airplane he was flying inside of
with other people issuing a C lb or
climb command which quote caused one of
the airplanes engines to climb resulting
in a lateral or sideways movement of the
plane I'm really torn between the fact
that Roberts has been telling the
airlines about this for a long time
ie if someone plugs into an open
Ethernet jack on your plane they can get
access to the things that make the plane
move or fall out of the sky and being
really horrified that mr. Roberts did
his pen testing on a plane that was you
know full of passengers and in the sky
so maybe the tweet will get the security
hole fixed though so far Roberts has
found the FAA and air
less than interested in closing it as a
longtime RadioShack customer I gotta say
I'm kind of thrilled the state of Texas
is leading the charge by several states
to quote oppose the sale of personally
identifiable information by RadioShack
and that the FTC and hey even wireless
carriers and Apple are concerned about
privacy policies that you agreed to that
they're actually upheld when a company
goes bankrupt and starts selling or
auctioning off its assets
PCWorld is a really good write-up FTC
recommends conditions for sale of
RadioShack customer data and it's kind
of interesting because you may have I'm
sure most of you have given up data in
exchange for discounts or to get oh I
don't know
registration warranty whatever it is but
essentially the director of the FTC's
bureau of consumer protection Jessica
eldritch says the FTC's concerns about
the Dana sale not being in line with
Radio Shack's privacy policy would quote
be greatly diminished quinn quote if say
the data was sold to a similar type of
business that would and I quote again
adhere to the privacy policies that
customers like me agreed to when they
gave the information to RadioShack
so PC world notes that quote
alternatively RadioShack would have to
take permission from customers to
transfer their data information of
customers who do not agree would have to
be purged this is a big deal Radio check
it's in bankruptcy and selling off
whatever it can to pay creditors which
of course includes all of the consumer
data they've collected over the years
not credit card type info but over eight
million email addresses PCWorld notes
and a customer database of names and
addresses sixty-seven million strong
quote of which approximately eleven
point nine million made a purchase in
the last twelve months and is a lots of
potential junk mail people we'll see
what happens
before I go want to give a huge thanks
