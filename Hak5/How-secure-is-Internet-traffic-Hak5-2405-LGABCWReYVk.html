but we're getting there for the sake of
simplicity let's say there's two kinds
of traffic on the internet encrypted and
unencrypted or what we like to call
plain text since it's just plain as day
going across the wire similarly there's
all sorts of things that you can do
wanting Internet and they fall into a
spectrum of like really easy to do and
quite difficult so here's some examples
let's say you want to go to a website
that begins with HTTP well that's stupid
simple you just type the address into
the browser it's also plain text so it's
far from secure how about sending an
email again really easy open your mail
client type in the address and off it
goes just as before it's plain text
how about chatting with your mates on
dust2 and saying hey let's rush bomb
site B again easy but plain text I also
take the toner route because as he T's
camp the double doors now when the
internet started back in the 60s almost
everything was plain text back then the
Internet was a government research
project and it was difficult enough just
getting the whole thing to work let
alone secure it I mean the first message
sent across the internet was supposed to
be login but the system crashed up to
the second letter so I guess you could
say the first message online was low
anyway messages on the Internet have to
get forwarded from node to node to node
until finally meeting their destination
and a lot of the early work was just
focused on making the whole thing not
fall over
it was a much simpler time sis admin's
were sis ops servers were mainframes and
plaintext telnet was used because SSH
hadn't been invented yet by the very
early 90s less than 1% of the planet had
internet access unlike today we're about
half the populations online then in 1991
people figured hey maybe plaintext isn't
the best way to send email since every
node in between me and you can read the
message kind of like a postcard and a
wizard by the name of Phil Zimmermann
came around and invented encrypted email
and called it PGP for pretty good
privacy and it was pretty good but it
was hard to use and in the nearly three
decades since it hasn't really gone
mainstream
in 1993 Al Gore helped her in that
internet that was government controlled
into the privatized internet that we
know and love today
Amazon AOL zombocom and every dot-com
inbetween popped up there was a
September that never ended and suddenly
there was a need for encryption because
shopping
come 1994 the dominant web browser of
the time Netscape adopted SSL and
encrypted web pages were born with the
now-familiar HTTP as a technology HTTP
was both secure and easy you just had to
type in the address in the browser over
time the lock icon and the technology
behind it would evolve and get more
secure by the mid-2000s HTTPS had made
online banking an online shopping so
commonplace that we now have a term for
getting an Amazon box and not
remembering what's in it by 2010 social
media had gone mainstream
but HTTP adoption hadn't that would all
change with a browser plug-in called
Firesheep that showed the masses how
easy it was to eavesdrop on and mess
with plain text HTTP traffic between all
the news about HTTP not being secure and
the privacy concerns over all the stuff
were sharing on social media major sites
like Facebook and Twitter made HTTPS the
default in 2013 a little fuel is added
to the fire when NSA whistleblower
Edward Snowden caused a media frenzy
over the large-scale internet
eavesdropping operations being conducted
by governments around the world by now
with a little help from cool
technologies like let's encrypt we have
an internet that has more secure HTTPS
sites than plaintext HTTP sites the
modern era has led to some good news and
bad news on the one hand there's
constant revelations about misuse of
private data and major site breaches and
on the other as a society that values
privacy and security
we've been keen to adopt new security
technologies just as long as they're
easy so while a previous generation of
secure technologies like PGP and
proprietary VPNs have only found niche
uses a new generation of easy to use
security technologies have emerged and
gained mainstream adoption and while
there's still a ton of plain text and
easily exploited systems out there today
the landscape has changed dramatically
perhaps it's wishful thinking but we may
be headed towards a world where secure
is the new default secure is easy and
you don't need a tinfoil hat to care
about privacy in the next part we're
going to look at how a new security
technology is being introduced that may
reshape the inner workings of the
Internet but what do you think do you do
