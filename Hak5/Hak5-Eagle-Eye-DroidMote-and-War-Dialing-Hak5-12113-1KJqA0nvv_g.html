by teen anyway hope you don't get cut
off the internet what would your last
communication on the internet be if I
was before I was cut off or just in
general yeah like well obviously before
your last dying words on the internet
your tweet hundred and forty characters
before plus plus plus no carrier that's
a good question um would probably have
to be try the soup Travis soup okay not
like a plan it try the soup yeah the
trashing our rights nah I'm over that
nice uh so um so tell me you are not war
driving because that was ten years ago
your war dialing like it's 1985 yeah
sounds about right yep early eighties
and well actually before we get into
that when did you first start we're
dialing about that time it would have
been a 1200 baud modem and well we had
we had some trash 80s and we had my dad
even had an altar at the house for a
while but that was you know obviously
predating modems yeah would have been
awfully been the BPS days and and what
for those that aren't familiar for the
like you know the youngins in the crowd
that may not remember war dialing what
is that in a nutshell so in a nutshell
you're using a computer to
programmatically dial numbers string of
numbers sometimes in sequence or out
looking for other systems carriers could
be something like another computer a
remote access terminal could be an HVAC
system some heating or some SCADA I
guess is the new buzzword but basically
you're just trying to reach out and
touch something you're fumbling around
in the dark until you find something
interesting to mess with maybe it's even
uh that that cool BBS that's got all the
wares exactly that's usually what it was
about was trying to find the wares or
try to find ways to de loop in other
systems like the next 25 violin that
might get you into a different network
that you would not normally be able to
access because it's not over IP now
but the internet killed the BBS so what
computers are still connected to dial up
other than your grandmother who's still
using AOL question so there's actually
uh there's a lot of systems still on
there most of them aren't internet
access tend to be like you know high
availability or redundant systems like
you have a cisco edge router something
that you need to be able to get into it
that never goes down when you dial up a
modem and have another means because in
that case it's out of band it's not
connecting it to it through the internet
you go through the pain plain old
telephone system correct so yeah
essentially you'd be able to still get
in without having to rely on IQ and so
basically what you're saying is that now
that all of the bulletin board systems
are not using telephone lines anymore
all that's left on the phone network for
modems to be connected to our
interesting things generally speaking
yeah so they're actually still about 50
or so dial-up PBS's that are still
around in the US and Canada and there's
a lot of stuff overseas but for the most
part you're looking at a lot of
interesting things like Cisco switches
that we talked about or telephone
company switches not networking switches
but that actually handle call and route
management there's a lot of payphones a
lot of the cocotte customer-owned pay
phones have modems that you can use to
service from the field what else is
there various electronic monitoring
stations that type of thing I've had a
radio station empower power management I
know for sure that when i was looking at
this kind of solution like oh the server
goes down how do you reboot it well you
can't ssh in because it's down obviously
so that they have these little boxes
that are totally cheap to you just plug
them into a analog line and then you
just dial that number boo Boop reboot
the modem or reboot the computer right
exactly and so and another interesting
thing about dial-up is that it's kind of
fallen out of favor for data
exfiltration so if you're on a
penetration test or if you're a bad guy
and you you want a way to exfiltrate
data that maybe goes around their their
digital loss system then you just go
over the phone lines and it's likely to
not be noticed you know there's there's
no intrusion detection system anymore
that's going to detect expel over bot
analog there's no firewall or IDs it's
like checking the packets that are going
through because they're like it's a
modem connection whatever right exactly
it's
it's not that's not possible it's just
that nobody thinks that it's still being
done so they don't they don't tend to
look for it anymore so the stuff that
you find is it really like legacy gear
in large corporations where they forgot
they even have it or what a lot of cases
you see a lot of mainframes as4 hundreds
that type of thing and you'll see a lot
of just random systems that you know the
person who installed it is either dead
or lungs inspired or retired living fat
happy at the beach so what are you war
dialing now what systems my word on link
so right now like this week I'm looking
around suburbia because there's a lot of
interesting stuff that's in corporate
America but I'm kind of interested to
see what are people that are still doing
this still using modems doing in
residential ranges and so this week I've
dialed about 5,000 numbers and of the
5,000 I found about 20 carriers most of
them tend to be like pcanywhere type
systems so you actually can do a dial-up
connection to an rdp session remote
desktop and control your computer that
way I mean it's it's super slow it's
crazy slow but you know if you need to
get in you need to get in I mean that
sounds reliable and again like we're
saying like you fall back out a band use
the phone network that's fantastic I
didn't even know that pcanywhere ran
over modems so what why did you choose
to do residential rather than corporate
where you would find the mainframes and
whatnot um probably because when i was a
kid i was really interested in looking
at telephone company switches and i was
very interested in our local central
office in town and so that was something
that I was meant to get around to and
never actually did not to say that I
won't be looking at corporate I just you
see a lot of Cisco switches and a lot of
boring stuff in in corporate America so
I'm really interested in finding like
the gems the legacy stuff you want to
find that ESS 5 or that dms 100 exactly
and yes and I've been we'll look the the
exchange that I'm working on right now
is a TMS 100 yeah and what's going to
say it'll come back how are you dialing
into any of these anyway so right now
I'm using a cable provider that has a
unit that is essentially voice over IP
but it's got low enough latency and it's
a good enough signal that allows me to
dial over the cable over coaxial and
right now i'm using a combination of
windows
tell sweep and i'm using i wore for
linux written by two beef from tell
freak that is so crazy to think that
there are still wardriving applications
out there yeah there's a few i think
that THC scam is still being actively
developed by the hackers choice out and
I think leave Germany and then I war
hasn't been touched since 2007 but it
still works really well and it's got
support for iax voice over IP modems so
you can do some other cool things so so
when you do them and I mean dialing not
driving but when you do war dialing / /
a VoIP line and then you do now going
analogue though and then that analog is
going back to digital it's it's digital
to analog to digital it sounds horrible
what kind of BPS are you getting so a
good question on we using standard like
sip or IX at home home grown I'm getting
lousy speeds it like 9600 but using my
local cable provider I'm actually able
to get full 56k connections nice and so
the obvious question is if you've dialed
5,000 phone numbers and there's only
maybe 50 modems out there what were the
other 4900 calls like as soon as a lot
of grumpy people answering the phone and
having a mode and screaming in their ear
but so what I tried to do is be a
gentleman about it and I would only dial
between the hours of 8am and 6pm so that
way i figured that most people would be
at work or one quick calls not going to
be a big deal as opposed to in the
middle of the night where we used to do
it because because because our parents
would bust us to know exactly and so
then you're dialing 5000 numbers in the
middle of the night you're waking up an
entire city so it just seemed like a
gentlemanly thing to do and then you're
dialing I'm them sequentially and then
the phone company finds out and then you
get in trouble with your parents and
don't do that definitely try to
randomize it so are you randomizing I am
yeah so what I'll do is I'll typically
scan and blocks of 99 not quite a
hundred because i'm still trying to stay
under that threshold and also i'll scan
99 in a range and it'll bounce around
within that range and then after that
spans completed them the next 100 within
that range so it's still somewhat
predictable there's relatively low
entropy and the numbers that I'm dialing
but I try to keep it civil so that I
don't get cut off from my phone
and so is it one of these like services
that are like unlimited nationwide
calling yeah so you doing your local
exchange or you venturing outside the
country now that we have I mean remember
who is all about free long distance in
the 80s and 90s was fun freaking it out
and now long distances like they can't
give it away I fast enough so so where
are you you dialing you want to talk
about the town that you're upsetting
right now it's a small town in San Diego
where I grew up I don't want to disclose
too much about it for operational
security but I'm looking at other areas
to women for work which is what started
me on this tangent was I do a lot of
things for work that are within the
continental United States but you can
use voice over IP and get through a
analog telephone adapter you can get
dial tone in another country and the be
even Jay Falcon did an awesome talk at
con a couple years ago on hacking for
networks / voice over IP and I believe
they found a cisco dial up to the
Kremlin you know like they just dropped
him right into a cisco switch that is
wicked so actually it's got me noodling
just right now thinking about like how
you say you're using like a cable
provider but couldn't you just as easily
fire up Astros can get a cheap sip
provider who probably wouldn't care what
you're dialing because they're just
wholesale selling you phone calls anyway
right so it depends on how much you want
to spend I mean if you want to keep it
minimal on you can use an asterisk type
setup but you're still going to be
paying for dial tone for the most part
unless you want to like commit to you
know X number of dollars a month and
you're looking at about 2 cents a minute
the building there can be a little bit
more advantageous for the hobbyist
because only if the call supervises are
going to actually charge you so if you
call a number nobody answers you're not
going to get charged for that but if
something does answer then you're going
to be paying they're going to round up
to the nearest minute but we're still
talking pennies on the dollar and so
what's the strangest thing you've found
so far um that's interesting so there
was a proprietary protocol connecting to
a mainframe that is used EDI electronic
data interchange and it was a schema
that this organization had modified for
their own particular uses and that one
that went kind of threw me for a loop
rip it when I found it I didn't know
what it was
dialing the modem it would answer it
would connect so I would see it and then
it would just hang out for 30 seconds
and if I didn't send it the secret
password of the key sequence to nudge
the system that are responding which is
boot you so that was kind of what got me
on this tangent and probably the most
interesting but it opened up my eyes to
realize that most of the modems that I'm
seeing nowadays don't respond with
standard banners so in the old day she
would hit the enter key a couple times
or return and it would it would spit out
a login prompt but nowadays they've
company started to getting wise to that
and so rather than just getting in or a
couple times you need to initiate the
hand to hand shake properly before it'll
actually let you do anything so now
you're talking about you know
potentially thousands of types of
systems that you're going to have to
manually go through and figure out so
one of some of the things that I've been
doing or trying to create a limited
framework to to sort of incorporate
these nudge strings that are beyond the
simple you know courage returned a
couple times and then using a
combination of when you find a carrier
do a caller ID look up and you can do
that for like a penny a look up now over
the internet so have a quick little bash
script or I just I lat type of the
number it checks and spits out who the
names registered to and so now you've
got this number when I've got a name
associated with it well now it's you
know it's acne tire company okay all
right well now they're in the automotive
industry so that sort of narrows the
field of the possibilities of the types
of things that they're going to be
running that less likely to be running a
mainframe more likely to be running
maybe something that monitors the tire
pressure machine in the garage or
something that's awesome it's just so
cool it just warms my heart to hear this
kind of stuff again are you publishing
your research after this talk uh yeah
probably i know the slides will be made
available and one of these days i'll
stop being lazy and actually put up some
code on github but I mean honestly the
stuff that I'm doing is it's so it's
it's their parlor tricks and it's not my
code right it's a prior script here and
there or you know just a config file so
i'll probably at least put a blog
together but it's you know i'm just
trying to get people thinking about it i
think there's something really valuable
and saying like hey remember that thing
that we used to do that work that
everybody forgot about because we all
move it onto the things they say that
they still work that's awesome it's a
real pleasure Thank You Senor Jeffy pop
you've probably heard me raving about
ting over the past few months and I'm so
happy to say that a lot of hacked by
viewers have already taken advantage of
their awesome customer first approach to
the whole cell market you guys don't
know ting is a new service that brings
clarity usability and huge savings to
mobile phone users and it's this because
of one simple plan you don't have to
think about anything it's really just
honest pricing megabytes minutes text
messages they're all billed separately
so you know if you use more than you
just paid for the next tier there's no
ridiculous overage fees and if you use
less fully accredited the difference
there's no BS you just you know pay for
what you use it's so awesome it's kind
of like one of those mind-blowing like
why doesn't everybody do that well ting
does it and you can get yourself you
know you can actually try out their
online savings calculator to see how
much you could save over a hack five dot
ting com and if you sign up they're
going to go ahead and hook you guys up
cuz they're huge hak5 fans $75 off your
first month of service for just being a
hack 5 viewer so again that's hack five
dot ting com it tickles me pink to see
pink pink is that what it is really
tickles me orange cuz it's always ya to
give me orange did you hear about the
war dialing it's like yeah that was
hilarious I loved it well I mean I used
to do that yeah like on my modem and
then I'd get like you know what my mom
would pick up the phone in the middle of
night and hear modem sounds and I'd get
in trouble and oh it was just like so
cool to see that being done still and
like the whole idea of like oh well the
box said you know I've got to check the
box that says we didn't put the scatter
system on the internet so which photo on
a modem yeah I love that cute yes well
yeah that was an awesome interview and
we have our Tecna West photo of the week
when we get in this week this one comes
from Michael who says that he owns a
computer repair custom buildings a shop
over at Salt Lake City Utah specializing
in high-performance gaming rooms which
is really cool but dude I totally want
to build my own gaming rig and he also
does workstations Annie
he would share with us some of his own
technol list I just love this when was
last time you built a computer it's been
a long long time I thought you just got
the new one when you moved into the new
place yeah I did that was like two years
ago almost so it's time for a new one
yeah yeah I'm been here two years of
this februari in February I will oh ok i
will have been in you know what happens
in February simcity the nuisances no my
contact up up into some sent me oh my
god um I know that's kind of like not
really my like biggest happiest John
where I love the FPS I'm like I'm like
yeah I know this doesn't right like boom
headshot but um I am so excited about
the SimCity because it's it's the one
for me that's that's exciting how I get
with maybe I'll build a new rig just for
that seriously you could you know it's a
great excuse and then you could build it
on the show in fact what's your Excuse
we want to know what is your excuse to
build an awesome rig hit us up feedback
at hak5 organ fact if you've got wicked
rigs that's where you can send a picture
of them feedback fat or technical in the
subject line will find it ma'am just
like that yes now it's time for this
week's trivia so last week's trivia
question was why did the a open ax for
be 533 tube motherboard contain a vacuum
tube why and the answer was to introduce
a warm analog tone to the on-board audio
War Medal those warm tones oh yeah this
week's question is who is widely
recognized as the most influential
