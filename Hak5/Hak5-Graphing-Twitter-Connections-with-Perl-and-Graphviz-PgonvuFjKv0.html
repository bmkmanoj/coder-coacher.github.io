mapping Twitter connections with pearl
and grasses building and modding a ninja
throwing star land tap a task manager
for chrome and D offing Wi-Fi all that
and more this time on hak5 this segment
of hak5 is brought to you by domain.com
hello Mac by my name is Darren kitchen
my name is Shannon Morris of course if
your weekly dose obsessed Chewbacca hmm
oh yeah all right no it's all good i get
excited we got a great show this week
yes super excited you know what else we
got what do we have candy what you wanna
see yeah okay all right Oh talking about
now don't tell nobody this is totally
illegal hmm see they say Kinder Surprise
on these eggs and now states were we're
not supposed to have these here in the
state but here in the states when we do
get him they say i kinder surprise but
like just another egg I think oh yeah
this is my Easter candy so what I have
to thank you to our car driver yeah sent
these in from Ireland may have had one
already it was very good I got I got a
race car you got to put it together
yourself which means figuring out how it
goes to go that's the back of it so
anyway yeah exciting stuff here we've
got a great show we're talking about
like you soldering up some oil stars and
we're uh you know what just candy they
sent us what else do you send packing
material oh yes okay newspaper from
Ireland we wait summer okay what are you
Irish people freezing summer heat to
raise bedroom temperatures uh-huh study
published in the journal human
reproduction found a high level of
vitamin D which the human body Expo when
exposed to sun produces produce a sperm
that are better as swimming towards the
egg and are more penetrative Oh hooray
pentesting I just found out that it's 13
degrees in Dublin but I think this was
on May thirtieth so yeah it's raised a
13 degrees Celsius Dublin Thank You
archiver of course you guys can send
anything you want because will he get
weird stuff and love to get it we like
candy yeah also we're getting it into
some network tapping passively a little
bit of soldering a little bit of ninja
throwing stars in case you really feel
like going black belt and being like
four top and then I'm getting into a
whole lot of fun twitter stuff with
pearl and graph is which i just found
out about and i think is no sweet graph
this yes sweet okay well um why don't
you go ahead and tell me about this
alright so basically twitter map is an
awesome way to kind of get this
beautiful image of what your twitter
experience looks like what your twitter
I'd like it's a search it has the name
Twitter in it so I'm already oh yeah
well as you guys know I'm a huge fan of
programming as a hobby I mean picking up
basic was one of the first major steps
that led me becoming like this huge
computer geek that am today so when I
saw an email from hak5 viewer Jason
Cooper well I had to check out his
latest creation and I took a look
basically jason has developed a really
nifty perl script which maps links
between people on Twitter now his first
version gives an output file ready to be
converted by graphviz into a beautiful
image and i'll go ahead and demonstrate
here how to get started in Linux but
basically this is going to work on any
OS that support pearl and graphviz which
is pretty much any major platform so
I've already gone ahead and W getid and
unzipped the Twitter map code from his
website over at HEC Roth industries dot
co dot UK you can find it here on his
products page this is all good open
source stuff and grabbed from him so
thank you so much for sending this by
and let's just go ahead and start so I'm
here in the directory and let's just run
Twitter map right and you know as you
can see run cooter map reveals just an
explanation of the options but we don't
get a whole lot of information here so
I'm going to go ahead and less Twitter
map and take a look at the code here and
like a good programmer he's gone ahead
and commented out all of the
documentation that you'll need and this
really explains like what it is that
you're going to need to know to get
going with this all right so I'm going
to go ahead and here and run the Twitter
map program for the first time I'm going
to give it a couple of options since I
just want to run a quick test of it so
tactic breath search and then I want to
say limit equals 3 so that i'm not
spending all day on this and then tack
tack max pages 23 as well and then I
choose my output file and that's just
going to be wherever we store this i'm
going to call it hak5 darren one map and
then I get to choose the twitter ID or
the twitter username that i'm going to
be mapping in this case that'll be hak5
Darren
now this is going to take a moment while
the script combs through the last three
pages of my tweets and then it's going
to follow people back three levels deep
through the messages that have been sent
to and from the specified account in
this case hack 5 Darren now Jason hopes
to add the option to map followers in
addition to the messages and also may be
an option to produce word lists from the
tweet which could be fun and interesting
at the same time but then again once the
Twitter map finishes will be left with
an output file all right so if I less
this file here hak5 Darren one map I can
actually see a list of those Twitter IDs
and the relationship so the colors here
orange black red blue they correspond to
the relationship so red is the origin or
wherever you chose is the target while
blue represents neighbors black or third
parties and orange our IDs that haven't
been looked at yet so using graphviz the
output file can be then converted into
an image so let's check out that syntax
and that is using fdp tack oh and then
I'm going to give it the hack for I'm
going to say hak5 Darren one dot PNG and
then tack T because we want PNG and then
our source file in this case attack 5
Darren 1 dot map alright so this is
going to take some time so while we're
doing waiting for graphviz to process
you might want to pop back over to Jason
site and have a peek at some of his
other creations like SSS detect which
detects whether you've been a victim of
Moxie's awesome tool ssl strip or he's
got a nifty game for the gp2x so once
complete you're going to find a PNG file
in your source directory and honestly it
looks fantastic check this out huge by
the way
so let's scale this to size we can see
here we got hak5 Darren and if we scroll
up and down we can see like all of these
other users that are attached here we've
got like leo laporte because we have
lots of mutual friends if we like scroll
up it's like there's Ober Rob and here's
Dave Randolph and snubs and you know
it's just really cool to see all this I
think it's a great example of the spring
model image that you can make with
graphviz and honestly just a simple
conversion file if you take a look that
dot map file we outputted so thank you
so much Jason I wasn't even aware the
graph is was a thing so playing with
that code totally made my day so what
are you guys hacking out anyway you know
you got some code to send our way hit me
up feedback at hak5 org maybe we'll just
show it right here on the program now
stay tuned because in just a bit
Shannon's going to have is all soldering
and packet sniffing like a pro but first
let's take a quick break and then check
in with Kirby for the meow of the week
if you want to build a video site or if
your website has a play button i
recommend getting a dot TV domain a dot
TV website lets you show keep your
