coming up now on threat wire hello world
I'm Shannon Morse inthis is threat wire
for December 30th 2015 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom this is our last
episode of the year and as such we
thought we would wrap up the biggest tax
of the year so we have compiled a list
of the five biggest tax of the year
starting with number five which is vtech
VTech a leading distributor and maker of
internet-connected children's toys found
a breach in their systems in late
November that led to several million
adults and children's data being stolen
the adult profiles contained names email
addresses secret questions and answers
for passwords IP addresses mailing
addresses and download history and the
children's data included names genders
and dates of birth to make matters worse
profile pictures of the children as well
as chat messages with their parents were
reportedly breached as well as of
December 15th a 21 year old British man
was arrested in suspicion of being
behind the hack and currently an
investigation is underway number four is
the Ashley Madison hack in July of 2015
the affairs website called Ashley
Madison was hacked and told to shut down
or the data would be publicized the site
obviously did not shut down and the
stolen data was released worldwide in
August the site did not delete
personally identifying information of
users even when users paid to have their
accounts be deleted and as such real
names home addresses search history and
credit card transaction records were all
released over 10 gigabytes of data and
34 million user accounts were breached
due to the moral implications this hack
was very controversial and widely
reported although the journalistic
ethics of some reports are still
questioned today users were blackmailed
harassed and some took their own lives a
class-action lawsuit was filed against
avid media the company in charge of
Ashley Madison however no arrests have
been made at time of recording and the
CEO has since stepped down number three
is Experian and t-mobile from September
of 2013 all the way to September of 2015
18 million account credentials were
stolen from experience credit
application processing for tmobile names
addresses and birth dates were all
exposed as well as encrypted Social
Security numbers and driver's license
numbers or passport ID numbers
unfortunately though the encrypted data
might have been compromised as well but
neither company has publicized what kind
of encryption they actually use what
kind of technique Experian and t-mobile
offered to three years of free credit
monitoring to affected users
class-action lawsuits have been filed
against the company but have not been
finalized number two is the health
industry excellus bluecross blueshield
announced a breach into their systems in
august which affected 10 million users
data including names birth dates Social
Security numbers addresses phone numbers
in some credit card numbers were stolen
two years of free credit monitoring was
offered to anyone in this hack and
mandiant security was hired to
investigate the breach of information
but many many months before exilis was
the hack of anthem in January 80 million
customers and non-customers if you had
been an anthem card holder in the past
decade had data breached including
Social Security numbers birth dates full
names addresses and income information
and the data was not encrypted which is
a huge HIPAA violation mandiant and the
FBI are investigating this hack and
anthem is offering guess what two years
of free credit monitoring to affected
users and we're down to number one which
is say it with me folks OPM in June of
this year the US Office of Personnel
Management which keeps a database of
former and current government employees
reported a hack into their systems that
was first discovered in April but may
have been happening since as early as
March of 2014 the hack included names
dates and places of birth addresses
Social Security numbers and security
clearance background information the
American Federation of government
employees also believed the breach
compromised military records veteran
status job history pay history pension
information gender race and health and
life insurance information to make the
hack even worse 5.6 million sets of
fingerprints
were also stolen it is unclear whether
or not the hack was state-sponsored but
US officials suspect chinese hackers are
at fault the total reached almost 22
million people this hack is our number
one biggest hack of the year not because
of the number of people but because of
the repercussions while victims were
notified via mail and are offered guess
what 23 years of credit monitoring see a
trend here yet me too this is a national
security issue fingerprints of possible
security clearance individuals could
have severe implications if they were
hacked especially if the heck did
originate from a state-sponsored
criminal the OPM director resigned in
July and an interagency task force has
been assembled to research the breach
now if you haven't paid for freeze on
your credit card information and your
credit monitoring yeah maybe you should
do that now I think now's the time we
started threat wire back up earlier this
year because the information on hacks
security new regulations etc is very
important to us and we hope that it is
important to you too of course if you
want us to continue doing the show into
2016 as we are now and even more
episodes consider becoming one of our
patrons by contributing any amount that
you want at patreon.com / threat wire I
like this part of the show because we
get to see some happy and adorable fur
babies after all this horrific
information about hacks that we keep on
hearing about if you are a hushpuppy
contributor by the way on patreon don't
forget to send in your pet pics because
