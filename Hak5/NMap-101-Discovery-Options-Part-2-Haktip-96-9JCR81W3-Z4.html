5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are going
over even more nmap discovery options
since there are so many discovery
options that we could cover I decided to
split them into two episodes last weeks
and this week's so last week we covered
about 10 options that you can add to
your command to make sure you receive
information from your specific target
even if ICMP is blocked this week we're
going to cover the basics of the rest of
them so first off we have this one
called tak Pio
which basically stands for IP protocol
ping this will send packets with a
specific protocol to your target machine
now your syntax would look something
like this
you'll type in sudo because you do have
to be root and then nmap tak p.o and the
both of those are capital 1070 331 145
and that just happens to me my target
press enter and it will ask for your
password if you're not already root and
it'll give you back the same kind of
information that you've seen in the past
with most nmap commands that we've shown
so far if you want to add a certain
protocol to your command you would also
add something like this
so it'd be sudo and map Pio and then at
the end of that specific syntax you
would put one two four or whatever your
different protocols would be and then
press Enter and you'll get a similar
output the defaults if you don't specify
anything our protocol one for ICMP
protocol two for IGMP and protocol for
or for IP in IP so you don't actually
have to type those luckily there is a
handy list of protocols online for you
to use and I will put all of those in my
show notes now next we have an ARP ping
which can be used by adding TAC PR so
that one in this case would look like
this type in sudo and map TAC PR and
both of those are capitalized 10 dot 73
31 145 or whatever your target ends up
being
and you'll get a similar outcome again
so this is implied whenever you scan a
local network it's very fast very
accurate because land hoes cannot block
our requests you can't use this if your
target isn't on your local subnet so
keep that in mind now another one we
have touched on a little bit is trace
route this will trace the network path
to a specific host it's kind of cool
because when you run it you end up with
a map of all the locations that your
target goes through to get to you so to
do this again you're going to use sudo
so you'll type in sudo and map and then
two dashes trace route and whoever your
target is so I'm going to try let's see
I'm going to ping our forums to see what
those are 52 8.75 dot 103 and hit enter
oh my goodness
that took a long time okay so that took
a little while longer but you'll notice
that a list of hops show up and
addresses for each one it is kind of
cool to check out how your target is
able to get from one point to another if
I scroll through here you'll see our bug
bomb scroll up a little bit so you see
the usual output that you see on pretty
much every single and map output and
then down here you see the trace route
using port 53 TCP hop the route how long
it took to get there and the address so
you can see how many hops it took and
this one takes quite a few to get where
we are huh that's kind of cool now we're
going to take a quick break but we will
be right back with more discovery
options in just a moment the hack shop
is heck 5s premier store for all of your
pen testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
looks like a flash drive but it types
like a keyboard and it can type scripts
into a computer ridiculously quickly
like this week's pick from lava noid in
the forums so this script that he shows
off will quickly backup passwords
product keys directory listings and tons
tons more it's very cool and actually
really fast now we couldn't do the show
without your support so we would like to
thank you with something special use the
coupon code snubz with any note order in
the hack shop for your very own hack tip
stickers and again thank you so much for
supporting the show we're back with more
options for an nmap now next we are
going to try out a forced reverse DNS
resolution with the TAC our option so
for this example I will type in of
course and map and then tack R and its
capital R of course 10 dot 73 to 31.1
4/5 and I'm going to add sudo on it just
in case
sweet up on Kai so this one is the
reverse resolution this output will look
similar to the default output and is
useful if you're trying to resolve the
reverse dns info on every IP address for
a subnet on a block of IP addresses
so if verse dns can still reveal info
through and map even if the target is
offline or blocking and maps regular
probes on the other hand if you want to
disable reverse dns lookups you can do
so with the tack end option so very
similar just add tack in if you find
using reverse dns is slow this will
speed it up there is also an alternative
DNS lookup method that you can use as
well so this one looks like this end map
I'll put sudo just in case two dashes
type system
- DNS and then whoever your target is
type enter and it will finish up this
uses the host system DNS resolver
instead of n Maps own method it's much
slower than the other reverse DNS lookup
method but it can still be useful for
troubleshooting if you want to manually
specify DNS servers you can also do the
following you can type in and map very
similar to that one and then at the end
of
this part DNS servers you would type in
whatever the servers are that you want
to specify for this example so I could
type in something like let's do 6 7 . 2
2 2 2 2 2 then we'll do 208 . 84.5 i
don't know if this is going to work and
then your target so this is going to
bypass the default DNS servers that are
configured in your local system now last
but not least is creating a host list
this is going to identify the IP
addresses and dns names of targets
without sending any packets to them so
to do so and this one actually uses a
lowercase letter instead of an uppercase
surprise you type in nmap i'll do sudo
and map tech s capital L 10 dot 70 3.31
1 so I'm going to scan my whole network
and then hit enter so normally what this
is going to do is list out its name and
IP address of each of the targets in a
very simple lift list without all the
extra information that nmap usually
passes to you as an output so you'll
notice on my machine that mine doesn't
it just gives me the IP address of each
of the different targets in a list but
it doesn't give me an DNS record a DNS
name for each one so for some reason I
keep on having this issue I haven't
figured it out yet but it's unable to
open this resolve Conville so maybe you
guys can help me understand why this
keeps on happening
maybe it's specifically my Linux machine
I don't know we'll see so what would you
like to see next
on my end map tutorials I have lots of
fun with these and I want to continue
them for a little while now you can
always send me a comment below or you
can email us over at tips at hack 5 org
be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 for more great stuff just like
this I'll be there reminding you to
trust your techno West</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
