Squarespace hello and welcome to hack
tip the show we break down the concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas i'm your host Darren
kitchen and today did they were taking a
break from our Wi-Fi 101 series to focus
on a few tips for backtrack 5 Linux
might like her favorite happy tastic
distro of choice even though the new
version of black bun to just came out
looks pretty good you know who knows
we'll see anyway I wanted to go let you
guys know that we will be getting back
to the frames and the packets and the
sniffing the pre-shared keys and the
wiper protected access all but for the
moment on kind of knee deep and ducks
and hacker cons and mods and going to
Louisville so anyway hang type 0 so
anyway if you wanted to go back now and
review all of it is over at hjk the
number 5 org as well as youtube.com
slash show / hack tip and if you don't
already help yourself a nifty USB Wi-Fi
radio with our beloved realtek 8187 you
can actually go ahead and head over to
the hack shop and grab one today we just
got em in they look beautiful they're
all sexy in matte black anyway Booya
it's time to back track now back to back
track and talk about x.x the windows
system or x 11 or commonly just known as
x is both software and a network
protocol that builds the foundation of a
GUI or a graphical user interface and
it's considered a hardware abstraction
layer or how that creates kind of an
in-between for the actual hardware of
the computer and say like the programs
that want to I don't know draw window
and one of the beautiful things about X
is that you can be used remotely over
ssh and always talked about this a bit
on act 5 i'm just going to revisit this
on hack tip here soon but suffice it to
say x is excellent what i did there
alright so this brings us to the actual
gooeys or user interfaces now on linux
there are many user interfaces or window
managers that use X and much like
Windows Mac OS X or OS 10
and I said that window managers like for
Linux like gnome and KDE to find the
whole user interface and all that all
that wimpy stuff wimp that's uh yeah
just what we needed another backronym
windows icons menus pointers thanks
xerox it seems you guys invented
everything in the 70s anyway this whole
thing this whole long spiel has brought
us back to backtrack and my distro of
choice which I use gnome because you
know combs both the gnome and KDE
flavors and I'm just not cool enough use
fluxbox so I use no my love gnome and if
you've been using backtrack for a while
you know that when you first boot all
you typically do is login as root and
then start X with that nifty start X
command I mean how convenient anyway
while running it's rude isn't advised
for other distros I mean come on it's a
hacker dis chair so hopefully you know
you're doing but while this whole
rigmarole was fun at first after typing
in route your password start X after a
while it gets kind of tedious and you
know boring so today that's right today
we're automating this biznitch right
after a quick break Squarespace is the
fast and easy way to create a high
quality website they offer 24 x seven
sport over 60 professionally designed

actual process of logging in
automatically has done easily with a
cool little program called run getty or
run GE TTYL because t2 anyway it's
really simple to set up all we have to
do is first install run getty by doing
apt-get install our UNG TTYL
and with that now installed we can go
ahead and edit our first TTYL
configuration files so for that i'm
going to use by and it's in /a TC / and
knit / TTYL 1.com and what we want to do
here is come down to where it says exact
/s bin / GE TTYL go ahead I to insert
and put a pound in front of that and
that just comments that out so let's add
another line here what will want it to
say is exact /s bin / run GE TTYL and
then space TTYL one space tak tak
auto-login route alright so go ahead and
exit at an insert mode Cole in X to
write that file and quit and now we can
just edit they r dot bash ours r dot
bash underscored profile to go ahead and
start x after root has been logged in so
for that we will actually will first
need to touch it because i don't think
it's there let's see LS and it's in /
route / dot bash underscore profile yeah
it's not there so for that we'll go
ahead and touch till the slash dot bash
underscore profile Tilda just being it
replacement for your home directory in
this case / route now that thats file
has been created I can come back in here
and LS that hey there it is except it's
completely empty what we need to do is
edit this so we're going to again vice
logic route / bash underscore profile
and all really need to do is add a line
them here that says start X so I to
insert start X escape colon X boom we
are all set all we're off to the races
all we have to do now is uh is go ahead
and reboot and you know Bob's your uncle
will be I actually do that here but in
the screen recording software would quit
and then it would be all weird so let's
not do that anyway I want to know what
programs are rocking your world what
technologies are taking away your test
technol lust words I have them hit me up
