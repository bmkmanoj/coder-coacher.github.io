for someone gigahertz hacking all that
and more this time on hack five
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com
hello welcome ak5 my name is darren
kitchen my name is Shannon Morris your
weekly dose of techno lust I am so
stoked about this episode this is really
exciting because today we are looking at
the brand new yardstick 1 this is pretty
awesome the yardstick 1 is an
inexpensive sub 1 gigahertz
software-defined radio transceiver aimed
at security researchers and in this
episode we're going to go over all of
the good stuff everything from setting
up the yardstick 1 to what it can do the
RF cat software cases peripherals
setting it up in Linux and then finally
doing a little demo yay
so the yard and yard stick one actually
stands for yet another radio dongle and
it was created by Mike Osman who you may
know of great Scot gadgets so you may
know him from the uber tooth one the
hacker f1 both really cool projects very
great tools for security researchers and
penetration testers as well
pen testers it was originally based on
the torque on 14 badge which
incorporated at Texas Instruments you
may remember the calculators assisi 1111
so it's the same chip found in the
famous pink pager the IM me and this was
the toy that pop was popularized by mike
and travis Goodspeed because of its hack
ability that's right real men carrying
pink pagers essentially it is a
software-defined radio that operates
officially in the lower 300 megahertz
the lower 400 megahertz
and the 900 megahertz range is now
unofficially it can actually achieve a
little bit greater bandwidth and this is
pretty awesome because much of that
spectrum is the unlicensed is em or
industrial scientific and medical band
you know that basically unlicensed
spectrum where we can have a lot of fun
for 33 megahertz in region one that's
Europe Africa and Middle East 915
megahertz if you're in the United States
or South America Greenland
I guess Canada is well America's hat
it's pretty cool this will do data rates
up to 500 kilobits per second and has
built in support for some really common
modulation techniques such as
amplitude modulation or I guess
amplitude shift keying on-off keying few
other types of frequency shift keying
and minimum shift keying stuff and I
stroke my beard so this is really fun
because those are the frequencies and
modulations used by lots and lots of
different things that thus far hasn't
really been properly audited by the
security community it's only now that
things like the SDR s and the hacker f1
have become mainstream that we've
started seeing attacks against things
like automotive keyless entry systems
you know garage doors or what-have-you
so a few yardstick friendly sub
gigahertz projects that come to mine are
hacking doorbells those garage doors
open openers that I mentioned fixed key
remotes which are super fun so I
actually know that Darren and I have
been looking at some of the equipment
that we use here in the studio such as
this little remote so hopefully we'll
have a remote or an actual segment over
this little room textures like next week
because it's looking good I've already
captured the waveforms wow it was so
much cool stuff and let me tell you
what's going to actually make this
auditing system like ridiculously
accessible to security researchers is
the fact that it already has
pre-installed RF cat firmware and that's
courtesy of Atlas if you're not familiar
RF cat is it's sort of like the cat
program or will net cat if you're more
familiar with that on Linux I know it's
good stuff you know standard in and out
that's call is written in Python and it
is super simple to incorporate into your
own projects as you'll soon see it's a
ridiculous easy library and it's
specifically designed to interface with
the CC 1111 dongles there's the Chronos
dongle there's an e MK dongle but now
there's an actual yardstick one
specifically designed for security
researchers dongle and having the RF cat
firmware pre-installed makes it so much
easier since you don't need to flash it
with like pogo pads or anything you know
and actually if you do want to flash it
the CC bootloader is pre-installed as
well so you can actually reflash the
firmware without needing any additional
hard waiting just to read over USB it's
good stuff so before we actually get
into the setup and the demo I do want to
talk real quick about some of the
differences between the yardstick one
and the other CC 11
so most notably it fate features SMA
connector on it for external antennas
which is super great yeah just like that
one no we're gonna go into either use an
a an T 500 telescopic antenna which is
really great for general purpose don't
you poke me with that thing or what if
our GSM antennas 2 to 900 megahertz mic
also put a lot of work into improving
the sensitivity and he added an
amplifier and low-pass filter to keep it
clean while operating at 900 megahertz
so it also features programming test
points and expansion headers and lastly
I did want to mention that similar to
the uber tooth one it will fit into a
generic plastic case stout so you could
find one online or you could 3d print
one yourself yeah just like that little
one that I think you printed that
yesterday and under like 20 minutes I
know the STL files are up on the X
github so thanks for that
yeah know that there's a we run Mouser
as well that's so where you could just
heat shrink it so now with those basic
ins and outs out of the way we are going
to go ahead and get our Linux set up and
start using it with our very first
program with RF cat and the yardstick 1
we're going to do just that right after
this quick break
domain.com and dock club came to hack 5
with a great idea build a club all about
learning stuff making things and having
fun so we've been hosting open houses at
the hack 5 warehouse through hack house
club and with the help of domain.com and
dot club we've taken it to the next
level with a quadcopter arena of doom
from LAN parties drone racing and battle
arenas to 3d printing software-defined
radios and let's not forget barbecue
hacking is just plain better when it's
social dock club gets it and they are
the perfect social domain whether it's
IRC or clubs in RL it's all about coming
together and having fun so what better
domain to do it than a doc club it's
perfect because a doc club is
universally and globally understood so
if you're looking for the ultimate
social domain consider a doc club so
join us this summer in the San Francisco
Bay Area and bring your mini quadcopter
to the arena for drone battle club we're
setting up the leaderboard so show us
what you've got
and what's your dock club let us know
and we'll share it with the hak5
audience it helps
bread the word get yours over at
domain.com slash club they're only $9.99
a year and there are thousands of great
domains available and be sure to use the
coupon code hak5 to get 15% off and let
them know we sent you so when you think
domain names think domain.com we are
back and we're ready to get started with
the yardstick 1 setup so I'm going to be
using Linux I believe Darren is as well
so on Linux you're going to need the
latest copy of RF cat from atlases repo
you can find out over at bitbucket org
slash atlas 0 / RK / RF okay so you're
going to click downloads and grab the
latest RF cat gzip or just compile it
from source and then untie the file
through the directory or terminal
whichever you prefer and CD into the
directory in your terminal so now I can
ensure that you have the dependencies
which are Python Python USB which is
Python - USB and Lib USB so for my
distro I needed to do an apt-get install
Python - USB that's for Linux Mint
specifically which is what I use on my
computer did you have to get that it's
the same thing you know I'm running
Ubuntu 1404 so then it's just a matter
of issuing sudo python set up py install
and then finally sudo RF cat tak R and
actually if you read the readme you can
find other ways to do this rootless just
a matter of setting a you dev rule well
it just does commands in our show notes
tonight quick and dirty though just to
get started here you're going to be
presented with a interactive environment
it's all based on Python let me show you
that here so on my laptop I'm going to
go ahead and run sudo RF cat tech or I
guess it's dot slash because I'm in the
directory and there we go I already have
my dongle plugged in otherwise it'll be
it'll say waiting for dongle and this is
the greatest thing since
frequency-hopping and it really is
because this creates an object called
Adi for dongle and you can fondle it
with all of these different functions
that are built-in right you really just
say that that's what you do in Python
you fumble your dongle or functions at
least this has already built-in stuff to
to ping to discover to transmit to
receive to set your modulation
and the data rates to set your
frequencies so as you can see if you
already have an idea for a program this
Python library is going to make it super
ridiculous simple to communicate with
the art stick one yeah so that's awesome
so I can also see my current
configuration by issuing print D Ripper
radio config so I'll go into RF cat so
that's sudo RF cat tack our whoops and
it's waiting for your dongle so we go
ahead and plug that guy in ha ha
yeah oh there we go
okay cool so you can see all the
different functions that I can use in
here and I'm going to go ahead and type
in that very last one at the bottom cool
all right there we go and if you scroll
up you can see all of the different
information about the modulation
technique and the frequencies that
you're operating on looks like you're on
it okay looks like earned 300 recognizes
my yardstick one up here and then you
can see the frequency that I'm currently
on very cool rad stuff and then to quit
it's just a matter of issuing quit
opening closed parentheses because you
are in fact in a boil you're in pies on
your timer you rad yeah so I'm going to
go ahead and do that here and there we
go and I'm out
whoo so with that you know that now the
yardstick one is working happily with
the RF cat library so this means we can
now start actually using it with a
program that has specifically been
designed with this library and you know
what I thought as far as like hello
world in this thing what better way to
do it and an ephemeral IRC oh my gosh
it's not actually our C it's a child
like Nick at its yeah
right it's a guess chat I love chat I've
been on IRC since the 90s never been in
flame war team Roode the Box wrote an
epic chat client called porchat it was
actually using the torque on 12 badge
and this was for contest at torque on a
while back and we have since forked it
and added support for the yardstick 1 mm
okay so I'm going to go ahead and start
this off so I'll start I'll return to my
home directory with CD of course so just
you know CD yay and then I can clone the
github which is over at github calm
slash hack 5 slash torch at so that is
so now I can see D into tour chat and
then I can sudo dot slash torch at oops
not capitalized torch at PU I hit enter
and now I'm in the what is this called n
curses yeah it's an N curses interfaces
at xqe it's good stuff so I can press
you to create a user name which will
just basically bring me down to the next
cursor row so I'll put in snubs of
course for my username and then I can
simply write to other people who are
also logged in hmm hey there Shannon huh
check oh yeah I got it on my computer
how's it going there we are and we have
this is so cool we have a femoral chat
you know just you can see that there's a
few other options C will allow you to
change the channel that will allow you
to change the frequency I'm just so
happy do I like pandas so do i and those
are great it's like the best chat
session ever I love turtles too okay so
anyway as you can see this is pretty rad
and actually what's more if one of the
clients in this chatroom has internet
access regardless of whether the other
clients do the other clients can
actually request web pages through that
first client with the W option
no it's crazy it's just what they were
like well we finished a chat might as
well add some cool new feature free
option that's for ya
so already you can imagine like wait a
second you know remember that box that
was like pulled from the latest Def Con
they were like oh we can't show it yeah
right you could do stuff like that and
since it's Python I know that it would
be stupid simple to implement in AES
encryption with appreciated key I do
know this because I've already has it
it's fun hey this would be awesome guess
what guess what and done
it's Python gosh you're like a USB key I
am so excited about it you've been done
I can't wait to start hacking on this
yeah so I think that's about it for
getting started with the yardstick 1 we
will be following up with more on this
since as you can see it's really super
accessible and when paired with an RTL
SDR it's a really awesome combo for
unliked licensed spectrum security
research I know Darren and I have
already been working on some really fun
hacks the legal formula warehouse like
our doorbell our studio equipments so
stay tuned for all of that it's going to
be really really fun and of course if
you like what we're up to you want to
support the show directly you can pick
up some of the often awesome really cool
pen testing gear like the USB rubber
ducky which we mentioned the land turtle
of course the yardstick one is one of
those as well over at h JK shop.com
right and you can also find the links
from all the stuff that we've talked
about today in our show notes you'll
also find all of our past episodes over
at hak5 dot board with that I'm Darrin
kitchen I like pandas that's Shannon
Morris check - tecna's
are you doing no no stop it
mine's bigger I've - tuned a 900
megahertz it gets only a quarter wave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
