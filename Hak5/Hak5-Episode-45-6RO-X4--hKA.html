you'll see that every time we try to do
a walking shot it's real shaky kind of
Blair Witch ish it's horrible and if
you're paying attention to this shot
it's a lot more stable not shaking
nearly as much that's because our
cameras attached to a Steadicam and this
is not an expensive venture at all the
article has been posted on Make Magazine
Slashdot Digg it's been everywhere and
for about 1350 you can have your own
Steadicam now I decided even though it's
something that we need for the show it's
kind of tech oriented so I'd share it
with you all let's go ahead and check it
out Wes thanks so much for taking on
this project because really what I asked
us to do was build us a Steadicam
because I've been looking online I
really wanted one so we didn't have all
these shaky shots and everything yeah
well everything I saw was like a
thousand dollars and then Wes found this
awesome website which I believe I had
seen before maybe I think it showed it
to me a long time again right so this is
$14 inexpensive Steadicam and fifty to
be exact yeah we got the receipt it's
pretty inexpensive
Johnny chun-li has done this original
we're gonna have the link right down
here and Wes is gonna show us how it's
done
so what do we need to get started okay
what you're gonna need to get started is
you field trip to the hardware store fun
fun always you need three black iron
half inch nipples mm-hmm 10 inches long
all right
1/2 inch t3 half inch caps 2 machine
bolts inch and a half long that's what
those are yeah these are the Machine
bolts great yeah it's a better shot of
that right there
and they need to be an inch and a half
long and a quarter inch diameter okay we
need the nuts that go along with them
like these right here three flanged
washers quarter inch of course these are
an inch and a half yeah and a half
outside diameter quarter inch inside and
then we need some lock washers like
these right here
once again quarter-inch and these aren't
little baby ninja stars no I'm sorry
okay I hate to disappoint that's all
right
I'm gonna find out where what these go
for so once we've all got all these
supplies what's the first thing okay
gather all your tools that you might
need to half-inch wrench screwdriver
pipe wrench needle nose first thing is
your machine work you need to pop two
quarter inch holes that's where we had
fun drilling this hole yeah this right
here you can see it I mean it doesn't
have to be dead center but closer the
better obviously the most important
thing with this was that we had it on a
vise yeah you know you're gonna hurt
yourself if you don't use a vise yeah
you're gonna end up breaking a finger or
breaking your wrist something like that
doesn't sound like much fun okay so once
we've got bad so we need to drill holes
in what two of these yes yeah one is
just to you know make it look pretty
yeah pretty much it's gonna cover the
thread so we don't have some great got
our fingers well why don't we start with
the weight okay okay so cut off with the
counterweight yeah here's the two and a
half pound weight mm-hmm and from here
this is gonna be the bottom of our
Steadicam and that's actually what's
gonna act to steady it counteract any
kind of swinging motion so from this we
take our weight tick one machine bolt
and one flange washer washer down flange
bolt through okay flange washer on the
other side like so
then cap with a hole in it great one
blocking washer now this this part gets
to be a little bit of a pain because you
have to like get it on the bolt mmm
inside of the cap so you just kind of
have to play with it there we go you can
just jiggle it in a lot of times it'll
fall right on and then same thing for
the nut you kind of get it situated on
there and here's the fun part
just kind of hold your finger on the nut
and hand thread it on as far as it'll go
you know at this point it's not all
about getting it all the way to have a
science yeah this oh hey I got it
alright then we'll take the screwdriver
and our little pair of needlenose pliers
here
hold tonight here comes the fun part
alright and then carry on until its
height oops
once you get it kind of snug that lock
washer in the bottom will actually grab
the bolt so you won't need the
needlenose at a certain point it kind of
makes life in earth hold this way
alright check that out
teamwork there we go alright now you can
let go it's nice and snug now you're
just a good way to rate how much you've
torqued this down is when the washers
dish out mmm that's when you know it's
there you've got this little dimple in
here yeah you can see that right there
and we've done the same thing with this
so how'd you get that little dimple in
there that one you can either just you
know do it like this or you can hold it
in the vise mm-hmm inside of the weight
hole with one of your machine bolts
stuck in it right and smack it one good
time with a hammer cool okay so what
about for the camera end all right they
kept the camera mount that one look
looks a little funky
alright like we've already got to start
it off I see we've got the cap here with
the bolt going through it not on the
other end yeah
underneath that nuts another lock washer
great okay now here you take a wing nut
put it on upside down you'll see why in
just a second
and then take your other dishwasher okay
put it so it cups up okay so instead of
the camera just sitting on the end of
this little piece right here it's gonna
sit on this whole thing right that's
gonna distribute the weight I'm tackling
grant yeah that's exactly what its gonna
do and it'll look something like this
and you of all people know that when
you're screwing this and be careful
incredibly just just snug it yeah this
camera 3 you don't want to break him or
three yeah you can't hurt camera three
and then just snug it up with the wing
nut just like that no see yeah it's a
good fit cool okay so um now we've got
the bottom down we've got the top down
so you know just throw it all together
right yeah
sling it off you gotta figure this stuff
out right mm-hmm now do you need to
really tighten this down real good or I
mean you need to use like the wrench to
hook it all up or what it depends on
what you you're gonna decide to do with
your Steadicam if you want to make it
super portable mmm hand tightening it's
gonna be good enough yeah we want this
portable so we can put it in the camera
bag and try and get through customs
customs yeah it's not gonna make it fun
at all
but yeah hand tight is good enough but
if you're gonna make it more of like a
permanent fixture go ahead and take a
pipe wrench to it and snug everything
down really tight you don't want it to
come apart on you mm-hm at some very
very inopportune time would you like a
hand Aaron no I got it here please yeah
all right you just told that parts to
see see how easy that is yeah it
would've been easier had we not had the
camera on it yeah probably but okay so
there's that top half and then screw the
bottom half on you bring it over here so
everybody can see okay so everybody can
see me not be able to screw something
wrong how many hackers does a tip screw
on a two and a half pound wait there we
go wow that was really yeah and I mean
it's not very heavy at all mm-hmm you
know it's probably about ten pounds
total right Tommy and you can just yeah
we were doing some tests earlier and
it's just you kind of and you kind of
have to walk you know toe heel toe heel
yeah you kind of do your toe heel and
you know you hold all your weight and on
the vertical post you just kind of use
your other hand to stabilize on the
handle it can do some nice pain stuff
like that I mean you can see how simple
it is we just put it together cool in no
time so there's actually a couple of
additional parts that you can get to
this you know for there's some little
add-ons for doing like you know Manning
the camera on the bottom and stuff like
that and more informations on that on
that website of course we've got links
to that at the bottom of the screen as
well as on our show notes thank you so
much for building us a Steadicam we're
going to put this head a lot of good use
yeah and now our hack links won't get
motion sickness hey right here try
watching episode 3 on a 61 inch plasma
all right so you don't think anything
all right seriously I have no clue what
I'm gonna say so I'm just gonna make
this shit up as I go along alright so
here we are back in the lab we're
getting ready alright so here we are
back in the lab and I'm getting ready to
show you everything that you need and
how to do it get it for the feast
status with your steely knives but you
just can't kill the Beast last thing I
remember I was running for the door I
had to find that passage back to the
place I was before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
