NSA data the FCC passes some new privacy
laws and should hacking back or
counter-attacking be legal all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
I'm Shannon Morse and this is throughout
wire for tuesday november first 2016
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and internet freedom
and yes i am in my Star Trek uniform i
am recording this on halloween first off
i wanted to give a big thanks to all of
our patrons over at patreon.com /
throughout wire you fund the making of
the show so thank you for letting us
bring you security news every single
week this week i would like to focus on
the first story the group who had
previously released documented NSA
hacking tools out into the wild is back
on halloween day releasing more data for
the masses trick or treat October
thirty-first shadow brokers updated
their medium account to say that they
were dumping data online that showed IP
addresses of servers used by the
equation group now the equation group
you may remember has been linked as an
internal NSA hacking group many times in
the past so according to security
researcher Mustafa al-bassam the new
data contains a quote list of servers
compromised by the NSA to use as exploit
staging servers this list contains over
300 domains and IP addresses related to
49 different countries but it doesn't
prove that these servers were hacked by
the NSA now while the shadow brokers
first claimed that they only release
more docs whenever they got a winner of
their original auction they ceased said
auction and chose to release the data
publicly anyways even though they didn't
necessarily get paid this also comes as
another NSA contractor is awaiting a
hearing on his own stolen NSA documents
we will keep an eye on this story as it
unfolds that's super big d das that hit
dine DNS a little bit over a week ago
should have been a pretty big wake-up
call too many about the ongoing issues
with IOT or Internet of Things it
definitely was for Virginia Democratic
Senator Mark Warner who wrote letters to
the FCC FTC and the DHS explained
the threat that we face from insecure
Internet of Things devices Warner asks
if isp should deny connections to
devices that are delegated as insecure
and if there was something that the
government could do to vet IOT devices
in the first place and not only that but
more legal issues arose this past week
as researchers at invincea found three
different vulnerabilities in the mirror
I source code that would enable a user
to crash a sequence of attacks but leave
the bot running an attacker could just
restart the attacks though so this
doesn't necessarily remove the botnet it
just kind of crashes part of it the
problem is whether it would be legal or
not for a DDoS protection firm to do
this n mcandrew an attorney in
Washington DC says quote as a general
matter you cannot send code to another
computer that is unauthorized in nature
if you think about the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act or CFAA for short you are
really talking about unauthorized access
to a protected computer the question is
if the code is on the bot you're
modifying code that resides on these
devices I think it constitutes access
and you would have a potential problem
with the CFAA counter-attacks impose a
sort of gray area for white hat hackers
when you are protecting yourself and
killing the botnet process on the
infected IOT device but not removing the
malware would it be considered slightly
helping or not the federal
communications commission passed a new
rules on October 27th requiring ISPs to
protect consumer privacy by requiring
consent from a customer before sharing
the personal information with a
third-party ISPs will have three
categories that they will have to abide
by depending on the type of data that
they want to share opt-in confirmation
from a customer includes data about
their location their financials their
health their social security numbers
their children's info which I find
incredibly weird web browsing history
app usage in communication content
opt-out data includes serviced here and
email addresses for example and would
require an obvious opt-out format and
lastly our exclusions like information
for billing and collections which would
not require consent from the consumer
these new rules offer customers more
turn
perrin see about their ISPs and they
include the rule that the eyes fees must
now notify customers in the event of
some kind of data breach was pretty cool
now who is against the new rulings of
course it's the association of the
national advertisers ISPs have a full
year to comply with the FCC's ruling
though I want to send a big heartfelt
thank you again for being a patron of
threat wire you can contribute over at
patreon calm / threat wire to get your

everyone that watches this show donates
a dollar per month we would successfully
cover all of our fees like red like
electricity plus we would be able to do
