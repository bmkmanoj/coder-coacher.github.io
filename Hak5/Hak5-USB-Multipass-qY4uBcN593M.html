these boot keys into one
this episode the pack five is brought to
you by go daddy
Squarespace Gamefly and viewers like you
hello and welcome to hack five my name
is Gerren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
I'm bald wise oh my god who's that
that's not Matt it's producer Paul
producer Paul oh that's so much nicer
than Paul the camera guy well the kind
of guys like action figures yeah that's
true
producer Paul so much cooler always been
asked yes we have an awesome show for
you guys this week we are doing lots of
fun USB stuff you know it once a year
Aaron has to just break them out and
have a lot of fun we are taking all of
this mess and we are turning it into one
USB key to rule them all so you know how
you've got you know you're you're one to
roll them home yeah yeah it's right so I
mean okay so so tools that you're
talking about the Trinity and then
things like off crack we've talked about
in the past on do we don't say those are
three that you okay well you take those
and then some my favorite tools like
backtrack 30 backtrack for and and my
mind's blanking at the moment but I know
the oh and then you've got a whole bunch
of different like rescue disks helix
like forensics stuff and put them all
onto one USB key and just have little
menu so that when you blew it off of it
yeah turn that little much nicer than
carrying around like 25 USBs yeah I mean
well like it you could still look like
that I mean you're not an uber nerd
until your keychain is like six
different USB keys on it with like
different like things like written on
them and like you know magic marker or
whatever and then like scratched out and
then later you put something else on it
you know I've never gone that far I will
say I've never gone that far but yeah
that's pretty you don't you don't where
the USB key on the little lanyard that
comes in I have done it before but
really really good so I don't know we'll
we'll be doing that a little bit later I
know that you're talking about Trinity
Trinity yes like it's like see
PR for your dead computer woohoo
surviving pcs up in this but I guess we
should mention we're not he's sick
that's a shame I called in sick we're
actually shooting early too so I haven't
seen all of the feedback on the Tomcat
stuff that we did last week yeah well I
mean I've seen a couple of things and
I'm surprised that I haven't gotten the
you know I was I was hoping for the Java
guy in the back of the class to be like
well actually and I haven't seen that at
all yet so I've just been yeah I just
been hearing a whole lot of other geeks
that are like yeah Java I know this is
how I make it not suck as much I'm like
wow I mean you know so it is what it is
we'll see maybe in a week from now that
will change but continuing that series
maybe the week after because after this
we're in San Francisco yes and then
after that we're back for one more
episode before we would kill off the
season and then come back the very next
week with a new one dude August is gonna
be an awesome month yes hopefully it's
going to be a lot better than this month
because well at least this week in
particular the worst week
okay so broken camera that was my fault
I got Darren a battery grip and the
battery grip kind of killed his camera
so don't get the optica batter you grew
up cuz that thing doesn't really work
broken motorcycle yeah just that was
just kind of try not to get hit by cars
don't get hit by cars cuz when you fly
over the hood and your motorcycle falls
on its side it kind of bends the
motorcycle and gives you a nice little
bruise on your need and it's not pretty
we're hurting but you know we're alive
and it's good to be alive and it's good
yeah and a little note and so our
helmets rock on this and little note to
you drivers out there pay attention for
motorcycles just because they're smaller
than you guys doesn't mean they don't
have the right away you can't just Ram
right through him so I'm not bitter I'm
just saying look out for us thanks I
appreciate it
and then so two broken things oh and
then the website was broken into two but
I was gonna leave that for Matt because
he's got more details on that that we
could turn it into a lesson learned do
some segment stuff analysis and exploit
code and mouse which stuff
but might be a little too early for that
so we'll just you know leave that on the
back burner for the time being
Oh yep and then middle over it while
we're on vacation
so I think that's pretty much it that's
what we're doing this episode we're
getting our USB loving on so why don't
we just get right into it all right well
first let's take a look with Squarespace

geek like me you've got plenty of tools
in your collection that you use to do
tons of fun stuff nefarious stuff repair
stuff whatever whether it's backtrack 3
backtrack 4 konbu mem test 86 NT
password daniels buta nuke free daus off
crack trinity rescue kit system restore
city bar PE helix dan small linux ubuntu
Knoppix I mean the list goes on and on
and you guys have been sending me
awesome stuff via Twitter of more stuff
that I even need to check out but the
problem is and I'm the viewers beaky's
and I'm not carrying around a man-purse
of USB keys I mean nobody needs a murse
right so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna put that awesome new 16 gig drive
that you got laying around to some good
use we're gonna put all those fun little
distros on there so that you don't have
to be you know Dorking mcdr cretin yeah
so this was something that I've been
like you know getting lots of questions
about for last forever I've been trying
to do for last forever if I could find a
free moment and and and hunt around
every time I look into this it seems
like digital alchemy until Frank Castle
came along and he was determined on a
mission to make this work totally got
back to me with the secrets so I am
going to dispense to you now the secret
sauce to turn one of these into a multi
pass so let's go ahead and get the
turkey prepped I have this one already
done we're gonna be talking about
customizing it in just a little bit here
but let's start fried
I've got a blank USB I'd say what is it
2cm this Cruiser any of any of you guys
know me and the SanDisk Cruiser from
seasons past you know that they're near
and dear to my heart
so let's go ahead and get it prepped
what our our ingredients so that we can
get this thing booting a lots of fun
stuff well first of all we need a little
tool called PE two USB so PE two USB is
pretty easy we just go ahead and run
this single executable and it's gone
ahead and found our Sanders cruiser here
and we just want to make sure that we
have enabled disk format quick format
and force volume just mount checked here
and we go ahead and click start say yeah
yeah if you're running Vista you might
want to run this administrator but there
we go operation successfully completed
and we are we are one step further to
having this awesome multipath goodness
there is a note here that if we are
doing a drive bigger than 2 gigabytes
you might get an error but don't worry
it's not a big deal it just means that
we're gonna go have to go back into like
windows disk manager and format at fat32
here I'll show you it's really simple so
like pull up my computer or your desktop
or wherever you got you my computer you
or my computer god I hate that so right
click and hit manage and then down to
disk management and this is important
because we're gonna have to come and
take a look at this here soon and you'll
notice disc 1 is my roughly 1 gigabyte
fat right here if this were a bigger
drive like for instance my 8 gig micro
Drive where I did this earlier I got the
air and just had to come into here and
format it fat32 so that I can actually
use more than two gigs unlike some
people that accidentally format 40 gig
hard drives is fat and then they only
have a 2 gig partition and they install
Windows and then they'll wonder why they
can't install office point being
make sure the fat32 it for the win so
let's go on to the next step so next we
need two for two in use what's called
grub installer GUI this makes it really
really simple basically grub is the
magic sauce that is making all of this
happen if you're not familiar with grub
you're not from an in Linux and whatnot
land it's basically a beautiful little
boot manager that allows us to do
multiple operating systems and cool
stuff like that you'll notice it if you
dual boot with like Ubuntu or or CentOS
or your favorite distro Slackware for
the one and and you've installed windows
first rather than the other way where
anyway point being we're gonna go ahead
and get our grub on so come down here to
grub install and I will have all of
these links in the show notes so you can
just download this package and what we
want to do is run the GUI and we're
gonna choose disk and we get a little
drop down here and we get HT 0 or HD 1
well let's come over to computer manager
we see disc 0 is my Acer drive and disc
1 is that one gig
sandesh cruiser so we want to make sure
we choose HD 1 I am NOT responsible for
your computer if you totally
accidentally rub it up with this because
you chose wrong things so just you know
make sure all right so we've chosen that
and there is nothing else to check we
basically just click install and there
we go the MBR the Master Boot Record has
been successfully installed so now this
little guy is bootable now there's a
little problem with him though right
there's this little file that is not
quite the one that we want that comes
with the GUI version what we want is to
actually download the grub for DOS
version 0.4 0.4 whatever the latest says
grab it and there's a little file never
called G our LD r-right the grub loader
we're gonna go ahead and grab that and
we want to put that on our drive so
we're gonna go into our removable disk
here and we just need to paste it in
right and then we need one more file so
we're gonna go ahead and create a new
file here and we're gonna call it menu
dot LST and open that with your favorite
text editor and this is where all the
fun stuff is going to happen this is
where we are going to tell grub how to
and what are our different operating
systems that we're going to want to boot
and then later in a bit we are gonna go
ahead and totally customize this and
pimp it out so it's like you know all
yours and stuff so so let's let's give
you an example let's go ahead and just
load up like just two things so that you
know that this works you reboot off of
it and you're like I got two operating
systems on one USB key how cool is
right so for that I'm just gonna go into
my other folder here where I have my
images right so I got a bunch of images
here now what will typically happen when
you have a when you have a bootable like
anything off of bootable USB like if
you've taken the like backtrack three
back check for ice or something and put
it on a USB key with something like
unetbootin you'll notice that you have a
couple of files in there you got your
sis Linux stuff but more importantly you
have a boot folder and you have a like
backtrack for folder right what we need
to do or basically copy those things
those folders onto our USB Drive and we
need to add those to our menu dot list
now I know what you're thinking you're
like what is alright if my backtrack 3
has a boot folder and a backtrack 4 has
a boot folder isn't that gonna be a
problem now cuz we're gonna rename the
folder then we're just gonna go ahead
and change it in the menu to LST it's
all gonna work so that's one way to do
it when it comes to floppy disk images
for example con boot easiest way to get
that going on USB is actually use the
floppy version it's just a matter of
putting the IMG file in there and then
just pointing to with our menu list and
in some cases especially with ophcrack
which is an awesome resource you the
only way to get it really going is to
actually make an off crack USB key and
then extract the stuff out of there if
you're dealing with a lot of Isis stuff
one of the easiest ways to just rather
than burn it to a burn it to a USB or
burn it to a CD and copy over the boot
folder and whatever folders you need are
is to actually just use 7-zip or WinRAR
but 7-zip it's open source an awesome so
you can actually extract that ISO and go
ahead and pull what you need out of it
and trust me I've got a lot more details
in the nitty-gritty in the next segment
and the show notes about what those
nitty gritties are but I wanted to give
you an idea of how to prep the turkey
and what this all is going to entail so
that we can boot up
say hey what I want today time am I
feeling in a backtrack mode or do I need
to you know boot up hyerin's or hilux
cuz you know if something's broken error
I need to figure than that anyway so so
stick around in just a bit we're gonna
take a little break and when we get back
Shannon's gonna be telling us about a
very cool utility that you could also
put on your USB multipass whatever
boutin happiness that will help you with
repairing computers and things that
aren't quite as nefarious as you know
your standard fare Wi-Fi sniffing
passwords cracking hash happiness anyway
we're gonna take a quick break and when
we get back we're gonna get right into

it's 2005 and my boss's PC is fubar I
need to get some files off there and
what do I do that da da da it's a
Knoppix I know that was the district
Royce back then live CD popped it in BAM
little Samba action later I got the
stuff that Explorer just couldn't touch
a lot has changed since then Shannon
there are so many great distributions
built specifically for rescuing dying
computers certainly windows dine
computer so let's go ahead and what's
this distro that you're that you're
falling for right now well one of the
rescue kits that you can use it's called
trinity rescue kit it's basically the
coolest little CPR for your computer
that's either dying or you have some
data that's been completely screwed up
you have a dead harddrive whatever and
you need to get the data off of there
you need to figure out what the
passwords are trinity rescue kit is the
thing that you need to use i had a
little bit of an issue with this i tried
to get in onto a USB using unetbootin
didn't work it couldn't find the
operating system so what i ended up
having to do was install it onto a CD
first and then install it onto a USB
using the trinity rescue kit that was
installed on the CD but this is this is
the case with unetbootin is it's it's
about a 50% of the time it's not always
you know guaranteed turn a CD into a USB
always but it's good that they actually
have a tool built into the operating
system is the same they know that this
problem exists with hate I hear there
are other ways but this way actually you
know if you get a blank CD laying around
it seems pretty dead simple once you get
it going
so but before we get into that tell me
what what is Trinity do for me though
right so what is all sorts of stuff it
has like 20 different things that are
built in it built into it there's a
virus scanner it'll scan all of your
different hard drives there is a we're
kind of you know it uses everything from
clan AV to f-prot to AVG to
bitdefender's so it runs all four of
these at the same time to try to figure
out what kind of viruses that you might
have on your machine after that you can
do file sharing you can basically take
all the fire files that are on that
computer and you know try to figure out
which ones are still good and everything
by transferring them over to another
computer using samba and you can do that
either secured or just by using a guest
guest connection right from what I
understand you'll actually either
connect to like a Samba server like
folder share or just share out all of
the drives on the machine which is quite
convenient when you know you just and
then that's one of those things like
like right from the menu you don't even
have to mess around you just pop the CD
in or in our case USB and I just
selected from from a little boot list I
love that there was also another thing
that I thought was really cool there was
a comment on their website about this
guy who has a bunch of contractors come
in they use their own computers for the
job but half the time they don't
remember what the admin admin password
is on their computer it is yeah I know
well so he has to go in and use trinity
rescue kit to actually figure out what
the admin password is and then he can
reset it so it can also reset password
well I love I love anything that can
reach that capacity I mean this has like
although now it's just convair it did
for the way
yeah thanks anyway so Trinity has like
20 different things that you can do I
mean this is just scratching the surface
I'm still learning everything about it
but it's pretty cool all right so how do
we get this cool tool onto a USB Drive
so they can actually like you know all
right so you plug in your CD and you go
to the default menu which is the trinity
rescue kit three-point-three default and
it runs through everything and you type
in Trk to USB tack d slash dev slash SDA
tack s 900 or 128 whatever 500 whatever
you want that to be okay what this means
yeah I was about to there's a lot of
stuff so I get the Trk to USB the
command kind of says what it does it
takes you're taking trinity rescue kit
you're tuning it into a USB tack d slash
dev slash SDA SDA is the device the
partition that you wanted to use the
thing about this yes you want to use the
USB that's your this is your partition
yeah nan so I was gonna be sta though
yes the problem with this though is we
tried this we tried putting SD a1 and
SDA - you can't put any kind of
partition number at the end of it or
else it'll just go like file error you
can't do that right yeah so it's
basically going to clear the entire USB
key so if you've got stuff on there you
imagine you know yeah whatever these are
make sure that you're putting this onto
your USB and not your hard drive because
that could be really bad for your
computer and it would completely you
know do you fall your purpose for doing
this in the first place I'm trying to
rescue your files but hang on yeah you
didn't need that hard bit now when if
you're running out of these just go to a
trade show seriously all right so what
about the the attack s attack s is the
size that you want to save on the USB
for trinity rescue kit it has to be over
I think it's 128 megabytes because
Trinity takes up 128 it can't be any
more than one gig they suggest keeping
it under one gig just because apparently
one gig will screw up really crappy
bios's there are plenty of them yeah did
not know
so I'm in my 900 and then I just pressed
enter and I let it go through the
routine and eventually it installed
everything onto the USB it does take a
couple of minutes but eventually it does
get on there minute works whoa
I love this alright so we've gone ahead
and we've taken this cool utility CD
over to the usb I say let's take a break
and when we get back we'll take that
same USB Drive and then put it on to our
multi path so we don't have to waste an
entire Drive there whoo I want to let
everybody know that game flood is an
amazing service they are the largest
online video game rental service and

gamefly.com slash pack so in the
previous segment we already prepped the
turkey of you all and actually set this
guy up so that we can boot off grub and
though it got that beautiful little menu
except there's nothing in it it's time
to go ahead and actually populate our
USB Drive with all of our little live
disks and utilities and get them up
there in the menu so how do we do that
well as I mentioned earlier it's just a
matter of copying over the necessary
files and setting the parameters in your
menu LST file so let's take a look at
what we actually have here on my F Drive
so for example my backtrack 4 is
typically and if you would you know take
a backtrack for ISO and actually just
extract it was something like 7-zip
you'll notice that it is basically a
boot and abt 4 and there's a couple
other files but these are the two that
are important now you'll notice that
actually renamed the boot folder to boot
bt4 and that is because I actually have
multiple ones I have boot bt4 I have a
boot off and by the by the time I'm done
with this I'm gonna have a ton of those
so really when it comes down to the menu
it's just a matter of making sure all of
those line up so you know there's my
bt4 and here at the very top there we go
is my backtrack for now I just give it a
title backtrack for and most of these
are just a matter of specifying the
kernel and then an ard to where the
actual image is okay so in this case
just make sure that it's boot bt4 for
some some are really easy like mem test
86 or Daniels boot and nuke especially
if it's a floppy disk image it's just a
matter of copying over that IMG folder
I'm sorry file and then specifying the
kernel and and I will have the
nitty-gritty stuff in the show notes
because it'll vary from thang thing in
fact let me show you an example here
you'll see that mem test 86 and dban
here are just matters of you know these
die mgs of these floppy disk images if
you actually look on the disk it's hey
that's kind of interesting is that 1.44
mag or well one platform AG there we go
yeah con boot this one was kind of a pee
ITA so but but we got that one running
and you know now we can actually get our
konbu lovin on a USB so that's happy
what else we have on here we got an anti
password cracker we got the system
rescue CD free dass off crack off crack
is kind of an interesting one to mention
this is this is a good example of one
where it doesn't it's not as easy as
just extracting the ISO and copying over
the pertinent files this one and a
couple others are like it where you
actually want to use like a I'd say like
a temporary USB Drive where you'll take
this and using the same method that you
would to normally make a USB bootable
Drive you'll go ahead and do that for
the case of off crack there's actually a
tool I forget the name of it it's in my
utils folder it's called Taz USB this
little utility at least in the case of
off crack is what you would use and you
would specify your ISO just like you
would do with unetbootin and then
specify your target and it would
actually build it and it takes forever
but when it's done
you've got a USB key that is bootable it
off crack and then you would actually
just browse to that and then grab the
pertinent files copy them over to your
I'll take best and then set it up in the
menu LST okay
so we've got a ton of goodies here in
our menu file so let's actually go ahead
boot up into this take a look at it and
then we'll get it all customized you
know because we got to it'll be fun
but its skin on it all right so I'm
gluten up my netbook here and you'll see
that I've got my USB harddrive my
SanDisk Cruiser I'm gonna go ahead and
boot off of that and bam there we go we
got this gorgeous little menu and we can
see that I can boot into backtrack fork
on boot mmm test 86'd ban free dass all
the fun utilities and trust me this is
not an exhaustive list and i'm sure you
guys will come up with some more that
you would put on your ultimate USB boot
key awesomeness so you know hit us up on
the forms for that but you know maybe
I'll just go ahead and boot into one of
these show you that that it works all
sweet and stuff and you know BAM crypto
there we go so but what we actually
wanted to do now is get some
customization on so that this thing is
all like you know skinned up for us
something they actually restart this all
right so I'm booting into a bun to here
and they really want to customize my
awesome new USB key with a little bit of
personalization so what better than to
give it a skin a little grub splash
screen let me show you how easy it is
here in Linux with a little Lud
awesomeness right so I got some two
images here I got an f-22 Raptor that I
took a shot of or oh there we go
that's my bike shows that with an sr-71
blackbird let's go ahead and actually
convert this into an image that we can
use with grub now we're gonna actually
have to create a file that's compatible
in this case it's going to be an X p.m.
image I know right whatever that is and
and then we're gonna have to gzip it on
top of that so obscurity for the max to
the win and all that fun stuff
so let's actually just go ahead and
throw up and some some gimp here so I'm
in the GIMP and what I want to do is
actually just go ahead and create a new
image and I'm going to make it 640 by
480 and I also need to open an existing
image that one on my desktop of Josette
and the black bird
and there we go it's all selected so I'm
just gonna go ahead and hit copy come
over to here paste it right in there
maybe position it a little bit better
let's see we got a got a lot of stuff
going on here at 640 by 480 let's see if
I can make this a little bit more
manageable yeah move that up there oh
that looks good
I like that frame all right cool so
there's a couple of things that we have
to do to actually prep this image to
become an X p.m. and what we need to do
is crush these colors down to 14 and all
right so there's gonna be like dithering
and all sorts of crazy stuff going on I
would be doing this in Photoshop but
Photoshop does not like to do X PMS so
you know get some Linux love and on and
we just go to image and mode and indexed
and then we get this a nice little
dialog here where we leave everything as
default except instead of 255 colors nah
let's make that 14 we hit convert and
there we go it looks like a boot screen
from the 90s but hey you know it's our
boot screen from the 9th isn't this
couldn't that just be like a you know
sweet cb7 that 750 awesomeness this
could be you know tux or Jolly Roger
but anyway you'll get creative and I'm
sure we'll see it on the forms but let's
go ahead and save this so file save as
and we want to make sure that we
actually choose dude did you the file
type at the very bottom here X p.m. so
on the desktop I'm gonna call that
Josette whoops X p.m. gonna hit save and
we're going to merge the visible layers
there we go we have our file so I throw
up in a terminal here
and see their tour desktop with a
capital D we can see that we actually
have that Josette xpm file there I would
just need to gzip the xpm file and there
we go and I believe our oh there's our
multi pass and slash media yeah
everything's there so we just need to
copy over our gzip and there it is and
we're just going to CP that so we've CP
it right over to there and then last but
not least we actually have to go back
into that menu file and give it a little
parameter there attached to tell to use
that splash so let's go ahead and I used
by last time let's use Nano and it's
just a matter of saying splash image the
file name XP mgz let's go ahead and save
that out and we are ready to reboot
alright once again we're gonna boot off
of our USB key so I select the cruiser
and now instead of some ugly blue menu
there we go it's my bike yeah I got all
my tools and I'm just I'm on cloud nine
because you know this all worked now I
know we covered a lot of ground here and
you may have some questions so of course
hit us up on the forums and the blog
comments just tweet us or feedback at
hak5 org especially if you have some
suggestions for other tools like you
know obviously you know helix and and
your con boots and your bar Pease but
but if you have some other tools that
you think that we should totally add to
this list let us know we'd love to check
those out but you know that that's uh
that's pretty much it for this for this
go-round but I'd love to hear what you
guys think and I think at this point we
need to take a quick little break and
then wrap this bad boy up

information there and I very much
appreciated it you're very welcome
Shannon I am glad that I could introduce
you to so many complex topics of
computer technologies and now we can
digest it in an easily format that is
podcasting it was so very interesting
but now I must tell you about another
podcast on revision three.com which is
called totally rad show it would be
totally unwise of us to not cross promo
shows on the network as us nothing that
you know TRS they're going over to a
comic-con San Diego comic-con yeah that
was real and they're talking about
everything from comic books to
television to videogames to movies all
sorts of crazy stuff and they are
recording live at revision3.com slash
TRS and they just came out with intro
DVDs you know I and and you know kudos
for keep going

thought that was the blooper but anyway
so we're keep going for this and I just
want to let you know that if you would
like to come out to Williamsburg and
hang out with us in all of our stupid
dorkiness that you have just seen and
yes that's how it is come out on August
15th we are having a meet-up at Busch
Gardens and then afterwards we're going
to some pubs and stuff but it is open
all ages and wild Busch Gardens this
year that's so sad
I know we'll get one of those fun paths
and go the second time or whatever yeah
it's like 60 bucks a head or something
but then the bar part afterwards does
not have a cover if you will although
that does have an age restriction so
you're damned if you do and do it anyway

fun at theme park beer and roller
coasters I'm hacking I love some stuff
