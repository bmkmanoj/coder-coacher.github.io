one of the hosts of hack five thank you
so much for visiting our page at
youtube.com slash hack 5 or hack 5 org

common question that we get is where do
I start we have assembled several
different playlists by topic so you can
easily follow along with a specific
series on your own time so if you
already have a topic in mind such as
software-defined radio which is one of
my favorites you can just click on over
to our playlist and browse for that
series of episodes on YouTube if you are
completely new to our channel and to
hacking in general I would recommend
