bill Adobe patch is a critical flash
vulnerability NIST finally practices
what it preaches on SSL crypto and we
fight back against mass surveillance all
of that and more this time on threat
wire hello and welcome to threat why are
your summary of what's threatening
security privacy Anna our beloved
Internet freedom I'm your host Darren
kitchen and this is our second episode
of the rebooted series where today we
will begin with censorship cnet reports
that turkey approves legislation to
block internet sites bill passed in
parliament that if approved by the
turkish president would allow for the
blocking of any internet site within
four hours of receiving get this a
privacy violation complaint now Turkey
which is a candidate to the European
Union received a lot of flak from
anti-censorship groups in fact a
spokesperson from the EU said that quote
the Turkish public deserves more
information and more transparency not
restrictions and the way I see it this
is just reaffirms my belief that
governments think that they own the
internet and that any attempt to censor
to shut off to manipulate the internet
is an attack on the pillars of what
makes this this whole network great
which is the people all right Adobe on
tuesday issued a security bulletin with
an update to its flash player the update
addresses a critical vulnerability that
could potentially allow an attacker to
remotely take control of an affected
system via patch prize to flash player
versions 12 point 0 0 for 3 on Windows
and Mac as well as 11.2 202 335 on Linux
you can actually check what version of
flash you're running over at adobe com /
software / flash / about and if you're
using IE 10 and above or chrome the
plugin is updated automatically original
Institute of Standards and Technology or
NIST made a special publication in
January 2011 disallowing the use of
sha-1 algorithm for digital signature
generation in SSL Certificates after
2013 so if you haven't noticed it's
actually 2014 now and netcraft is
reporting that the ssl certificate for
nest gov isn't
act using the deprecated sha-1 hashing
algorithm now the certificate was
actually issued by verisign on the
twenty-third of January it's really easy
to poke fun at NIST I mean they've been
getting a lot of flak amongst hackers
for having allowed the NSA to influence
its random number generators and
certified crypto functions but being
said this story's a little bit scarier
according to netcraft nearly ninety
eight percent of all ssl certificates
are using sha-1 the fear here is that a
practical attack against Shaw one is
estimated to cost according to Bruce
Schneier a mere 700 thousand dollars
next year that means a well funded
organization or government could
impersonate any https website so don't
expect that little lock icon to be
protecting you of a man-in-the-middle
attack for long if things don't change
now the shot to family of hashing
functions which replaces sha-1 it is
much more secure was published back in
two thousand one but it still only
accounts for 1.86 percent of SSL
certificates now to be fair since the
story broke yesterday miss actually
upgraded their certificate though not on
all of their domains and I too am guilty
of using the week algorithm on act 5
dark so I know I will be shopping for a
new search soon the day is coming to
fight back against mass surveillance
really it is the mass protest backed by
the likes of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation reddit the ACLU demand
progress Greenpeace Mozilla and at the
time of recording some 4257 others has
been scheduled for februari 11th now it
is the website the day we fight back org
where it states quote in January 2012 we
defeated the SOPA and PIPA censorship
legislation with the largest internet
protest in history today we faced
another critical threat that once again
undermines the internet and the notion
that any of us live in a genuinely free
society mass surveillance so the protest
celebrates the win against PIPA and SOPA
and it also is in memory of the hacker
hero who led those fights Aaron Schwartz
so here's what will go down on the 11th
I mean aside from my birthday if you're
in the United States prepared to see a
lot
of take action banners on websites
urging you to contact your legislators
if you're a website operator you can
actually get the JavaScript to add just
to run just at the end of your HTML
right before the body tag closing that
JavaScript will look like this and it
automatically goes live at midnight
Eastern on the 11th now if you're not in
the US you'll be urged to contact the
appropriate parties regarding your
privacy but furthermore you're urged to
get the word out on social media you
know change your profile picture join
the conversation on Reddit and otherwise
you know band together against the nasty
is evil to ever grace our internet and
all peoples fundamental human right of
expression kind of feel seriously about
that one yeah our comment of the week
comes from Jeremy who wrote quote I
think the community and people in
general need to understand the Aaron
Schwartz could have been any of us the
law is very vague and therefore very
open to interpretation even normal use
of the internet could be considered a
violation of the law Vic they clearly
made an example out of him regardless of
what you think what he did was right or
wrong he was fighting for all internet
users remember that now there was also a
comment that I believe deserves a little
attention it was from Ken who wrote
quote and you push Google+ without
blushing guess I do threat wire was
actually started as a YouTube commission
showed through discovery digital /
revision3 and at the time while I mean
YouTube and Google+ are kind of merging
into one so it made a little bit of
sense there but now with this reboot
there's really an opportunity to do a
proper RSS video feed and you know to
continue this conversation on anywhere
so I guess my question for you this week
is where would you take your ball and
play I mean reddit the hak5 forums a
decentralized social network like
diaspora or friend akka or hey how about
a telnet BBS I want to hear your ideas
let me know in the comments and remember
you can subscribe at threat wire org and
get involved with the community
currently a Google+ where the
conversation goes on all week that's
where I found out about some great
stories like the one about the FBI's RFQ
to buy your mouth way
error or how the GCHQ targeted Anonymous
hackers with DDoS attacks yay so anyway
mad props to Mike be and marm sorry Mike
m and Steve be for those contributions
and with that i'm darren kitchen i'll
see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
