comments on email encryption and webmail
this segment of hak5 is brought to you
by teeth like Darren mentioned back at
the beginning of the show we have gotten
a lot of emails about PGP yeah and
you've also gotten a lot of text
messages about this apparently gave out
your phone numbers yeah that's what i
did with hack across America if you've
been watching a video blog series you
know that I've been having text
conversations with awesome people about
really cool cerebral stuff and that's
why I love this that is kind of cool my
phone abroad they like those general
well I did just get a work phone so I
could give out that one if I really
wanted to or you could just call her her
phone numbers 5 10 8 65 I'm don't even
know that's nice well you started
getting there oh really yeah it is 510
haha see war dial and a hundred thousand
phone numbers you could be on the black
Shannon so let's go ahead and start it
off with a text that you got on that
phone it said the problem and this was
from somebody in Virginia apparently the
problem with PGP is that I can't get
anyone else to use it and needs to be
built into gmail and transparent to the
user and I yeah I absolutely gotta be
easy and wholeheartedly agree what if
we've been talking about the fact that
security and privacy is not convenient
and this is one of those things where as
we've talked about with this extension
it's not rocket science practically
speaking this is really easy to do this
technology has been around for 20 years
so why is it not implemented in every
except every single mail server that we
could ever have think about this with
like gmail is an example perhaps how do
we get gmail for free well because
google sells ads against it yeah you get
that email about that wedding and then
suddenly on little right hand side you
get think it stuff about weddings all
the time and I'm like hmm they're
reading your ok except look at your GP g
emails or sorry PGP emails what do those
guys look like Uncle not roll on Gotham
that's me reading a pgp email to the one
there they don't know what kind of adds
to sell to you know yeah they don't know
what to sell they can't sell ads yeah if
you really want to get tin foil hat to
you could just be like oh you know
their privacy and the government and the
emails and it's not in there Deborah
yeah they're not the corporate best
interest or who knows what else happens
behind closed doors what yes that is the
problem is chicken and egg thing so what
we have to do is be eggs or chickens
that's right I said be a chicken I'm not
sure which one came first but we need to
be the one that does yeah we can start
we can start a trend it'll be the new
popular trend is oh you don't have PGP
oh dude oh are you all of my tweets now
are in aes-128 so we also got a lot of
text that said and emails that say
things like the problem with key servers
as spammers harvest your email address
form from them problem with key servers
is that you can't verify the
authenticity of the key is you can't
remove your key everything ok so those
are all legitimate concerns when it
comes to key servers same kind of
concerns with like guest books and
anywhere else do you put your key or
atari nike but your email address
publicly yeah I've heard some
interesting solutions about having like
CSVs emailed to you with the public key
of the person and the things and then oh
that's even more complication to the
matter so yes BAM is a reality it to be
honest I feel like span was kind of
dealt with or at least I I don't know I
used like a system of white listing and
priority stuff and a lot of heuristics
in any way I also rely on gmail heavily
for that stuff the new damn good job so
it absolutely is an issue and but
without it you have to deal with the
whole key exchange issue so again this
is a prime example of convenience and
then like privacy and security just it's
a balancing act the problem with key
servers is that you can't easily remove
your key if you go to the MIT one I
tried to do this cuz I think i showed my
keeper d kitchenette hak5 better which
is not my email it's just an alias I use
when they sign up for stuff and I need
some throw away but anyway i created a
pgp key for that when i was testing out
some software and that was just with a
1024 bit key so as you can imagine there
since all of the different key servers
replicate yeah there's no real easy way
for me
to send an issue over to since anyone
can publish a key in there what's to say
what's the authentication mechanism for
removing the key and the key savera MIT
does have a mechanism for doing that if
you do a revocation certificate which is
not really you still need your private
key to create this this certificate okay
but you can't do that from melville op'
and even if you were to do that it would
only remove it from that key server it
is propagated just like DNS propagates
through out the internet to the other
key servers oh yes that's that okay that
is a problem because then somebody gets
your old key and maybe you lost your
private cater no longer you're using it
this is why expirations are good when it
comes to keys I don't have perfect
solution there oh yeah there's no
residing touch on that insect there was
another one about how you can't verify
the authenticity because anybody can
publish a key to the key server so i
could put true i could put in accra
org this is her key right but totally is
made up heat yeah well sure except she's
not gonna be able to decode the message
yeah cuz she doesn't have the other half
of that key and I mean I guess unless
you're intercepting that message in
which case Bob's your uncle but the way
that I see it I think that's taken care
of by signing and we can talk about
signing in a bit here but unfortunately
it's totally not supported by Melville
Oh like I said this yeah so didn't you
say you had a problem with millville
open I've analyzed yeah in fact actually
I'm having the better luck now with it
if I just keep refreshing my gmail page
when I open a pgp message just means
heading a thousand times time it is a
bit annoying this is why I've moved to a
nig meal with under bird and we're gonna
get into that here in a bit cuz it's not
as complicated as a sound that sounds
fine and there is something really nice
and something to be said about owning
your mail on your computer and not in
somebody else's server but who knows
what stories coyotes are done with these
webmail providers anyways so ultimately
what are you need to run your own mail
server on your own VPS or something and
then that any question mean it's yes
provider so one it's convenient to
security and then the other is
eventually you have to trust someone
trust no one well then you're not gonna
have very many
friends that's true now we also got a
very long email from Saul he wrote in
with a link to the complete guide to
publishing PGP keys in DNS we should
have that in the show notes yes good
stuff yes definitely now details how
keys can be published via dns server
eliminating the need for key servers
Saul says personally as I don't roll my
own DNS I used a pique pique a record
method as it's all I can fit in the txt
record and then point to the URI of my
MIT public key of course this is just
because my public key is already held
there I've previously had the URI point
to public keys SAT either on my website
and even in my dropbox public folder
although I didn't like the link between
me and my Dropbox ID being obvious so
soon dropped this idea pointing to MIT
is the nicest I feel I think the idea of
trying a key tying a key to your email
address via dns is very elegant his
services like Melville op' ever
implemented automatic look up of public
he's in the DNS based on your intended
recipients it would be it would really
make PGP accessible security concerns
aside of course but if you can't trust
your DNS records to have your real
public key you probably can't trust them
to control your MX records so yeah and
this is the same thing it's like you're
mitigating trust and ultimately I mean
what you're talking about is really cool
however I am feeling like the discussion
about you know why isn't this just built
into gmail if it's that simple is you
know is Google going to go ahead and
allow give everyone a txt record or a
DNS record for their PGP kiss as well it
just doesn't seem feasible this is great
for us that roller owns say like you
know I'm actually Darren a hack five org
but I've got this gmail account yeah um
you know it's great for Darren hak5 dot
org and I did the same thing like you
were talking about you just put it up on
you know hak5 org slash key / Darren
yeah / q / Shannon we could do Shannon
hak5 org make it a txt record and that
does a decent job of you know verifying
the validity of that key because you'd
need to be the webmaster didn't you say
webmaster its 1998 and I said webmaster
however hello geocities yes
thank you for sending that in and check
out that article it's really interesting
and that is definitely one I love that
this is creating so much discussion
amongst oh yeah there's these kinds of
conversation without like right before
air just got one this guy is working on
this Python script to create a pgp based
Twitter thing using cool been another
quick out wicked hot stuff so yes well
alright our next one comes from Michael
he says I love the idea of this PGP and
would be fully interested in doing this
however I need to be able to access my
email on my android phone this is a good
one he said my dad is stuck on Internet
explorer he doesn't like firefox or
chrome is there any kind of webmail PGP
for IE well there are some webmail
providers that claim to support PGP on
the Rendon basically the private key is
held on their server and all of the
stuff happens in the cloud as it were
I'm personally more of a fan of a non
hoods on hosted solution and we're going
to be touching on some of this stuff I'm
not even gonna mention any of these
service providers because I don't think
that is a right way to go I mean again
talking about getting trust and all of
that it's just like a VPN Anjali you're
just moving you're just offsetting the
security to another exit point or
whatever have you so um no okay there's
unfortunately this is the why we need to
become chickens if there is there's no
good answer for your dad unfortunately
and to answer your question about
Android it's k-9 mail and AGP which
haven't been updated so well k-9 mail
has been but a GP hasn't been updated
since 2010 it is open source and we're
gonna be talking about how to set that
up and trying to find cool concise I
could see that I made a right Nixon yes
that's also that's the idea they're just
trying to make it as convenient as
possible yeah I hope so yes it's ready
for a techno last photo of the week I am
so ready for this one it comes from oron
he said here's a picture of some of my
home set up he has an awesome set up i
love the quad monitors he said a windows
seven quad screen system flanked by a
pair of max Oh max
I have to use those for work and they
drive me nuts now having the 3840 x 2160
is great for the search and rescue map
work idea I do when I'm volunteering for
the civil air search and rescue
association the CAS ara I think that's
totally awesome that he volunteers for
something like that that's excellent
that sounds like a wicked use of
technology oh I totally thanks for
sending in your technol us you can do
the same thing by emailing photos to
feedback at hak5 org we can tweet him at
us to yeah raw trivia last week's trivia
question was what is the true statement
regarding WEP cracking initialization
vectors are small or are they large they
get reused frequently and are sent and
clear text or are they sent and
encrypted during in transmission and the
answer was Ivy's are small they get
reused frequently and they are sent in
clear text what's the problem huh yeah
what's your take on that you got to
collect them all they're like Pokemon to
get all the IDS cracky cracky that's
awesome yeah it's good to know as well
now this week's question is what is
another term for turning off the SSID
broadcast you can answer that over at
hak5 org slash trivia for your chance to
win some schwag I have a feeling and
drag on in kismet would know they
probably do we'll be back after this
quick break you guys know how I feel
about the mobile phone experience it's
so cluttered and confusing all these
powerlessness you basically at the mercy
of these phone companies who have these
plans riddled with you no hidden fees
and steep penalties arbitrary rules I
couldn't care less about them however I
have just found an awesome phone
companies trust me for as a former phone
freak it warms my heart to say this
because it's run by a bunch of cool
geeks they're frustrated with the status
quo and they did something about it it's
called ting and they're a new service
that brings clarity usability and huge
savings to the mobile phone network it's
so cool because they've built it on the
sprint 4G network so as Scott you know
it's the first time vno with LTE devices
it's got awesome android phones i have 6
10 devices now amazing customer service
like you call them and they literally
just answer the phone you call and boom
my sister switched over i've switched
over all of my friends are switching
over it's really the greatest
and so I just love this I'm so
passionate about this because they're
actually doing something innovative let
me tell you about this they're one
simple plan that offers fair and honest
pricing that's what I love megabyte
minutes and messages are all billed
separately so if you use less than you
expected well then you're credited the
difference and if you use more than you
simply build the appropriate amount
there's no premiums and penalties so get
this hak5 10.com this is a special
website they've set up they've got an
online calculator there where you can
already see how much savings you're
going to get plus if you go there just
as a hak5 viewer you're going to get
twenty five dollars off most ting
devices or twenty-five dollars towards
ting service just for being a hak5
viewer and you know i have to thank them
because i mean i just picked up another
ting phone another i have six now this
one's going in the van on hack across
America to power our gps tracking it's
just so simple with ting so check it out
at hak5 encom also we'd like to tell you
that we value your feedback every last
comment gets read feedback a hack 5-door
