attacks the IRS announces new breach
numbers and Microsoft is on a disabling
rampage all that coming up now on threat
wire hello world I'm Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for August 19 2015
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
thanks for joining us for another
episode let's get right to the top
stories utorrent main line views all
BitTorrent applications used to host and
see download files from person to person
well it turns out they're also the host
of a new denial of service attack
specifically a distributed reflective
denial of service attack or a dr d OS
for short announced by a group of
researchers in a paper called p2p
file-sharing in hell this attack lets
one user of the software send malformed
requests to another BitTorrent user that
requested data floods a third-party
target with data from fifty to one
hundred and twenty times larger in size
these really big packets of data flying
into a victim's machine go way too fast
and the machine basically passes out the
underlying problem is with UDP or user
Datagram protocol which has no way of
preventing fake IP addresses this lets
the attacker change their IP address and
flood a victim's computer with requests
that look like they are actually real
now by using this drdo s attack it hides
the attacker it can be attempted by only
one machine and the requests end up
being up to that 120 times larger at
most now while this isn't necessarily
new the researchers recommend anti
spoofing filtering techniques a
three-way handshake such as TCP instead
of UDP which doesn't use that in
requiring a special token of data to
keep an attacker from adding other peers
in the application back in May we
learned of a really big IRS breach to
their get transcript system which a user
can create an account on to gain access
to their tax returns and a bunch of
other information that the IRS has at
the time it was thought that over
114,000 households probably had their
information stolen now that number is
looking more like 300,000 with 600
thousands suspicious attempts made which
means that criminals had a fifty percent
success rate via the get transcript
website that's kind of huge all they had
to know was a person's name the birth
date social security number their tax
filing status which basically is on
facebook and their address unfortunately
with all the breaches that have been
happening in the past few years that
information is not hard to come by the
IRS took down the online site to sign up
but you can still receive two current a
transcript by mail with the same
information meaning that if a thief
really wanted to they could still steal
your information credit protection will
be offered to expose taxpayers according
to the IRS sadly though this hack is not
over they're still investigating it and
it's ongoing it could be much worse you
may want to wait on upgrading to Windows
10 if you're using counterfeit software
or hardware according to the US section
7 B quote sometimes you'll need software
updates to keep using the services we
may automatically check your version of
the software and download software
updates or configuration changes
including those that prevent you from
accessing the services playing
counterfeit games or using unauthorized
hardware peripheral devices so basically
when you turn on Cortana you've accepted
that EULA in Windows 10 and while I
understand what counterfeit games are
that's so horrible what is unauthorized
Hardware peripheral devices is that like
non Microsoft Certified xbox controllers
I mean I'm all for catching thieves but
I'm not too keen on how much scanning
they're going to be doing on my own
system to thwart other criminals lastly
I wanted to mention a couple of other
stories that hit the news just now first
the Ashley Madison breach of data has
been posted online totaling nine point
seven gigabytes in size with about 32
million users information being made
public and second the Wi-Fi service
provider smart city holdings has agreed
to pay the FCC 750 thousand dollars for
blocking personal cell phone data plans
while people use convention centers for
cons and trade shows this comes months
after a similar lawsuit against Marriott
for doing a simmer a similar block of
their hotel conference areas and finally
remember when
target got hacked I'm pretty sure we all
remember that well target now has to
cough up about 67 million dollars or up
to that amount to visa on behalf of
credit card issuers on that brand and
mastercard strikes a similar deal as
well now this reminds me kind of a when
I worked as a merchant payment system
company I worked out wine and I would
always tell merchants it caused a lot
less to upgrade to better security than
it does to actually get fine by Visa and
MasterCard to her story now check out
our patreon page to find out how you can
help us keep the show coming ad free and
completely independent we might even
throw in some cats and dogs like these
ones for good measure because we love
these guys and they're freaking adorable
so thank you to all you that find value
in threat wire and contribute to its
sysex success especially those guys
patreon com for that and of course
liking the show subscribing I'm sure
there's a subscribe button around here
somewhere if you're watching on YouTube
all that is very important to to get the
word out go to threat wire net for all
the things and with that I'm Shannon
Morse and i will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
