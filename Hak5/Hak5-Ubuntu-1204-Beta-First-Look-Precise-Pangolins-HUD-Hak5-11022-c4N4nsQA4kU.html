by domain.com all right welcome to the
future time traveler and this time you
may have had like a another vodka and
redbull or another coffee or whatever
but finally our backtrack 5 installation
is finished we've got this screen up
installation complete but before we're
ready to restart we've got a few things
we got to take care of so click continue
testing now our first item of importance
is that we just installed grub on to dev
sdb or whatever USB devices but that's
the same place where we grabbed our
bites for our key file right so it's
quite possible that some of those bites
may have changed especially if you were
grabbing bites at the very beginning of
the device so while we're at it let's
just rerun our key derivation algorithm
if you want to call it that I guess
black size one count with 64 offset was
32 skip sorry it's 32 and we'll call
this one second key ok so we copy our 64
bytes out let's do a sha-1 some and see
if they're different it looks like they
are okay not a big deal because we've
been using Lux and Lux is awesome
because there's this flexibility where
you can have multiple keys that decrypt
the same encrypted content so we're
going to do crib set up again dash D for
our key file and remember we had our
first key that was the first one that we
used so we're going to be specifying
that as our key file to do the original
unlock and we're going to be using the
command lux add key again our target is
dev sda1 and our new key file is going
to be second key now this is important
because if we try to go back and like
boot the system and use our USB device
with the same key creation process we
get a different key we wouldn't be able
to decrypt our backtrack 5 install so
we've just added our new key file and we
should be almost ready to roll let's do
a couple more items while we're at it
alright let's make some mount points so
we're going to do make door / mount will
do hack top and let's mount a dev mapper
hack top on this new mount point
mount hack top and then roll mount our
USB device partition dev sdb one in this
case on mount hack top boot and we are
ready to change route into our new
backtrack 5 environment alright so you
can notice that the that the prompts
changed this means we're working inside
of our backtrack 5 installed environment
instead of the live environment now
let's go ahead and mount our proc and
sis FS file systems because we're going
to be running update in a tram FS and
updating the unit ramdisk and we want to
make sure that those boot and subsequent
foods are those load and subsequent
foods so we have two files to edit the
first one that we're going to do is at
secret tab oh and while we're at it we
need to get our block ID in a new tab if
you haven't if you didn't do this before
because I didn't do it before we need to
get the grid of our target partition so
that's def sda1 so we use this block ID
program and we get our grid here of dev
sda1 and we kick back over and we do our
target name which was hack top our
source device is dev disk by uuid and
then our grid key file is going to be
none because we'll be driving our key
file at boot time and options are going
to be lux because that's what we're
using lastly we just need to edit the FS
tab direct our file we don't need our
floppy so you can delete that line if
you don't need it and instead of the
grid what we're going to be doing is
just specifying a generic device this
allows you in the future to use another
USB Drive if you lose your original and
you have a backup stored somewhere or
for whatever other reasons but so we
just enter our dev sdb one as being our
device that has our boot partition on it
so at this point we're pretty much set
up and ready to roll if you're on VMware
going to hold and use an alternate boot
manager to be able to boot off the USB
device but if you're using bare metal
you won't need to do any of that just
make sure that you go into bios or UEFI
and set your USB device to boot at a
higher priority than your hard drive and
you should be good to go so we're going
to help and we'll be back in just a
moment if you're in VMware like i'm
using i'm using plop to be able to boot
boot from a USB device so you just set
your plop I so as your cd-rom drive and
select your USB device and we will soon
be booting off of our boot partition
that we installed to our removable media
fingers crossed if everything is working
out well you should start seeing like
Linux diagnostic stuff booting up right
like it's all the all the messages that
you've seen d message everything's
loading it's looking good so far but
then all of a sudden we get this like
splash screen with our backtrack 5
wallpaper and nothing's happening so
what's actually going on is outside of
our site right now so we're going to
kill X real quick to do that it's just
ctrl alt backspace it'll drop you to the
console oh there goes okay cool you hit
ctrl alt backspace it kills X and then
it drops you back to the console if it
starts prompting for a passphrase just
do ctrl C until it drops you into
busybox in this case it dropped me
directly into busybox which normally
doesn't happen so i'm not sure why so
we'll see what happens but anyways once
you're in busybox you can do your key
derivation algorithm again so we're
doing we're going to do a DD and again
blocks faces one count is 64 in the
offset skip his 32 and then we are ready
to write that out to a file so we
grabbed our 64 bytes we do our crib set
up Lux open again is the command that we
did earlier dev sda1 is our target
partition and then our our map target is
hack top so if everything goes well the
key slot should unlock
which you may or may not getting morning
because like if you do this in a boon to
the newer versions they don't give you
like a like the the key slot unlock they
don't give you any message about that
but they just drop you directly into the
shell and there's like no complaint in
this case we do see that the key slot
one was unlocked and once you're back
into your busy box shell at the prompt
you can just do ctrl D and that will
bail out of the shell and run you
straight into your boot process so in a
moment however long depending on how
fast your laptop is mines on the fastest
it will continue booting the backtrack
environment and you are ready to go
there we are there's our backtrack log
in route and tour obviously as the
default and if we start X BAM there we
are so now we are inside of our
backtrack 5 environment that we
installed to our target hard drive or
solid-state drive or whatever dev sda1
but the partition is encrypted I mean
we've decrypted it now but it's
encrypted at rest so it's pretty cool
like that is your encrypted route
installed with backtrack 5 have any
questions like because it's kind of a
long process and obviously you can get
hung up somewhere definitely go back and
pause and you know make sure all the
steps were followed step by step but
like feel free to hit me up online like
I'm more than happy to help out this is

boo to 12.04 LTS called precise pangolin
will be releasing on April 26 with the
official beta releasing tomorrow on
march first and because of this we
decided to get a first look at the new
OS updates now this version is LTS
long-term support so we're going to be
seeing updates for it for a while man
while now which means that it's a really
good option for you guys that need it
for work purposes there have been some
modest improvements on the back end with
some features like the update from linux
kernel three point 0 to 3.2 and some
built-in updates so let's see we got
rollout t all right yep three point two
point oh awesome brand new update to the
colonel i know a lot of you guys were
excited about that rhythmbox is the
music player of choice and then there's
firefox thunderbird libreoffice they've
all been updated and included in the
download package there's also been a few
small updates to unity the slide-out
left hand tool bar isn't as annoying and
I downloaded my unity to add some
customization to the GUI that's pretty
cool thing to check out on my unity I
ran into a slight problem when playing
when you with unity where comp is
crashed as I was going through the
quickness which by the way they can be
selected with one right click now so you
just hover and click you have this nice
nice side bar over here very very useful
for anybody who would need that kind of
stuff hopefully compiz won't be as buggy
when the beta officially releases of
course this is just a daily build that
I'm testing after all so I figure
they'll fix that by then my favorite
cheat change and oh my god I was so
excited about this my broadcom wireless
adapter yeah I know it's a broadcom but
you know it's what came with my computer
so I had to deal with it it works it
just works it works right out of the
gate I didn't have to go into the
command line and do any kind of wacky
crazy stuff that Darren usually does it
magically downloaded the drivers and
connected to my local wireless router in
seconds no need for an Ethernet cable
and I considered it completely awesome I
mean
it's using a non open source driver but
hey religion aside it's really good to
see that it's just working that's
awesome so that's definitely like a plus
10 for me now on to the big name for 12
point 0 for the HUD HUD stands for
head-up display and it was announced by
Mark Shuttleworth on his blog here's the
idea we're all used to menus and
toolbars and whatnot they've been around
since the dawn of computers they've just
gotten shinier and more colorful yay and
we're all used to them you always find
the same menu options in all of your
programs in the same place you can
generally find what you want just from
experience you know file save as it's
always there but sometimes men you suck
you have to use your mouse and if you
get into the nested menus and click the
wrong thing you have to go back through
all of the sudden menus to find what you
need that happens to me all the time and
bookmarks for example and you know what
you need it's just a pain in the butt to
get there also I'm not a fan of hot keys
yeah I could I know I can never remember
them and I know it's frustrating for
Darren one other ever I'm learning
something new and I'm using my mouse to
get through everything yeah I know it
takes a while sorry Darren it's cool man
so while he's standing over there and
saying like oh just hit ctrl shift
escape alt f2 and there you have it i'm
sitting over here with my mouse going
through everything and yeah it takes
forever I know so yeah we need some new
innovation I'll bite this isn't
completely innovative with voice
commands and search menus that we
currently have in the world but it is
something that we've been waiting a
while for whether you note it or not I
know a lot of people hate change I mean
no one liked unity when it came out so
canonical might have an issue getting
users to use and like the new HUD the
head-up display for myself though
someone who hasn't really fallen
completely in love with any kind of
version of Linux yet I think it's
beautiful and it's fast and shiny and
new I mean I welcome the new HUD
overlord why not other than they would
be an overlord not too good huh so
what's it look like might as well show
you huh just hit all while you're in
some kind of standard Ubuntu app for
example I'll go into Firefox right now
and hit alt you can use either the left
or the right all it does not matter and
you pull up this very cool little search
bar thing up that the top top and you
can type in any kind of word that you
would generally find in the toolbar for
example save or print open or quit I'll
type and save and it takes me to view
file messages clear Boone 21 and set up
mail I could also type in New it'll give
me these different ideas create new
wireless network
okay so here's a good one file i typed
in tab because i wanted a new tab and it
gives me new tab then i can just arrow
up and down and click enter to bring up
my new tab very easy you'll get this
looked list of options its most likely
something that you wanted and you choose
the one that you need and you're done
it's much faster than navigating to the
file menu with the mouse and here's
something cool it can actually learn
what you usually do so it'll prioritize
your list by the things you'll Okla most
likely use for example i was using mine
earlier to cut off my new wireless
network up here at all and when i hit
alt and i typed in something for firefox
it automatically thought maybe i'm
considering something in the in the
navigation menu for wireless settings so
it brought me there kind of neat so i
can see how this HUD is going to be a
great idea i think it still needs a
little bit of tweaking for example i
like to choose clothes to close out of a
program but i had to type and quit
because it had no clue what i wanted to
do when i type in clothes so a couple of
extra definitions that I think need to
be added and I think it's just still
know what you know closing a window or
program is it's an intuitive and a smart
improvement and I would love to see
something like this become the norm
maybe even making the normal toolbar
completely disappear and give me more
real estate on my screen which would be
awesome i'm always looking for more real
estate on my screen any kind of update
that makes me my productivity faster and
easier is a-okay with me oh and if you
don't like it you just don't press the
Alt key I know it's built in and a lot
of people probably won't like it and
they'll say oh I don't like that unity
and now this HUD what the heck is that
so just don't press alt it's okay and
have you tried ubuntu 12.04 LTS yet what
do you think of the newly released
head-up display and updates to the OS in
general make sure you guys tell me about
it in the feedback at hak5 org email or
you can comment in the section below
coming up soon we'll be answering your
viewer questions but first I'm going to
play with this we're going to take a
break and then check in with Darren for
the nibble
time once again for the nipple and this
week I thought I'd show you something
that I just learned was said that is
going to make your life so much easier
when it comes to sorting and stuff and
here let's just dive right into it i've
got a karma log here and as you can see
karma is enabled and then I've got all
these other associations well that's
great but I wanted this to be backwards
upside down and want to enabled at the
bottom and all the latest stuff to be at
the very top right and well I could do
it done it with a little JavaScript I
like doing stuff with bash and check
this out if I cat this and pipe it into
sort I can sort this and I want it to be
in Reverse a sort tack are unfortunately
it groups everything together and as you
can see that's not what I wanted but
with a little bit of said and yes you
can do this with awk it's just a lot
more CPU intensive if I pipe this over
to said and it's one bang capital G
semicolon lowercase H semi colon dollar
bang lowercase D I now have it backwards
this is enabled at the bottom instead of
enabled at the top I know it's fun it's
fashion it's what I've been doing for
weeks and weeks and weeks and if you've
got fun commands and tools and nuggets
to send over to us over the hak5 that
organizing nibbles share us your four
bits I know Shannon loves hooking up
people with all sorts of hacked by
abstract person in those by and now
we'll be back in just a second we're
already here I don't know where we are
let's do the thing ball</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
