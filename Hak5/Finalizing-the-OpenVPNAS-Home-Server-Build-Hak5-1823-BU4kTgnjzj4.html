well as setting up Auto Start servers in
Zen server and your thoughts on China
and OpenVPN it's gonna be great
checked out attack 5 this episode of
hack 5 is brought to you by domain.com
hello welcome to hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen and it is your weekly
dose of Technol us thats kirby she is
co-hosting with me today because Shannon
is out on vacation or maybe she's not
maybe it's cat 5 now I'm not really sure
10 years it's really really bad ok so
what we're gonna do here today is we're
going to follow up on our quick and
dirty OpenVPN guide that we started last
week and do the final setup to get your
machine online and accessible from
outside your land and essentially what
we're gonna have to do is three basic
steps first we need to set a static IP
address on the server second since we're
doing this in a virtual machine and if
you've been following along with our
series on that we're using Zen we need
to set up this virtual machine to start
up automatically whenever the hypervisor
or in this case it's an intel milk boots
up and then finally third we need to do
some port forwarding so let's just go
ahead and dive right in the static IP
address set up is pretty simple let's go
ahead and ssh into hack five at what was
it 10 73 31 to 40 believe was that box
and this is an Ubuntu 1404 TLS or LTS
good stuff and basically if we do an if
config we can see here we have an IP
address on our land of yeah there but we
this is only dynamic so I can find that
out by saying sudo nano there's a file
in slash Etsy under network called
interfaces and I can see here that it is
I face f0i net DHCP so all we really
have to do is go ahead and change that
to ein it's static and then specify the
address the gateway and the net mask so
in this case I'm just going to go ahead
and change that static and say address
1070 331 I'm gonna leave it as what it
is right now too
I know nothing else is on it netmask in
this case we're on a slash 24 so it's
255 255 255 dot zero and gateway 1070
331 1 is our gateway here I'm going to
go ahead and save that file exit out of
there and Bob's your uncle so the next
thing is since this is a virtual machine
we do want it to boot every time this
nook comes online and we're gonna set up
this nook so that you know on the event
of a power failure if it reboots the
hypervisor starts up and then the
hypervisor will go ahead and start up in
this case that Ubuntu server that we
were just ssh tin to and we will
probably also want to do that as well
for zen orchestra so that we can also do
the web management stuff but thankfully
right now there's nothing that requires
going into that web management because
our servers are running so in that case
let's go ahead and ssh over to our of
our in this case let me open a new term
it'll make that much bigger for you to
see ah
XenServer which is root at one I see 10
73 31 one five two in my case that looks
good and there we go we are now on the
Zen box and we can actually go ahead if
we want we can actually type X s console
and get the same console that we would
have otherwise got if we had the
physical access to that box so this is a
really nice feature of Zen server
because i mean it's it's linux right so
what we need to do in order to set this
virtual machine up so that it will boot
on startup is we need to first determine
the UUID of our server or our pool in
this case we only have one server in the
pool so there you go and then we need to
go ahead and enable auto starting
capabilities which is turn off by
default in 6.5 version of Zen Center but
it's pretty easy to re-enable so let's
determine the UUID of our pool or our
server with the XE pool - list command
and we can see it right here I'm going
to go ahead and get that guy in my
clipboard and then the next thing to do
is actually just to go ahead and say let
it node it can auto start which is X e
pool we're setting a pool parameter
/ am and then we set our UUID of the
pool we're talking about in this case
there we go
actually there needs to be an equal sign
right here so i knows what it's equal to
and then we also have to say other -
config : Auto underscore power on equals
true now I messed that up by it needs to
be pool pram set and then UUID equals
there we go so now we just do something
very similar except for our virtual
machine this time instead of the actual
server or the pool and that is to begin
with an x e vm - list and we can see
here are all of the different servers
running on this machine and the one that
I'm interested in is this one here
called Open VPN so go ahead and grab
into my clipboard
it's UUID and go ahead and do a very
similar command in this case it's X II
VM - / Ram
- set and then UUID
equals and then go ahead and give it
that you UID and then again other -
config : Auto underscore power on equals
true so there we go we've gotten had
instead of static IP address for our
Ubuntu server so it'll always have that
next time it reboots and next time the
virtual server reboots so that virtual
machine so there we go the last part now
is to actually go ahead and open up the
port's that we need on our firewall so
that everybody is all happy and we can
get access to our land through this VPN
over the Internet now to do that let's
go ahead and take a look at our Open VPN
and just like last time go ahead and log
in there and you'll notice there's a few
ports that we need to go ahead and open
up first of all is 943 obviously because
I'm connected to it over port 943 it's
not like a regular web server that would
be listening on port 80 if I go there
well actually it is it's listening on 80
fancy that well we could do 80 as well
but or 943
you just don't do the slash admin and
you get the same thing so go ahead and
make note of that and then the other
ports for our VPN connections are TCP
443 our standard ssl port and UDP 1194
now I'm gonna go ahead and just leave it
at that because essentially this
configuration is going to go ahead and
change depending on what router you use
and I'm pretty sure you're not using the
crazy esoteric link bonding one that
we're not using here so it really
doesn't move me to walk you through the
steps on our end here but you know
whatever router you're using at home let
us know your favorite celeste saw a lot
of awesome comments about PF sense and
all sorts of good stuff as far as like
open source routers are concerned so let
me know in the comments in fact we're
gonna take a quick break and when we get
back i've got some responses to some of
the epic comments but first a word from
our sponsor domain.com and doc club came
to hack five with a great idea build a
club all about learning stuff making
things and having fun and so we did just
that and we man what a brilliant idea we
recently hosted our very first ever open
house at the hack 5 warehouse and with
the help of domain.com and dot club we
put on a mini LAN party micro drone
obstacle course 3d print fest quadcopter
race and killer barbecue and I must say
these guys get it the internet and
hacker culture in particular it's all
about fostering community from BBS's to
phyto net to IRC it's all about coming
together and having fun and what better
domain to do it than a doc cloth it's
perfect because the doc club is
universally and globally understood not
just here in the United States so if
you're building a new business or naming
your startup consider a doc club as the
ultimate social domain join us in the
San Francisco Bay Area for workshops and
projects and crazy in dorkwad got the
races at our very own doc club hack
house club then head over to domain.com
slash club to register your club today
they're only $9.99 a year and there are
thousands of awesome options still
available May
to use the coupon code hak5 to save 15%
and let the guys over at domain.com know
we sent you so when you think domain
names think domain.com all right I have
to thank you guys for the epic comments
last week I loved the discussions and
I'm gonna start this off with Dakota who
asks can I set up this kind of host on
Hostgator or GoDaddy or digital oceans
etc my parents won't allow me to port
forward on the router well makes sense
well okay so I'm not really sure about
Hostgator or whatever I have had
personal experience with digitalocean
I've used that a lot it works great in
fact I love how inexpensive those VPS is
can be this is really kind of the
perfect thing to just go ahead and throw
in the cloud if you trust the cloud
service provider more on that little
later the other thing is if you want to
do this on the uber cheap and you don't
always need it
Amazon ec2 instances can be had for as
little as what two cents an hour or
something like that so that might
definitely be the way to go if you only
need something that you can pop on here
and there and thanks for the question
we have another one here from Brendan
who says that I use a VPN not only to
stay safe on public Wi-Fi but also to
maintain my privacy after new mandatory
metadata related laws were recently
introduced in his country of Australia
dude that sucks if my VPN server were in
my house then the metadata would still
be collected so in his case is actually
better for him to just go ahead and VPN
to somewhere outside the country in fact
there were a lot of people who had
mentioned similar things as far as
bypassing geo IP restrictions that were
a lot of times used to make sure that
you can't watch Netflix if you're in
that you know bad country no Netflix for
you you know what I'm talking about or
do what I do and you know VPN into the
UK so you can watch BBC iPlayer but then
again top care is not on the air anymore
so really what is there to watch ok I'm
sorry I've just upset a lot of Doctor
Who fans Gill Hume
I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly
says that the whole video I was thinking
about the wireless SNES controller on
the table where can you get one is it
bluetooth yes it is the I think it's the
SNES 30 yeah
it is Bluetooth I picked mine off I
named Amazon it was probably like 20 or
30 bucks it is bluetooth it works great
I love it I'm using it for something a
little non-traditional as you might
imagine but we'll leave it at that and
if you want to see more about the SNES
controller we can good and screw it
later but that's a totally different
hack and then Jeremy says that I
understand what we are doing here and
you guys ahead and says that he
understands that there is really no way
to protect our packets right if we want
to use the web then it can always be
attacked so we it should really be
titled like ways to help protect your
packets and nothing is going to make
them safe and I totally get that
basically what we're doing is we are
creating a secured a encrypted tunnel
between where we are right now and
wherever that may be
I mean if I'm hacking across America I
might be connected to some Wi-Fi at some
coffee shop whatever have you what I'm
doing is I'm creating an encrypted
tunnel between that location and in this
case my home now that that is the same
thing assuming that I trust my home
connection right so we were just talking
about virtual private servers and like
do I trust my VPS up in digital oceans
or do I trust a VPS up in or an Amazon
ec2 instance for that matter
at a certain point regardless of you
using a VPN to protect the link between
those two nodes you are going to go out
onto the public Internet right so
assuming that all lines are tapped
you're kind of screwed in which case
there's amazing awesome other
technologies that is not really what
this is for but look into i2p
obviously and I probably don't know also
have to tell you about tor but The Onion
Router is an amazing resource as well
and that kind of leads into Rob's
question which is would this work in
China though and most likely not I've
never personally been to China however I
do know that the Great Firewall there is
rather restrictive and this uses well
let's see TCP port 443 which is the same
thing HTTP works on
however the traffic has its own kind of
unique signature if you will
also the 11 the UDP 1192 it's really
obvious what UDP 1192 is that's the nice
thing that OpenVPN you have the ability
to choose of either of those and as far
as bypassing the Great Firewall of China
I think that a great project to look at
would be obf proxy and we'll talk more
about that later but essentially that
would allow you to mask all of your
traffic as a different kind of
application and make it look like your
VPN traffic isn't actually VPN traffic
but it's actually Skype traffic so
anyway that's really awesome stuff I
would like to hear from you guys what
are your thoughts email us feedback at
hack 5 org Shannon and I we read them
all we also love all of the comments
there's always great discussion going on
on the youtubes and over on the forums
forms a hack 5 org in fact while you're
over at hack 5 door you can click follow
and find all of the ways to see our
social networks and you know actually
that was a great time to follow us on
Twitter find out what we're doing as we
go into DEFCON season we're gonna be
having so much fun in Las Vegas I know
that Sebastian and I are doing talks on
the Wi-Fi pineapple at the wireless
villages at besides Las Vegas and at
DEFCON I know that we're having a
birthday cake at the pool party at Las
Vegas besides so check out LV b-sides
it's amazing I love that conference if
you're in Vegas a day or two early
before Def Con it's really worth
checking out it is the complete opposite
of that other con that is running before
Def Con yes
black hats I don't Ford back anyway
whatever that notwithstanding we are
gonna be having some major announcements
on Monday so stay tuned we're gonna have
a special episode Shannon and I on
Monday I look forward to sharing with
you a project that we've been working on
for so long that's gonna make use of
some of the technology that we've been
talking about today and change the way
you think about lands and then shells
and all sorts of good stuff so with that
i'm darren kitchen and on behalf
of Chenin who is out today we're
reminding you to trust your Technol us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
