by Toyota with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
from CES 2014 at showstoppers the press
event and I found one of my favoritest
things ever I wanted to back this on
Kickstarter but unfortunately I was
broke at the time Daniel you have the
3doodler I love this thing I really do I
watched the videos about it I wanted to
back it I wanted to buy like three of
them because they're inexpensive I love
it okay so you have to tell me all about
this product absolutely thank you very
much as well enthusiasm so it's the
world's first 3d printing pen we
launched on kickstarter back in February
and the response was insane just
phenomenal we pre-sold 25,000 pens in
the space for a month and it gave us
enough money it's a basic launch a
product launch a company and start
building it and distributing it
congratulations on that that's so
exciting so I know you're going to be
doodling while I'm interviewing you but
just tell me a little bit about the
product itself how did you come up with
this idea so there are three co-founders
p myself a max and peter max for
prototyping some new toy concepts with a
3d printer and it made a mistake while
printing and pete looked at him was like
oh I can't believe it did that I just
want to pick up the extrude ahead and
correct a mistake hands ahead I can do
that so he basically took a pot his ops
3d printer circle fixed-route i had and
they put it in a little form called the
teacup and they were like blowing on it
too hard in the plastic but that was the
first 3doodler and then the next step is
to make it into a pen that's hilarious
I've actually had problems with my
extruder as well on my 3d printer at
home because I've built my own I put it
all together and it's very complicated
this is interesting because it's it's
more for a consumer market it's it's for
an artist more so than a maker that's
right as no software involved with least
no complex software and no expensive
hardware you just pick up the pen and
after 20 or so minutes of getting up the
learning curve you can create anything
in 3d so is this kind of like a glue gun
that's not a bad analogy and it's yeah
it's similar technology and that it
heats the material and then you can
extruder out to create things the big
difference is it's using plastic so
a lot harder two types of plastic and
you can create object in the air that
will stand up straight and don't have
flex to them so you really can build
anything with this that's amazing yeah I
saw the Eiffel Tower in the background
and we will have to get a shot of that
because that is so cool also i was
wondering what kind of filament do you
use for this so there are two types of
filament you can use ABS plastic and PLA
both three millimeter and as you know
ABS is a petroleum-based plastic
commonly used in 3d printing and PLA is
a new bioplastic it's made of corn the
colors are very vibrant it's fantastic
is it easy to clean do you have any
problems with it I'm getting stuck
inside the pen or anything like that I
have barely any problems with mine which
is great I've been using it for last
time you said it is very easy to clean
and the belly any cleaning is required
you cannot make us wipe off the tip and
if you do get a blockage it's pretty
easy to unlock that's good to hear also
i was wondering as well you have a stand
back here it's that stand to well study
your fingers as you're trying to build
something so we wanted to a stand for a
while and then we wanted to ensure that
something that was useful so this is a
stand here we call it the doodle suit
because when you put the pen in it it
looks like it's got a pair of trousers
on and the stance does two purposes the
first is to give the pen or you arrest
in between sessions but the second is
these two legs which serve as buttons so
almost like a mouse you can press down
on those buttons and then control the
pen with a lot more stability to create
very precise objects that's awesome i
love it and i can mix and match the
colors is that much as i want to i just
stick them in there and let them let
them heat up and if you get bored of a
color v or using you can reverse it back
out of the panic button you on it that's
so cool I absolutely love this thing and
yeah I guess you just you just plug it
in you let it heat up and then you're
you're ready to go correct that's right
and now with 20,000 pins out there we're
seeing amazing amounts of creativity
from our backers yeah I bet is their
community online is there a place where
I can find out more there is so on our
website we have a community tab that you
can click on when you go there you go
getting started videos you've got
stencils like the Eiffel Tower so you
make it in pieces and join it together
what about 100 stencils now and we're
also launching a forum pretty soon so
people can share tips and tricks that's
awesome I can't wait to check it out and
community
is awesome let me know how much does it
cost it's ninety nine dollars and that
comes with two packets of plastic you
kept it under a hundred bucks that's
great I'm so excited I'm buying one of
these for myself I'm super excited I
can't wait to bring out some creativity
and make my own art thank you so much
again for chatting with me about the
3doodler if you guys want to find out
more about this and 3d printers
everything that's going on here at CES
go over to revision 3.com / CES 2014
check out our videos thanks once again
to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
