from newegg he knocks us all out we r

with him what really makes me mad is the
fact that given her his an Ally's his
theory she can't stay here anymore and
has to go stay with her parents what the
hell is that
what the hell is that no there aren't
any model numbers on it whatsoever yet
the only thing it says that it complies
with FCC part 15 uh-huh right you know
what does it look like it looks people I
don't know why they're looking for the

audible.com slash hak5 for details hey
whats up guys got kind of a geeky
problem interesting solution the thing
is I'm on my way from Williamsburg
Virginia to Washington DC on this road
trip and I'm an idiot and let people
server my ipod so I don't have this
killer mix that I made but there's this
really cool fun way that I can get
access to any of my music anywhere and
thankfully because I have such an
awesome cell phone I'm a little cable I
can tether them up get on the evdo
network and get access to my music and
we've talked about this bit before
season 1 and a lot of things have
changed since then and one of the sites
that I want to take a look at is this
place called anywhere FM it's basically
like a flash interface it looks very
similar to iTunes and lets you you know
play your music create playlists mixes
all that other fun stuff but with neat
about it is it lets you upload your
music from your home computer to their
site and then you can just get access to
it anywhere that you have an internet
connection it's pretty easy to use if
you've used itunes before it's the same
basic thing and i find that the
performance is actually pretty good and
uploading doesn't take very long single
tracks you just go through its little
upload interface you select a track and
you know a few minutes later it's up
there of course for people like you and
I with big music collections we may want
to invest some time into what they have
the iTunes uploader it's a little
utility sorry unfortunately for right
now it's only for Windows and only for
itunes but if you're using that it will
connect to your itunes playlists and you
can choose you know what playlists you
want to use and it will just upload your
entire collection or whatever you choose
up so i did it the other night uploaded
a whole bunch of fun stuff and just let
it run in the background some of the
other nifty features include a
visualizer that can be toggled full
screen or in the corner and the ability
to choose between a couple different
skins
now they've got light color and dark
color actual interface and a whole
plethora of different background images
that you can choose from they're just
kind of fun to make it a little bit more
your own one of the things that I find
it most useful is the fact that you can
pop it out into its own window and
minimize your previous Firefox or
whatever window and bam it becomes a
nice little addition to whatever your
desktop is of course like any web to a
service anywhere EFM is in beta however
reading across our FAQ I found something
interesting and that is that they do
plan to eventually support windows media
player and winamp and of course right
now unlimited storage I guess after a
while they'll end up charging for
premium access but for right now
definitely give it its been and now I
can go ahead and get all connected and
as simple as that I've got access to all
of my music that have uploaded from my
home computer okay hope you guys enjoyed
that I'm going to continue on my track
the real problem with being a geek is
that doesn't really offer the
opportunity to meet new people in real
life outside of your university CS
program it's really hard to find someone
to connect with over the new over the
box set of Star Trek or over the new
release of your favorite tech TV
podcasts you can look at a person to say
at all but you can't look a person say
geek let's just work that way geek the
geek is an online matchmaking service
that caters specifically the geeks and
their admirers if you're interested for
more information go to gk to gk com
that's gk to gk com so last month's
trivia question was in soviet russia
television watches you is an example of
the russian reversal a type of joke
popularized by comic Yakov Smirnoff what
is the grammatical term for this formula
based cliche coined by Glenn Whitman in
2004 that was correctly answered by shin
mirai you I think yes shin Mariah that a
viet woohoo and the answer is uh snow
clone yes whoa snow cones yes no clone
wikipedia ball cats no beacon snow
clones a lot yes they do yeah we'll have
some links to some fun articles about
this anyway so he's going to get his
super dope hak5 swag bag it's the
cruising the pins and all the pumps and
all the haven't had five goodness so
this month's trivia question alright in
2004 New York phone phreak decoder was
arrested and charged for accessing what
hair streaking manufactured test
equipment and mad props if you can send
us the default password this brings it
back to the 90s for me yeah you knew
that one oh yeah like I can't talk about
how well I knew that one but I know how
well he did yeah anyway Oh send your
answers to trivia at hak5 org David
explain
hey what's going on everybody it's time
for another mod segment with me and this
time we're going to be doing power over
ethernet for a wrt54g now here's the
wrt54g right here you know pretty
standard everybody's seen it before
4-port wireless router and it does not
natively support power over ethernet but
with a pretty awesome forum post that i
found somebody discovered a way to do it
using an actual ethernet cable and the
existing power brick now we've got our
list of materials our array of things
we're going to need if you will starting
off of course with what we saw at the
beginning good old trusty soldering iron
some wire it's good to use the black and
the red so you know which way is
positive and negative using DC power of
course good old solder some wire
strippers the router itself network
cable some kind of cutting instrument
and a good old-fashioned phillips
screwdriver can't go wrong with that now
basically what we're going to be doing
is wiring the existing wall wart as we
so lovingly call it here and hak5 the DC
power inverter that comes with the
linksys router into the network cable
and then inside of the router we're
going to rear out those pins from the
network cable over to the DC plug on the
back but all on the main board you'll
never see it so normally what you do is
take this thing apart now to take the
router apart you just kind of grab it by
the feet here and pull there's the board
right there now I've done this already
with another one so we'll set this aside
try not to break anything
like that so here's the regular
mainboard all by itself and what we're
really going to be interested in is all
of these little tiny tiny solder points
on the bottom here if we get a close-up
of that if you look over here here's the
eight pins for the van or the internet
connection here's the four ports on the
back and then you see these three right
here these are the DC connection on the
back there so what we're going to be
interested in is the one and these three
over here it's really a pretty simple
process what we're going to do is we're
going to bridge pins three and four on
the LAN and seven and eight because as
most of us know only four pins are used
on an Ethernet cable and if we get
another close up here you can actually
see the traces we get really close here
you can see that pins one and two are
used you can see the traces off of them
then you get one two three excuse me I
said 3 and 4 i'm at four and five those
two right there with no traces attached
to them and then over here on the side
you've got seven and eight which also
don't have any traces and that's the
same all the way through for all
connections I greatly apologize I said
three and four it is four and five and
it's really a pretty simple process what
we're going to do first is pull some
wire out here snip it off let's make
sure we've got plenty of wire here to go
from one point A to point B so we'll
just kind of eyeball that in there and
that's good right there snip that off
strip it out and exposed end come back
over here and with a steady hand which
hopefully I'll have today we'll just
solder this on right here and solve this
one on right here okay so always in DC
power red means positive black beans
negative so that was their positive
terminal so let's go ahead and get the
negative turnham terminal on there
they're going to be on seven and eight
so we'll just kind of eyeball this back
in again same process pop that that off
and exposed wire take my little
alligator cheat right here unclamp that
get my negative wire situated here
it's about right and clamp it down oops
loosed a good wire and back to
oh it's really freaking hot simple as
that no particular rocket science
involved in that process right there and
once those are nice and cool bend them
around over here and connect them to our
terminals for the DC plug bend this one
in connect to our positive terminal
right here oh this is going to be fun be
real fun
and oops let's try and clean the tip up
a little bit
so after being a little bit of a pain
simple as that and that's all we really
need to do on the main board here not a
whole lot of science behind that one so
now what we need to do is go ahead and
modify our network cable to make this
work so we'll set this aside when I come
down here towards one end cut it open
with my rusty utility knife this time on
hak5 west gives himself tetanus peel it
open expose the wires everybody seen
them what we're interested in are the
brown wires and the blue wires that's
what we really want give ourselves a
little working room there we go come in
here separate the brown ones out cut
these off and let's go ahead and grab
the blue ones too because these are the
two sets of wires that are actually
going to carry our current for us and
that is going to be a pretty simple task
as well just a little more soldering
that's all it is twist those together
that's all we're going to do right there
for the moment so I'm going to reach
down here under the table oh goodness
standard linksys wall wart well trim out
about a foot snip that off right there
now on this thing if you look it's get a
nice close-up on this one one wire solid
black one wires black with white stripes
see that kind of like your network
cables solid black negative black and
white positive so you just need to keep
track of that
we'll go ahead and strip these off here
there we go now you can even look at
your network cable here now remember we
used seven and eight as our negative and
four and five is our positive so if you
look inside the network connector here
you'll see seven and eight or both are
round wires so that means Browns on our
connection here go to negative twist
this all together and blues go to
positive to set together and of course
to secure the connection will sling a
little slot solder honor there you go
perfect
a little bit of heat shrink here protect
our exposed end so fire fire a little
more fire never have too much fire and
we're going to go ahead and package this
thing all back together make it look
like nothing ever happened and wrap this
whole thing up okay so here is the
finished product all wrapped up nice and
neat and and its original packaging two
antennas on the back now you'll see
nothing's plugged into the back here
nothing at all nothing's on on the front
let's plug in the network cable real
quick just a single network cable click
come back to the front and it's testing
it's got power it's rocking and rolling
now a couple of things that you'll have
to make note of when you do this
particular project is when you fix your
network cable to carry the POA you'll
have to realize that it's unidirectional
at one point after your it's all said
and done one end absolutely has to go
into the router and then the other end
has to go into the network connection
that's it now you might ask yourself as
to why you might want to do this
particular project and the simple answer
is making a life easier later you might
want to stick a wireless router like the
wrt54g in a an odd balash place like
your attic and if anybody has ever been
in an attic before you know that it's a
real pain to work up there and
especially there's there's no outlets
they don't wire attics for outlets so
it'd be so much easier to run power over
the ethernet cable and run it straight
into the router and only have to worry
about running one cable it's it just
makes perfect sense now as always
there'll be a link in the show note to
the the forum post that this originally
came from there's high res pictures
step-by-step instructions and you can
always email me west at hak5 org if you
have any questions
why just give them a name when you can

that's hack and the number three and get
your comm name for just 695 a year get
your piece of the internet at
godaddy.com Go Go Daddy it's time for
the hak5 land party powered by evo Lance
com internet gaming has evolved last
month we played ut2004 and I was out of
town so I got my hall pass on that one
you got your Hall Pass um I never had a
chance to buy the game so you don't own
it no you're saying I don't okay he
doesn't own many games actually oh sorry
anyway so but I hope everybody had fun
nade rock the server yeah I don't know
if you guys remember to it was exactly a
year ago on Episode two XO to where I
punched the set and got on the happy
pills and decided to challenge West to a
UT 99 match and we eventually we finally
did that this month yes we finally did
that at the last it was a hack 5 life
special completely televised it was like
this crazy sporting event who's really
cool go check it out we're not going to
tell you who won yes but we will tell
you that there will be a rematch in
counter-strike that my death match
monsoon or no and speaking of mods
injured half-life 2 realm this month's
game is going to be the insurgency mod
for half-life 2 we have links in the
show notes to download and install and
all that fun stuff and we will be seeing
you in that game sep tember 8th at nine
o'clock eastern daylight time it's still
daylight time so yes and that will be
directly following hak5 live i think
that's episode eight or nine it's
something yet so hopefully a word for
the details on that and when is you in
game
joining us once again is a good friend
muaks from room 360 2.com two shows a
whole bunch of interesting ways to
enumerate things anonymously for you
curious types he's actually not in
studio with us we're also i would be
shaking his hand he's joining us via
Skype which in itself is really hack the
way we've got it tied in with the mixing
board and the reverse B and C anyway
moob Ock's thanks for coming on how I am
I'm doing okay so anonymous numeration
is the topic of your latest blog post
that should be coming out around the
same time in this episode you want to
give us an idea of what that means so
basically what numeration anonymous
enumeration especially is finding out
information about something now why
would you want to do this or why would
you want to do it and honestly say you
get hacked or or you're just running
snort or something that you find a
little tidbit of information and you
want to take it to the next step you
want to learn more but you don't want to
show up on someone else's snort for
instance that's what I'm going to show
you today ok cool so let's look at the
first tool obviously a favorite of
everybody's who is SC yeah who is done
st now everybody knows how to do it who
is at somehow some way right i used to
do in my network solutions but then they
implemented a captcha and since i found
who is SC no captcha no goes a lot
faster to look up information right so
great thing about who is that I see is
you can type in the URL right at the top
or the IP address right stop it go and
you get all the information and again
it's normal Google's information right
you can find out you know the dns
information that you enter when you
create a domain like the name on the
account and normally there's you know a
person designated for a technical
contact and a company contract for their
address and phone number and of course
we always fill in the correct
information because that's the ethical
thing to do of course yeah so nothing
too big here it's just a really good
source for who is kind
enumeration starts at that so next up we
have the next step in narration where we
still have the who is it's at central
office net and they got a lot of good
tools but doing dots here's what we're
going to focus on today and once you
click that you go in and you type in the
domain or IP that your honor and again
who is information dns records that's a
new one but the cool thing is the server
scam and what the service can does is
kind of grabs the header information
from four or five different ones right
so we go down and the service game is at
the bottom we've already looked at the
Whois information and here's the spare
scan now if you had ftp and smtp going
on hack I org and pull the header from
that and pop3 and imap but all you have
for running is an HTTP which is your
apache server so it looks like this is
sort of like nmap it's actually doing
like a scan for different services
running but it doesn't look like it's
doing a complete like 65,000 port scan
though you know ftp smtp h HTTP your
regular stuff that are on web servers
good to know real quick especially the
header information because you can tell
right on here that we're running PHP
version 5.1 016 what you doing can then
go and find fun exploit for and and drop
us a little happy gram txt on our rid of
our web server exactly so so we've taken
that to the next step what's the next
step after that I mean you have some
more information but you don't really
have everything so server sniff net is
where we go next now they have a lot of
good tools some sometimes I don't ever
come off this website and I'll let you
look at each one like subdomains will
enumerate that I'm not leaving for sub
domain attack so not tak particular a
dictionary based sub-domain query so if
you did on hak5 dot org eventually you'd
find a noob to hack five oregon game
direct five and wiki and all the other
subdomains correct even if not listed
another part is the web server sanction
me pulls the header just like central
austin now new one is page social
grab the source of the website and you
should still haven't touched their site
and if you want just hyperlinks or
comments comments is sometimes pretty
interesting robots to context but we're
going to focus on file info now what
file info does is it grabs the file and
we've already pulled it up here it grabs
the file and it can it supports all
these I mean tons of formats as you can
see on the site and they suggest less
than three bags okay wait once you hit
go so you it'll give you a hex tile
it'll look do all kinds of information
on it including strip strings out and
raw text so we scroll down real quick
we're going to get down here at some
point where it go so it'll actually take
a look at the file information of this
URL that you've given it and actually
find out not just you know give you the
heck sense but but now we get the
metadata and other interesting facts
that maybe you know embedded in there I
can find that using like the string
search could be interesting on unlike an
executable you know if there's comments
within that compiled executable so it as
you can see he down here we've pulled
out all the strings are showing up in
the file and we do have some interesting
information here like the last user who
edited it was a pacino the version of
the word of the all microsoft word the
title of document Department of
Agriculture some other information in
here to somewhere in here there's even
the information of the last person who
edited the right we were looking at the
Edit summary of this so we could see the
different revisions that were happening
within the organization very cool now
your last tool that you want to talk
about totally blew me away now the
websites awesome let's go ahead and look
at that that's that's my gym evolution
it's by Patera now the cool thing about
this is it uses transforms which is how
the coder does
it's different searches that's all it
means is there transforms and hit type
in an email jests or one of these other
options and a telephone number or a
website right and just find out more
information about what you give it
correct it'll do all these searches
again from the website it's not actually
using your browser for anything it's
doing searches on the web server and
they'll find top 30 words according to
associated with your email address
Darren kitchen Paul alley of course Jim
Cotter you scroll down a little bit and
we have now the actual search results we
have your Flickr site your myspace page
your of course hak5 org and some of the
other email addresses associated with
your email address trivia channel comic
it'll give you actually the snippets of
where it showed up so again this is not
the coolest part they have a GUI so now
I have to warn you the GUI actually does
do the lookups from your IP address
focus it's not actually hitting the web
server and calling back so I already
have it installed then we're going to
jump to that and we've already done a
couple searches and that's done by
dragging and dropping one of these
options on the right hand side and then
editing the default that comes up with
by double clicking it just as I did with
the domain okay org so we've done a
person search on Darren kitchen and also
one on Darren hak5 org and I find it you
know amazing that it's found you know
not only you know my flickr page my
amazon profile you know my myspace it
even found my facebook you did find your
facebook and then it found more people
that are like kate Abraham or Veronica
Belmont or other people that are my
friends on Facebook correct I don't off
of that we could actually start a
numerate converted to a person and keep
going down that trail the odd thing is
that we did the search on your email
address and Darren
in Darren kitchen and both came up with
this odd number song number 127 34 you
know it's not my number I'm kind of in
Houston what would happen if i called it
again you can follow the cookie trail as
far as you want you know because
wherever we go online if we're not just
always giving bogus information we're
leaving little digital breadcrumbs of
who we are and this tool looks like it
makes it very easy to find out a whole
lot of information about somebody that
you might be curious about or yourself
if you're just ego 13 we're very
paranoid about where your stuff is a
buddy of mine actually just use this
recently and found out that his friend
had posted his complete information cell
phone number promo dress and everything
to craigslist on his resume so it can
find some interesting information well
once again muaks you have raised my
paranoia factor just a little bit more
and i really look forward to seeing the
the post on technocrats you want to tell
us about that new blog that you've
started oh yeah i'm a part of a new blog
a new tech blog by franklin hairs and my
class and all three of us have generated
content on technocrat that's te chno
cr80 and what we do is as it says on my
shirt get edge it's hacking gaming geek
and tech i mean really it's just it's
like the engadget of of tanked I guess
sounds cool well I can't wait to see
your article with all of the links where
you can find more information of course
also in our show notes and you know do
some curious searches yourself it mimics
if you were here in the studio I'd shake
your hand I'm just going to say thanks
so much for coming on the show and
bearing with our VNC skype crazy mess
that we have here alright no problem
thanks for having me once again it's
that time where we have to say goodbye
but before we do there's a couple things
that we need to wrap up yep first and
foremost is the community projects sound
off you saw the bumper earlier in the
show we're going to start featuring
community projects there every month
this month was the hak5 comic
that's being done by NXT and family come
and a whole bunch of other fun people up
on the IRC in the forms if that's
something you're interested in if you're
talented and illustrator or just a great
sketch artist you might want to check
out the wiki link where you can get
involved in the project and I've been
having a lot of fun doing some
illustrator or inkscape type right on
inking with it good stuff yeah i'm
looking forward to the the first like
addition or whatever the path that'll be
fun first boy on if you will next is the
text adventure programming challenge and
that kind of ties in with the next one
as well sort of kind of sure we'll get
to that in a minute and basically what
they're doing is they've a small group
of the community members has written a
text adventure in c and then they went
back and wrote it again in java and now
it's your turn to join in and see if you
can do it in white space or low code or
Pascal you know you know whatever pearl
yeah well Waka bang bang whoa and of
course there's a fun new thing ditch
into the community it's BBS hak5 org you
can tell them that to it if you're like
PBS what is that bulletin board system
picking it back to school old school
making me remember 88-89 and and you
know it's peter some of you were gonna
be like I've never heard of a bulletin
board system in this town you did I did
I was part of that group that just
completely missed out on the whole BBS
check it out it's a really cool and
unique experience relive the retro news
and we have some door games so I've been
playing legend of the Red Dragons so if
you remember that Seth able mad props
get in on that game it's a lot of really
easy to get you telnet BBS hak5 org and
as always you can email any of us Darren
West alley Paul anybody at hak5 org or
just send email to feedback at hak5
Gorga may be featured in one of the
bumpers and we love right here what you
think of the show and another thing
we're going to need your feedback on is
hak5 radio it's been relaunched its
taken off it's doing a really really
great job as it is thus far the pre-show
before hak5 live is awesome I suggest to
anybody check that out but it's going
through a web design and we need your
help there's a thread in the forums that
you know you can volunteer some time
some PHP code some CSS whatever may be a
small portfolio of what you've done
before
not necessary but yeah find the link in
the show notes hit on the form and we'd
love to see that website get even more
prettier yes more prettier is good more
prettier so we also have a new sponsor
for this episode we'd like to thank
audible com because they are helping
bring hak5 to you this month they are
