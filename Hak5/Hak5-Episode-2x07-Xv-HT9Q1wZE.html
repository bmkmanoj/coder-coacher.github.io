Morissette Pearl Jam baby Jesus and uh
you guys rock on thank you alright well
we're glad to have you on the show John
thank you so much for coming back up on
the radar and coming out to hang out
with us and being on the show today
thank you so much and along with John in
the second set is our other panelists
another esteemed colleague that's Rob
you may know him from IRC as mu bakes
you've probably seen him on new Rick's
movies he loves it when you call net 0
anyway Rob's been on the show before
where we're yes I I got her during a
move but it wasn't on tape so I'm so
sorry because of my girl all right nice
well Rob's gonna be helping to field
some questions today and we're glad to
have him down so without further ado
let's get this party started let's jump
right into it with IRC at work this is
kind of a pain i remember the first time
i got an office job mm-hmm um I ever
thought it was so cool oh wait I get to
sit at a computer all day gonna be
playing quake 2 and like it wasn't
really like yeah now but if you're real
good about it you can hide an IRC
windows sometimes behind a word document
we've been there but sometimes the
system administrator your one whole room
dentistry hitters lock the UAH and makes
it a little bit I mean obviously you
want to block ports on your firewall you
want to keep his few ports open as
possible so that you know there's no
kind of security risks or anything else
like that in a corporate environment
really I think one of the main concerns
is you don't want your employees to fit
at work exactly oh alright I yay and
that's not only that but if you if
you're in a big kind of corporate
situation you don't want your employees
to be on IRC or on aim or whatever
because that means they're not they're
not working they're not being productive
so like getting an HDTV in a week in the
hak5 studios and then productivity whoo
so I don't know it's a cool program yeah
so uh not really it is a program because
it is an open source project button on
sourceforge yes you can you can find it
on sourceforge just look for IRC at work
and it kind of works like it runs like a
like a web server type dealy but if you
want to pull the screen up right here
thank you if you look at it right here
this is an actual website that's running
right now IRC at work calm and all you
do is come in here and you enter your
neck so let's do this hak5 Wes dammit I
can't type and then your server
obviously so IRC that heck 5-door
because I can't remember the new one and
then pound hak5 give it a second it'll
roll up BAM look IRC this is great and
whether you're telling with the other
200 people that are all yet I made I
made 209 nice but uh yeah everybody's
like oh wow delight yeah it's completely
web-based which means you go to port 80
so your firewall won't block it it just
comes in as a regular so as far as your
systems administrators concerned you're
just browsing the web I'm researching
right and they cannot I mean there's no
way you'd like stop you from doing that
because then productivity was really
yeah yeah it really go through the
crapper but this particular IRC at work
proxy if you will is run by a very
generous guy that set this up using PHP
I'm sorry it's a pearl CGI app right and
I I guess one of the things that we want
to stress with this is that not to abuse
this particular site yeah because this
guy's you know running it out of you
know the kindness of his own heart you
don't have to pay anything for it so you
don't want to
sit there and just abuse it right one of
the other the link is actually at the
bottom of the page on the item main IRT
at work okay hum yeah but what I would
suggest see if your system administrator
checks logs which some do and some don't
know if your key blogs IRC at were calm
and that's kind of a dead giveaway so
maybe you want to register your own
domain anybody and you know get your own
web hook for those and then you could
run your own like totally work related
research calm and run your own IRC
totally work related research calm I
like that i'm going to go register that
yeah Rob what do you do right yeah Rob
how do you work around your little IRC
problem I I don't know IRC from work
we're all those know you've never i
received from work but if you were any
word any word to do so he never ever
looking stuff of it no ever but if you
were if I were I estate home to my home
server and use a command line so what
Twitter seems like that it was what
providing an IRC club I r and s your
side I RSS icon quick and I think we've
talked about setting up actually as this
HD right now oh right on little bit
ponies if you want to pull up this right
now pull up the laptop there we go this
is the this is the actual you know
homepage for IRC at word it's nothing
fancy but come over here you get the
homes features demo download blah blah
blah all that fun stuff but that's where
you can go pick it out find all the
documentation you need to run your own
IRC at work type deal and now since i'm
i am the systems administrator and i
finally figured out how a sonic 50 words
through that was like the most
complicated like firewall i've ever been
inside it was really just different so i
got that figured out and that's why
everybody sees me on IRC all the time
now during the day but this before but
you're on IRC at work for research of
course like no actually there's plenty
of technical questions a code EP
christian who r on
satcom yeah ritual it's very good check
it out if you haven't had calm dot I
think there's a website for a wiki yeah
but it's like a calm door guy think yeah
but uh he helped me out with a lot of
Mac problems because i'm not i'm not big
on the mac i'm not big on the OSX i said
as having some weird problem with sex OS
x mm-hmm more but hey now so i actually
i do use IRC for work type related stuff
so definitely if you're in the situation
where you want IRC may be at school at
work whatever this is a really cool
program to check out you can find the
links in our show notes and Paul do we
have a caller yes we do let's go ahead
not idea where he is row that real quick
so you know like when Steve Jobs was
just you know back in college yeah
hindman was also dude we watched the
keynote on a on a projector it was like
that 940 other jobs you know you got to
talk about like Steve Jobs just saw
somewhere oh here we go here's our
caller that's for those and could we
have we can go we go right after all
right Ryan no way what's up buddy how
you doing I'm doing pretty good yourself
doing all right nice to have you on nice
going to be here I guess so you have a
new day right loving the new digs we
just moved into the new place and set up
something you like this morning yeah if
the production desk obviously survived
the move no more mishaps there yes is
you know some two-by-fours ismail's and
it all kind of came back together great
you know we're looking forward to set
upgrade for season three but for the
meantime he's going to stick with mana
left a black walls or the brick of
Braille walls his bricks the new black
so anyway so uh Brian what's your
question for us buddy question okay
excuse me fine there's this live
streaming radio show that I'd like to
listen to it's at a slightly
inconvenient time from three to six
starts when i'm at work ends when I'm at
home plus you know when i'm at work
have people coming up to me and trying
to talk to me tracting so I want to
capture it there's obviously commercial
stuff that can do that but you know free
DLC is free and i can i'm trying to set
it up with like the schedule the task
scheduler and windows to start at three
o'clock and kill it after three hours
right i'm running into problems is i
want to date stamp the file that i'm
saving it as I see Sir so like % date
percent in the windows command prompt
will convert to the current date you can
do some substring to take out the
slashes problem is when I put that into
the schedule the scheduler thing
whatever it doesn't interpolate that and
it just tries to save it as like % date
and the substring has a colon in and
that's not valid character for a file
right so so what you're ending up with
you schedule it you'll actually end up
with a file that's named percent date
percent mp3 or whatever exactly and
that's no comment okay go I believe
there is a way to do this there's a
batch file that I've used most commonly
when i'm doing like backups I'll write a
batch file to do a backup and then move
it from one server over to an ass or
something and I want to name it by the
date so my best resource for that is
actually SS 64 calm and I will get these
show notes in the assurance links in the
show notes for this this has a whole
bunch of example scripts that you can
use to write about a file that will
start your VLC because you already know
the DLC command to start record on the
right right Oh character you just write
the batch pot for that with the you know
with this has like somebody does some
things to the variables to actually
crave one that works and will create the
file name correctly and if you do that
in this batch file what you can do is
then scheduled another task at six
o'clock so if we always have to go when
your programs over you would schedule a
task continues the massive held command
to kill VL seals wolf so then you don't
need to worry about it's still running
after you close the batch right ok
Robbie get some this mic up
I need to make up but Paul would you get
that thank you so anyway yeah so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to throw
those links in the show notes I haven't
had a chance to actually write this
batch file but I'm going to get our own
80 we just moved in and got the tunnel
yesterday excuse me sir Aaron would you
say excuses excuses don't make me give
it all right so maybe come back down
there and smack you again boy I will
smack you first yeah so anyway so yeah
we'll have the show notes go go up for
you with all the links and pertinent
information I hope it helps you out did
you have anything else no really so is I
climaxing Wow well thanks a lot for Carl
I'm debit bats thanks everyone yeah yeah
your silhouette it's like the so much
yeah just an elective of our minds you
know your life and it's like when the
better i get the Walters Art action
program or so yeah we're like yeah we're
like they're doing the interview and
they've got the broker or voice and
they're like a silhouette so anyway so I
guess we're up against our first break
when we get back we're going to take a
look at a front row hack for your power
pc macintosh and your wiimote so would
be back in just a bit after a word from
these people
doggy doggy doggy Dougie Doug what maybe
see no easy godaddy.com is huh yeah i
just bought you for a buck 99 did not
yeah I did dog nabbit whoops just take
your dog mr. Winky my wife loves mr.
Winky oh now I'm gonna do your wife
mother you know I'm gonna do your mother
now too late I already did my mother
pervert enter code hack that's h AK when
you check out for an additional ten
percent off any order
welcome back to hack 5 i'm here kitchen
this is Paul Tobias and we're continuing
the beta to live show it's both 2 X 07
it's both hak5 live beta 2 we're going
to hit gold one of these days we're kind
of still fumbling around in the new
house that we are very thankful to be in
love the new set a limit on the couch
and Paul's got a cool hack for so we've
been thinking about when we when we
moved in here one of the biggest things
that's so important to us geeks is media
and there's got to be a really good way
to manage media and we're like well hey
what about what up front row you know
but Paul's got a mac mini and had an
old-school neck me the PowerPC ones that
they can come with front row on them so
for a while I just didn't think it was
possible actually get front room without
buying the Intel mix but then I read off
of the analog five and I like five yeah
is the hak5 community easing if you're
not familiar with ezines head over text
files calm there are tons from the old
BBS era for you to check out and the
hak5 community has just kind of taken
that spirit and moved with it and their
first issue is awesome I definitely
suggest you head over to the hak5 wiki
and check that out very cool stuff so
that's where you found out about this
yeah I found out from there I can't
remember the fellows name but a it up a
pretty nice article on it and all the
performance photo essentially what he
did was he found someone who created a
program called enabler that will let you
kind of put in the little bits and
pieces for it to think that you can put
front row on there and there's a
specific build of smart row that you can
download from the Apple website and you
just install it and it will work just
fine so if I wanted to go to it I
usually just hit Apple xscape if it
works yep there it goes will front row
going on and i'll hit apple escape to
get back at but so i have front row but
it doesn't play all my media and so
one big thing I had to do was go through
and find all my codexes for divx and
xvid and stuff like that so you can
search around online there's a certain
places to get them from i'm working on a
wiki that'll put up and we'll show you
if the codexes you'll need it all
different kind of media playing through
the front row but now that I have it all
kind of on my machine I want to get away
from my machine and so that's why I
wanted to hook up my wiimote so I can
sit on my couch and watch the TV just
know better I mean when you look at this
it's like you would have just thought it
was an apple product I love it it just
matches so perfectly and the way that it
works is as soon as the nintendo
released we essentially all everyone
back in that yeah some i think it was a
fellow from japan he put out a just
little program within like a couple days
of it being out I just kind of hooks up
through the Bluetooth fly that we mow
and it gives you out of a little bit of
control over your computer and it'll
just get you little directions press 1
and 2 to sync it up and it will looks
like you sinking it to your to your way
mons having a little difficulty but
usually there's a bunch of rapid i will
show up no no it's connected but it's
not my i've upgraded recently conversion
four point oh it's been all main point
for four point four point out right and
this is based on the open source Dungey
remote library that's been released and
this is the Apple version of that
there's also a version for your pc if
you're thinking about doing the same
thing with like a kind of a Windows
Media Center type thing same idea and
we'll have links to those hacks in the
show notes as well yep but it works just
the same you'll want a pit little home
button I'll be a strike to that still
scroll around so all of these so the
arrow keys the d-pad and we'll just
cycle through the menu yep and the ABE I
change it so that the a button will be
less lucky earth is about pulling the
trigger was kind of difficult right so
I'll go into a movie
let's see if I can get something playing
real quick and the the instructions for
getting it on powerpc because front row
natively is in for the powerpc violent
action just for the intel macs so what
was the program that allowed you to do
this it was called enabler ok let's put
out by the fellow who just does the
program because we wanted to be able to
do it right and this is actually based
off of a very interesting article in the
analog five easy and on the wiki by shin
awry you who wrote this really cool
article about using front row on Power
PC Mac but with voice commands Paul
didn't want to be saying computer in
front row open movies but which is
totally cool i mean you know it's like
beam me up you know make happen but but
yeah with the wiimotes it's the same
kind of idea so i guess we got to give
credit where credit's due to xinhua Rio
supe or broken us up with that article
in analog five so we'll give a link to
his um his blog over there yep and oh
gosh you're playing us yeah how meta the
hell were you doing this is Lombe it was
like a little bit that's a video that
never was supposed to be released that's
not managed to have it but that was hak5
live alpha 0 point 0 point 0 point 1
yeah yeah but uh it also has a book get
at xscape button and that's pretty much
it rock on so you'll be able to find all
of the all the show notes and everything
to all three projects will probably will
be up on the wiki okay and maybe rock on
so do you think we should try the
voice-activated maybe of it oh you know
here's another question I before we
close the segment I need to know um do
you actually need the sensor bar for
this to work um if you want be able to
have more precise control over actually
pointing the curse around on the screen
right because essentially you could play
Doom with this yeah a good do them on a
on a mac with a wiimote but with linux
we do that maybe but uh now you don't
need the sensor bar because
kind of move around according to the
gyros in it but if you hook it up with a
sensor bar they'll have a lot more
precision I see but as for just the
front row you don't mean that precision
because you're just using the arrow keys
a and B and home rock on yeah all right
Paul well thanks for getting off the
console given a West a try with a video
mixing micro so we should have a bouncy
board alright so we should have another
caller coming up and I'm trying to find
out who which one was next it would be a
guy right yes sky from Newfoundland yeah
I got it I party me oh actually can you
tell this is beta I don't know Oh does
it feel a little wrong not great yeah
it's not cool at all is it uh uh oh you
want to switch out and let's all get the
con oh I'm gonna check an IRC the line
then we got a little stall because
someone can't do their job wet socks
socks raised us I'm never going to be
able to get on screen during the last
year's man or even know how to use skype
anymore I'm fired yeah and I don't even
use skype and I know how to use it like
I'm trying to find like you already come
on where yeah yeah it's got a tie pin in
the solution I will take care of that oh
there's where you type it in your school
yeah is that is that him yes God yeah
but I'm saying Chris okay I'm on it you
don't tight there you click here and
this is why we have Paul on the console
it doesn't look hard but it is extremely
difficult horribly difficult there's two
buttons there he goes hey hon hey get
back to the video now all right hey you
there Chris yeah I am and I just hear
sirens here firing yeah that's weird Oh
siren
oh boy actually no there's a hospital
really close to here hoping that's it
okay what's up man you got a question
for us yeah my question is what software
and hardware you guys using to mix your
streams I've tried a lot of solutions
but I can't really get any result team
clothes what'd you guys get okay well
this is good a great that we have Paul
on the set right now because I guess you
could tell you all about what we use to
mix yeah yeah conewago I'm trying to
supervise to either but you don't know
don't worry wes is gaga his question is
what hardware do we use take it it's
raining hard occasionally look forward
you asking about what we're doing to
video mix or to stream out to the server
is there a big dose actually okay well
let's take the video mixing and then
hand it over to rob who knows more about
the server um alright uh as for the
hardware what's that hey you went up
sure I'll take care of that so are you
pointing tia but uh oh yeah we're going
to get a little weird feedback loop but
whatever so um if you can see down a
little corner here we have the edirol
which is just our mixer for Channel it's
how we actually switch between all these
different Oh fired but uh we use it to
mix the four channels across here and
say you have main cameras we have our
someone's computer laptop on the set and
then we have our skype and BTW our
machine and that all is gets previewed
to there which is someone off of that
and so that's kind of the hardware for
mixing the video that's pretty much it
um it all has and then it goes from the
mixer to what we call 72 which is our
transmission Bach or
yeah way down there with the mountain
dew on it yeah yeah whoo mountain dew
it's all I drink I got a big collection
of cans but under cans I yeah like a
beat you up you a bougie honey yes yeah
and so it is I'll show you what the
cables not long enough on the camera
well how long did we spend yesterday
setting us back up that's on my way yes
your hours gonna go back to 10 this took
about yeah about five hours to put this
all back together we had it in about two
different crates plus all the screens
and the desk and whatnot and in fact the
live show was even delayed because
there's a dongle what we use it
hardware-wise when it comes out of the
edirol mixer and the audio and
everything it goes into an all in wonder
card it's actually a radeon 7500 if you
can believe that I know it's ancient but
it does the job because it has an
s-video n it has the the audio n and
it'll take that in a little purple
dongle and go right into the video card
and allow us to pull that up in the
stream program and the problem that we
had right before we went live and if you
are watching at three o'clock when were
supposed to be going it was okay audio
list and if that there was a double that
I actually left you ever go to a land
party and you're like all save space
I'll throw my mouse my keyboard yeah or
not your keyboard but my mouse and all
my cables inside your computer well the
Domino's inside the computer so we have
audio now and that's happy as for the
server side I think if we head over to
rob and Rob he may be able to wire it
clue you in on that just a bit more
alright so for a service I actually laid
this all out in again in a lot of five
hour
and basically what this is running off
to the rank server this colos which is
co-located server that a full circle so
on the server itself we have too few
applications shoutcast nice s I passions
often server and it can do sell caps
compatibility has the left leg okay do
the setup and eco are what you make of
it so for us we use shout cats because I
sketches is a little iffy when it goes
to video yeah okay almost out of the box
you can use nsv which is the winamp
version of streaming video nullsoft the
video okay so that's the software you
guys uses it and as we captured and
require the NSE schools UFC chapter on
Google's had a hard time but energy
tools what you want to look for okay so
you have any caffeine it can take you in
even though webcam is in fluid is it
tastes but we have reasonable or input
and anything and you have to get the 6.1
codec to actually work with a point
guilty or something equally what I was
raining on the left yeah okay you coat
it you want it doesn't come to ended
with the vehicle and if
BP 6.1 right did you just want alone and
it was great that's what's going on
right now okay so you have that you have
your shoutcast server and hateful setup
you've got that all detailed in the
analog by a lot of five Wow yeah we're
just kind of like we've been dfm we've
been upgraded you know if you want to
give a shout out to famicom and give
awesome job on a lot of side rock on so
yeah that's that should pretty much
explain it now we're actually using all
of that that Rob explained is actually
on his server and we'd like to thank him
so much for hosting this live stream
that's a hash five radio com and see you
can find more information about that at
what room 366 room 362 calm because
Novak's needs to get a room and and what
and that's whole boy smell what I wanted
to think about one of the things that
that's the limitation of this is that we
actually have a cap of what 250 we have
a 250 cash right we're giving out a bit
200 if you're experiencing buffering
right now if if if is what we're going
to be doing in the next couple weeks is
getting a dedicated server so that we
can on a gigabit to the net so that what
so we'll be able to transmit with
202,000 yeah two thousand concurrent
viewers if more than two thousand of you
guys show up all at once then it's gonna
get mighty expensive for huh I think
that for the time being will continue
hak5 live at a much higher quality so
cool thanks so much for the question it
was there anything else on your mind no
that's it that explains everything thank
you awesome alright well also i guess
i'd recommend you check out episode 2 x
061 we did last month where we covered a
lot of the hardware that's involved in
the video mixing okay i've been out of
the loop on the last few episodes yeah
we'll definitely check out the last one
cuz i think it sums up your question
better than we could live right now on
the spot
yeah okay Thank You us comment I think
we're up against our next break when we
get back from that I'm going to be
talking about recovering your WEP or wpa
passwords from the Windows registry and
then we'll tie it some loose ends give
some shoutouts and call this thing a
knight day or something
with two terabytes of transfer and 20
gigs of storage stream host may attack
five possible don't forget to go to
dreamhost calm and use coupon code hak5
for all of your web hosting these
you
and if we could get camera one yeah
wallhugger the hell was that you see
that uh you don't know what that was oh
I don't know what they always had the
script over there like we're in Block C
we're supposed to be doing welcome
there's something you just won the ad on
VTR yeah okay whew kepta said take a
look at that later okay whatever anyway
um lives yes back to the show well then
moving right along brick road along
there's um what's in it for me what's in
it for you what's in it for me Watson it
or what's in it I got you okay um
there's a thing that we said a long time
ago when we first started hack five and
that was we were never going to do a
tutorial on cracking WEP because there's
a million in one other videos and go out
there and watch and it's just cheesy and
hokey and script kitty LOL alright i
mean i'm sorry just I just don't want to
what correct besides like it's like the
first thing that anybody ever asks when
they feel it yes something prove prove
why you didn't do that well we didn't
want to do the web cracking pain because
they don't already been done a million
times ends over know okay but what I
recently found in our very own forms
under the questions board was a very
interesting thread about extracting wpa
and WEP keys from the windows registry
and I just sounds like the WPA awesome
WP you as well oh so if you head over to
223 you can take a look this is actually
the thread that that it was our friend
iron peak as in hello Harry down you
want to head over to three there you go
I am tired that's a question about
extracting WEP and wpa cues from the
windows registry and this is I swear
this is one of the reasons why i love
hak5
the community so much because um this is
just one of those cool things where you
can just start a question you've got a
thought and the next thing you know
things are piling up and piling up and
we've got answered just like we have so
many switchblade packages hacksaw
packages with the Pandora hack is now
like hello I don't think did Viacom buy
it now I'm there I don't know it's just
like it's it's gotten so massive so I
mean bad pops got to everybody in this
thread and imd for bringing this up and
one of the suggestions was actually this
really nifty tool from nirsoft you may
be familiar with them if you've ever
played with nurse CMD or nir CMD really
cool pro it's part of a lot of us
Witchblade packages that allow you to do
from the command line cool things like
Jack the cd-rom oh is that is I like
where the superscript we come through or
you to piss somebody off will not just
that it actually has some very like
useful stuff like changing the volume by
the command line you know so when you're
like automating everything you know
batch filing your job and now the things
like that this is a great way to to do
that so if you haven't heard of nirsoft
or nursery md definitely head over to
NRS oft com that's where you can find
this program and this is the wireless
key view tool and it will recover your
wpa and WEP keys recover right i mean if
you know you might infect one of the
coolest things is it's actually a
command-line tool if i head over to my
desktop and wire list okay so this is um
i'm gonna do it the command line way cuz
it's way more fun that way and maybe
you've got like a USB key that
automatically runs a batch file on it
recovers information from a target
computer this would be terribly cool
thing to add to it so i'm just going to
go ahead and delete my test i'll let it
create a min ago and i'm going to run
the wireless key program so tomorrow's
qex see lips there you go and i'm going
to do the S text I so it's /x text s / s
text right and then a file so I'm going
to do a dot txt right and what that does
is now
the dir here I've got my blog at exe and
I'm going to Paul can you give us fifty
percent opacity on this okay i'm going
to type long txt and those are web keys
and wpa keys and that's all you'll see
and hopefully those enough to keep them
from being too visible on the stream go
ahead and launch the program normally
just in the the GUI what's just so funny
about this program is that you know all
of us that are pretty you know security
aware and you know protecting our
information and everything else you
don't save passwords you don't save user
logon and with any website you go to
like firefox gives you the option would
you like to see but no no never never
don't let it do that no never never
never never you'll forget it and two
will remember it exactly like it if
there's it if a password is saved on
your computer it can be recovered right
more specifically stolen but nobody ever
thinks about the fact that when you
enter a WEP key or wpa key in for your
wireless networking it saves it where's
the option right I mean I I'm gonna play
noob here I guess I haven't looked
around enough but where's that I'm
guessing it's in the registry somewhere
I guess so but is a Rob take a look at
Rob going by Brett what you wanted to
chime in and all you who know me i hate
microsoft don't playing babe come on
tiger vista that is default so it
doesn't say the password for web key wpa
it's not it gives you the option to save
it but it will not let me wish you a
round of applause for that and here's
one for Microsoft so so I guess what Rob
trying to say is that they're actually
making a step in the right direction
we'll see I know I do there but they're
putting me in words like with vista
they've incorporated a lot of things
like OSX dutch where if you're going to
run a command or you're going to you
know running execute a program or run
you change certain system configurations
it's like are you sure you want to do
them okay
which can get kind of buggy but
completely off we're going on a tangent
here but I'll just go ahead and say it
right now I believe that all of that
warning dialog is putting the security
on the user and I believe that every
user needs to be educated and understand
security but we're talking about the
average user and if you're watching this
show you're not the average user to
obviously above it yeah so I think
they're all just going to hit ok cancel
whatever continue ignore and that's in
the long run going to hurt security
because really I think the best security
is both on the OS level and on the
education of the users so they
understand what they're doing and if
they just get so used to hitting ignore
ok whatever it's like where I feel like
we're taking a step backwards there but
well this is a rant we should damn I
really want to get into this
conversation you're retorted well here's
the thing though because like I
bedazzling I was playing with OSX and I
was trying to install office for mac you
know and my boss like i was doing it for
my boss's computer you know his billable
hours are way higher than mine so i do
all the grunt work well so he's like I
want office on this mac on a macbook pro
sure drop the CD in it's like I need the
user password the administrative
password damn and it's like his super
duper double top secret alpha omega 40
character long password with a new blog
and like like every special character on
the number row uh-huh so he's not going
to give that to me yeah obviously so he
goes in types of me so go in the other
room yeah well no I walk in I hold the
laptop in front of me then he types it
yeah and then I go back to my office and
I continue the installation then it asks
for the password again and I have to get
up and walk back to his office ask him
to enter the password he enters it I
walk back and I continue the pet
continue the installation it's like oh
you need to update fine give me a
password damn yeah but you don't want
that linux as rude when you were running
BST did you run his route i don't know i
had i built my own linux is BST but no
intentional like I know it's you I'm not
just has been slashed at will and me but
but yeah okay I'm so sorry everybody in
IRC is that OS Wars not the place not
the time sorry keep that in iris Eve we
will continue anyway so what we were
getting at was this whole WEP and wpa
recovery from the registry um for web
keys okay there are so many what's your
favorite tool to crack WEP key to switch
over to order Kenji I'm sorry to again
aircrack-ng you with us women love it
Paul hello aircrack-ng is the standard
it's been around for a while I thought
I'm talking about out of something with
cows oh oh yeah I'm sorry cow patty cow
patty is made by render man and the
church of Wi-Fi of a great job at church
of Wi-Fi church my fire and they do a
great job at making rainbow tables that
go into cow patty that practice
standards yes I mean yeah I was gonna
say because the thing with wpa is the
SSID salts the password right if I
entered into the best work so anyway um
I guess what we're trying to say is we
didn't want to talk about web cracking
it available to you know check your
notes or the forms or whatever wpa
difficult to crack I've seen some
rainbow table stuff for common passwords
or I'm sorry naw Kham passwords comment
s SI es like for the linksys SSID
linksys so I'm going to change your path
you're going to enable weapon out a
password don't you think you would
change the city is ready so rather than
trying brute force from just sitting out
there in the cold forever you're going
to get frost bit and you might as well
just go into the office the flower guy
or whatever and USB key this program
recovers the WEP and wpa keys from the
registry yeah but it does it in hash
right well no it does it in what an x
value the hex values on this now and
also a jewelry yet go ahead and switch
yeah you can open it now this is what it
looks like and basically here are all of
the W I'm sorry that the Wi-Fi access
points that I connect you and I can see
that this one's got web and this one's
got web and the rest of them are wpa-psk
it gives us the hex value i'm not going
to scroll over because then you'll see
the whole hex value but that hex value
itself
all you women is the equivalent I mean
if you convert it back to a ski it's not
may not be the the same thing that they
entered in but that's just because it
will generate multiple ones right if you
use this program on somebody else's
machine but you know maybe you're over
at your friend's house and and they
forgot their you want to get on their
wireless network but they saved it and
since they saved it they no longer know
what it is right right then this would
be a perfect tool to run on the machine
to actually find out what their wpa key
is and then just give it the hex value
when you connect using whether you're
using the windows 0 wireless compare or
whatever whatever the proprietary yeah
like wireless cell garden that yeah the
Intel crap I hate that thing here but
long story short what it's going to do
is it's going to rip the hex value out
of the registry right no matter no
matter who is managing the wireless
connection and then all you would have
to do is then enter beckon enter this
hex value back in because when it goes
to check encryption it's like what close
enough hey that's yeah works for me no
guys little no yeah bring back over here
we got a relay on to http at Yoda web de
for 8,000 y battery life y OU ta w eb d
rock on nice cool relatable thank you ok
so relay the people that are watching it
right now if you want to get on that
stream at guess there would be more
tense too for that matter say it's an
IRC again cool um and you know what
reallys are welcome I you know what
let's adjust your little things real
quick there have been a few questions
that have come up so many times one is
we actually released under Creative
Commons license and what that means
we're a non-commercial attribution
share-alike license translation that
means you can distribute our content as
much as you want you give it everybody
you can cut it apart remakes it back
together throw it on YouTube just the
part would dare and hit the set and
getting hurt and maybe lower like I in
an entire montage of Darren getting hit
that's perfectly fine as long as we're
you know you give attribution to us you
know its attack five and use the content
so it was actually but if you decide to
use it for anything commercial you have
to come
have to ask us for our explicit
permission that's it otherwise you are
free to cede distribute download 500
times burn 5000 disks give them to your
friends that's fine we want you to do
that yeah we've done so many questions
from like people that are like in the AV
like like in our college and they want
to put it on there / the AV group and
the women in the dorm closed circuit TV
system and I'm like dude yeah that's
perfectly fine that is not against our
license so anyway that's just a clear up
that license thing can't actually
remember oh and rebroadcasting so if you
want to rebroadcast a stream by all
means do that we'll have a deadly sewer
hopefully for the next episode and that
should hold two thousand but you know
the more the merrier yeah exactly that's
great we greatly appreciate it the more
people that can tune in live the better
we feel and the just like the the more
happy people there are yes I think that
puts us at c4 yep which is where we come
in I in a tie up a couple loose ends
there is a loose end right here want to
give a shout out to somebody that's been
very involved in a very active member
when it comes to development of projects
you might know him from the switchblade
his name is Amish he's very cool and
there's a talent that he has the I no
idea I was talking to him once and I
just like to pimp his stuff because it
is so cool check this out if you want to
just well if you just want to switch
over to this YouTube clip yeah this is
actually how Amish and who knew it was
such an awesome freestyle walking runner
freerunners is actually called marker
over in Europe rock on so anyway Matt
shoutouts to Amish definitely head over
to youtube I'll put this in the show
notes do because it's just that cool for
the end of the show the guys actually
want to see a tour of the studio what a
tour of the studio I want to see a small
tour this video this is just a few can
they just make seen the studio there's
yeah we're on a tether we can we can we
can do a quick little spin I couldn't ok
I'm going to put in the kitchen if you
want to
I can show you the downstairs Oh Paul if
you want to switch the camera tail just
go ahead and please and then around yeah
yeah okay shake it off the tripod okay
let me just that's all yes all right
well you're about to get very dizzy
snack ok this is this notice anything
broadcast console there's a broadcast
console hate depth at the Here I am hi
yeah I'm a complete tool the monolith
influence the 32 inch LCD the break
walls Acura what's John oh look there's
John and moves all they're trying to
crack our web or they're trying to crack
a wpa okay and then if I can these are
the light so you probably can't see this
is a living room that's real kind of
much as I can show you of it he lights
and we gotta wrap up here in just
seconds to let me put this back up oh
and in the kitchen that you already saw
so I guess you guys ever want to switch
off of that so they don't get the
busyness yeah the brillant Blair Witch
