airport docks about the Queen were found
on a USB Drive and Google plans to
remove HTTP public key pinning all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings I
am Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for October 31st 2017 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom happy Halloween
everyone
I am NOT in costume because I am
recording a day early and I forgot to
bring in my costume oh well our patreon
is over at patreon.com slash threat wire
that's the best way to support the show
and it will help us reach our next goal
a quick reminder as well hack five is
doing a month-long contest over at hack
5 org slash contest to enter for your
chance to win daily giveaways post your
creative hack 5 gear photo to Twitter
Instagram or Facebook with the hashtag
hashtag hack 5 gear and you could win
$100 hack 5 gear gift certificates
perfect for the holidays and now onto
the news so first off a huge thanks to
Eric and Zach for sharing this news over
on our patreon community tab for the
very past week new ransomware called bad
rabbit was spreading across Eastern
European countries such as Russia
Ukraine Turkey and Germany it was
targeted towards corporate networks and
demanded point 0 5 Bitcoin which is
about two hundred eighty five dollars as
of time of recording from victims before
unlocking the ransom data according to
Cisco Telos bad rabbit uses the eternal
romance NSA developed exploit which
bypasses SMB file-sharing security which
would allow an attacker to remotely
control the machine if it sounds
familiar that's probably because it was
also used by not Petya ransomware
earlier this year due to the
similarities in the code some
researchers are linking the two
malicious programs together by the same
actor the bad rabbit ransomware was used
in a drive-by attack against
corporations including new sites payment
systems and infrastructure offices it
was hidden inside of a fake Adobe Flash
Player installation executable so it
required a humans interaction with it to
actually initiate and download once it
was installed
bad rabbit would encrypt files with RSA
2048-bit keys and give victims 40 hours
to comply to the demands before
increasing the cost even more
interestingly it also uses free and open
source code from a legitimate program
which is called descriptor which is
basically used to encrypt a user's
computer currently there is no
decryption software available but
Microsoft did patch the eternal romance
vulnerability back in March of this year
if you're worried about ransomware
update your computer's obviously turn on
auto updates if you can disable WMI
services through the command prompt and
i've included a link with directions
below on how to do that and use good
internet hygiene whenever you're
clicking on links around the web and of
course if you do get infected having a
back-up plan is key to not having to
worry about ransomware and not having to
pay a ransom there are two sides to this
security coin number one never plug an
unknown device into your computer
especially a USB flash drive they could
be full of malicious data ready to
strike as soon as you plug it in when
hack five tested this theory of do
security researchers practice what we
preach we found that 62 of a 100 USB
rubber duckies were plugged into
computers that's bad folks and number
two if you are using a USB flash drive
to carry important sensitive material
keep it safe and keep it encrypted big
thanks to Michael for sharing this story
over on the patreon community tab it
turns out recently an unnamed British
man found a USB flash drive just chillin
in the street and he decided to plug it
into a computer at the library what he
found was so sensitive that he turned it
over to a Sunday Mirror reporter but not
before sifting through the data 76
folders containing unencrypted details
about Heathrow International Airport
were included maps of the airport
locations of CCTV cameras routes for the
Queen and other political figures maps
of escape tunnels timetables for
security patrols for the airport and the
list goes on and it gets workers 2.5
gigs worth all of which would be highly
valuable to criminals or threat actors
now nobody really knows how the USB
Drive got there
or whether the data was seen by other
individuals local police and airport
authorities heard about the news and are
investigating how this happened quite
some time ago Google engineers help
develop HTTP public key pinning that's
RFC 74 69 for the nerds like me out
there this protocol was designed to
reduce the risk of incidents of
man-in-the-middle attacks over TLS
connections by pinning or remembering
host certificates and matching the
certificate fingerprints with that of
the host HP KP for short is supported by
Chrome Firefox and opera but Google
Chrome is removing support for it by May
29th 2018 over time HP KP will be
deprecated until completely and
supported on that date they decided to
remove its support because an attacker
could use workarounds to still target a
user using malicious pins or
compromising a web server because of
this chrome is recommending developers
use certificate transparency and the
expected CT header for their certs
luckily adoption of HTTP public key
pinning was rather low so consumers
probably won't see a difference in their
browsing as usual though you can check
if a site is securely using certificates
by looking for that little green lock
icon and the wording secure or a
certificate issuer name followed by the
website address that you are visiting in
the address bar a big huge thank you to
all of the wonderful people who
contribute to patreon.com slash threat
wire you are the reason that we can keep
on bringing you news every single week
even on Halloween we are on the way to
our next goal which allows me to upgrade
some of our equipment for this set
including that stupid light that decided
to die last week as well as open up a
live video Q&amp;amp;A just for patrons each and
every month and that is all of our
patrons any little bit helps us grow the
show and in return you'll get access to
a bunch of extras on patreon we might
even feature your adorable fur baby in
an upcoming episode just like these
they're so cute check out the perk
levels on patreon and thanks again for
helping us keep the show completely
independent and of course if you cannot
donate you can hit that subscribe button
or you can share this episode on your
favorite social media page and with that
I'm Shannon Morse and I will see you on
the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
