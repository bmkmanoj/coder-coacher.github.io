multi-touch tables with the guys from
three mates
my father's brought to you by mass
effect to assemble your team fight for
the lost go to assist express and domain
com got a great idea it all starts with
a great domain hello welcome to hack
five my name is darren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse and this is of course your
weekly dish Tecna listen here we are
back in the studio back at the studio
whoa what are we doing in here no we
haven't been here for like six weeks I
know and we're not gonna feel like we
were at CES for like five weeks so yes
will do that to you yeah that's true
yeah Oh feel so tiring but it's good to
be back home yes right before we ship
out again because we're gonna be at
shmoocon so yeah are up in DC when is
that that's like two weeks ah that is
februari fifth through the seventh so
I'm not sure how that falls as far as
the two weeks yeah yeah I'm so excited
only two more episodes of this season
Wow yeah wait what episode are we on I
lost count uh 624 oh okay yeah wow so
that means 625 626 and then we start
season seven yay season seven is gonna
be very exciting i've been tooling up
for this thing for quite a while can be
been plenty of awesome stuff coming up
yes i'm super excited okay so we're not
gonna be in studio for very long though
because that's just what we've been
doing lately we took the mobile rig over
to a nondescript location here in
williamsburg to go check out some
multi-touch goodness yeah let's go check
out what our friends over at three mates
have built guys you know as well as I do
that the future is here and it's a
big-ass table yes that's right we were
talking about multi-touch we are at a
nondescript location here little wood
shop right outside of a CIA training
facility in williamsburg virginia and i
have the pleasure of being Brady Simpson
from m38 or I'm sorry three days that's
how I guess three mad you had to work
Lee yeah we're gonna have to get people
on a set set pronunciation well I mean I
just like how it's like it's totally
leet speak yeah me name yeah so we're
talking multi-touch this is all the rage
I mean you can do it on you know you've
probably already doing it on your iPhone
your your your grocery store
going to the grocery store didn't like
that so yeah probably were on TV too yes
on TV as well all the other whether
people now with the you know it's great
i love it so what is multi-touch well
multi-touch is a interaction between a
user and a set of components and it's a
way of doing things you know you hear
about the GUI and now i think the
transformation is going towards the
newly the natural user interface so
multi-touch is basically a set of
hardware components that recognize you
know multiple touch points on a screen
or surface okay and turn it into
software and we've done touch screens
before in hak5 we recently did just a
capacitive touchscreen on a 19 inch
panel and it's pretty cool we use it
actually for our production but it's not
multi-touch by any stretch of the
imagination I can't you know touch two
points and how many us recognize it in
emulations how does how does multi-touch
that what are the different kinds of
multi-touch as far as the surfaces are
concerned okay well there's a few
different kinds of methods for
multi-touch you know for something like
the iPhone there's going to be different
layers that they use different
substrates and in between these layers
there's going to be sort of like a grid
and in each grid there's going to be
sensors and these sensor these track the
pressure from your fingers and track the
prompt the points and send it into a
software program and that's how I can
have that on my little pocket device
yeah yeah basically it's a grid of
sensors and in between substrates and
layers now have you seen that scale up
because because now we're talking about
like huge displays you know yeah a
couple of feet even for these
informational stuff like does that scale
have you seen that used that technology
use for the really big ones I haven't
seen that used on something like a
multi-touch table you know it's more the
methods used for a huge interactive
table are going to be more similar to
this you know in CNN they use a
projection style method and right here
we have a frustrated total internal
reflection method and it uses a few
components
it's pretty pretty different it's almost
like night and day between iPhone in an
interactive table like this so let's get
down into what these different
components are because there's a lot to
it so this table right here has you know
a display it's got optics it's got light
it's got a bearing a ray of several ways
tunes right to capture what when you put
your fingers on that and move it around
so when you look down at that you've got
you know your display of whatever your
application is you can touch it in
interact with the environment just how
would naturally feel to just kind of
like on your iPhone but bigger now oh
let's go ahead and just talk about the
the ways that we can capture okay so
this one right here or I'm sorry not not
even let's talk about the display first
so this is based on an LCD screen yes
this is based on an LCD screen like a
basically your standard LCD TV you can
use a LCD monitor it's what we've got
going anyway I'm one of those right here
yeah we do um it's over there we can
just bring that here and basically what
you want to do is take apart the LCD
take apart the TV we're going to use all
the components or nearly all of them
thank you sir so you guys have been
doing this for a while this is one of
the panels you've taken apart there's a
32 this is a 32 inch LCD panel this is
just a thin liquid crystal display that
the pixel it's going to be you know
pixelated and this is the display that's
actually inside your TV okay and it's
kind of crazy because you put this up to
let you can't see through this you can't
see through it as soon as it turns on
it's completely visible it's not really
transparent work yeah yeah exactly
that's so crazy so when this powers out
we can see right through it that's very
much how this is working exactly we're
measuring this on you can see straight
through it on this one and okay so what
about the there's also i've seen
projection used yeah i mean we've got a
few there's a few different methods
there's ftir which is we what we use and
then there's also a rear diffused
illumination method and that's where
you're shooting the light up into the
acrylic instead of shooting it from the
side and that uses you know you can use
a projection with that too
now what's ftir what does that mean ftir
means frustrated total internal
reflection and basically that's kind of
just a big big way of saying infrared
light is scattered through the acrylic
panel in this case okay and basically
you have the lights surrounding the
acrylic panel and the scattered light is
going to be through the acrylic and when
you press your finger on there that's
the point of contact so rather than
being different substrates with like an
array of there's red there's just your
finger pressing down on the acrylic
which scatters yeah and like this is the
invisible you know you can't see the
light it's not visible to the human
human eye but when you press your finger
down the point of contact it scatters
infrared and that's when the camera
picked it okay so that's the other part
of it though is captures exactly so
rather than like a capacitive or a
resistive touch panel where there's no
like optics involved you guys are
actually using a camera yes is that what
is that the reason why it's a table you
know that yeah that's that's mainly the
reason why it's a table because we need
that space in between the camera and the
the acrylic okay so this guy is a 19
inches well this is a 19 inch at two and
a half feet tall or something yeah about
two and a half feet tall and you again
that's for the space between the camera
and the acrylic and we've got we've got
infrared lights all around the top of
the acrylic and we've got it house and
you know sturdy frame and everything's
alright cool before we get into yeah I
think ok so we've touched on the
different methods of detection you're
saying that you guys use the ftir I use
ftir and then LLP ello he is a laser
light plane that's a different method
it's a little different because instead
of using infrared lights it's using
lasers and it's kind of the same concept
you press your finger down and it's
going to scatter the light and that's
how the optics are going to pick up and
it's going to run to the tracking
program okay now all of these now we're
talking about lighting here we're not
even talking about like the visible
spectrum we're talking about something
that's going to be picked up on the
camera here that's not in
fearing with the display yes now the
once we've taken this panel out yes
there's nothing lighting this no I
noticed he actually have one here this
is a backlight when you take apart the
LCD there's going to be a back light
that comes with it and this is going to
be housed inside of the multi-touch to
provide you know ample light so that
when you turn on the LCD you can get
that that affect their same send you
right through yeah exactly okay so this
right here is from a 32 inch with 32 it
yeah tell of LCD TV and what are these
little guy these are these are the bulbs
these are the cathode lights okay on the
on the backlight and nowadays a lot of
the the higher on TVs are going LED yeah
ad you see a lot of that nowadays what
are the other types of lighting that
you're seeing and like computer monitors
or how do you you know assist the
lighting that because once you take it
out you've got you got a huge space and
you know you're going to need some extra
light to support that in and substitute
for that difference in space so you're
going to want some added lighting in
there you can use cold cathodes you know
you can pretty much almost use anything
in there you use like a tungsten yeah
you can use tungsten bulb you know and
most of the time you want to stick with
the fluorescent lighting though because
it has that kind of blue hue and that's
what's going to look best on the LCD
awesome alright well we're going to take
a quick break and when we get back we're
going to take a tour of the x19 unit
this thing is absolutely gorgeous these
guys at three made do an excellent job
of putting together some turnkey
multi-touch cheese and some kits and all
sorts other fun stuff so stay tuned

got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain com Aaron I feel
like there's something between us I
don't know maybe it's uh maybe it's some
kind of cool device yeah so this is the
x 19 this is the actual hardware you've
gone ahead and built based on what is
this 19-inch oh right this is a 19 inch
acer widescreen monitor that we have
taken apart and turned into a
multi-touch great so you guys have been
doing this for a while now is probably
like what your your your 10th build or
some pie it's it's close to that it's
it's been a learning experience there's
been a couple wrecked multi touches but
we've we've got our process down to it
to a science well yeah it looks great
looks like it just came off an assembly
line I was hoping that maybe make it
crack it open take a look at what's
inside and kind of get a tour of the
whole Union how you went about
constructing this okay well that's
actually really easy with this unit we
designed this so that we could take off
one of the panels if we need to make any
adjustments or show it off we made it so
this is actually a magnetically on here
so as you can see it easily comes off we
also have screws at the top which allow
it to come in there even more solid we
have taken those off so that we can show
this easier but we've got four magnets
on here that keep this sheet on there
nice and tight that's very inventive
elica it's kind of like your you know
your computer side panel so rather than
have to take a whole case off right it
right in there and and so the first
thing I noticed right off the bat we got
a shelf here so and empower and
everything so we could put the computer
inside of there right this way we
designed this was we didn't technically
need this space but we wanted the users
and whoever purchases these multi-touch
to be able to put their computer in here
so this would be an all-in-one unit so
we added a little bit of depth
you could even fit a desktop computer in
here if you want it to and that's why
there's the extra space and that also
brings this up to a good level of course
not right now on this table but when it
is on the floor this is going to be make
a great coffee table at pack house and I
can't wait to start playing with that so
tell me that some of the other
components in some of the bill what goes
into actually constructing this okay
well if I take you down the line you
have your acrylic panel then you have
your LCD screen then you have all the
components for your LCD screen you have
your extra lighting you have your back
lighting that comes with the LCD you
have your camera and then you have all
the other wires and components that are
going to need and that basically is the
rundown of how the multi-touch is built
now this panel here you see in which
dude in together it looks really great
with this brushed aluminum you got some
pieces arrow is hoping maybe you could
show me how that right I'm just a gong
now here's a little example I haven't
brushed this aluminum but we put a nice
brush on here and here is a sample of
acrylic we use a thick very durable
acrylic and basically what we do is we
cut this aluminum to the link that we
need and then we sandwich it in here now
there's a little trick to it getting the
lights in there but you can kind of see
that this is how it's done and this
gives us a very snug fit ok cool and now
you have you have another one put
together with the LEDs you want to grab
that so we can take a look I thought
that was really really cool right here
you can kind of see this was a little
bit of a testing unit but basically you
can kind of see how we were just testing
to see these infrared lights on this
acrylic and basically what you got up
you can see this so yeah so what are
these right here is the infrared lights
and that is what goes in between this
bar and this acrylic so this is all just
kind of sandwiches divider this was a
testing panel so it isn't the correct
thickness but this you can kind of see
we'll go in like that and hold the
infrared lights in there and there's no
other like there's there's no other like
some straight or something like that
and we need to sandwich together to get
that reflection off those LEDs so it
feels really solid what is this this is
like oh this is uh we don't get too much
into the details but basically this this
is the kind of acrylic you could sit on
in it and it's not going to go anywhere
you we really want to take it out to the
yeah we really want to take it out to
the testing range and in see a couple
lines at it yeah yeah I don't we'll take
the palm out first so this we don't want
to do on this version but there's one
that we would like to see if we can have
people standing on there may be dancing
nice see a little multi-touch dance
floor action ariga right actually that's
one of our concepts that we're thinking
about ooh exciting all right so that is
the the panel the LEDs the the plexi
glass or acrylic open in there I like
the nice little bezel we guy here going
on and then so what about the actual box
this you've got a wooden one over here
when your prototypes what about this one
for the x-linked on this one we used
metal columns in all four corners we've
got two pieces of very sturdy wood at
the top and the bottom and this is what
makes the unit so light and then we have
metal sheets that go in between here and
then some stuff to help bounce off the
light appropriately but basically we
have something that's made out of mostly
metal a little bit of wood and it's it's
very durable it's lightweight i'd say
around 15 pounds so basically got the
wood on the top one on the bottom and
then we have the shelf which holds some
of the other parts okay so tell me about
the the lighting that's going on in here
now this piece right here is the actual
backlight that key from the 19-inch but
it's it's not enough when we've got a
two-foot throw so what are we sitting
here so basically when you take apart
this LCD screen just like Brady
explained you have the LCD panel and
then you have the backlighting and one
of the interesting features is the
backlighting on a smaller LCD screen is
a little bit different than the
backlighting on a bigger LCD screen and
this one isn't as bright on the smaller
ones what's actually in here
I'm not a hundred percent sure I think
it's a some form of LED okay um but I'm
not sure so what we have is since this
lighting is not bright enough we add
some of our own lights and they add a
lot of more they make it a lot easier to
see especially in the daytime mm-hmm
well what are some of the trickier part
you were telling me something about this
cable here that that was a real pain and
Crichton with some of the earlier builds
little less and learn then there you
want to share that with us oh yes this
is in an LCD screen when you if you take
one apart you have what's called the FCC
issue which is the cable that goes from
the LCD screen to the to the board to
all the circuitry and this cable is very
sensitive and you actually to be really
careful that you don't you don't have
anything happen to it because then you
won't get a proprietary screen you have
to make sure this cable is long enough
or you're not going to be able to
separate the parts and that again is the
FCC issue okay so you've done this with
a bunch of different correct LCD panels
is there one manufacturer that you like
over at others on so far the panel's
that we've used have all been pretty
much similar the LCD screens that are
made with more plastic than metal are
actually a little bit easier oh really
it's just easier to take apart with the
acer monitors they are they're good for
taking apart because they're cheap um so
you know if you're not on a budget you
can go more expensive but this monitor
has been just fine for us awesome thank
you so much for giving me a tour now in
just a bit we're going to go ahead and
get into the software the demos all the
fun nitty gritties of this but first I
want to thank those fabulous fun people
that fund these fun project
say that's 10 times faster I couldn't
say it at all Judy I'd love to drive the
three hours to Annapolis but I think we
can fix your kitten screensaver from
here I just need you to open port 5900
on your firewall firewall get little
boxy thing the internet goes through
look at me just a year ago what a noob
trying to do tech support the hard way
little did I know go to assist Express
is the easiest way to control another
person's computer online provide instant
support to your friends family members
and clients and amaze them by getting it
all done over the internet you lower
your support costs you lower your travel
time and you can even provide support
remotely even when your client isn't
physically at their computer brought to
you by citrix all go to assist express
sessions are encrypted 128-bit
end-to-end and you get twenty four seven
support so try go to assist express free
for 30 days and you go to go to assist
calm / hak5 don't be a noob like me so
ready we've got the x19 down here we've
got it hooked up to the laptop put the
camera on here so viewers at home can
actually see what's on this leg let's go
ahead and get it running what's the
software that's involved in making all
of this magic happen okay well right now
we're running an open-source software
and that's really nice for us because
it's free and it also works really well
a big proponents of open source on this
show exactly okay so what is the first
component once we've got the webcam
interface with our operating system
whether that's like Windows XP or blenda
whatever sure what do we have to do to
get the image that the webcam seeing
working with all the applications okay
well once you have everything in terms
of that you need a driver for your
webcam and once you have all that
situated you're going to want to
download the open source software
obviously and once you start running it
you're going to want to calibrate it
before you get to the application so
what kind of open source software are we
using here okay right now we're running
CC v 1.2 and there's a CC v 1.3 which
enables another webcam to be stitched
and opens up the possibility for as big
of a multi-touch as you can pretty much
so we could have multiple web cams for
what
for better calibration better better
tracking accuracy and it basically opens
up the length that you can go to so we
could actually have like a table that I
saw one at the kodak booth at CES just
recently that was like 20 feet long four
feet wide absolutely read exactly
they're going to be using multiple
multiple cameras sweet and you also have
much lib okay touch nose yeah I was
going to say we have touch lib which is
you know a little bit older and it also
comes with a few good applications too I
like it was we have reference season
four we did that when we talked about
the multi-touch mini which is kind of
like this but so far off base it's like
the cardboard box and paper asian LCD
included so this is really cool I can
see here on the software in the ccv you
can see in this image we're actually
seeing like you can see my hands through
here kind of like in a very ghost
hunters kind of way and and it's crazy
because you can like on my end I can't
see through this LCD I can't see the
camera inside there I can't see the
other components inside the x19 but it
can see my hands exactly so so what do
we have to do to get this all calibrated
so what we've got going here is a few
different filters on and each different
each multi-touch is going to have a
different settings you're going to want
to have different settings so right now
we have the smooth and the high pass on
okay so according to light you know
amount of light you know stuff like that
you're going to want to change the
settings accordingly so as soon as we
take this back to the hack house i'm
going to want to recalibrate exact room
the environment all that exactly
recalibrate and adjust the settings to
your environment how do we go about that
in the ccv okay so right now what we're
going to want to do is press C to enter
out the calibration okay and then we're
going to press C again to start the
calibration i'll go ahead and all right
there we go so I just hold my finger
until the red lights are blue exactly
and this is easy I could do this all day
so this is very similar to to like if
you had a pocket pc or a palm exactly
you know going to go old school and say
handspring visor you guys remember those
and then we're going to want to go back
to a CC CC v mainframe and this is where
you want to choose to either send it to
to e4 flash or 20 s
oh well send was so I'm seeing like I
got the image here okay so when I put my
finger down I can see you can see the
truck truck blobs uh-huh and ones yeah
and the to e is the protocol which is
going to send it's basically going to
communicate with your application and
the tracking program okay so that's the
bridge that's so that's what we call
that it's speaking exactly at you and
then okay so I've got all five fingers I
got 10 on here how many I've got five
all right I've got 20 excellent we've
got 30 different points now and it's
tracking them all in real time that is
crazy exactly this is a solid and sturdy
program alright sweet so we've got this
running would just minimize this yeah
we're just going to minimize this and
then you're going to want to bring up
your applications so these are demo apps
where do we get these well basically
most of these applications are going to
actually come on the open source
software such as ccv or touch lip and
there's also an array of software online
nui group that you can just download
okay and we're going to be using flash
applications so in that case we do one
like let me just say spec-wise on a
machine Bowl would we need to actually
you know run this I mean it's pretty
much your standard entertainment pc you
know intel core 2 duo maybe two
gigabytes of ram at least okay so so
your average pc from the last few years
exactly and the nice thing about this is
that you can even use these in a browser
such as Internet Explorer and you don't
have to have an expensive you know
macromedia flash player or whatever
there we go sweet and I could probably
do that in chrome or firefox on linux
full screen it exactly and that's what
we're doing so what is this demo here so
this is a photo app and i've gone in and
added my own pictures which everyone can
do like like this picture here of your
doggy exactly alright so we get it and
then this is intuitive this is just I
didn't even have to ask you how to use
this I'm sorry stealing your photo here
oh there's your cat lighthouse somebody
went down to outer banks oops that's
very cool so it's exactly as you would
expect it to
to work yeah and you know you can resize
the whole frame and zoom in and okay and
then we've got some other apps these are
ones that we've actually just downloaded
all right so what is this program do
okay well this program is called art Jen
and it's basically just another fun app
that you could use in a bar or a club
and you know people just go crazy
awesome so let's let's try it out oh
that's it you just you just start touch
that's it this is just another cool
visual app all right then we can like
make it all funky if we want yeah and
you know you if you leave your finger
there the shapes are going to follow and
go to your exact position so can we
customize this any or exactly you can on
the side you see the storm settings you
can customize the shapes and everything
sighs and then here's some of the
options you know you can you can change
the shapes here is it says go to
position or the scale you can change
that the shapes you've got a few
different shapes in there I'm sure you
can upload your own let's try shape 5
alright sweet there we go I like that
there's enough options in there that I
could stay entertained especially with a
couple of cocktails for quite a while
exec alright so let's get to another app
here all right so what is this one okay
well this is called the tank game we

be a little off on the tracking but
basically it seems to be pretty good all
right so it looks like a glutamic
controlling year I got a little tank guy
and oh ok so I'm controlling his uh his
little what are they called tracks or
whatever yeah i can put whoa there we go
it's at you yeah I'm just spinning

cool colors if you had to go you can see
the ripples going through the water or
in this case these are all flash
applications that are just paying
attention to the protocol that to you
say that the ccv is sending to it so I'm
sure if you were a developer you could
learn how to interface with that
protocol and next thing you know you're
