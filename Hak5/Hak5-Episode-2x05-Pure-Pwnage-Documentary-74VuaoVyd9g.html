Canada you're watching hack 5 with
Darren Ali and Paul not forgetting one
guy's rock on the generation coming up
can't go learn like Tyler it just can't
do it it's outdated it's done forget it
find out how Wes integrates LEDs in
spray paint into crap Paul installs doom
in Linux on nothing and Oh Darren uses
PHP Apache and a cell phone to
accomplish Jack today on a very special
hack 5 the pureness documentary
hello happy hackers and welcome to
another episode of hack five I'm Wes I'm
Darin and this is the season of giving
and we were given the opportunity to go
up to Toronto Canada and document the
just crazy phenomenon that is the live
release of a pure ownage episode and if
you're not familiar with parentage
you've obviously been living under an
internet rock you need to head over to
peerage comm now before you see all
these spoilers and check out every
episode because it is the best show
online kay thanks bye
you've got 12 episodes to catch up on
including we've got a little possibly
some fun extra fun coming up so you know
mom's washing dishes you seeis is
vacuuming gather up the whole family and
for some karaoke yes a little sing-along
so stay tuned for that also at the end
of the show we're gonna announce the
details about the land party that's
coming up this month as well as a
possible beta live show something fun
like that so I guess we will see you on
the other side let's head up to Toronto
and check it out
well the way that we describe it is that
pure ownage is online television show
about internet culture and video games
and it's just really what it is is us
putting videos online we shoot videos
ourselves with our own gear and we use
the locations around where we live and
we've made up
some characters that are what we like to
think of as exaggerated versions of
ourselves so I play a film student I'm
interested in film in the in the show
and my brother Jeremy is interested in
video games and yeah that's basically
what we do well the show is a
mockumentary on the life of an aspiring
professional video game player named
Jeremy it's sort of delivered
episodically and that I think the you
know the reason it's successful or what
makes it really different is that it's
an authentic look at online video game
culture which is something the type of
content that that audience can't get
anywhere else because if you try to find
a video game content and media all you
get is crap on MTV it's written by staff
right you get stuff like Grandma's Boy
and you get stuff that doesn't in any
way represent how gamers actually feel
and talk and think and act and what they
care about so that's what parentage does
it fills that void and all the gamers in
the world so yeah well there's the
I'm the primary character actually I'm
the main guy because I'm always there
I'm the guy behind the camera but no no
the main characters Jeremy my brother
I played by Jarek kale and there's also
FPS Doug first-person shooter player and
we've got Miranda plant as Anastasia and
Dave the way was also in a few episodes
in season 1 all right Jeremy is the main
character he's the brother of the
filmmaker Kyle who's always behind the
camera and Jeremy is a you know he's
that kid that we've all encountered on
internet farms before I think anyone
that's gamed online to any extent has
encountered the Jeremy you know the law
Ruffalo newfag law kind of contributor
to discussion is that annoying kid that
is rude that always talks about how
awesome he is at the game and really
prides himself in being good at video
games and you know can really kick your
ass gemma is particularly funny because
he has an accent and that a lot of
people internationally they think it's a
Canadian accent but the truth is the
accent doesn't really exist the root of
the accent the idea behind it is that
it's a guy who has been essentially
raised in front of his computer monitor
and he's learned to talk and type which
is pretty evident by the way he talks
and types in these gaming communities
and he sort of had to learn how to
pronounce words on his own because you
know he didn't really pay attention to
school he doesn't watch movies and he's
not exposed to television these these
things that classically trained accents
into people and all these little
cultural idiosyncrasies that he lacks
and so that's Jeremy you know he's got
his it's got his own Sonne accent even
you know he's just he's a product of his
own basement I guess and so the idea of
how someone would turn out if they grew
up entirely in that environment Kyle is
sort of you know he's he's a guy that
has a little bit more experience with
the regular world then I think most of
the characters he's kind of
straight man at the bunch and he's he
sort of adds an element in the comedy is
when you know you couldn't imagine
looking through through Kyle's eyes as
the show is shot and saying who are
these crazy guys like you know a lot of
times we'll have the characters just you
know do something ridiculous and then
stop and look at the camera it doesn't
say Kyle what's the problem what's the
matter you know I always do this this is
normal alright but it's of course
something very abnormal okay seriously
guys I knew you guys were geeks but this
is a new level of geek like honestly you
can't be carrying around plastic guns I
really hope that you haven't shown this
to anybody give it to Doug seriously if
you Doug if you ever want to get a
girlfriend you know holy shit
Doug was an episode three which is
entitled that vs Doug we introduced the
FPS player the guy that's obsessed with
the headshot and he was a big hit a very
popular character of course a lot you
will play FPS you know I play a lot of F
guesses and Joel in real life plays a
lot of FPS is and he's particularly
violent when he loses and whatnot and
and I just thought it made so much sense
and someone who would play FPS
religiously would have to be that sort
of super hyperactive ADHD kind of guy
that is is is twitching and very
irritable
what's going on are you okay what's
going on go on top you just better go
dude
I think you just better go do you are
you okay just go man seriously just go
he you know he walked on in real life as
if you were in the game which is
actually a bit routed off reality
because I think a lot of gamers have
experienced this not just me but when
you play a game long enough if you get
so into it you're playing 810 hours a
day for a few days in a row when you
step outside in the real world you start
to perceive it as if it were the game
world you know you start to wonder you
know I could build a warfare right there
but I could squeeze it in and fit it
there and this and that and if you play
a lot of FPS you you sort of find myself
looking around corners and always trying
to be behind cover or something
subconsciously I find myself doing his
weird things so so that's what you know
we sort of gave that characteristic to
Doug that he's always in some level
inside the FPS still because you know he
plays so religiously then you know he
would sort of go around and pretend he's
playing the game like you know in some
kind of fantasy world where there's
violence but it's still all about a
video game it's not really true violence
you know we try to keep that line and
pure orange we're sure there's guns and
knives and we talk about killing people
and shooting them in the head but it's
really you know all about video game
violence which I think in the minds of
most gamers is completely different from
actual real-world violence and Anastacia
it was just the need to bring someone
female into the cast you know we didn't
want this big sausage fest forever and
and we thought what better xian'er than
an MMORPG to have a female play right
how does a considered sexist but it's
the truth most females that I know that
are gamers and play online they love Wow
and or EQ or you or whatever they really
got into because they're just such a
social game right the game itself is is
a is just about being social in the case
you know persistent state worlds and
Jeremy ladies are about fun don't you
have fun playing the games I mean don't
you have fun playing with me you get to
meet people and chat with them like
didn't you have fun making those friends
Anastasia was a character created before
actually I had an experience playing him
always personally what Jared had played
a lot of animals and we wanted to deal
with the addictive nature of these types
of types of games but a lot of people
have functional lives in RL where
they're playing mmo's they can have a
level 60 in world of warcraft it still
have a day job but we also wanted to
introduce a female character in the show
because we needed to have sort of that
balance and we'd like to introduce a
love interest for Jeremy as well so this
is also one of the reasons why Anastasia
was created okay hold on just one second
I got you something okay happy
Anniversary thank you
that felt really well that I think the
ultimate skill in an MMO is is the
ability to chat and persuade people to
give you that leap drop and I know that
for a fact and through my personal
experience that girls do very well at
persuading guys to give them loot drops
and whatnot so I think the ultimate MMO
player has to be a girl because you need
that voice on the Ventus we talk all the
guys and be giving you that staff of
kick-ass Dave is just Dave he was living
he was living the same place as Jarrod
at the time and living across the
hallway he stood in his daughter one day
and introduced himself to me and we just
really hit it off that I think the
second thing he ever asked me it was do
you play video games and I just got this
huge smile on my face and Dave's a good
gamer and Dave you know I'm like yeah I
you know I play games and Dave's like
really well
what games you play I'm like I don't
know you know I'm like smash brothers
and names like uh-huh
yeah and I'm like what but he's like oh
yeah me my friends play Smash Brothers
knowing these like
he's like obviously like that I own the
model like it's like I'm Asian
you know he's guessing obviously I own
the mall and he sort of had this funny
not not serious but it's just Dave he's
got this joking kind of like is if a
white guy's gonna be in a fighting game
attitude so we sat down and we played
some Smash Brothers for quite a few
hours and uh after many close calls but
no victory victories by Dave we were
just instant friends and he had this
respect for me that he had finally met a
gamer that maybe sort of met his match
and someone that he could play with so
we spent so many afternoons playing
Super Smash Brothers and we just really
hit it off and uh I consider now these
probably my best friend he was helping
us film one day he was actually holding
a lamp in episode 2 and Jarrod said hey
we've got put Dave in the show I was
thinking about this funny character
that's kind of like a racist Chinese guy
and he's talks about white barbarians
and yes that we thought was a pretty
pretty neat concept when he first met
Dave you know I was like God my name is
Dave right and we had talked to him what
was his actual name that way which we
thought was the coolest name ever you
know the way all right that way really
cool name so we thought oh what what you
know white barbarians we are to strip
them of his real name and label him
bland boring Dave you know that was that
was sort of a joke and in Episode three
let me introduce Dave at the end so we
did die Dave helped oh so here's like my
bike Dave here actually my name is Duane
but the white barbarians call me Dave
Dave things like a pretty funny guy
always sometimes and it's a need to have
him around because she's so funny you
know that's been fantastic but you know
Dave was never never an actor and he was
never been comfortable front of the
camera he didn't really like it so the
effect somewhat of being kind of famous
he walks around a lot me he's the most
in public by far and of any of us
because such an active guys in such a
good good health he just goes running
and and you know he was getting so he
obviously he then gets noticed a lot
more than anyone he didn't really think
the effect of his life was all that
positive of the show so he sort of you
know politely requested that maybe we we
ride him out in a positive way so so
that's what we did but we're still very
thankful you know the experience of
working with Dave was just a blast so
hopefully we'll get him for some cameras
or some
the convincing I'm sure eventually with
the master was also played by me is
played by me just because we couldn't
really find anyone else to play and this
was a at the time where we wanted to
introduce this PI ma type character you
know the guy who is just so good at
video games we were sort of in this this
transition period where we wanted to
expand the audience of the show and by
bringing different games we had FPS dug
and we had already planned to bring in
Miranda as the MMO girl but we wanted
Jeremy more specifically to not be RTS
Jeremy because after the FPS type
episode some people like oh so Jeremy's
RTS Doug's FPS I heard these guys and we
really want to know the lead in the show
not to be so cornered into a specific
genre but we wanted Jeremy then he
started the Luke's got lock of our
series right so we wanted him to to be
this ultimate gamer and then we needed
something to to change his mind about
other types of games if one wants to
truly we must begin your training
immediately so we sort of introduced
this figure that is his teachings and
the one person in the world that Jeremy
treats with respect I guess the one guy
that maybe he wouldn't hump if he ever
managed to feed him one day or something
I don't know I think it worked out
really well you know me so they wanted
to add that level of proneness that is
just surreal and of course in Episode
four that's the first time where the
camera leaves Kyle's sort of hand and
you have the cinematic mode when in the
black bar so it's sort of cinema mode
it's the first time you ever cut to
cinema and that's when a lot of people
realized hey there maybe it's a
it shows a little bit more fake than I
had previously thought and we sort of
introduced the idea that there is a
school and that in that the abilities
that Jeremy has you know are something
that are being monitored by you know
these higher powers or something or
maybe it's being taught I don't know it
allowed us the opportunity to give
Jeremy superhuman abilities because we
we've probably that we created me on
this almost not Hogwarts but the
existence of this place where guys are
so good that they can play four games at
the same time and it set world record
times you know these are guys that you
know that just uh they take gaming to a
completely different level to the point
where it's like fantasy so and that's to
master well the story so far we've done
12 episodes and in the first few
episodes we started to introduce their
characters around episode six we started
to have sort of boy-girl type stuff
going on as we visited different gaming
genres and we dealt with different
themes in in video games MMO addiction
you know LAN tournaments whizzers I was
with Atlanta getting all the characters
go to a LAN tournament so we sort of
build the characters a bit you know then
we get introduced to his teacher and
mentor and the idea of these schools and
whatnot and we started expanding the
sort of fantasy gaming element then
we've introduced this other sort of
fantastic story about the big bad gaming
army and the masters gaming army and
what's going on with that and having you
know the power of micromanagement the
gamers if they get good enough in micro
they can have these you know fantastic
blue ball powers that you'll have some
sort of you know harmful effect when
they hit somebody and it's all
relatively ambiguous but we wanted to
introduce these elements to add an
epicness to the story
and then the last few episodes it all
comes together and so this there's a lot
of a lot of cinematic moments and a lot
of epic storytelling them and we really
sort of brought out some fantasy
elements in the gaming and I guess in
the whole when you sit back and look at
it it looks like there's sort of a
transition from really grassroots
mockumentary into what's become this
this you know this this hybrid
mockumentary is dramatic comedy that is
in his parentage I think initially there
was initially people were surprised when
we did this but we kind of you know we I
guess we were watching a lot of Buffy
the Vampire Slayer at the time and we
wanted to introduce sort of just this
world with that most people don't know
about but only gamers know about them
the super powers involved so and that
allowed us to have you know epic things
like you know at the end of episode 12
FPS time turning to the dark side it
kind of you know and it's Jim Jeremy's
in peril
alright you know we wouldn't been able
to really do that or if we were sticking
to a hyper-realistic environment and we
only had you know the biggest thing the
worst thing that could happen to Jeremy
would be if I could lose in a video game
or you know whatever but but I think it
allows us to to you know have this sort
of excitement in the show that we
wouldn't have had otherwise but but
we're never locked into any style like I
think seasoned tools surprised a lot of
people because we have a lot of crazy
ideas and the styles constantly changing
and and it's unpredictable I was just
trying to get some test footage for my
editing software and I had bought a
camera from the University of Toronto
librarian it was born by accident I
guess you know we had Jeff and I had
just moved to Toronto and I was we were
interested in creating television style
content we had made a pilot for TV show
back when we lived in Calgary and and we
sort of pitched it around the network's
and we try to take this this traditional
path of getting a television show that
everyone goes through the success we got
a television show and it's it's it's a
tough path and I don't think it's the
fairest path often you know it's not
merit-based success it's not really how
my view is it's a lot a lot of times who
you know and this and that and and what
maybe some some older people who
couldn't possibly understand the
audience that we were making the show
for judging the show which seemed
ridiculous so then Jarrett uh came over
that day and he happened to be wearing a
bandana and an uber gamer shirt and we
were playing a lot of zero hour and we
had this idea for we had talked about
doing a zero hour show but it was more
like a news show but Jarrod sort of
started thinking in the direction of a
fictional showing he said oh I got this
character I was thinking up you know
I'll do this character we had maybe
named him yet so he started talking with
zero-hour and his Jeremie accent and
relatively undeveloped Jeremy accents
but it was still the Jeremy accent and I
edited a footage we shot it from a few
angles and pieced together the dialogue
and he told a story about zero-hour hos
owning some guy around the time when
BitTorrent came about in the computer
world that's when it occurred to to us
though we could distribute a show
regardless of how successful it was we
could distribute to all of our fans and
have any concerns about bandwidth their
money and before BitTorrent if you
wanted to give a show that's two hundred
megabytes to a million people you would
need a lot of money and a lot of
bandwidth to just to actually serve that
yourself and pay for it so you know
BitTorrent really is I think what
allowed independent content creators
like us to to not worry about the
distribution department just make it and
get it out there and make it and get it
out there which is what we did for
periodic and virtually well and we put
that online and we made it into a
preview for a show that didn't exist and
everyone was like I want to see this
show what does this preview business
Purana just type thing and we realize it
was in a man for this was pretty funny
video on its own but you know we made
episode one that was more about the
character more about his life and
everybody liked that he made up so - I
would want to see it our audience kept
growing and and pretty soon after that
you know we realized it was caught
something pretty serious I suppose the
answer is that I always thought we kind
of had a hit but my definition of what a
hit was changed as popularity grew you
cuz of around episode three we had I
don't know tens of thousands of viewers
and I thought that was a hit because I
thought wow you know like 50,000 people
are watching the show that's amazing
yeah well I think yep probably around
episode three which is pretty early and
it kept being reinforced every episode
we released it just became you know it
was like 90 percent ninety three ninety
seven ninety-nine
but by the time we're like nine point
nine and then and I'm by about Episode
six that hit and that was just because
the growth I always thought of it as
being this successful project because I
wasn't used to being able to entertain
so many people or have some people
interested in my art especially as a
scientist you know it was always a hobby
type thing but yeah it was it was it was
just that my definition of what a hit
had changed and now you know if I had
you know as it's this phenomenal to
think about when I'm sitting here in
this room editing a new episode is and
you know I just think about the stadiums
full of people on the internet that want
to see it that are dying the hardcore
fans and they're emailing us and they're
telling us can't wait for the episode
they're talking about it they're
theorizing with the plot and and all
this so it's really amazing to sit to
think that I'm sitting here in my room
by myself editing the episode and seeing
things that a lot of people want to see
and and you know a lot of people are
interested in what I'm creating that's a
really amazing amazing thing for me but
before pure ownage I am I'm actually
during Purana during the first nine
episodes I was in school so I was
studying physics at the University of
Toronto and that is in the last year my
PhD when I quit just because I really
had to work on the show the show was
really taken off and it was always a
dream of mine to work in the
entertainment business but it was sort
of a rock star type career a low chance
of actually having a successful career
in you know in the attaining business
right who would have thought right and
you know it's kinda like winning the
lottery trying to get in into the music
business or the film business but here
we are and we have we have a hit show I
suppose on the Internet as far as the
internet goes it's a hit show and you
know I realized that what I really have
to run with this
I really should be working on this
full-time and it was my hobby of course
before making music making videos with
my friends and it was a great hobby I
used to play in a lot of bands in
Toronto but at that point I realized
look I can make an income with Purana
and I might as well run with it to start
this company up and start working so now
I used to be a physicist and I now I
make funny videos and sell t-shirts so
it's a it's a funny story people think
when I say that they're like oh my god
physics what man how does that have to
do with music but it has a lot to do
with music you know a lot to do with
operating a camera as well I studied
optics and cameras all lenses and
electronics and so if you can understand
mathematics you can understand the
technical parts of filmmaking well
starting I guess after high school I
went into university started in physics
actually astrophysics I guess and I
slowly sort of morph that into pure math
that was I guess my my principal
interest that I realised after a couple
years of physics and then a couple more
years of math I started to get
disillusioned with academia I switched
over to computer science something that
seemed a little more practical than I
could at least may be used for a decent
paying job because all my friends were
moving south of the border and making a
killing in the dot-com boom I felt like
I was missing out on and then a couple
more years of computer science in six
total years of university I kind of
stopped going and started doing stand-up
comedy out in Calgary and I guess that
was the sort of the life-changing
experience you know after I got on stage
once and just sort of felt the rush of
the positive reinforcement of the crowd
when you make them laugh you know I
guess I'd always sort of been the class
clown and in school and whatnot and I
always really enjoyed making my friends
laugh and but I'd never really
considered doing that as a career mostly
because I was always pretty good in math
and sciences and
and when that's the case and I guess in
school you're usually pushed to
engineering and push to use your talents
in math and sciences and so I've always
kind of I always ignored I guess the
performing arts and then yeah once I did
stand-up once it was a there's really no
question after that the idea of pursuing
you know computer science as a career or
pursuing any 40-hour a week office job
as any sort of permanent career just
went right out the window and dispensed
him he was doing stand-up comedy moved
up to Toronto to pursue that as it was
going pretty well but you know you're
sort of ceiling don't west got the
Toronto started pure ownage stop doing
stand-up and now being interviewed by
hack Pot well usually Jarrod's and I we
get together after a little bit of a
break from the previous episode and we
sort of think about what we want to take
it the show when the next episode we
usually have some idea of what's going
to happen over the entire season each
episode and we usually have a list of
jokes or funny scenes and both of us
have thought up the vast portion of the
writing actually happens just from
Jarrett turning concepts general
concepts into his own funny dialogue and
adding Jeremy isn't so and I just kind
of try to become this character and then
we'd give this character stimuli in the
world there whatever and he would react
on his own almost like it's really
strange experience for me because I
didn't have that much experience with
acting and and I still don't I guess
outside of pure knowledge but it's it
was something that was kind of new to me
I'd only done stand-up comedy so I was
having a great time just kind of getting
in the head of this character and just
reacting as he would react and so that's
why I think the dialogue came out so
natural and I was the whole field of
show was so hyper realistic that so many
people around the world believe it to be
real after the first couple episodes
that he was really a character because I
don't think you could script dialogue
that natural and I think the minute he
tried to script it too you know he would
sound very scripting sometimes we will
go into a shoot and the script will just
be us as a bunch of concepts okay
journey needs to address this fact use
to address this fact and/or this concept
and as a joke here can you sort of
improvise around the this funny concept
and and that's how we usually just roll
the camera
we take the best takes and sometimes we
get some gold stuff just for improv but
you know the show's evolved you know we
face the choice again around Episode
four where you know we hit interviewed
people on the street right in Episode
two and we sort of had this this raw
mockumentary and we had to choose you
know between do we make that kind of
show where I go and interview people on
the street all the time you know like
you've seen do what is it they're gonna
be like a Borat style format you know
the buzz you know stuff like that or do
we make something with the story and do
we build the universe and then you know
really tell agreat story and we're both
we both love film and weight you know I
love reading books I love you know
reading and telling stories so we opted
for that route so some scenes are
scripted as well like the FBI scenes the
government agent scenes we should call
them those airholes are scripted and it
seems involving other actors the
cinematic stuff is more heavily scripted
but a lot of the a lot of the
mockumentary stuff is just general
concepts and improvisation well the Kyle
the character the sort of takes the
directing thing really seriously so
you'll notice he's doing a lot of crazy
camera angles and the first season he's
filming Jeremy wheelers on the floor or
trying to get the cool shot or telling
Jeremy what to do or whatever but you
know that's sort of a running joke it's
not really the way that I think about
the show the way I think about it is it
was being very much influenced by shows
like Trailer Park Boys and the British
version of The Office I thought those
were amazingly funny documentaries I'd
also done on a very low budget it's it's
great that you can tell such a you can
tell stories like these on a little
budget you don't need to fancy cameras
or whatever as long as you can explain
the fact that the budget is low you know
it did make sense that Kyle the film
student wouldn't have a nice camera so
that's how we wrote it in and you can
get away with you know the first step
first yep so it's looking sort of new
compared to what we're at now but you
know we named drop a few of the big
Directors in the show is sort of being
college
influence so that the fat you know
people that director is that people
identify with nowadays you know our
audiences is relatively young so you
know they they're familiar with people
like Quentin Tarantino and Martin
Scorsese but personally as far as the
films that I would like to make after
puron I think you know I I like doing
the cinema and pure ology because that's
the kind of movies that I'd like to make
you know the mockumentary is fun but
really when it comes down to it there's
a lot of great things you can do with
the cinema with the cinema aspect that
I'm trying to sort of practice in pure
ownage
and I'm also largely influenced by the
Coen Brothers there I love all their
movies and and yeah Sam Raimi guys but
anyway I'm rambling on I guess sometimes
making compromises it hurts the lack of
a budget sometimes it really sucks when
you have a really great idea that can't
be realized because you don't have
access to the tools that you would have
if we had our own Lucas French sometimes
that stuck that sucks I guess as a
storyteller that you you have to avoid
some some things the hardest part and
the most time-consuming part for me is
the editing process our episodes are now
you know they're pushing in 25 minutes
on average and that we keep feeling like
we have to top it top it in terms of
length so really it's just a question of
of getting in the zone for me I usually
I edit late at night and I sort of
forget how long I've been editing so
once I can get into that zone and I
usually work a week straight 18 hours a
day on the episode you know five days in
a row or whatever that's when I'm in the
zone
that's when editing is easy but starting
that process is pretty difficult you sit
back you look at all the tapes you're
like wow I have to capture all that
footage I got to edit all this stuff
together and and compose the music and
and all this you know it's a really a
lot of work but once I get into it it
goes by pretty quick and I guess
specific moments that I that you know
there's no long-term suffering but that
night when you're filming sixteen hours
straight and it's 5:00 in the morning it
does really suck and you really just
want to go home and go to sleep but when
I wake up the next day
and I think about it I just filled with
joy I'm so glad we did it you know it's
so you know it's so rewarding after the
fact that it's hard to complain about
that there's really hard to complain but
watching it really it's a it's a lot of
long nights occasionally doing some
really boring stuff but for the most
part yeah how could I complain episode
12 was different because you know 46
minutes long and that was grueling very
very grueling I was sleeping you know
three or four hours a night and it was
just because there was so much
adrenaline but my body was I was still
functioning which is amazing it's an
amazing thing that you can you can
function off with four hours of sleep or
three hours of sleep and and put
together the episode so that's and what
ended up happening we had it done on
time I was just you know when the
adrenaline comes from picturing theaters
in Calgary Toronto and Vancouver filled
with hundreds of people and there's no
episode all right that would be a
disaster there's no way it's got to be
done has to be done so they're not being
done in the end and yeah it was a lot of
work oh man there's so much that's so
awesome about it uh I think the best
part is that I wake up when I want to I
I have to set an alarm clock about once
a month and that's usually for some a
really important event like a meeting or
something that we might have but other
than that you know it's as weird as that
sounds but I really don't miss my alarm
clock I really like the fact that I can
work my own hours which often is till
5:00 in the morning but that's fine you
know I go to bed and sleep as long as I
want to the best part has got to be the
the premiere it's the live premieres
it's just amazing the fans that we have
they come out from everywhere they drive
from I don't know we're in this all over
the states some of them even plan
they're from Europe they plan their
vacations around drones episode releases
and the Bloor cinema in Toronto has got
to be the mecca for pure owners that's
where everybody goes who's the hardest
core Eastern North America and just to
show the episode on the big screen and
have the energy of the crowd and
actually finally find out where the
laughs are going to be
I think is very rewarding and very
interesting thing to sit down and watch
with all the excited fans that you know
and there's there's there's a pretty
wide age range as well we've got little
kids showing up there was actually a two
year old girl invent in the Vancouver
premier with her parents who were big
Paris fans that had driven ten hours to
get to get to the theater and they were
excited it's very rewarding to turn your
hobby and something that you used to do
for fun in your spare time into your
source of income into your job and I
mean it's a it's just a dream come true
to wake up in the morning and really
think about the fact that that writing
and producing and acting in the show is
what I do like that is my contribution
to our society that rewards me with food
and housing and all the games I want to
play and I mean I just don't understand
how life could get better than that yeah
it's just really amazing I think it's
just so rewarding to finally you know to
say look at all these people they're
here to see what we've created and it's
just you know a small even people and
and you know it's it's really what the
kind of shows that we want to make - so
it's kind of like we're being fans side
by side because the you know pure images
is the kind of show that we want to see
on television that we want to see on the
Internet or they know we'd like to see
this kind of calm and you know video
games because it's stuff that whirring -
so it's really kind of when I feel like
I'm a fan when all the works done and
I'm sitting in a theater and I'm
watching it alongside all these crazy
guys that are really excited to be there
yeah that's the most rewarding part

back here everybody thank you very much
all right guys
you're playing for your team and you're
playing for this community my favorite
thing about banding is I get to hang out
my friends everyday no matter what they
live so close the generation coming up
can't go learn like I learned you just
can't do it it's out later that's good
again I think the cult following the
kind of fans that we have are the best
kind of fans because we really have
started this community that's very
tight-knit a lot of people have become
good friends because of pure knowledge
so we've sort of brought together people
with common interests online and our
forms are very active we have a lot of
community initiatives like the the
teamspeak servers IRC offered ops and
got all these people that are sort of
working for us to develop this community
we've got the parish archive which has a
whole bunch of fan art on it there's a
peer honors portal which has basically
everything you ever want to know blow up
your own it's stuff that we don't even
have on our main page all the interviews
all the behind-the-scenes stuff stuff
we've released and then taken off the
main site you can dig it up from the
pure orange portal and this is all fans
that are just trying to you know help us
out or make somebody else's pure
knowledge experience better I mean I
think it's really cool that I've
actually met a lot of a lot of cool
people through periodical in the
community I'm it's reaffirming me really
you know it it helped me to come to
terms with how much of a gamer I am and
that it's it's cool and there's tons of
people out there better like me because
you know I've just accepted a long time
ago I'm a big loser I just didn't care
anymore but so it's nice to to like
everyday just have hundreds of people
writing us emails or our MySpace
whatever they're just talking about how
much the show has influenced them
and especially people that have these
amazing positive life changes as a
result of the show they've met their
girlfriends I get that a lot a lot of
guys have been hooked up because of
parentage episode 10 and that always
puts a big smile on my face to know that
I'm getting all these other people a lot
more late than I am it's kind of it's
kind of funny but but yeah I mean just
the devotion of the fans right it's just
amazing and the impact it has in their
life is amazing and and to be positively
reinforced like that by people riding
you and telling you the amazing change
you've made to their life I mean yeah
it's just amazing but yeah that's we're
really grateful to those people that
have really made Bureau image they've
really made the pee Amish community
we've do we just put up the seed really
we put up the episodes we made the forms
but it's really the fans that have
created the community themselves it
feels awesome
it feels really cool especially me
because I'm not the kind of guy that
used to go out to do much relieve my
house much so this is it's really cool
you know yeah I mean I guess sometimes
frustrating the peeing story is kind of
true I guess you know that that's
happened a couple times and oh yeah yes
you know just you're at a urinal and
then you look at the guy next to you who
exchanges glances and then you can kind
of tell immediately when someone
recognizes you because their eyes get
kind of wide and you can almost sense
their excitement and then they'll kind
of look at you and then the ping is a
good example because you know just
sometimes you're in a situation it's
that you don't want to be disturbed or
it's a bit awkward and that can be bad
but other than that I mean well because
of the the nature of the character Kyle
I've been relatively hidden from the
public and no one knew what I looked
like until episode 12 while there was a
few fans that found out with their
detective work on the Internet but most
for the most for the most part nobody
knew what I look like except for the
people that showed up to the live
screening events and there was actually
one incident where I was in a computer
store and the guy working there I was
talking to him about some product and he
said you look familiar
so don't really you said are you Kyle I
was expecting him to say oh maybe I was
in your class and in physics or
something but no I was getting
recognized as Kyle for the first time in
a computer store so that was pretty
interesting of it you know he didn't
even know my real name and it's amazing
to be walking down the street and having
the sixteen-year-old kid just run up to
me and he is shaking he's so excited and
you know when I start talking it's like
he he he can't believe it like it he
I've made this surreal experience for
him and it's something and I'm sitting
there talking I'm like wow you know if
this could be something that the
discounter members for the rest of his
life is this amazing moment where he
just ran into the owner on the street
because he's just losing his mind in
front of me just his brain is falling
out as a year so so I just give him my
time and I talked him because you know
for no effort on my part I'm bringing so
much joy it seems my investment versus
the return of the total happiness you're
bringing in the world it's like it's
like Fame gives you this gift where for
no investment I can just give out
happiness meeting these people which is
why when we do the premieres it's so
amazing and I'll sign every last
autograph because you know just they get
so much out of it and it's it's just fun
for me to give it really this what do I
lose so so yeah so I love it it really
brightens my day and anytime I get a a
really excited guy recognize me any
super pumped I'm pumped that's the day
I'm thinking oh man like that guy just
had such a great experience and it's not
as I'm envious I'm like I wish with the
roles reversed and I just ran into a
dude on a show that I loved watching you
know yeah maybe I'll run into Ricky
Gervais sometime next week yeah but yeah
since since we've been credited I
haven't been recognized yet on the
street maybe I should spend more time
outside cuz I've been in here doing work
on interviews and things like this
more than we should probably let them I
don't know you know we have our ideas
for what we want the show to be and
where we're gonna take it and stuff but
you know we have this form community and
we have all these fans and you only
really SEPA so they talked about and
they talked with me now what if what if
this and they give their very honest
opinion and a lot of people are pretty
mean and you know I'm pretty honest
anyways about what they thought about
this Epson or that episode and and so
it's it's hard to not be influenced by
them when they're telling you that they
like or dislike this and then when a
high percentage of them like or dislike
this it makes you think mm should we
make more more you know future episodes
closer to what they like and dislike you
know well it depends on a particular fan
in fact some fans we've had in the show
one example is is a very active fan
scree is his name on the on the boards
and we actually went to the Netherlands
we flew there to surprise him we had his
his address because he had bought some
newb store gear and so we showed up at
his house with the camera rolling and
his mom answered the door and we walked
in and he was well sitting down watching
TV and you know the owner and Kyle walk
in and say hey how's it going scurry and
he just flipped out his brain broke and
he you know he was so surprised that we
had flown up there to visit him we
surprised a few other fans and this
footage will be on the DVD it's some
great footage of us surprising fans and
then the Netherlands but and especially
after nine when the reception wasn't as
positive as we wanted we had to sit back
and think like man should we you know
not have any fantasy elements but in the
end you know we really have this this
great story you want to tell it and it
helps if you can just learn that line
I've been just jump into fantasy a
little bit you just think the doors open
up in the freedom you have to tell this
great story is there so in the end after
episode 9 we decided that you know we
read all the input and we appreciate it
but at the end of the day we have to
make the show that we want to make and
that we want to watch you so and so in
anyway we ended up casting him in there
wholesale we got to get you to show
somehow and this is this episode episode
11 Jeremy goes to nettle and so he said
hey you know you got a red keyboard it's
pretty cool we should make up a
character that
has read keyboard will call him read
board and you can fight him and he's
kind of like you're training in the
Netherlands but the way the master sent
me would have meet up with the red board
guy and put you through some training so
that's how the keyboard fight was born
we were lucky that that night it was
raining and screaming with this location
with some nice trees alongside the road
and and that we shot that scene with
scree as red board and he did such a
great job and in fact the fans the fans
that we put in the show are do such a
great job they worked so hard because
they're so excited to to to be working
with you and it's great they you know
the is such an amazing job like another
example is den lo guy Jamie and his his
friend Jay from the UK when they were
visiting Canada we hung out with them
because they had been long time active
forum members and we kind of got to know
them on the Internet and we said hey you
guys should be the castle guards and you
should play Tetris against Jimmy I think
that'd be cool and and they just loved
doing that - it did such a great job
they were perfect for the part it was
nice well the first premiere was a
life-changing experience I think for me
and I can almost guarantee for Miranda
and Joe as well and and Dave you know we
were just eating at a restaurant down
the street and we'd expected maybe fifty
hundred people to show up this was like
December 2005 and you know it was just
after episode yeah we were releasing
episode 9 we're launching episode 9 and
and so we left this restaurant it's like
an hour before the show and we're just
walking on the street to get ready and
get a block in the cinema and we see
this enormous lineup that's extending
around the corner and down the block and
blocking our backyard entrance into the
theater that we were gonna use to sneak
in and you know I get this call from
Jeff as I'm realizing through this
situation that all these people showed
up to watch this episode this 22 minute
episode you know for this internet show
we didn't think that that many people
would would be interested in seeing it
you know we knew there'd be some super
hardcores but uh yeah I get this frantic
calls from Jeff was that the theater
helping work because no one knows who he
is no one no one knows it's Kyle so he
had the freedom to walk around but the
other cast didn't and so I get this call
from Jeff and he's just like
talking a mile a minute saying I believe
we need help we need people who can I
call like oh my god we're being overrun
and I can't just and yeah I was too to
see that line up and then after the show
you know what it was over and well even
to step on stage you know I've done
comedy before just three hundred people
there was about you know five hundred
there so is the biggest room I never
stood in front of and not only that but
they knew who I was kind of and they had
this love for this character so when I
got on stage and they just started we
started going insane and that was the
first time I got to experience what it
would be like if I were to be famous you
know that's what it would feel like
stepping out in front of those people I
guess that's that's sort of the reaction
you get this sort of wave hits you of
all this energy of people it's really
hard to describe
well the episode 12 from here was the
biggest one significantly bigger than
any of the other ones it was you know
the if season finale I think got a lot
of people to come out and a lot of
people have been talking about how great
of an experience the premieres were you
know watching pure knowledge with other
parents fans and how everyone starts
lining up super early and and you get to
meet Jeremy and Kyle and Doug and staged
us so yeah I think we started yeah
announced it pretty early so that people
people email us say hey you should
announce it really early so I can book
time off work I can travel from wherever
I am and take a two-day drive or
whatever to come to Toronto so to
accommodate those people because we want
the hardcores to come out right - comedy
those people we announced really really
early and I think that had a lot to do
with how big it was and yeah it was
great it was the episode was very
cinematic so it worked really well in
the theater and and yeah it was you know
we're kind of getting to the point now
where you know we should be doing this
everywhere we could we can we can have
it have a theater screening in any major
city in North America and have the same
turnout so we're gonna try to get
organized and we're gonna has real tours
and and that way we'll be able to meet
all
fans all around but yeah he's I got sort
of blown away about this wave and then
after the show I go out in the back I
like trying to escape the theater and
there's just mob of people from both
sides around me and there must be 400
people that surround me and the streets
blocked off and cars can't get by and
there's all this chaos and commotion I'm
just being a swarm and I'm signing
autographs for an hour and a half and
people are freaking out and just
non-stop pictures being taken and
literally it was just you know I went
from being just this guy who played
games and whose future wasn't looking up
after you know not finishing school and
decided to do comedy which is an exactly
a lucrative career to feeling in that
moment like I've that I was Brad Pitt or
something you know it was a it was a
just such a surreal experience it really
really fucked with my head another thing
about the episode 12 screening was was
when we first realized that the personal
safety of the actors is an issue that we
haven't dealt with Jeremy after the show
was mobbed by so many fans he could
barely have sign autographs and nobody
could get in was blocking traffic cars
were honking so I think next time we're
gonna have to be more professional about
it and have handlers and security and
things like that so it's unfortunate
that we can't be all casual like we've
been in the past and be like hey
whatever we're just regular guys you
want to need us in chat whatever but
we're getting to the point now where
there's just so many people that want to
meet us and chat with us that never is
I'd love to talk to everybody but there
just isn't the time and it's unfortunate
but yeah we're trying to deal with it
and as best we can and give the fans as
great an experience as we can because
they've traveled a lot of them have
traveled so far to come meet us and talk
to us and then you know was all said and
done we went out with had drinks with
the fans at night and everything died
down and then at 3:00 in the morning we
walking to a restaurant this nice
restaurant and Bloor that's up in 24
hours and and it's packed and I walk in
and nobody knows who I am right cuz
they're no longer the fans show and I'm
bang back down to earth you know that
you're not this superstar that you you
felt like you were in
before a few hours before but back down
to just being a gamer that no one looks
at twice so weird experiences well I
think that we are at a very very special
time we're starting to see sort of this
this movement of independent media
people just grabbing a camera starting
produced their own stuff the way we have
producing their own music you know high
school students getting famous on
YouTube and and whatnot and all of this
is happening without though it's all
bypassing sort of the standard
broadcasters it's a lot of big companies
that are established that you know hold
all the power in the industry but now I
think that's that's changing well I
think it's the best thing that has
happened to artists ever and one one
interesting fact is that established
broadcasters are very slow to change and
so it's the ones that who are adapting
to the technological changes that are
going to be very strong in the next few
years and in fact a lot of companies
have been talking about this is just
generally how technology is making it
difficult to make money in the music
industry or make money in the in the
movie industry in terms of the
distribution because there's so much
piracy and people are whatever burning
DVDs and downloading music for free but
I think in the case of you know the
small startup company the independent
producer of technology makes it very
very easy to to make money in the
business or to get into the business of
entertainment and I can understand why
they're scared because part two of what
makes it so awesome is that show is now
in content are going to succeed ones
that are consumed via the internet
anyway they're gonna succeed based on
their merit so you got the old
established companies that are sort of
being brought down a bit and their
heyday is over and you've got the
independent independents that are that
can really get into the business in ways
that ever possible before and in fact I
would not be in the entertainment
business if it wasn't for the technology
that we use such as in the internet
BitTorrent streaming video
even even cheap cheaper cheap digital
cameras is another as another big factor
and home studio recording equipment now
as being sort of you know there's
companies that make that make studio
gear and microphones that are now making
the lower end stuff for the home studio
a lot of people are building home
studios recording digitally with their
computer which is another big reason why
we're able to make the p r-- on the
sound track and have all the great music
bits in pure orange so I think all those
factors combined that are all rooted in
new technology have made it possible for
companies like ours to exist and for us
to make a business out of what we want
to do making in terms of making art we
plan to do three seasons so no it's not
gonna live on too long there's a lot of
certain episodes I would expect would
have certain stylistic flares you know
that would be particular to that one
episode and not a general change the
whole style of pure ownage we're always
conscious of our roots and we know that
we have to we don't want to stray too
far from where the show started because
you you know the audience watches the
show for reason and then they like what
they see and if you start to just change
it completely then you might find a lot
of people aren't interested in watching
the show anymore well the plan is to
make three seasons and finish it off
there but it depends on the way the
story goes that's the story arc right
now we want to make a nice package nice
DVD set that the people will enjoy for a
long time we don't want to wait till the
show is fatigued
I'll see it's hard to talk about because
I don't want to give away too much from
from the next couple seasons we also
have plans for a feature film I don't
know if we'll get on that but I always
wanted to make pier lures the movie or
make some other movie but what we're
doing with our companies we're building
up a studio we're gonna remain
independent and we're gonna build up a
library of equipment that will allow us
to to reach the production quality of of
a lot of the digital Hollywood feature
films that we're seeing now hopefully
all that technology is getting cheaper
and cheaper you know the
the camera that George Lucas used in
Star Wars Episode one is now they used
to be a quarter-million dollars now it's
only $100,000 or whatever and there's
other lower end cameras of the so nice
in alta family that that hopefully you
know I look at the pictures of these
things on the internet and I drool but
yeah hopefully one day I'll get my hands
on one of those I'd expect you know
increased production quality and Jeff's
always getting better at editing more
killer music
oh yeah I mean there will be a parent's
really unless we die or something
because if it's not funded by someone
else which I don't think you probably
would ever need to be anyways like we
will be able to make it because pure
homage that has such a low budget
already that to make a film I mean
episode 12 at 46 minutes is half of the
length of a feature film so it's
basically two Episode twelve is a movie
and just a little bit higher production
quality and that's that's enough to be a
theater it's a mockumentary right people
forgive you know the quality of the
camera whatnot they expect it and it
makes sense the universe so to produce
the parents movie would be so cheap that
there's there's no way that we won't
afford the time and the equipment and
then in the next couple years of making
P Ranjan and we're really stuck both
daddy either that'll be something after
the series but yeah we know we've even
talked about putting the movie out you
know after season 2 or something I'm
excited
to the kids that are big fans of Jeremy
I guess the character would be they
should probably be a maybe a little more
forgiving than Jeremy and treat other
gamers with a little more respect
because in reality people with good
attitudes are more well received by the
community and you just have a more
pleasant time interacting with the
community they're going to have to
interact with a lot if you plan to play
a game competitively or be an uber gamer
secondly is practice practice practice
practice
consider your health a bit I think
that's a lot of things gamers don't
consider that would be my Jarrett's
advice and and yeah just don't ever be
discouraged don't don't ever think that
you're a loser or that you know it's not
cool what you're doing and just if you
love gaming then do what you love and I
think that advice applies to pretty much
anything in life in general as long as
you're not hurting someone else do what
you love to do and you know don't feel
bad for him
I get a lot of messages and personal
messages on the board and the emails and
people saying hey Kyle / Jeff I'm
interested in filmmaking you know what
do what do I do you want to look at my
films or whatever and but my my the main
piece of advice I give them is you know
grab a camera start shooting you guys
are young and you'll have plenty of
years for the practice projects before
you can you know before you start
getting into anything serious and really
the way I learned about filmmaking was
just watching a lot of movies and going
out and shooting stuff and heading it up
and seeing what it looks like so a lot
of the lessons I learned were just trial
and error I don't know if that makes me
the best filmmaker but sometimes I wish
I had gone to film school and now that
now that I'm am a filmmaker I suppose
but it's funny that a lot of people look
up to me and think I'm some power in the
industry and they think I have some
great advice for them where I can get
them in the business or whatever but
really I'm just a guy with a camera and
the home PC just like you and I just
have a few more years of messing around
with that camera in that PC then then
most of the people that are asking these
questions so yeah just a em I just tell
them my story what else can I do
in Episode six okay so there is the pure
ownage documentary I hope you guys
enjoyed watching that as much as we did
making it

so when did you realize that you were a
total noob we've had questions not in
there seventh question on the fourth
paragraph
when did you realize you're a total noob
are you trying to plead the fifth no my
balls not really but I think episode 10
is definitely the best yeah because it's
filmic it's the best so you see it's
getting better throughout the series you
can train a new but then he'll just be a
training new so that's the FPS dog
headshot greatest line it'd have to be
boom in each other but it's moved me in
many ways definitely helped me do better
in my life give me the motivation you
know it's all about the headshot
whenever Jeremy owns yeah definitely
when she's ready to 1v1 millions your
hour
my favorite moment was lots of stuff so
loving or he seen down a chair doing the
interview and my hermos wow it's like
the plague your Pony died because it
wasn't pretty enough
I always gets me every time one you
remind me of day yeah I like when this
shit when the sheep's were around that
he came he's like wah wah wah there's so
many it's so hard for me to pick I can't
really say cuz I like everything about
the show like I laugh all the time it's
hard to say that wall chicken wall
when when Jeremy goes all emo that is
the funniest thing ever the one where
they're trying to pick up chicks and
Jeremy's selling Kyle about this guy
that wants to take him home and he's
like it winds him toward this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
