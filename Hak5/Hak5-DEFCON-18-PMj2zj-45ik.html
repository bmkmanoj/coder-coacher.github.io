so that people could embarrass
themselves and it's also the home to
DEFCON the conference where every year
hackers black hats spies federal agents
we can all come and congregations do
hacker shit let's check it out
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
goto meeting and Netflix go to wwn
efflux calm / hak5 for your free trial
membership so we're here at the hardware
hacking village and I'm here with Mike
and rich checking out the wasp guys how
are you great how you doing not bad now
what what is the wasp the wasp is a UAV
we decided the war driving this was sort
of played out so we wanted to try our
hand at a little war flying so we
started out with that and then it kind
of expanded from there so now it's a
fully functional UAV with penetration
testing capabilities and penetration
testing UAV wasp well I mean aside from
it being cute that stand for anything
it's a Wi-Fi aerial surveillance
platform designed for information
gathering and potentially penetration
testing of Wi-Fi networks so tell me
some of the features of this drone is it
automated how does it fly it uses an
open-source platform called the
ardupilot we went ahead and use that
we've made some custom additions to the
code make it work with this particular
platform so that's embedded that's like
arduino it is our duane oh yeah there's
a pretty strong arduino community doing
this this type of thing mostly with RC
planes so you just what you put it up in
the air and it flies itself essentially
we manual takeoff manual land and then
plot GPS coordinates using a google
earth type application it'll fly a
pattern and then and we can monitor
using the base station any information
we see if we see something that's
interesting we flip a switch on the
remote and it goes into a loiter mode
and it'll it'll just circle until we
tell it to continue on its way now you
say C do you have any telemetry that you
get back from it yeah actually we have a
base station that that communicates back
over over 900 megahertz RF or 3g 3g way
you put it like a cell phone in there
something absolutely exactly and you say
you could see stuff do you have like
cameras onboard well we have a
real cheap camera I'm speaking more in
reference to Wi-Fi RF signals we have a
1 watt alpha Wi-Fi card with a belly
mounted 9dbi patch panel antenna pointed
down giving us about a 60-degree konark
of coverage on the ground about 400 foot
altitude it's about a thousand square
foot of coverage okay so you're running
some serious Wi-Fi in the sky what are
you doing with that idea what kind of
distributions and what what kind of fun
are you know what are you doing to wreak
havoc in those guys well it's a it's a
Via Appia 5000 g Pico ITX processor
running the back track for sweet some
losers we do the entire suite so on it
and it fits on a Pico and you just what
like remote in and then you know own
from the sky yes actually the base
station has another xB radio that allows
us to do secure shell over PPP and we
can actually use it as a router as well
and connect up additional netbooks
additional laptops to have multiple
people logged into the airplane at one
time doing multiple different things one
person looking at Wi-Fi one person
looking at 3g one person looking at the
camera so we really have some some
robust modular capabilities built into
the aircraft and the base station yeah I
bet you don't need to worry about you
know jumping really tall fences with
barbed wire with this thing so tell me
about the the flight what's is this
built on a pre-existing platform and
what kind of range do you get on this
well yes originally this this platform
was a US Army target gunnery drone so
it's a sort of surplus Thank You Uncle
Sam and and it just worked out for us we
happen to have one and it was cheap and
readily available so we went with that
and so we're gonna we're going to use it
until it's it no longer meets our needs
and then we'll switch to a different
platform if we see it in the future and
then had the maiden voyage go
well it flies much like a wounded harbor
seal would that the airframe itself
needs some some minor tweaks to center
gravity wait to be able to get to
improve our flight characteristics are
the airframe is a MIG it's designed to
go very very fast or it falls out of the
sky and we're constantly on that
balancing point of we're not quite going
fast enough oh we are no or not so it's
it's a real it's a real juggling act to
keep it in the air and we took about
another benefit of the airframe we took
about it probably a 20 25 g direct
impact nose in full throttle and we were
able to repair it in about an hour and
that was nice it took for the 30 minute
epoxy to dry wow that is epic so what's
next what's the feature that you weren't
able to get in here that you're dying to
what as soon as you get back to the
garage open BTS I want to start messing
with GSM you're gonna you going to own
the GSM networks from the skies I would
really like to do that yes you think a
usrp would fit in there I'm hoping we're
gonna find a way to make it fit if not
we'll get a bigger plane that is epic I
I love the idea that you guys just just
two guys in a garage owning the skies
with the Wi-Fi and and tell me you're
buzzing the tower Oh every chance we get
awesome can people go to a website and
find more about your project online yeah
WW rabbit hole org there's a full build
build blog pictures and a rudimentary
spec sheet that kind of details out what
we've got on board the aircraft we leave
the the capabilities up to the
imagination of whoever wants to use it
and the for the geeks at home that are
already tinkering up some crazy idea in
their head watching this what's the one
piece of advice that you wish that you
had known before you had gotten started
don't limit yourself epic thank you so
much
hacking village and as you guys know
this being my first Def Con I'm trying
to figure out what the deal is with the
badges so found none other than the
coolest team here team redacted how's it
going guys good good so uh this is so
Greg how I was going every good thanks
we're here with Greg and John John hello
and Catherine so team redacted you guys
are doing some really interesting stuff
with the badges but I need to first know
what what is the deal with the badges
these are so unique yeah so badges are
separated by category first colors
represent what group you're worth staff
press humans normal people and then each
badge badge has embedded electronics and
then there's this competition where you
do some type of hack or modification to
the badge and the coolest modification
or hack wins and so other NPC badges you
mentioned humans now so what about the
hardware on these guys sure it's a
freescale processor 16-bit
microcontroller and we are just it's the
same exact chip that was on last year's
DEFCON badge so that that gave us a way
to prepare for this year's DEFCON by
buying the demo boards and practicing
over the last year to be prepared for
this competition okay so what kind of
things would we expect to see on a
DEFCON badge board you know the hardware
itself well this year they have an LCD
display which has actually got text and
graphics on it as they're very limited
microcontrollers but last year they had
an LED which blinked three different
colors had a microphone on it did some
signal processing on that and so it
change depending on what the noise
levels were or things like that there
were also other things that would
produce that if you played a tone to it
it detected that this year there are
there's a party invite on one of them if
you have an invite you enter a code from
that invite into your badge and unlocks
it or if you hack the code you can make
it look as though you have an invite to
the party the usually these type of
things of the very weakly powered so
there is much code on them
there's a lot of things you can do that
excellent so you guys were prepared from
last year's using similar chips here uh
what exactly is this Frankenstein what
are we building here now we're building
the first Def Con badge virus so the
goal of our of our hack is that you can
put two badges together and then one
badge will upload its virus into the
next batch and then keep track of what
edition the virus is so if i infect you
I'm one and you're 1.1 and then if you
infect John then he's going to be one
point one point one so and then on and
then what would you do you would just be
able to graph this and visually see like
you know who made it with who and what
not exactly we could build the tree
graph and show the different mutations
and if someone came to us later they
could show us hey I'm you know 13 dot
five dot whatever we could kind of build
that chain down and tree ok so I go
ahead yeah one of the interesting things
about it is you can keep track of social
networks this way the people who
infected people they know I can have
very similar numbers things like you'll
be able to find groups like that who do
you know that knows a lot of people
people with big numbers they know a lot
of people so you're going to be able to
find clicks yeah that's pretty much one
of the parts do the trees you'll say one
person peaked a hundred people they can
convince a hundred people to give them
their badge so they have at least some
good friends okay so I noticed that
we've got us beyond here we've got jtag
how would our a boards mate and get
infected yes we've made these little
devices we call them the sticky headers
pun intended and then you take your
badge and you connect the header to the
open space and then when you connect it
to another badge say this badge the
badges will touch and then it'll upload
the virus using the jtag protocol to the
other badge so you so how long does it
take for one badge to infect another
approximately seven seconds or 770 so
you only last 7 seconds exactly I get
off that quick so i guess it so what's
it what's the name of the virus here its
standard in I n like standard in SD I n
yes excellent STD I and so I just need
to come back here later get myself
infected right yeah the codes not quite
working yet they modified the hardware
we're very close we have a demo here
which you can see how fast it is but it
can do it again five seconds later okay
tell me about the demo boards that you
brought here and the fund that must have
been getting this on the plane yeah the
looking at the wiring here taking you
through TSA I was a bit worried that
they might think when it goes through
the x-ray machine seeing any electronics
wired with squishy stuff around it might
look somewhat scary but there wasn't
even a question after I showed in the
boxes the boxes are labeled so but yeah
the the virus itself wasn't what there
should be worried about that you know on
these boards they are middle you know
anything that's got wires like this
you're going to see as being somewhat
scary so this is a development board
equivalent of what the badges are
actually running in this is what you've
been using to what to build the
proof-of-concept virus stuff
anticipating a similar chipset for the
defcon 18 badge exactly it's got the
same processor that is on the badge this
is just a development board with pins
that are very easy to hook things on to
while you're testing developing
prototypes and then we could take that
same code base and put it onto the
DEFCON badge and it should just work ok
so but um so we weren't you know
anticipating LCD or these special
components so now we have to take our
development code and poured it to work
with the special components that are on
this year's badge to customize our virus
for the defcon 18 badge and now that
you've got a display to work with I'm
sure you guys are thinking up some some
very devious stuff at any ideas come to
mind we can do all different stuff the
simplest thing that we could do is
display what generation of infection you
are and of course the lowest number
would be a more original infector
throughout the conference so the idea
that you would want to have a low number
or be infected by a low number so
definitely number like or pi like yeah
or 1337 did by the coolest all right
well I will be back here later to get
infected but I must ask how do you how
do you get you guys are just a group of
friends on IRC what gets you you know
motivated and how do you get excited
about this stuff where do you
in to get into embedded electronics
programming that diff konica last year
pretty much it no anything a year ago so
really you were starting fresh with with
writing code for this processor and
everything yeah we couldn't solder a
year ago Wow so yeah we practice all
year because we didn't want to have the
same father's we had last year so we
practiced and we are motivated based on
our failure from last year so now but
this year we're having different
problems totally different one okay
great and that that's the whole fun of
it thank you guys so much for sharing
with me what you're doing here I look
forward to coming back having some beers
and and getting infected thanks are you
registering domain names in the shell
again we get only sure you do just about
anything in the shower never gets a
weaksauce remains get it up so each
other I mix the chisel dude great idea
and way to name what oh please this is
long i want
that's right code domains are now live
though the biggest domain sense calm and
you can get them now over at domain.com
and while you're there check out their
virtual private servers they provide
unrestricted root access on Windows or
Linux they're easy to manage with cpanel
in plesk and they're capable of hosting
just about any size website you may have
even heard our very own hak5 org is
pimped out on a domain com VPS no matter
where you are you're next idea remember
domain com is the place to save fifteen
percent off a checkout with coupon code
hak5 I've got a great idea it all starts
with a great domain domain com cool so
we've got the pleasure being joined by
HD more HD how are you doing I'm doing
great today how about yourself I'm not
bad this Def Con treating you well yep
great so what's new with rapid seven and
metasploit the biggest thing recently is
the metasploit expressed 341 release
that just came out that adds pivoting
adds all kinds of fun functionality new
extent modules in the last six months
we're actually up to 100,000 and new
landscape metasploit framework I've got
six full-time employees working on it
plus the army of volunteers so things
are just kicking away along so do you
have any particular favorite modules in
the new release my favorite module won't
be released till tomorrow morning but
that's the vxworks module for doing a
memory dump of a device to the VxWorks
debugger I just gave a talk here at Def
Con about it and previously at bsides
and there's a lot of fun things you can
do with it I'm not familiar with the VX
debugger what is that the VX debug
service is a service that was
inadvertently left on line of about
250,000 devices across the internet very
few folks really realized how bad it is
instead of being a well known
vulnerability considering how prevalent
it is it's something very few people
really dug into so the metasploit models
provide a way to basically read/write
dump memory execute code would be like
of any vehicle running the debugger as
well as the different vulnerability that
hasn't been released yet and are these
are these embedded systems is this a
software service what is this vxworks
runs just about everything that doesn't
want a normal OS in 2005 you had 300
million devices running the ex-works
VxWorks is being used by the Mars rovers
used by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
being used with a c-130 Hercules just
about everything funny one a hacked like
robotic Battle suits are running vxworks
that is some scary thoughts so what else
in the the new release tickles your
fancy one thing we just got rolling in
that Egypt presented on was the PHP HP
motor Peter instead of using something
lame like a c99 shell or r57 shell you
have a full meterpreter prompt for any
PHP eval include or otherwise PHP code
execution vulnerability that provides
the same level functionality as the
windows of interpreter and that you can
actually pivot through a comp eyes web
server now using the PS premature prefer
itself so you can install this on
somebody's web server and then use it
running on PHP rather than have to have
the full service installed what will or
explain to me how that works so when you
find a vulnerability in a PHP web
application many times it allows you to
actually execute arbitrary PHP code the
problem things like c99 shell r57 shell
other existing post sex with
exploitation tools is one they don't
work for a while until two they're noisy
on the network not only do they write
files to disc but they generally leave
evidence behind the neat thing about the
PHP meterpreter code is it runs all in
memory on the web server through any of
these vectors and actually stages itself
across a socket the cool thing about
that is then you can use that to
basically pivot like the best example
like to give is you'll comp as a web
application you'll dump the database
crown jewels by reading the
configuration file and then you'll port
for the MySQL port from localhost and
the target back to your own machine any
login via the MySQL dump their tables
near done so it's neat way to kind of do
do more with PHP vulnerabilities that's
very cool so what other kind of features
are you dreaming up for future releases
the big bush we have now is on web
application assessments client-side
security testing doing a lot more on the
payload side as well mature proto
payload is going through all kinds of
changes every you know a couple days we
go through and add new functions change
things fixed bugs the big project right
now is getting the java meterpreter up
to the same level the cool thing when
the java interpreters gives you the same
functionality as a piece premature pedor
the wyndham interpreter but now within
the Java Virtual Machine which also runs
either in you can basically run the
meterpreter directly as an applet or we
can actually use that to install it on a
tomcat server or BS server jboss server
as a easily deployed application and
then have a full mature practice the
target through that excellent thanks so
much for doctors
so we're here at the bumpy booth at a
Def Con and I've always thought bump
keys were really interesting because
it's a way of breaking into locks
without having much skill at all which
is perfect for me because I want a break
into stuff and I don't really have any
skillet anything so we've got Clint here
from Waco Texas so what exactly are you
going to be demonstrating for us I'm
going to demonstrate for you here am1
key way and a master lock and I'm going
to bump this puppy open so what I'm
going to do is put the key all the way
in pull it out one notch put a slight
amount of torque just as if I were to
have the actual key and a pop and there
we go a first try oh and so does this
work on pretty much any lock we've got
keys that can pretty much open any door
in the United States what about in the
rest of the world absolutely we can get
the European bump keys and we also have
lock picks for those as well so bump
keys are like 999 keys that's like a key
that has closed up the different depths
when you look at them it's the farthest
one down would be a 9 and so you put it
in a machine and you say 999 and then
you get a bump absolutely and then you
have to shave a little bit off the hilt
right here right absolutely actually no
there's two different kinds of bump keys
there's a minimal movement and just a
standard bump key the minimal movement
bump key is where it's shaved off the
hill those will actually damage a
cylinder so if they're shaved off they
can go in and this little angle there
that will warp the cylinder out so what
you want to have is a regular bump key
and just a one notch out one notch in
every time very cool so let me see if I
can give this a shot real quick welp we
have several sets of keys we've got four
different rings here we've got the
residential set which pretty much has
your k to be 1k to be ten obtuse legs
and the most common master lock key
which is the m1 let me go into more of
the commercial set which is going to
have arrow a master in the AO
high-security best Yoko I n33
everybody's got one of these it's their
mailbox key probably and then we have
padlocks American padlocks master and
this is the most common key in the world
it's the Y 11 every desk pad lot or a
guest cash register camlock you can
think of is probably one of these so
pretty much the trick is you have to
have the right key for the right type of
lock you just don't need the specific
key for
individual lock right it's pretty much
like anything if it fits in the hole
it's good to go so what are the
different color hammers these are
specially made I assume they are this is
a flex plus bump hammer it's real wobbly
all of them are weighted at the head to
get the right precise hit for bumping a
lot this one's got a little bit more
wiggle to it wrist action this one's
more rigid so if you're in a tight spot
you need to bump something you can do it
a little better and so I guess you have
like a very certain weight and frequency
and kind of you know specific feel that
tends to work best for a bump key it's
all touch everything about it is so it's
the right amount of torque and they
robbed right amount of pop on the key
it's what's gonna make it happen but I
mean I guess these are specifically
optimized to make it so that any idiot
can do it pretty easily well somewhat I
just did it so any idiot can do it it's
still a school thank you very much so a
little earlier we're talking to us team
redacted about their standard in or STD
in virus on the defcon 18 badge let's
find out a little bit about the actual
defcon 18 bad you develop this didn't
you yes okay and this is this is the
third badge now or what this is actually
the fifth electronic badger you done for
defcon excellent at what has been the
evolution of the electronic badges and
why electronic badges to begin with yeah
well the the first time we did it was
def con 14 and at that point you know
the conference badges were just either
like boring plastic or maybe metal or
you know acrylic or something but nobody
had done anything like an alack active
electronic products so we thought it
would be cool to just try something and
see the response and the response was
crazy we made like seven almost seven
thousand badges and people you know
we're really into it and they're like
wow blinking lights and they wanted to
start modifying it and hacking it so
just progress from there and every year
we're sort of learning new technologies
and learning new techniques and trying
to make you know have some artistic
elements and just do things that never
really been done before and just kind of
keep pushing it so what is the new
hotness with the defcon 18 badge so that
the new hotness there's actually two new
hotness 'as if that's a word there is a
so we have the the LCD which is uh from
a company called kent displays and it's
um it's a cola steric LCD so it's sort
of like the kindle display that people
are familiar with explain that to me i'm
not familiar with the technology so the
technology is basically the
liquid crystals are twisted in such a
way that you don't have to continually
refresh the display so once you write to
the display you don't need any battery
power or anything like that and the
image will stay there indefinitely and
then the second hotness would be so the
second hotness is the fact that we're
using an aluminum substrate circuit
board so it's a solid piece of metal
with artwork laser engraved on the
badges so as far as I know no one's ever
done laser engraving on aluminum
substrate circuit boards for like an
active artistic circuit board before and
we have seven different types for human
vendor contest goon speaker press and
uber who are the people that win the
contest at the end of Def Con so there's
different artwork on each one and you
can set them all next to each other and
have like a nice landscape image ok well
tell me about the the actual firmware
the chips what we've got on here and and
on following up with the different
badges like I have the press one here do
I have different firmware than anybody
else so the firmware the functionality
is exactly the same between all of the
badges and the the design is really
simple that's what I really try to do
you know we have we have some serious
cost constraints and and time
constraints and we you know we want to
do something that's that's cool looking
but not completely intrusive because a
lot of people even though they think the
badge is cool they don't want to just
pack on it they just want to wear it and
go do other contests so we don't want it
to be intrusive we want it to be
something that can still be hackable so
there's this trade-off so you know we
have a battery we have a free scale MC
56 F 8006 which is a 16-bit digital
signal controller so it has all sorts of
really cool math functions and hardware
based acceleration and stuff and that's
actually the same part we used at Def
Con 17 and we had some customs issues
last year and had to order another seven
thousand explain to me the customs issue
because somebody was trying to tell me
that last year that you're using the
same chip from last year for some reason
that had to do with customs on the 17
badge yeah so the reason that we're
using this the same freescale part is um
last year we'd sent seven thousand parts
uh to our factory in China and they got
held in customs for months so we said
okay plan B we're gonna order seven
thousand more parts program them ship
those to China those got stuck in
customs too so now we had fourteen
thousand parts and customs and we
couldn't return them eventually the
seven thousand went through and DEF CON
17 proceeded as normal and then a few
months later I got the other seven
thousand reach
back to me so we had stock of the chip
you know it's not an ideal situation
because we want to try to do something
new with new parts every time but on the
on the other hand people are already
familiar with the chip so those people
that are hacking the badge now they have
a leg up because they already know what
to do exactly now I noticed you've got
USB on here and it shows up as a
standard TTYL what does that allow me to
do as a badge holder so there's two
different things that that USB serial
port provides the first in the regular
mode is a like an LCD control API so you
can send commands to the badge through
hyperterminal or any of your favorite
you know comport to serial port programs
to actually load the frame buffer and
and change the display and then rewrite
the display so it basically allows
people that aren't necessarily into
hardware hacking to still do something
with their badge and then the second
thing is a bootloader that you can
actually compile your own code based on
the code that we released on the DEF CON
CD of the badge model because this is
all open source yeah all open source all
the details are there so you can modify
the badge recompile it and then load it
through the serial bootloader back onto
the device and you don't need any
special hardware to do it well thank you
so much for sharing that with us
back from Def Con and alive and on our
respective coasts I'm joined here by
none other than Colleen and Rob fuller
in Northern Virginia and there's a lot
of big news that came out of Def Con
that we didn't necessarily get to see on
the show floor because as you guys saw
with with me it's a zoo it's an absolute
zoo you guys have a good time definitely
anything Bob catch your interest one of
the things that I thought was really
interesting was the GSM hacking that was
going on I mean everyone's carrying
around these little cell phones all the
time and GSM is of course the most
popular standard in the world and people
putting up theirs and you know spilling
all their most confidential data into it
to their you know bank teller or their
wife or their doctor or whatever and
people were generating a completely
usable gsm hacking solution right this
is the stuff that was the research I was
coming from Chris Paquette we saw him at
shmoocon this year muaks talking about
the same thing he actually did a demo
where he had to kind of get permission
from the FCC you guys may have noticed
that there were posters all over the
conference letting you know that between
certain hours during his talk that that
if you didn't want to be part of an
experiment involving gsm and your data
being sniffed turn off your phone the
thing that really scares me is once he
bumps it up to once he kicks it up that
notch to data where all of your phones
like are essentially you're basically
connecting to Wi-Fi and having all your
data go through him if if he could if he
kicks that one notch up right it is kind
of the perfect man in the middle but as
it is right now it's only for voice over
IP are not even voice over IP it's only
for 2g data and that's because he's
jamming the 3g signal so all of our
phones just kind of inherently drop down
to you know the lower standard right
which has been broken the 3g and 4g
standards have not been broken yet so i
guess you could theoretically just
select for your phone to not use those
standards that are broken that would be
a legitimate work around i'm just not
sure of all phones even have that option
but hopefully we don't only let you kill
off the 3g it doesn't allow you to kill
off edge
well stop using an iPhone okay I'm sorry
it's a trap or you could also just use a
cdma phone i mean when i was going to
defcon i decide okay no Wi-Fi devices
and nothing from work and only cdma
phones right now if you wanted to build
this yourself it's all open source and
it's all available it's a basically
$1,500 investment to get yourself and a
u.s. RP or a universal software radio
peripheral from eddie's calm and then
you get some open BTS which is a
distribution that allows you to
basically build your own base station
and then tie it all together with
asterisk on the backend to actually
connect the calls to the plain old
telephone system and there you go you've
got yourself a little gsm network as
some other fun social engineering stuff
coming out of Def Con muaks did you see
what the people over a defensive
security we're doing yeah they did a
social engineering contest which was
pretty awesome when they first set it up
they got contacted by the FBI and the
FBI got pretty up in their face about it
essentially wanting them to take it down
but they talked to the eff and they got
they worked with the FBI and made the
contest so that it wasn't going to be
intrusive to the companies that were
targeted basically yeah it seems that
they weren't actually trying to glean a
password or secure data from these
companies they're actually looking for
pretty trivial stuff like you know about
their cafeteria at their office or what
web browser they're using so you know
and specifically not targeting financial
institutions at all right and the the
things that that really came out of that
contest was that I think it was 5 out of
160 calls were denied information when
they asked for it and that really kind
of you know shows that even with the
little bit of information or with the
trivial information they asked for a
good social engineer could bump that up
and get more important data and right
because these were just amateurs anybody
could sign up and try this contest and
to think that only
five out of a hundred and forty calls
would reject you well you just hang up
and you call again yeah I mean that's
what I always do the customer service
representatives if they're not giving me
exactly what I want like you know a
discount on my service or a free phone
upgrade or something BAM I hang up call
back another one and they give it to me
right to noted here in the article that
one particular social engineer was able
to get the customer service
representative to actually visit a URL
and when asked why the social engineer
replied that it would just make him feel
better if the CSR visited the URL and of
course it was nothing malicious but you
know had it been oh that could be you
know I hugely dangerous right that's
actually it would make me feel better it
would make me feel better you would
download this executable and run it
Darren it'll make me feel better if you
order me a pizza right now from
zachary's i might be getting social
engineered right now and on that note i
am starving and it's late but we had a
such a great time at Def Con I want to
thank you both for joining me so we
could wrap up two of the more
interesting things that we didn't get to
see on the show floor but I thought were
quite important looking forward to the
next Def Con with you guys and of course
I do want to thank the sponsor that is
making this possible if you aren't using

when it comes to capturing flags I still
think it's something to do with Unreal
Tournament and that's because I'm left
in 1999 so to figure it all out i'm here
at Def Con with Egypt what's up man
nothing hanging out so you guys are
competing with within the capture the
flag how is acne pharmaceutical Zealand
at the moment we're in first but as they
said the the scoreboard isn't entirely
accurate but we're about double the next
team so entirely accurate e is fine with
me you're gonna have to completely
school me because I am so new to the
concept of capture the flag at Def Con I
hear though that it is a tradition and
institution if you will gah what's the
back of the book version how does that
work alright so DEFCON CTF is basically
an all-out pwnage session for three days
and it is the only contest at DEFCON
that gives away more than one black
badge a black badge at DEFCON for those
who don't know is a free pass to DEFCON
4 life and yeah so we're hoping that we
pick up eight of them this weekend rock
on now how do you get involved in even
playing this game it requires winning
qualls you have to be in the top ten in
the qualification round and
qualification is is in the past it's
been a jeopardy style board where they
asked questions and each subsequent
question gets harder and is worth more
points I was this done online or the
previous Khan has at work all done
online and it's usually several hundred
teams okay so out of several hundred
teams they allow 10 to come and compete
each team is comprised of what is their
living on how many people you can have
there's a limit to the number that can
sit at the table at one time so at on
the first day it's eight on the second
day it's ten and then after that they
open it up so on Sunday it gets to be a
really big zoo in there right on and I'm
sure you guys have like friends on IRC
maybe helping out alone maybe a little
awesome so what is it to compete what
are you of fighting against what kind of
what's the network look like so
basically the guys who set it up give us
a server and when we walk in we have no
idea what the server looks like and it
includes a certain number of services
and each of those services
is worth points you have to keep them
alive you have a service level and you
have to pone the other teams okay so not
only are you playing the defense
maintaining your SLA keeping your
services up and and but you're attacking
now tell me these services are we
talking like Apache Tomcat stuff like
that smtp services or what no there are
all custom services a lot of them are
something you're not normally kind of
familiar with like they'll take an HTTP
server and then make it stupid so it's
something that you might normally be
familiar with but they'll change it in a
way that your normal tools won't work
okay so it's not like you can just fire
up metasploit pointed at the box and you
know and hopefully it's a service that
already has vulnerabilities you're
really going in there and just trying at
random has odd what's your technique
when it comes to the attacking side of
that basically it's all reverse
engineering and what now you are a core
developer for metasploit how does that
give you or your team an advantage well
yes i am a core developer but I'm one of
only two guys on our team that actually
speaks Ruby so everybody else is writing
standalone exploits which is kind of a
painting the ass for me but all of my
exploits are Ruby and all of Josh's
exploits are Ruby which makes our stuff
work really well together okay when I
think capture the flag I think there's
you know each team has a flag you take
it and you bring it back to your base
how does that work in the network hacker
world well every year it's different um
in previous years it was submitted over
SSL or at one point it was actually a
modem connection which sucked and so the
the way that you submit Keys is
different each time but it's usually
something kind of geeky ok and then
points are scored based on various
challenges or has that work yeah so in
indy detex scoring system it's a zero
sum game there are only so many points
total and you get a percentage of those
points based on the number of other
people pointing a service nice at so how
does somebody that's interested in
playing this here at Def Con get
involved
um start out uh you know learning how to
use Ida first off but you got to really
it's that much reverse engineering it's
a ton of reverse engineering but
qualification rounds are not so much
reverse engineering so first you have to
beat qualls and that means learning how
to use the Jeopardy board which means
playing in previous rounds of calls so
then the qualification round also
includes a bunch of not necessarily
exploitation related questions um but a
lot of like forensics questions and a
lot of like here's a packet capture show
me the O'Day kind of questions so
there's in the qualification rounds it's
more of a wide-ranging skill set for CTF
itself it's mostly honing all right well
you got to tell me in your experience
doing the CTF what is the craziest thing
you've seen any like sabotage anything
like that yeah so this actually happened
a couple of years ago when I was playing
for somebody else and we were able to
replace our key files which normally
wasn't allowed we were able to replace
our key files with basically arbitrary
characters so we put back tick cat star
pipe netcat and we stole a whole bunch
of keys that way that's awesome dude
thank you so much I wish you guys the
best of luck with the Acme
pharmaceuticals thanks so hey dr. saws
were here at Def Con and I just saw you
I've met you once before when I was
buying a bunch of stuff from your former
warehouse you had a prototype when we're
unloading all the prototype this gear
that was a really cool show that I
really enjoyed watching actually I think
one of my friends was one of the welders
on your endless water slide oh great
yeah those were a great bunch of welders
and that was a really cool project would
have been great if we could have had
like a six hour episode of a devoted to
that project because there was so much
cool technical detail I guess one of the
limitations when you're on like typical
broadcast television is that you only
have so much time to talk about stuff
yeah you got like 44 minutes i think you
know after the ads are taken out and
then recap and all that kind of stuff so
yeah well that's what the Internet's for
right so what exactly are you doing here
what brings you to Def Con so I gave two
talks this year the first one was a work
shop that i did with two other guys from
MIT about sort of hacker education and
how we can make more hackers and then a
second talk was just kind of a fun fun
loving comedy talk about recovering my
computer from someone that had stolen it
and basically it got stolen and two
years later came back online and I found
it and I owned it and owned the guy that
had it and recovered the computer so how
exactly did you own him what were the
repercussions for this poor individual
who dare cross you well the he sort of
got off lightly he'd lost the computer
and he didn't get arrested or anything
but then I totally mocked him at Def Con
but she probably don't care about cuz
you know it's not a hacker but everyone
here thought it was funny so what you
find on the system well I actually don't
have the machine back yet the police is
still impounded it but running through
the directories and stuff mostly it was
still my stuff it hadn't been wiped so
that's good I might get a lot of my data
back but yeah he was mostly using it for
browsing online dating sites you copy
and paste the same email to like 200
women I guess that's kind of
embarrassing for the rest of the world
to find out so what's the what's the
favorite thing you've seen here at Def
Con that other people are doing um well
I really really like the badges this
year they're always very impressive and
I'm really looking forward to see what
people come up with in the badge hacking
competition people seem to be working
hard a lot of stuff going on in the
hardware hacking village so that that I
guess is going to be the most exciting
thing for tomorrow we were up in the
hardware hacking village and I think I
forget the name of the team but they
were working on a virus for the badges
that you could just press them together
and they in fact each other that was
really cool excellent yeah I've been
hoping to see something like that at
some point as the badges get most
sophisticated and they start
communicating I was really hoping
getting DEFCON 16 where they had the
infrared transmission system that
someone would write something that would
spread but that communication system i
think was so unreliable that no one
could really transmit anything with it
yeah I've noticed that the ninja Badgers
apparently the people are having trouble
fighting with each other works about ten
percent of the time yeah I don't really
know much about it but that's the
platform i think is that is right for a
virus to spread cuz it's all about
communication i guess this is the place
for that to happen alright thanks so
much good to see you have fun i'm here
with john and i absolutely love seeing
how hak5 viewers
some of the projects that we do and
totally run with them oh and you're
playing with what what project here the
Wi-Fi pineapple one of the near and dear
to Robin dies heart and so what is it
about this one that you've modified and
done so cool dude well I took the
regular Wi-Fi pineapple which it has a
jet you have your software installed and
intercepts any pro requests and reply to
those and I wanted to make it stand
alone so I could just actually stick it
in a pineapple and put it on a shelf so
i put a webpage on the on the pineapple
itself and then i resolved all dns
queries to that web page so whenever
anybody whenever it sees anybody's pro
requests for any network that's out
there it says yeah that's me and then
they connect to that and then whatever
page they go to Google Yahoo whatever it
just resolves all those DNS queries to
itself and Rick rolls them to rickroll
you guys have got to see this it's an
ascii rick roll it plays the mp3 and
that is just so hot because you can
leave that anywhere it doesn't need to
be connected to the Internet it's the
instant rick roller instant girl
automatic yep now you have this written
up on your blog right I do yes I do and
people can find that over at bebo blog
John bebo.com so in the lower third

I swear to god I'm gonna kill that thing
keeps on buzzing around the pen and
drugs nuts back
still at the hardware hacking village
and check it out as Shalom what's up man
hey how's it going do it excellent now i
really appreciate you offering me a nice
beverage here it's not cold it's not
cold I actually just got back from
contraption pulling contest out by the
pool we take the beers and basically
leave them out in the Vegas Sun and try
to pull them down as fast as we possibly
can okay and so is there like a record
for this I don't know what the record of
assault hand advance if everything is
measured in degrees per second so
however fast you can get it down to a
drinkable temperature somewhere in the
40s or even 30s all right so you think
you can get this beer drinkable for me
right now I think I get this beer
drinkable for you about 30 to 40 seconds
probably all right let's do it what do
we do all I'm gonna yeah go ahead and
walk me through this what it would these
elements are the people I hope this is I
think the fourth or fifth time that
entered this a lot of people vote for
way over engineered products for a
couple years I tried that and I kept on
failing miserably so I decided simpler
is better this year I basically just got
some ice packs that you can go ahead and
buy in any supermarket or anything
they're designed with like wrap around
cans or a cooler or something cut them
up it's a little individual things stick
them in the tub
and add some beer
you're gonna get a cold beer probably 30
to 40 seconds here yeah I've been
actually using the dry ice to refreeze
the cold packs throughout the contest
and I've been walking around the
constants and getting rid of the extra
beer that we had just cooling it for
people as you go I like this it looks
like it looks like Romulan ale right now
but but you figure in just a few seconds
here still drinkable probably about
another 10 seconds over totally totally
drinkable and actually for a while since
I had so many of these cold packs I was
rephrasing them and we would just lay
out as many cuts that we had 16 cups at
one point we're just constantly moving
down the beer animals ever done in the
crowd and it's an excuse to drink right
before the cock well I like that idea
and it definitely does feel cold so
let's say pull aside from it being
Budweiser that was definitely drinkable
yeah definitely I hope we have some
hacker shore next year because I've been
saying for a while we should get hacker
shore it is a hacker come but we can get
some better beer I think it's sweet so
what are you up to you these days I'm a
general IT consultant just you know kind
of your average everyday IT ninja I say
I've seen you all over the Twitter's if
you haven't checked it out it sir spans
a lot thanks so much dude thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
