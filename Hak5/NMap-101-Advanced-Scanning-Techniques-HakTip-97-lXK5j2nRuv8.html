support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are going
over advanced scanning options in nmap
now we already know that there a
numerous rate ways to scan a target in
nmap from the discovery options that we
learned last week to the default
scanning options that we've used since
the beginning there are other options
that I wanted to cover for user
selectable scan types instead of the
basic TCP scan like nmap usually does
these Advanced Options are good to know
if you're scanning an uncommon tar
target or you need to use a specific
service similar to last week pseudo is
required for a lot of these options so
the first option that I wanted to cover
is tak SS this performs a tcp syn scan
this option will send a syn packet which
is short for synchronized to the target
and wait for a response some servers
won't be able to detect this in pro but
just don't count on that if you're
expecting nobody to see you now this
command is going to look something like
this you'll type an nmap and then tack
lowercase s uppercase s 1073 dot 31.1
four or five now if i'm correct yes it
does require sudo so I'm going to add
sudo to the beginning of this and run it
type in the password so you get a
response back similar to the ones that
we've seen previously with the open
ports and if any closed ports are there
it will also state those up above now if
required of course put sudo at the
beginning so that you are able to gain
root privileges now next up is the st
option which is it performs a TCP
connect scan now this is the default for
non-root users so you're probably
already running this kind of scan but
just in case you didn't know about it
here you go it will attempt to connect
to the target without any kind of
stealthy mode so to do this one you
would type in nmap tak s capital T 10
dot 73 or whatever your target is
at one four or five and again it's going
to look similar to the outputs we've
seen previously
you will notice though that running this
that sometimes our first option with
tech SS for syn packets does end up
being a lot faster now another option
would be the tach s capital u option
which is scanning for UDP which is user
Datagram protocol for this one you would
type in sudo and map tech s U and then
your target now for this one and a tcp
null scan which is tak an option that
tcp null is used to trick a target into
thinking that it is probing with tcp so
it still generates a response now before
we take a break
the last option I wanted to share is the
TAC SF option for a TCP fin scan this is
used to solicit a TCP ack for
acknowledge that kind of packet from a
target it can also be used on a target
protected by a firewall now let's go
ahead and take a quick break but we will
be right back after the sponsor the hack
shop is hack fives premier store for all
of your pen testing needs including one
of my favorites the USB rubber ducky
which looks like a flash drive and it
types like a keyboard it can type
scripts in to your computer crazy crazy
fast like this week's pick from three
six nine nine n in the hack five forums
he shares a command that will
continuously run a batch file on a
Windows machine until the PC finally
crashes because why not
if we couldn't do the show without your
support so we would like to thank you
with something special you can use the
coupon code snubz that's me with any
order for your very own signed hacked
tip stickers aren't they cute even there
in signed it thank you so much for
supporting the show and of course we
couldn't do it without you
we're back with some more advanced
scanning options and we have just a few
more to share so bear with me first off
is the tak sx option which looks kind of
like this for this one you do need to
use sudo so sudo nmap tak s capital X
and then your target some mine I just
love using this target it's a great
example
it worked so basically this one is said
to light up the packet like a Christmas
tree hence the name which is an ex Miss
scan that's weird and map sends packets
which with urg which means urgent Finn
which closes a connection and psh for
push active next we have a fun one
called scan flags scan vlogs this will
let you run a custom scat scan with your
very own choices of packets so you don't
have to do a separate scan every time
you want to do a syn scan or a core push
or fin or whatever you want so you can
use syn/ack push urge or urg for urgent
rst for reset and then fin so it would
look something like this I would type in
n map and then tack tack or - - scan
flags and whichever ones I wanted to
type in so for this example I'm going to
use a canned psh for push 10 dot 7330
1.1 4 5 my example scanner so it's going
to scan and it will push out any
information that it gets from those two
different protocols so tcp acts scans
those are my next ones are very simple
you can just use that by adding s a a
capital a to your command and this is
also useful to find out if the target is
protected by any kind of firewall if you
see a line in your output that says a
number and then filtered ports chances
are those ports are protected by some
kind of firewall now if you're unsure
which scan to use which kind of might
come up for you start with an IP
protocol scan to show you what protocols
are available on this specific target
for this example you would type in nmap
and then tack s capital o not 0 10 17 3
31 not 1 4 5 or your target oops I
forgot my sudo let me type sudo
apparently I can't type it all today
there we go so this is going to take a
little bit longer but once it finishes
up your target will show you the
protocol state and the service that is
running remember that handy handy table
that we linked to last week that shows
all of the popular protocols in their
common associated numbers this is very
very handy to use whenever you're using
this specific targeting command so there
is a way to send raw Ethernet packets as
well too if you're interested not as
useful as other ones but it is still
handy to know so for this example you
don't need sudo Freud but you just type
in nmap tak-tek send tech ETH for
Ethernet and then 10 73 31 and whatever
your target is and it'll go ahead and
give you the same simple output and this
is also naturally implied so generally
you don't really need to use it and
lastly you can also alternatively use
raw IP packets and for this one you
would type in something similar and
instead of e th you would type in IP and
press Enter
so you'll get kind of the same output as
you similarly seen in the past this is
also automatically implied so it's rare
that you would actually have to write it
out now what would you like to see next
about nmap I've been getting a ton of
really good feedback from you guys so I
appreciate everybody that's been sending
in emails about them although I'm not
able to you know reply to every single
one I do appreciate each and every one
that you've been sending so thank you so
much now you can send me a comment below
or you can email us as usual over at
tips at hack 5 org if you like nmap
perhaps you'll enjoy Metasploit minute
of course with mu bik's airing every
wednesday over at hak5 org and be sure
to check out hack 5 it's our sister show
we've been doing great stuff over there
since 2005 and I love love love working
with them I'll be over there reminding
you as usual to trust your tech no less
