Taryn kitchen - weekly dose
technological playing with drones again
this week
I said not these guys set to under some
repair as we get ready for some new fun
stuff in the new year so let's just
travel into my office here and get into
it because we get a lot of awesome
feedback from not last week's episode
I'm sure that was a train wreck but the
episode about our drone our denial of
drone attack which was a lot of fun so
thanks for tuning in thanks for
supporting that and I would like to kick
off a little thing called perch and
stare that's right I'm just going to
stare at you now this is very boring no
actually what I'm talking about purchase
here is a is an element of a competition
that DARPA where the Department of
Defense Advanced Research Project had
just few years ago you may remember
these guys from little projects like the
DARPA Grand Challenge to create a
driverless car or this little point
thing called the Internet and so these
guys are kind of cool because they put
money behind meet stuff and they had a
contest UAV Forge was crowd sourcing
whole bunch really interesting UAV
development the contest had all of these
different specifications like being able
to go out like beyond line of sight and
land on a place and perch and monitor
and avoid obstacles and standard a
thousand feet and all these other
interesting things which was really cool
and I ran into this recently after you
know playing with these drones and the
first thing that comes to mind is let's
put a pineapple on it right let's do
some monitoring because I could
potentially put this somewhere where I
would like to do some packet sniffing
that I wouldn't otherwise be able to
easily access and that's a really
interesting concept so I looked into it
and it turns out I'm not the first
person to have ever thought of this in
fact just this
current and DEF CON I don't know how I
missed this talk but Ricki hill at Def
Con 2013 gave a talk on doing just that
by taking he took a while at the time a
Wi-Fi pineapple mark for and the this
guy this previous gen drone by DJI good
stuff and he you know used it to do that
per to monitor and I was like huh
alright well let's step up the game okay
so what I would like to do now and this
is very much a proof-of-concept segment
so I am nowhere near having air all the
bugs ironed out but I thought I'd share
with you the development of it what I'd
like to do is take the the current gen
latest drones from DJI because these are
ridiculously easy and pair it with the
latest gen Wi-Fi pineapple so take the
mark-5
and then pair it with a 12 volt battery
here as well as an inexpensive prepaid
GSM phone now I'm starting with the
phantom ii gen phantom and a lot of
people wrote in today why haven't you
you know developed your own because
there's an entire community of making
your own there's some really cool
resources i'll have and the show notes
for that and i'm working my way into
that but i figured i should probably
learn to fly first and this is one of
those things that's super simple to
learn on so I highly recommend that as a
platform and I've gone ahead and removed
this camera here so this is the let's
see here I think it's five ounce 4.8
ounce this is basically just a Wi-Fi
network camera that ties in with the
rest of the the system there so we're
taking this off and replacing in its
place because we need every ounce we can
get as well as I want to make sure that
we actually have a decent center of
gravity here we're going to go ahead and
put in our Mark 5 as well as our 12 volt
battery this is the 18 hour battery I
was talking about in the last segment I
would use a smaller say last gen
pineapple juice but there's only five
volt whereas this is our smallest 12
volt guy and I really am going to need
to use that because last piece of the
puzzle here is our t-mobile prepay
phone I love you guys over at t-mobile
because you can just buy a SIM card in
cash and all they do is ask you to write
your name down on a sticky note actually
although on that I must say what on
earth were you thinking that the prism
to really really t-mobile the prism I
guess we haven't learned anything okay
well anyway so with all of that and then
of course the cables that we're going to
need that brings us up to what now like
ah fifteen fifteen point three fifteen
point four ounces so my flight time is
not going to be anywhere near twenty
minutes but that's fine because you know
I'll get into the rest of the drone
stuff but I on the roof so let's just go
fly now and then I'll talk to the rest
of it although I should say that you
could go with a much lighter system for
the camera however I'm not doing that
because I'm actually using the cellphone
for its data connection to do an auto
SSA to reverse connection right back to
my virtual private server so that I can
control it and then I can also use this
GPS and I can use the camera onboard to
help me navigate and get to the rooftop
they want to get to
so speaking of rooftops let's go to one
now I probably couldn't have picked a
worse phone to pair for this project but
what I was going for was what is the
least expensive burner that I can pick
up with a prepaid sim and this prism too
is absolutely horrible it was the least
expensive that I could get with an
Android OS I would run but I would run
hangouts because I didn't want to have
to reinvent the wheel
my initial concept was to use WebRTC or
web real-time communications because
it's got an awesome framework for doing
something very similar to Google
Hangouts where you can you know just
just with this framework build well
real-time video and it works on Chrome
for Android except it doesn't for this
phone so I've fallen back on my hangout
idea it's it's not the greatest I'm
gonna have to find something better but
I do need
Fellon regardless or at least either the
phone or a 3G dongle to provide Internet
access for the for the Wi-Fi pineapple
down here so I figured I was killing two
birds one stone
turns out it's going to make things
exciting today so I'm just going to go
ahead and strap this guy down here with
my fancy Dancy rubber bands and already
in a call here and so now the pineapples
on it's getting Internet through the
phone and as you can see here it's the
frame rate is it's just terrible but
it's what we've got for right now so I
want to at least test the concept and
learn if anything if if this is too much
weight for this system or if I have to
completely redo this with smaller lipo
batteries and a dedicated camera and 3G
hardware rather than this have you found
so let me just make sure I'm good to go
and I am not so the Phantom have booted
it up and what I'm waiting for is for it
to get a signal to enough satellites in
the sky it's based on GPS and the reason
for that is because it has a return to
home feature which means I'm going to be
able to put it on a rooftop where I'd
like to do my Wi-Fi monitoring and then
power down the motors get as much
battery life as I possibly can out of
this and then when I'm ready to come
home it's simply a matter of turning off
the receiver it's going to shoot up into
the sky make a beeline for where it came
from and land within two meters of where
I took off from so that's why we're
doing it from this rooftop and I'm
trying to get line-of-sight to the other
rooftop ultimately I'd love to be able
to do all of the fpv stuff over 4G but
baby steps
look at this fall let's just uh read
under here yeah
actually one of the advantages is with a
hangout I can get it over glass which is
kind of a novel concept I don't know if
I would really prefer that for fpv I'd
rather have like oculus rift or phat
sharks there's some other big goggles so
I'm just using my huge phone here but
yeah I mean that's kind of an
interesting aspect of it you could do
fpv over Google glass it's actually not
terrible right now so the reason we're
the camera pointed straight down is I
can actually see the rooftop and I can
see me standing right there so if I
wanted to land on me I could so let's
give it a shot before we completely
exhaust this battery which I'm sure is
not happy right now
yeah but can we get to okay well yeah
except if I can't recover it totally be
hosed okay if you say so pull I mean
look at the video coming off of this
it's such a narrow field you can
actually yeah so I'm actually seeing the
trees and stuff I'm going over really
drifting just get that yeah you get the
dren landing how's that
whoa
what Paul well this is fantastic
no okay so it's not orrible it's not
completely flawed aside from the fact
that my camera is like tilted the wrong
direction so you kind of got a look at
the phone this way that totally worked I
could look down and I could see like oh
you don't want to land there's a bunch
of poles coming out of the roof and you
know avoid the boxes over here and and
yeah that totally worked like I'm
looking at concrete and so I've got it
powered down now so now I should be able
to connect one Wi-Fi pineapple
I set it up with a boot mode script with
the dip switches to record with
airmon-ng to an SD card I didn't put the
boot switches so and that was what was
going to kick off the ssh to my server
so I needed to have flipped the switches
all right well at least we can test this
check this out so I'm just going to go
ahead and because I can't get onto that
roof without becoming a ninja and so
I'll just go ahead and turn off the
remote and an annulment it shouldn't
just come home
we hope all right here we go oh my god
we doing this let me - last week's
episode in this I think like proof of
concept fail I yeah I just realized what
it was Paul the return to home feature
doesn't work when you've turned off the
propellers so when I landed and I cut
the engine
it's now saying okay cool I'm happy I'm
home so if I turn them on again I could
technically fly it back here but it's
going to count that spot right now is
its home for its return to home and I
honestly should just hack the firmware
to set waypoints anyway but I thought
I'd give it a go so let's see if we can
at least get it back what a fail um
please tell me you see me here we go I
think thank God
well at least we've covered it nothing
goes as well as I had hoped they need to
kind of go back to the drawing board on
this but still the concept is sound you
know perch and monitor it's it shouldn't
be too difficult to put it on a rooftop
somewhere leave it for a couple hours
record what I need on the Wi-Fi
pineapple and then come home so yeah at
least that's the concept I guess this is
one of those things where we just need
to garner some feedback and then
somebody really will be like yeah well
then as I am control there you just give
it a the make it work dip switch and
then then I'll remember to look my
pineapple dip switch to make my payload
go and well anyway it'll be epically
less fail I'm glad this is the New
Year's episode no one's actually
watching we'll see you in 2014

and now it's time for the trivia
question of the week last week's trivia
question was what year did Ivan
Sutherland create the first head-mounted
VR an augmented reality display system
and the answer is 1968 this week's
question is what is an e c.o you can
answer that over at hack 5 org slash
trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack 5 goodies
we have CDs we have flash drives we have
solid-state drives external hard drives
even floppy disks
I actually saw some in my dad's closet
and we have paper now paper wouldn't be
my first choice but this is kind of
interesting there are actually programs
available that will convert your files
into data that can be printed and stored
until you need it on paper and then once
you need the data you can scan the paper
and then decrypt the information saved
and you can even add a password so this
week I decided to check out a program
called paperback and this is a very easy
program to use all you have to do is
download the file and then you just
unzip it and you don't even have to
install it's so easy to use this program
will let you save a file that you want
to print into a bitmap and then if you
have to open the bitmap you can do that
in paperback as well and then you can
scan a photo and then decrypt it in
paperback all inside the program so I'm
going to go ahead and show you exactly
how this program works I'll pull it up
on my computer up here this is paper
back when you first open it it doesn't
say anything up here this is just from a
previous scan that I had going there's a
whole lot of options that you can go
through in paperback to customize your
own settings depending on your scanner
and your printer
so before printing you'll want to go
ahead and choose some specific options
that worked for me first off is the dot
density this is going to be the density
of the dots determining the size of the
data bit on the paper the closer the
dots are the more data that you can fit
onto a piece of paper my HP LaserJet can
do up to 600 dpi for the dot done
city so I put mine at the very top at
300dpi you can also change the dot size
to whatever you'd like I cut mine around
70% this is basically how far each dot
is from each other on the actual paper
and then the last thing I changed was
compression this reduces the size of the
bit mat so that it's not a huge file and
you don't end up with several different
pieces of paper obviously if you do have
a large file that you want to convert on
to a piece of paper to save you should
probably go ahead and turn that into a
nice zipped file or a compressed file
beforehand before you actually turn it
into a bitmap so now what I'm going to
do once I have all those settings set
I'm going to go ahead and click OK and
you can see up here you have encryption
options as well so you can encrypt your
data and send a password whenever you
decide to open the text so I'm going to
click OK I'll leave those off I'm going
to go ahead and open a bitmap so you can
see what it looks like in the file in
the program and I'll go to my folder so
this is a bitmap that I had created
previously and this is just a simple
photo from my Twitter account it's my
Twitter profile picture exactly so it's
a very small picture the quality map
over on the right-hand side shows you
how many file bits that you have going
on all the different blocks and then if
any blocks have any kind of errors it'll
show you that as well since mine is just
full green it basically tells you that
everything's ok and I don't have any
issues with the data if I click on
blocks that'll actually show me each
block on the paper so I can go down
several rows I can go over to the right
so I can see an up-close-and-personal
photo of what's going to end up being
printed once I am ready to go ahead and
print this I can just hit print
I'll choose open and then I can choose
my laser jet printer and go ahead and
print it now you don't want to change
any of the optional settings that you
have in your in your HP printer or
whatever printer that you actually have
you want to go ahead and just leave it
to whatever the default is so I'll go
ahead and cancel out
that since I already printed out a
couple of different files and I'll show
you what I came up with so this is what
you get it doesn't look too interesting
at first but if you look up close and
personal it's actually a whole bunch of
little dots that are compressed into
kind of what ends up being a QR code in
a way so this first file was just a text
document and you can tell with these two
it was a much larger file so these two
were my Twitter image and I decided to
do two different ones damage one or the
other to see if I could actually scan it
back what's interesting with this is
once I scanned it I was able to go back
into paperback and I'll go ahead and
pull this up for you so I'm going to
scan a new folder new file so I'll go
ahead and go to file too and there we go
I'll open a bitmap file so I saved my
previously scanned Twitter image files
the QR codes for those into a whole
bunch of different bitmaps to open up in
paperback so this one tells me there's
no grid there's obviously an issue with
this one I'm going to try to open a
different one
I'll try Twitter too okay so this one
was able to open didn't have any issues
opening it up but there were a whole
bunch of different errors that were
included in this one this one we damaged
with a little bit of a smudge we added a
little bit of water on top of it to mess
up the ink when I go over to the blocks
you'll see that several of these images
have errors it'll give me little red
grid lines to show me what's going on
with each one and where the errors are
so the main errors that I'm getting are
in the middle where I had actually
smudged it not as many errors in this
area just a few small ones luckily when
you go into options if you only have a
few errors and you choose redundancy
this will hopefully fix those errors
upon scanning and recovering them in
paperback so you shouldn't have any
issues unless you've actually like
smudged it on purpose which is a problem
I'll hit cancel so we're getting errors
whenever we scan but what if I just
decided to save a bit Matt from
paperback that I've already encrypted to
be a printable document and I just
decided to save it leave it in some kind
of encrypted drive and open it up on a
different computer I can do that too so
I'm going to open a bitmap oops I'll go
ahead and choose a new file first so
I'll choose file number three you can
have up to five different documents open
at the same time and paperback and I'm
going to open up a new bitmap so I had
ended up saving this Twitter image as a
separate bitmap and I also saved a whole
bunch of other images to the hak5
wallpaper I saved a bunch of pictures
that I had downloaded I even saved a
simple word document over here so if I
choose the simple word document I'll hit
open
it'll unencrypted it it'll show me that
it's perfectly fine all the qualities
there so I'm going to choose save I'm
going to save it on my desktop as a dot
txt file and I'll call it Titan last
hak5
so when I hit save go ahead and go to my
desktop and here's the technologic
okay so I know that this is exactly what
I had saved previously inside paperback
so it works for figuring out what kind
of QR code what kind of dots are going
on on each piece of paper unfortunately
though it does have a huge problem
whenever you try to print something
you basically have to keep it in
pristine condition like keep it in a C
for something until you actually want to
scan it again I did try several
different scans of the pristine document
that I have here in my hand and none of
them worked right I kept on getting
errors on each one I kept on having
issues this isn't the only program out
there that does this kind of scan data
you also have a whole bunch of other
ones for linux as well
I know some of you guys out there have
probably tried it so for me is it worth
it not not to me yes it does keep prying
eyes off of your data because you can't
use a man-in-the-middle attack on
physical printed information although
you can use you know a social
engineering attack on someone and coy
them into giving you their papers but in
my experience a flash drive will pretty
much survive a laundry washer of course
and you can encrypt a flash drive but a
piece of paper that won't survive as
long as a flash drive will at least not
in my position in my experience so that
was paper back a very interesting
product I have to say it's not for me
but I want to know what you guys think
and if this is something that you'd
actually enjoy using if it is make sure
to leave me an email feedback at hak5
org and definitely check out more and
hopefully I'll check out some more as
well in the future and we're back with
the tetanus photo of the week this one
comes from Christopher he sends us this
photo and he says I know you like cats
but my dog Charlie loves watching the
show too
that was so cute I love his little ears
so adorable now if you want to share
your technology you can send them to
feedback at hak5 org with the subject
line
technolon find them real nice and easy
and that about wraps up this episode of
hak5 happy new years to everyone I know
you're having very new years doing your
own people have commented that we used
to drink on the show and we no longer do
so here in December
Shen's Cheers making up for the last
year I'm not joining you guys because I
know that you're sitting right here 365
days worth of drinks and one night no no
this is cheers to the guy in the hoodie
with the headphones sitting there with
the second monitor in the IRC no I'm
talking to you
Cheers do you really know is it what I
just did the star that star or the first
time I heard to start a star and I'm
looking for the star key and I'm like
wait there's no star key Oh
asterisk oh you're so funny yeah so
you're also a good voice we have a bunch
of specials going on at the hack shop oh
hey okay shop.com
we do do your specials we have fantastic
stuff check it out over at the hack shop
and thank you for supporting us directly
we could not do this without you this is
honestly you are the reason that hack 5
exists because you watch the show
support us with the shop yeah that is
true pretty much I work and you can also
go to hack 5 org slash follow to find us
on all of our different social networks
and everything that we're doing every
day on the Internet's everything that we
choose to be public mmm like and follow
and or plus you're technology that was
good thank you
Oh cats can they go feedback if you want
to email us if you could email feedback
act 5 dogs so hold down the windows key
and hit R and then type in male 2 :
feedback a hack 5 that Oregon press
ENTER and then wonder why you don't have
a mail client because that day is coming
past unless you're using outlook in
which case look out I used to have
Eudora Pegasus
incredible mine incredible Oh see that's
still a webmail service it is no do you
ever pop your stuff you ever pop your
IMAP oh oh yeah I did that we're going
to wish you guys a happy new year we
have a fantastic 2014 lined up Shannon's
taken the reins here on hack five and
making all sorts of good stuff happen so
stay tuned we could see us coming up in
just a bit
we've got Sebastian joining us for that
share is going to be there as well and
we're going to lay waste to the Consumer
Electronics Show then right after that
we've got shmoocon which is a fantastic
conference where you can both get
hacking and Yingling because it's only
available on the east coast back no
you're stuck with Anchor Steam yeah I'll
bring some back and then after that
we'll after that we're probably gonna be
launching season 16 which in hex you can
leave a comment about yay but until then
I'm gonna remind you guys that I'm
Darren kitchen
I'm Shannon Morse mm-hmm trust trust
your tech no less last year technical
yorker' tells not a big truck you can
just point with my notes so how I do
so how I do you have a giant bag why do
you have a giant bag
I just giant bag of nuts
oh yeah I'm a dart those would taste
good with beer
hello hak5 you may remember me from
podcasts such as this weekend where's my
and how do you find your way home
