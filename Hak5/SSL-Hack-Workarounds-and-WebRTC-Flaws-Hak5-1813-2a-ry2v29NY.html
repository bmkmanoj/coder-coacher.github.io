by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen welcome to the
show my name is Jana Morris it's your
weekly dose of hello everyone we're so
excited I'm so excited I'm stealing club
mate' yes that's right we are back from
from epicness in the Lost Coast oh yeah
we'll have to come back around and talk
about that later but we have returned to
civilization where there is in fact cell
service which we were quite thankful for
and we have we're gonna have a little
bit of an abbreviated show today just
because I have to boogie to the Mojave
Desert because you have something
awesome happening I can you tell us I
don't want to save it I'm going to Air
Force Base I'm gonna see the Dryden
Research Center I'm not saying why I'm
going to NASA but stay tuned for a
report on next week's show that it's
gonna be really fun are you gonna get to
fly a spaceship that's what they said
Darren you know we've got all these
astronauts and we've trained them for
years and they're so good at flying the
space shuttles that we don't have in
service but we need you to pilot the
Soyuz make me a spaceship ok
and when I say me I mean like all of us
like take our tax dollars and then make
a spaceship yes please
and then you got a configur and then you
were to do a make install and you might
need to change the CH bond yeah you
might Jamal hey speaking of such mobs
and all of that good stuff we got a
great a bunch of great feedback we do on
last week's show and so I thought maybe
we could just dive into some of those
that have been piling up because there's
a bunch of good stuff starting with an
awesome tweet that I got saying hey dude
and Michael Finley that was from him and
he says I had five that hack five Darren
may want to turn off SSL version 3 on
your social server hashtag is secure
oh yes all of the non secures is secure
what's going on
the brutal attack October 2014 the
poodle to attack was debuted Google
released details of the attack it is
basically a thing
that would allow someone to do a little
man-in-the-middle goodness if they were
able to drop your session down to the
older SSL v3 protocol which you could if
you're the man in the middle you can do
some little trickery to break the
negotiation of TLS and in which case
there's a bunch of awesome attacks in
which you can sniff out the plaintext
goodness so thus negating the whole
purpose of SSL in the first place
yeah the workaround as you can find the
workaround is basically to disable SSL
v3 on your servers and but can you still
use the other versions and it's okay
yeah so it's called a downgrade attack
and it really basically depends on the
browser's being able to like support the
older versions and not like say no I
will only speak to you with the most
secure version yeah and this is
something that has plagued security for
a long time which is the whole like well
we want everybody to shift into the
direction of using the newer bestest
protocols but we also implemented all
this old stuff that doesn't support it
yet so we have to be backwards
compatibility
for a time this is a really fun time to
be in the browser scene because a lot is
being taken up between Google and
Mozilla as far as like phasing out
phasing out but deprecating HTTP you
know using the the stick instead of the
just the caret when it comes to HTTP so
I do believe that we will see you know
and encrypt the web I think we're going
to see a lot of movement in that here
real soon as SSL Certificates are about
to get revolutionized if Mozilla has
anything to say about it turns out
though disabling this is really easy and
a link in the description where you can
just jump to your web server of choice
ng nginx or Apache which I'm running wow
it's just a matter of you're good to go
you just have to pop them in those
configs okay yeah so that's all it's
good stuff but that led to you Brian's
comment I got it I just got back from
that yeah you know what you're not
allowed to sleep here in the hak5
warehouse yeah well maybe we should get
like somebody from the community to be
like I want to be assisted min for the
hi-5 Network
well like crowdsource that thing yeah
totally
why not I mean we got the Thunder
getting assault force on IRC why not we
also got a quote or a comment from Brian
who said you may want to use this to
finish setting up as a cell on the
friend akka server and you linked us
over to Mozilla's github this is really
cool if you haven't checked this out
it's the Mozilla SSL configuration
generator which makes it ridiculously
easy to specify all sorts of stuff like
hey I'm using nginx give me a config hey
I'm using a patchy I want HSTs Boop just
check the box now you got it right you
mean I don't have to write this myself
no I love generator generating I know
right I get your term papers generated -
this is pretty cool because it'll allow
you to enable edge words HSTs which is
all sorts of good stuff it is HTTP
strict Transport Security and it
supports some of some of the HTTP
sniffing attacks that we have previously
seen although again it's fun cat and
mouse on that front which is really
better for all of us in the long run
because it makes encryption better so
break all the things so you can fix all
the things yes break all the things what
now so can you tell me a little bit
about this hacker space that we heard
about from Jeff ok Jeff is a friend that
I met at one of the most epic I say one
of the most epic hacker camps in America
there's only one hacker camp in America
sadly and that is torque on and it's
only every other year but I've seen him
both times that have been and it's been
amazing Jeff is one of the movers and
shakers between our behind Ally mega
which is a makerspace and hacker space
in Olympia Washington so this is really
just a shout out that's very specific to
people near Olympia Washington but if
you didn't know there's a hacker space
in your backyard and unfortunately I
wasn't able to go during hack across
America despite wanting so badly to
visit because they are making so much
cool stuff in the way of home automation
you can check out their stuff over at
home automation hacking comm they have a
bunch of really cool projects yeah
they've got a Kickstarter
going and they're looking for some help
to make this thing come true
yeah so I just thought it would you know
that's so great give a little shout out
because there are so many happy
in fact hackerspaces org if you didn't
already know there's probably somewhere
nearby where you can go and meet
like-minded geeks who want to break out
soldering irons write some code and
other good stuff so do yourself a favor
head over there meet some new friends
you'll thank me later the bust we have a
hackerspace
our lovely place here we're thinking
about doing some open houses oops right
I'm braking which we need to I guess get
your feedback on didn't mention this
episode was gonna be a little uh
laissez-faire um yeah I think that it
would be really fun to have some open
house we're just essentially have a
hackerspace here between all the 3d
printers and the laser cutters and the
you know everything I can't even think
it yeah but we have a lot of that means
yeah you were just doing some Geiger
soldering yet stuff ready yet not more
than that later but yeah so if you're in
the San Francisco Bay Area I don't know
maybe just hit us up feedback at hack $5
let us know what you guys think we did a
very successful series of Bay Area
hacker brunches so maybe we could kind
of roll that into Bay Area hacker
barbecues right what do you think we get
like a barbecue out at the open up the
roll-up gate and then you know make some
brats and burgers and together I wanted
to shout out this is from Anthony
Russell and he said I hate trying to
think I just want to watch random hack
five episodes so my gift to the hack 5
crew is random AJ Kade calm oh my gosh
this is so great and it is in fact a
random packets of randomizer and you
just you just click on randomize me and
whoa episode season 1 episode 6 oh man
let me try that one again oh not found
like I know hey I talked to him season 1
episode 5 season 8 episode 21 men today
allottee oh oh that's a good one yeah
well if I pineapple mark 3 backtrack
Virtual Machines
so it turns out not everything we did
was evergreen but this is good actually
this is really good the shmoocon 2012
yeah I p6 in fact I all the IP six
hacking still legit like dude there
needs to be more definitely I have to
hand it to him that's really rad and I
kind of Thank You Russell
and I wish that our our episode scheme
our URL scheme was a little bit more
standardized I'm sure you figured it out
thanks thanks for a random hack and from
Bucky he says hi hack five peeps just
watched episode 18 10 it's awesome stuff
with jitsi played a little with it
before but did not know that you could
pull off some hosting server goodness
ran into some details I thought I would
forward from the browser perspective on
web RTC did stumble across an
interesting post and it's from soft PD
accom which shows a web RTC no no that
was a little troubling and the browser
evidently vomits out your public IP and
your internal LAN IP via certain types
of requests made even when using a VPN
the browser blahs this information out
you can test it over at the github
address which will also put in the show
notes I use a web RTC disabled plug-in
for Firefox right now which is the
workaround happy bondable web RTC
disabled plug-in not sure if there's a
fix yet and that was from Bucky thank
you yeah that goes exactly along with
what I had mentioned when we were first
researching with JIT see how there was
that thing that came out back in January
about the issue with your public IP are
you a private public IP B yes so and
your private IP and that's kind of the
the interesting thing here because it's
always been that your public IP when you
go to a server is visible to that server
because I know how to talk to you now
when I say your public IP I mean the
last IP before you hit its server right
so if you're going through a VPN it
would be your VPN service provider if
you're going through tor it would be
your tor exit node so you know there's
people ask all the time like how do i
naanum eyes or how do i spoof my IP
address or get rid of my IP address I'm
like no that's not how it works yeah you
can't you have to have an IP where
you're not going anywhere
because you won't get ever get a request
from whoever's the website is I mean
technically you could
right a malformed package handshake that
has yes exactly well when it comes to
UDP and I tell you joke about that I'm
sure you wouldn't get it hey I might get
it you might and that's well you might
not okay so good idea is that you could
craft a packet you could use scappini
some other packet crafting thing to to
send out a packet that's got like a
malformed return address but you would
never get a response because you're not
sitting there listening on the other end
to find out anyway well people normally
mean when they say spoofing their IP is
going through something like a VPN or
tour or i2p or one of those other
anonymizing services which asks who you
are personally right well here's the
thing
WebRTC part of the spec part of how is
invented and one of the cool things
about what it does is it allows
different web services to communicate
with each other even if they're on the
same land now what does that mean
obviously we have an awesome network
here at the hak5 warehouse in fact we
have several we have a hack five
internal network which has you know Paul
and Shannon and myself and we use it to
collaborate and that's good and then we
have a totally separate lab network
where we can play with stuff that might
be totally getting owned and that's cool
because that's separate network and then
we have like now like a totally
different you know Zen based server
cluster thingy running cool things like
friend akka and jitsi and all of that
now one of the rad things about jitsi is
that and any web RTC based thing is that
it will allow you to collaborate even if
you're on the same land so if you and I
are they on the same network we don't
have to go up to the Internet and back
down for us to do real-time
communication pretty much yeah and then
it's super fast yeah cuz it's just over
the land it doesn't have to use any
internet bandwidth and thus we're gonna
get I mean we're on a gigabit network
here it's gonna be fantastic but that is
that's kind of a feature of how it works
now some people are like hey this isn't
cool because maybe I was not intending
for both my in fact here's the demo of
it you can see your local IP and I can
see yeah that's my ten dot 70 3.31
that's
you're local at the at the warehouse
yeah and our public IP that's our IP
address here at the at the hak5 space
and now everybody notes and it's totally
cool
because it is and the the novel thing
here is that it can find your your both
your internal and your external IP
address using a method called stun which
is the session to session traversals
utilities for NAT man if I had known
that we were gonna get too much into net
I would have gotten a whiteboard out
essentially suffice it to say it's a way
to get out of your internal network and
out to the bigger online network the
thing is this isn't really a bug as much
as it is a feature in the sense that
WebRTC relies on this to be able to
traverse NAT and to be able to
communicate with other things on its
land like Dropbox does a similar thing
now it's I guess I guess this is one of
those things where it's like unintended
so the fact that the browser's are
leaving WebRTC on by default and
allowing these things allowing any
website to query both your public and
obviously public but your private IP
address and all of those things
dangerous for you I mean you know for a
lot for a lot of people they're just
gonna find out that they're 192.168.1.1
ever because they get like a Linksys
router home or something like that and
that's not going to tell them anything
but yeah you know it is a concern if
you're trying to protect yourself
through a VPN and so for the privacy
conscious people that may have been like
hey what is that now this thing is
exposing my stuff which is why you know
it may be one of the reasons why Mozilla
hasn't adopted it fully
I mean WebRTC is an open stares you know
Google's behind WebRTC which I have no
idea how much that plays in with
Mozilla's adoption but yeah I think that
turning it off by default would be the
best way and we've talked about some
different plugins that you can use to
like limit like what browser features
are enabled by default and this is
actually a conversation that's going on
right now as Mozilla for instance is
talking about deprecating HTTP and
saying only certain features for example
WebRTC would be one of them are
available over HTTP
so I think for now yeah just bring a
plugin that Brian mentioned would be
pretty cool I mean also you know if
you're gonna go that far you might as
well be running no script anyway or not
script okay
so yeah it's just it's just good to know
but I don't think it can be looked at as
like a vulnerability it's a feature but
you might not want it all the time so I
would hope that the browser is a kind of
sort of feature yeah I would just hope
that the browser makers would make it
like a checkbox where you have to every
time allow access to web RTC stuff and
if you want to play with it the code is
up on github its WebRTC IPS and you can
see it's it's very little amount of code
I mean that's it that's it to fetch an
IP so anyway I'll have links to all of
that in the show notes interesting so if
I still want to go to jitsi on the
Hangout or our hack 5 hangout I can do
that
I'm just gonna have to be aware of that
feature yes okay yeah but that's fine
actually the way the none of the hack 5
network servers are physically touching
the internal hack 5 Network anyway yeah
so it used to be when we ran one for
testing before we had awesome bandwidth
it was great because it would allow us
to have a internal service where we
could have our own Google actually one
of the reasons we even found jitsi is
because like when sub was here we really
rely on Google+ Hangouts to be able to
collaborate when he's in his office I'm
in my office we're going over code
willing a screen share we want to
collaborate on building epic Wi-Fi
pineapple II goodness and it was
frustrating having DSL and not being
able to communicate and we're like why
be holding ourselves to Google anyway
where we have to go up to the internet
and back down when we're like we could
literally just shout across the room to
talk to each other but we want to be
able to screen share more easily and and
see each other on the webcams and make
funny faces and all that and so that's
why we found jitsi and we can run it
internally without ever having to have
it touch the internet and similar to
that now that we have a public instance
of it running at hangout hak5 organ you
can go there now and join the room hack
5 and say hi to everybody in IRC that
physically does not touch the internal
network right which is good yeah because
that means that even if it gets popped
because none of the hak5 stuff that
we've put on the network like we're
saying like oh yeah it's perfect you
know this is like total beta stuff like
in fact I'm not even sure how much jitsi
me is even being updated these days so
you know may have just been a tech demo
we'll see they're still in like the 1.0
something but if that gets popped it's
fine because it's physically not even
touching our internal network here yeah
that's cool
and oh should we take a break or do you
want to keep going let's take a break
and when we get back we're gonna hear
from Matthew it's that time of the show
where we think domain.com because they
have been supporting hack 5 for years
and they want you to know that when that
killer idea hits it's time to snag
yourself a domain name and web hosting
fast and you won't find a quicker domain
discovery system and check-out process
and over at domain.com couldn't get your
website up and running in no time and
I've told you before why Shannon and I
love domain.com mainly because they're
affordable reliable and easy to use but
mostly because they are a fun place to
do business you can tweet them at
domain.com and see what I'm talking
about and the guys over at domain.com
huge fans of hack 5 for years and they
want to hook you guys up so get this you
get the coupon code hak5 and at checkout
you'll get an extra 15% off so when you
think domain names think domain.com I'm
ready for some more viewer questions and
maybe some comments like this one from
Matthew he said I just wanted to respond
to the episode about free network
hosting I used to watch hack 5 when I
was on dial-up years ago oh my gosh
dial-up I just used W get TAC t0 taxi to
download episodes overnight and watch
them later
hmm that's kind of cool it is kind of
cool and you know what I want to show
the rest of everybody how they can maybe
potentially do similar stuff except
using Google's bandwidth and getting the
potentially smaller files smaller
episodes of hack 5 without us doing any
work you see that's right YouTube does a
lot of this can you - you - can YouTube
and if you're there now aha
check this out right I'm gonna grab the
latest URL from the address bar here of
this is our latest episode of threat
wire so check it out it is all good
stuff about threats or just hack 5 org
and say all the good stuffs anyway so
we've talked about youtube-dl before
before right group its youtube-dl and
this is available for Windows Mac Linux
and if you give it the - - help you'll
see there are a ton of options but let
me just get you to the one that you're
really going to want which is in this
case if I just go ahead and paste this
URL it's just going to download
quote-unquote the best version of it but
you can also list the different formats
that are available on any video with
tactic list formats cool and we can see
that there are WebM and faurÃ©'s some
more various resolutions of mp4s we've
got 3gp if you're really low on
bandwidth look at that number 17
it is a 176 by 144 and that 3gp it's a
bakwin 3g it was a hot new thing it was
like a video format that's like
ridiculously low bandwidth I don't think
it really caught on much but that is
going to be a very small file so if you
are really crunched on bandwidth you
could then go ahead and tell it to
download number 17
you know similarly and this is also and
of roles in with what Jason had asked
right yeah he wanted to know if there's
a way to download mp3s yes and it
doesn't show up as just one of the
format's available but what you can do
is if you tie it in with say like trying
to hit ctrl L to clear the screen but it
doesn't work as I know if you do if you
have yourself a copy of ffmpeg which is
pretty easy to get you can do it go
ahead and do extract audio and then set
the audio format to mp3 and there you go
and it's going to go ahead and download
in this case the - manifest and it gets
a low res version and then it runs it
through FM
egg and in just a moment here boom Wow
and have ILS I find out that I'm on
Windows an LS isn't of and if a cow I
know how to windows and there we go
there is and that's a really long
filename oh okay
but boom there's my mp3 and that was
really quick and simple and so there are
some ways to get mp3s out of YouTube for
you know for your audio podcast
listening use it in fringe copyright
that would be bad okay I'm I'm happily
excited about this YouTube thing I am
happily excited about all the video many
good things listen we've talked about
all sorts of fun stuff on this week's
episode of hack 5 so if you want to
leave a comment about any of those
please do so below electives have
subscribed those go a long way to if you
haven't already seen on the sister
podcast we have a threat wire and
Metasploit minute and Shannon is doing
an awesome job with tech thing and so
you know just thank you for all of the
continued support each a k5 o RG is
where we will always be no matter what
so bookmark that now and let us know
what you guys think about some ideas if
possible get-togethers barbecues sound
like yeah I'm really loving this idea is
I'm like community inspired
I don't know events you just not
barbecue I kind of just want some
barbecue yes
oh oh oh JK shop.com of course we can't
forget that we have lots of really cool
items coming in there so definitely
there's some new stuff next week so yeah
check that out as well as what is it oh
we're now going to be listed on Diamond
Club TV there we go
yes which will tie in with our live
streaming stuff for when the episodes
record later right yeah yeah so we
should have that and then Paul's melding
the IRC walls so epic stuff is happening
I'll do that next week with a report
from Dryden I'm sorry Armstrong recent
worse and I'll be back next week with
some really fun stuff with a Geiger
counter oh yeah I'm really do active we
all are a little bit
inside I'm terren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse
the trust your technology elective
techno lust you know what it really is
yeah oh yeah I ain't afraid no ghosts
Matthew that's a great comment and you
know what I would like to add to that
because I think that there's some
awesome ways that you can might even
consider getting stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
