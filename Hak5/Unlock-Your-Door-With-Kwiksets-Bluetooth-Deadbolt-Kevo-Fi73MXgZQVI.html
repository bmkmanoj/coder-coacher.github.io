by Toyota for hack 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2014 checking out some
physical security stuff check this out
this is actually the TiVo from quick set
and this is really novel because what
they've done here is put bluetooth le
the low-power bluetooth stuff up in a
deadbolt and what that allows you to do
now is to actually open and close your
lock using say your phone or a key fob
now of course in addition there is still
the traditional keys these continue to
work what's actually behind the scenes
is some batteries and some motors and
some brains behind it that you know
communicate over bluetooth interestingly
it was not able to find out anything
about the actual back end whether it's a
yes or you know these you know what the
key exchange mechanism is of a stiffy
Hulman and so that always kind of makes
me a little nervous because it wasn't I
wasn't told that they didn't know I was
told that they don't kind of share that
stuff so this might be a fun thing to do
some pen testing on because you know
what's more fun than than lock-picking
now on the lock picking side they do say
that it's actually not bump a bowl so
you wouldn't be able to just like use a
bump key and a hammer whack rotate it
and open up this deadbolt that way
however I feel like there's a lot of
cool stuff that this brings to you as
far as like access control and knowing
when the lock has been opened it also
adds a lot of convenience factors as far
as say if I go out for the weekend and I
have a cat sitter that I need to come in
I could actually send them over email
this is where other there might be a fun
Avenue send over email a virtual key
that they can then use to open the door
that sounds kind of awesome I would love
to try to brute force this or otherwise
capture some keys because they don't
talk about whether it's symmetric or if
there's public/private key pairs or
whatever else is involved but it is
still really novel and I feel like this
deserves some attention because of the
hack ability not just the convenience
factors but also like I want to know
what makes this thing tick so anyway I
love whatever these vendors show me like
the most secure whatever's there are
then add awesome stuff like this they
did say that if a vulnerability was
found and that they do have pen testers
working on this stuff if a vulnerability
was found that you would be able to push
a firmware update to the lock from the
app so you pick up your phone you put it
into that mode you hold it up to the
lock and then physically one by one to
update all of your locks because again
this is bluetooth it's not connected to
Wi-Fi they do say that they have a
product and accessory to this coming out
in the future that would then tie the
Bluetooth into Wi-Fi so you get a
network back end so it's it's
interesting in the whole connected home
so I think it's I think it needs peer
review is what I think and I think it
needs to be open source before I had put
it on my house however interesting check
it out its the kevo thanks once again to
Toyota for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
