assist express there are a lot of power
users out there kind of like Darren who
don't really use the Start menu or well
their Mouse they just want to be able to
put in a couple of keystrokes and
immediately get to the program that they
need to use luckily there's this nice
simple utility called lachchi that does
just what Darren needs launching is a
free cross-platform utility designed to
help you forget about your Start menu
the icons on your desktop and even your
file manager it indexes the programs in
your Start menu and it can launch your
documents your project files folders and
bookmarks with just a couple of
keystrokes Longy can be found over at
luncheonette where you can download
donate and check out skins and how to's
the skins on their website let me pull
over that website right here ok those
skins kind of remind me of the days of
winamp so I just decided to go ahead and
stick with the little black skin it's
very nice and simple and sleek the
download is available for Windows all
the way up to 7 Mac Linux as well as a
portable version yes after downloading
launch II all you have to do is open the
main window and type in a program name
or something that you want to find and
press Enter so for example I want to
find I want to find Skype so it shows me
the icon and highlight Skype and I can
just click enter and it should open up
the program for me I'm gonna wait for it
to open a couple of seconds beautiful it
should automatically open up the program
and if you find that it doesn't work you
can click on the Settings tab let me
pull that up choose settings and go to
catalog from here you just have to click
on the plus button and you can highlight
whatever folder or directory that you
want it to add into its category and you
click rescan catalog and it should find
all the new files for you now there's a
couple of extra keystrokes to know alt +
space will
been enclosed the launching window so if
I have my Google Chrome open I can just
hit alt space and it brings it up to the
front there's also when you type in
something then hit the tab will start a
sort of command line entry for example
if I type in Chrome and then a website
it should take me automatically to that
website so I'll type in I'm gonna try
the hak5 website tab it finds Google
Chrome asked me run and I'm gonna put in
the hak5 website this is kind of cool it
actually brings up a new tab instead of
a completely new window which is very
handy for me and it looks like it works
you can also check out all of your
history of searches by pressing down
when the window is blank so I'll blank
out the window hit down and I can look
at all of my history of all of my
searches that I did you can press Shift
+ Delete to delete any highlighted
program in that list so I'm gonna delete
I'm gonna choose Skype so shift and
delete just deletes it right out of
there it's nice and easy and I'll see
you to add some kind of functionality
for other types of programs you can go
to the catalog tab underneath settings
and over on the side under file types
after you've highlighted the folder that
you want to add some file types to you
can click plus and type in whatever kind
of file type it is for example I want to
add I'll do mp3 so I'll juice star dot
mp3 to add all mp3's hit enter and then
rescan the catalogue again so it
refreshes and adds all the new file
types along with the healthy dose of
easy GUI is a handful of plug-ins for
your mere enjoyment the launch II
website features many plugins to make
the utility easier to use and more
useful including a built in calculator a
website browser and a program killer for
background programs I think this is a
really handy tool for those users that
need something to help them speed up
their daily processes just a bit by
giving them that freedom to not have to
use the mouse like darin also the
portable version which i think is really
awesome would be
really handy for any IT support who
don't necessarily know where programs
are on each of the computers that they
have to work on booting up this tool in
searching for a program is pretty much
as easy as making my delicious sweet tea
which I could really use some of right
now anyway send me an email at feedback

launch e coming up soon we'll be
answering some viewer questions but

Alex submitted this tip over a hack
$5.00 gosh nibble he wrote need access
to a file on an FTP server but you're on
a machine that doesn't have you know you
can't install programs or you don't have
your all-singing all-dancing USB flash
drives of portable as well by using the
full address ftp colon slash slash
before the beginning of your host name
you can go ahead and access it through
Firefox Chrome ie even Windows Explorer
so thanks so much Alex I'd like to also
point out that the syntax for this can
also be used as FTP colon slash slash
the username colon password at in this
case localhost or your IP address or
your domain or whatever colon your port
number
- default 21 and then you can even do
slash directory so and there you go oh
hey look at that username and password
on localhost with directory anyway
thanks so much for sending that in Alex
totally appreciate it and you can get
your own
five swag by submitting your four bits
over a hack five dorg slash nibble
trust
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
