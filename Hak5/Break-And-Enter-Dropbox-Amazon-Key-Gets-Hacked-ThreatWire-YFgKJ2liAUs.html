Apple source code gets leaked and crypto
mining hits government sites all that
coming up now on threat wire greetings
hello everyone I am Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for February 13 2018
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
happy Valentine's Day if you are
celebrating our patreon is over at
patreon.com slash threat wire and that
is always the best way to support the
show and will help us reach our next
goal and now it's time for some news
starting with Amazon so one Sunday of
last week mg on Twitter posted an
intriguing video showing what looked
like a dia sonication attack that used a
Raspberry Pi against the Amazon key
delivery service in the video he hid the
Raspberry Pi in a simple light fixture
and he left while a delivery person used
the app to unlock the door and deliver a
package the delivery person locks the
door through the app at least they think
they do
then they leave and he later came back
after getting a notification that the
delivery attempt was made and he got his
Raspberry Pi and then he steps right
into the house because the door was
still unlocked the remainder part of the
video shows from the users point of view
unlocking the door fine but never
getting the option to lock the door on
the app until eventually receiving a
timeout error and an audible door
locking sound it turns out that the door
is still unlocked this attack uses
Amazon key which combines a smart IOT
door lock with the Amazon Cloud cam
security camera so I reached out to mg
to learn more about this vulnerability I
asked him about if the deaaath attack
happens when the lock is locking and he
said quote that is what the Rhino SEC
team did a few months ago and this is
slightly different ideas earlier while
the left is actively unlocking this
prevents the lock from sending back thee
I have successfully unlocked a
notification that is what caused the app
to freak out and fail back to saying
that it is locked
I also added an audible mechanical
locking motor sound to further add to
the illusion
now the Raspberry Pi equipped with a
portable battery a wireless radio dongle
a speaker and a case will keep that D
authentication active until it is
finally retrieved by the attacker and
turned off according to mg the attacker
would have a few seconds to pull it off
while the device is disconnected the
attack does not require being connected
to the targets Wi-Fi network they would
just need to be in the wireless
proximity so not necessarily super close
but within range to detect the unlocking
happening mg looked for a burst of
wireless packet frames when the camera
turns on specifically it's Amazon's
a UI or their organizational unique
identifier for key to work with their
camera the camera auto turns on when a
delivery attempt is made so the user
gets a notification about the front door
and then they can watch their video on
their phone mg mentions monitoring for
ZB traffic would be more precise since
that happens from the camera to the lock
but Zig bees are not on 802 11 Wireless
so this would require a little bit more
money to detect a hacker F for example
would probably suffice though I have not
personally looked into it now it does
seem kind of scary but could it be used
in common scenarios so Amazon drivers
are supposed to check and make sure that
a door is locked before moving on and if
not locks supposedly a driver would not
be able to deliver any more packages
until the door is actually locked at
that previous location so this is more
of a consumer app problem which Amazon
has released a fix for if user run it
into their house for example after they
forgot something or they needed to drop
off a package real quick for themselves
and then run back to their car for
example then the attack could work now
mg says quote to give Amazon credit now
that I have discussed it with them this
does seem less applicable to the
delivery scenario because the drivers
have a more strict app and delivery
protocol unfortunately I did not have
access to the driver app to verify so
this seems much more applicable to the
consumer user side and the consumer app
is what they rolled out fixes for as I
mentioned Rhino second did a deal last
year that prevented the lock from
closing it was a very manual attack in
Amazon fixed it the fact that a DRO
at a different time was still a problem
several months later seems to say some
things about the development practices
now mg does bring up a very valid and
good point why was this attack missed by
Amazon Amazon may have not fixed it
because they consider this to not be a
real-life delivery scenario as they said
in many different articles but this is
still a problem and it still persisted
it should still also be fixed at least
that's how I feel as of two days ago
Amazon has now released updates for iOS
and Android to mitigate this attack on
Wednesday of last week a github user
posted code called I boot to the code
sharing website which seemed to be core
information that Apple's iPhones use to
boot up into the operating system of the
phone now this code is what verifies the
iPhone is actually an iPhone and it
makes iOS run similar to how a BIOS
works on a laptop or a desktop PC now
this code could be used to bring back
jailbreaking via tethering to computers
I remember those days or it could push
large vulnerabilities to the root of the
devices hardware and/or software now
researchers could use it to find future
problems that could rake in very large
bug bounties from Apple to the sound of
$200,000 or attackers could use it to
find Falls that could crack encryption
now Apple did send a DMCA takedown to
github the very next day proving that
the source code was real and legitimate
now since it is from iOS 9 it is rather
old Apple states that the code was from
three years ago but the products do not
rely on security of source code
preferably now Apple does use several
different layers of security for their
products such as the newer secure
Enclave processor chip for example now
while it was taken down off of github
the code was available since 2017 and is
probably still available now with one
user even posting it on reddit and even
though it is old code according to Apple
only 7% of users use iOS is older than
iOS 10 so that still means around 70
million people could be affected so if
you have an iOS device update your phone
to the newest operating system if you
can and if you have not already well
this is not the
first time that we have heard about
JavaScript libraries being altered and
it probably will not be the last but
this one is important because it
involves coin hive and crypto mining as
well as several different government
affiliated websites across several
different countries over the weekend
Scott helm a security researcher wrote
on his blog about a new crypto jackin
problem affecting over 4,000 sites
across the web
he was alerted when a friend's antivirus
threw up warnings about a security
affiliated site that had a crypto miner
running on every single page on their
domain the 4,000 plus sites are listed
via public wwm
and I'll have that link below in the
show notes for ya the crypto minor in
this case was being run through a
third-party JavaScript library that was
loaded on their website so it was not
actually hosted directly by the site
themselves the library was from a
company called texthelp and their
software browsealoud which uses
assistive technology to read websites to
folks that need it such as for the blind
or if English is not your first language
text helps code was altered to include a
coin high of crypto minor so if any web
site called back to their library of
code they would also get the coin hive
minor and according to text HELP this
was a criminal act and they are pursuing
an investigation with authorities now
Troy hunt a security researcher and
creator of have I been pwned calm
pointed out that this affects us court
websites UK government websites and a
whole lot more so how do you protect
against this as a web admin well as
admins you should add the SRA integrity
attribute to your site to check for code
modification also having good content
security policies should persist and
Troy goes into a whole lot more detail
about the supply chain problem between
parties in his post which is linked
below I recently asked my patreon
supporters how they felt about me
covering crypto currency and exchange
hacks to which y'all overwhelmingly said
yes all the hacks so thank you patrons I
will definitely keep a keen eye out for
those kind of stories everyone who
supports threat wire over at patreon.com
slash threat wire y'all are the reasons
that we
keep on bringing you news every single
week and we are on our way to the next
goal we're super close now which allows
me to upgrade some of our equipment but
we will also open up a live video Q&amp;amp;A
just for patrons each and every single
month and it doesn't matter what your
level of contribution is you will get
access to that Q&amp;amp;A now if you are
already a patron you get access to an
audio RSS feed which is exclusive just
for you first looks at show topics polls
just like the one I did on
cryptocurrency discussions just for
patrons and a lot more and any little
bit helps us grow the show so thank you
again really appreciate it and hey check
out these amazing cute super adorable
fur babies
sent in by some of our patreon
supporters there've adorable thank you
