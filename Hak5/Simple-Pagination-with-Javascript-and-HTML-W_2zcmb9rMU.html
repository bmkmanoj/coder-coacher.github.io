to give any other code tip this time I
want to go into some JavaScript a lot of
times it's a pain in the butt when
you're trying to view pages or do some
pagination really really fast instead of
doing this page request well I got a
check for you let's go and get started
we are going to only use javascript in
HTML so we're going to go ahead and
create a function in JavaScript called
show page or whatever you decide to do
it's going to accept an ID next we're
going to create a variable it's gonna
have the total number of pages now
there's a lot of flexibility where you
could change this where it's set
dynamically I went ahead and set it to 2
since the HTML is only going to be
handling two pages next we're going to
go ahead and create a for loop this is a
really cool trick when you're managing
lots of pages or you want to do some
pagination instead of specifically
hiding those div tags one by one by one
you're still for loop
hide all of them and only show the one
that you want to display so that's
basically the idea of the way that this
code is set up however there's a lot of
flexibility within it because you can
set this stuff server-side or for use in
Ajax or you can set it client-side if
you're just sticking with some
JavaScript next one to just go into your
actual HTML and I went ahead and created
a very simple div ID navigation and set
two links to say click here to display
page one or page two now on click we're
going to actually call that function
pass it that ID for this example we have
one and two or you could dynamically set
it and it will call that function hide
all of those div tags and then only
display the ID that you sent it so if I
click page two I'm sending the number
two to it and then it displays that page
next we're just going to go into the
actual style it's going to involve very
very little CSS the important part is
you actually want to set that div tag to
a style display:none known is actually
going to hide the div tag on the page
load then when you actually call the
function and set that div tag you're
going to put display block and it
actually blocks is all the stuff all of
the styles of that page specifically
none so that's your basic code step of
the day from with some JavaScript hope
you guys enjoyed see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
