persistent live Linux USB drives the
easy way ssh certificate based
authentication and why it's important
and questions feedback and follow-ups
all that and more on this episode of
hack 5
so episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by goto assist Express Nokia and
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain hello welcome
to hack 5 my name is darren kitchen and
i'm snubz shannon boys see anyway we've
got an awesome show for you guys today
we're talking a little bit about ssh
certificate authentication why it's
important maybe a little
man-in-the-middle action got some stuff
going on with USB lives this is like one
of your favorite things
anything that boots very easily is
something that I enjoy yeah sure like
easy the easy route well that's cuz I
know how to do the easy stuff you know
but you always find annoys like I love
how I'm like oh you know you just get
this ISO and you just forgot to do this
legacy chillin PHP code where I ran from
and I'm like alright you stick this in
and download this ISO file there you go
you get to go and even the program he's
got like flowery but you'll see it good
stuff and we get some follow up but you
know before that like what's what's
going on like got a busy week going on
so we're gonna get busier as the
holidays progress um let's see we're
sending up the Christmas tree today and
I'm going to Missouri for Christmas nice
congratulations oh yeah lookin go see my
family I'm excited and rather than stick
around the house all by my lonesome I'm
heading up to Toronto so that's gonna be
fun I'm jealous of you I'm gonna be
there from that Saturday right after
Christmas or is it a Friday I think it's
Saturday yeah Saturday after Christmas
through Wednesday I think it's so yeah
that'll be fun if you're in the Canada
area you know the general place just
come on by maybe I should have a
Missouri Meetup
alright well you have a Missouri Meetup
whatever so we've got Springfield
natives before but I'm not going to
Springfield I'm going to Waynesville
Waynesville hometown
well what the W's but so what's the
that's what's the population I'm sorry
again I don't know like my relative of
waynesville 1000 it's so small it's
Oracle Toronto's what's up yeah you're
gonna have a good time loss
yeah anyway follow our Twitter feeds for
any respective meetups that may or may
not happen yes
oh I've been so busy fielding so many
questions and having so much fun with my
new and improved hak5 Brandon's new and
improved with a hack 5 stickers put a
sticker on it increases the megahertz
I'm telling you I'm sure it does but
yeah I'm having fun with um couple of
Wi-Fi scanning apps as well as SSH stuff
and network wrapping and it's bad enough
well I'm trying to get doom and nes
games to work on this guy how'd you like
that segmentation fault yeah that's nice
don't you love spending you know an hour
to trying to work on something compile
stuff and then segmentation it just
doesn't work yeah yeah I didn't even
know what that meant until they told me
look was working this mean but yeah yeah
it might have to put that segment on
hold until we get to figure it out I did
get I tried scummvm works so you could
potentially play monkeys island
yes but the resolution since it's 320
240 I got to figure out some hacks for
for fluxbox to make it work right
because you get to see the very top left
of the interface oh joy yeah yeah sweet
you can see the sky yeah you can see
Monkey Island but you'd really just see
kind of a kind of a volcano and some
clouds yeah yeah it's not fun oh well
you want to get into some follow up
because there's a ton recently on the
whole SSH stuff actually it's not even
on the list but I love the from the last
episode I was showing off a program
written by one of our friends Phil done
there from the words from the
Netherlands that makes it easy to do SSH
tunneling on Mac Linux Windows whatever
it's pun on Perl or Python and PHP and
then Paul was showing off a Mac GUI and
I love the emails I got two of them that
said hey you know you can do the same
thing from the command line with these
strings and I'm like reference to
episode 5 where's the three now but you
know hey yeah I come on I love that it's
like you know the drive-by viewers it's
like whatever yeah
get off you're correct man yeah dork all
right well our first comment from the
SSH follow-up comes in from and I'm
proud to say I can pronounce this
disaster he recommends gnome SSH tunnel
manager it's a slick front-end for if
you're running Linux and you're on the
gnome side of things it's a slick GUI
that's going to help you manage a whole
bunch of SSH proxies that do the port
forwarding and all that fun stuff and it
just makes it easy with a nice little
gooey kind of similar to what you've got
with your network manager in gnome and
as a gnome user here in Ubuntu I'm going
to check that one out
looks really lonely low so also pointed
out that in Mac OS 10 they have an SSH
built into the terminal much like Linux
very true yes well what is that called
Darwin Paul help me out here Darwin
what's it called SSH the earth he's not
listening terminal Paul doesn't actually
listen to the show as we recorded he
just makes sure the levels don't peek
yeah if you want to get the bash in in
OS 10 I'm such a Mac noob he says it's
just Unix
all right yes BSD that's right it's
built on what does that kernel dad
doesn't matter we're going to digress
here and I'll let you know about spam
what a great handle he writes in the
point out that if you're using Firefox
and doing SSH tunneling you might want
to look into going to into your address
bar and going to about colon config and
then scrolling down and finding the
setting network dot procs I'm sorry
network dot proxy dot Sox underscore
remote underscore DNS and you want to
enable that because if you don't all of
your DNS queries and that is to say
every time you go to you know google.com
or Facebook comm and it says hey what's
the IP address of that it would send
that over the clear not like that's
something that someone could sniff a
password from or anything but if you
want to protect yourself with SSH
tunneling and become anonymous like
we've been using Firefox and so many
examples to set it as your you know your
browser that will use that socks proxy
you'll want it to actually to do your
DNS lookups over the proxy as well else
somebody on the land could maybe
Neph up and not see what the content of
the page is but know where you're going
that's quality rocks yeah yeah I don't
want people following my tracks on the
Internet's not that I go anywhere uh-huh
I'm gonna check the smooth ball records
not crap
finally post break from I am the killer
net points us in points us to secure
socks and SSH socks proxy GUI front end
for Mac os10 that he likes a ton more
than the SSH tunnel one point six right
Paul showed SSH tunnel one point six off
last week I thought it was really cool
but but post break seems to really like
the secure socks what are you looking
for like on Oh she was sick she's
running around back and forth in between
us and Paul and I'm like is there food I
don't see any food on the floor yeah you
know when uh you know in Spaceballs when
they went plaid I feel like in
podcasting we just went kitty oh man
kitty so with that we should probably
move on in just a bit we're going to be
talking about certificate authentication
with SSH tunnels why it's important
maybe a little man in the middle action
we'll see and but first I do want to
thank our awesome sponsor go to assist
Express when it comes to providing my
users with technical support my days of
flying blind are over I don't even
bother if I can't see their desktop and
interact with it so I convince my
employer to get me go to assist Express
by Citrix now when I take a call I can
instantly connect to their desktop and
fix the problem in no time I don't need
to worry about a whole lot because it's
a hundred and twenty eight bit secured
end-to-end I don't need a fancy firewall
or fancy VPN just a web browser will do
so it reduces my travel costs it doesn't
waste my time doesn't waste my users
time so you know they can get back to
work and I don't even need to be at the
computer for me to fix the problem if
it's not severe I say hey Jan go take
lunch when you come back your computer
is going to be as good as new
so I encourage you to check out go to
assist Express whether you're supporting
a work force or just supporting your
family's computer is definitely the way
to go when it comes to you know remote
support so if you would like to try it
out you can get a 30-day trial at go to
assist calm slash hack five
and again to support the show you've got
to use that URL go to assist comm slash
hack five recently we've been talking a
lot about SSH whether it be tunneling
port forwarding what-have-you and I
thought it would be important to talk
about ways to use certificate based
authentication because way that we've
been doing things thus far hasn't
necessarily been the most secure and to
illustrate that point I've gone ahead
and set up a little scenario here with
my attacking machine I'm actually in a
bun to the Koala one it's been treating
me nice and I have an interceptor setup
here that is running in line between
target on the network here in EPC that's
you know going to get pwned here in this
segment and the rest of the network so
this is just sitting in line between
Ethernet there and if this were you know
not a scenario done in the kitchen it
would probably be tucked away behind a
printer is like a print server embedded
in a wall or place inside of a plushy
monkey or so inclined but the point
being we have a Interceptor running here
we've got packets flowing through it and
typically the way that it's done when
using a device like this is that we will
you know run the scripts which utilize
SSH to open up an VPN tunnel that we
will then sniff because everything is
mirrored on it and essentially we can
see all of the traffic flowing through
the land for our victim here well we're
not going to do that today we're
actually going to stretch the legs of
this open wrt based device a little bit
and have some more fun with it but we're
still going to be using SCP which is
just copy for SSH and essentially SSH
and we're going to make it more secure
so let's just go ahead and dive right
into the demo you're totally going to
rock this in just a moment so let's go
ahead and connect to this little bad boy
here so if config W land 0 up and need
setter IP address as 10 to 4 5 to 5 5 to
5 I know 3 will do and W config or
actually iw list and we're going to scan
I'm going to make sure that the
Interceptor is up and there it is okay
so this particular one I don't have any
authentication on or it's completely
open so that just makes things easy here
in the lab and we should be connected to
it so let's just give it a little ping
lovin and yes I am getting packets back
from it so naturally what we'll want to
do and I'll do this in a new window here
and pseudo back to sue is go ahead and
SSH you over to it so SSH to root at 10
to 50 55 to 54 and what happens here is
that I'm told hey a little warning here
we're not sure that this device is what
you think it is it actually says the
authentication of the host can't be
established the authenticity so we're
not sure it's legitimately that host it
gives me the RSA key fingerprint so I
can match it up with the what the one
that I have on file like I remember that
like I remember IP addresses or phone
numbers no so let's make things a little
bit easier on ourselves and set it up so
that we don't one don't have to use
password that makes life easy that the
relationship between these two devices
is based on some key files that we will
generate and that way a would be men in
the middle attacker won't be able to
mess with this and tune in next week for
that because we're going to be having
some fun breaking this down but for now
let's go ahead and secure ourselves from
the attack next week and since this is
in a lab environment yes I know that
this is in fact you know the Droid or
whatever I'm looking for so I will go
ahead say yes and connect to it and her
right I'm logged in and I can you know
if config here and see that we do have
be our land running and you can see it's
got tons packets going through it
because it is in fact doing its thing if
I if I TCP dump B art a clan I can see
what's going on here and I've just got a
constant ping go in there you can see a
little ICMP action going on on my host
just to keep things a lot
of an interesting so let's go ahead and
generate a key pair that's going to
allow us to connect to this Interceptor
whenever we want without a password and
being sure that it is in fact the the
device that we think it is so I'll come
back over here to my other terminal
where I am actually on the booklet not
the see here on route at booklet rather
than route of open wrt and what I need
to do is go to dot SSH and what I want
to do is generate our key pair so I will
use SSH tack key Jen and I want to tack
T for the type and we're going to use an
RSA key pair and we're going to tack B
for the bit length and make it I don't
know a 1024 that should be good enough
now I'm going to go ahead and use the
defaults to save this as ID underscore
RSA I'm not going to use a passphrase
and I have some beautiful little thing
there it looks like a rooster but that's
just the way I see the ASCII art you may
see it differently and if I LS again I
see that I do have this ID underscore
RSA dub file that's important we need to
copy that over to our device and then
set it up because it's running drop bear
you'll see it's pretty easy so let's SCP
the ID underscore RSA file dot pub / -
10 10 10 to 5 5 to 5 5 to 5 4 and let's
just put in temp for right now that'll
make things easy great so back over to
the Interceptor and there is the file
that I'm expecting since this is running
drop bear and it's on open wrt it's a
little quirky normally what we would
want to do is put this in in tilde slash
dot SSH so in your home directory a
folder called SSH in a file called
authorized underscore keys since it's
dropped bear on open wrt it's actually
going to be a little bit different so
let's go ahead and take a look we're
going to CD over to at sea drop bear and
we're going to cat that file that we
just copied over into a file called
authorized keys
now I do that because if we were copying
multiple keys from different machines
that we would like to be able to connect
to the Interceptor from using the two
Wacka Wacka x' we'll just go ahead and
append them to that file I also need to
model or chmod or however you want to
call that give it a little 600 action
authorized keys now this is the Kamikaze
build of open wrt so they've actually
made it pretty easy to make changes here
if this was like White Russian I just go
in and use vine Anna whatever to modify
the Etsy / and it D / I think it's s 50
the way it comes the drop bear file and
just put a tack s on the end of the user
s pin drop bear so that the tax option
is basically saying no password but
since we're using kamikaze we can
actually use UCI which makes it a little
bit easier to modify some settings here
so you see I set drop bear dot drop bear
and zero password off equals off and
we'll go ahead and commit those changes
now we're going to exit this and ssh
back in there we go I didn't have to
enter in a password there was no
passphrase it was just the keys there
and that way if anybody were snooping it
wouldn't really help them any because I
didn't pass the password and if they
tried to modify the keys in any way this
would throw up red flags everywhere kind
of like if you were to go to a site that
had a bogus SSL certificate you know in
like Firefox it's like seven clicks just
to get through that now so hooray we are
securely connected to our Interceptor
let's have some fun stretch its legs a
little bit I got a couple of packages
that we might want to send over to it
and have some fun rather than just doing
the default you interceptor scripts and
which are still quite fun to set up a
you know at app 0a Open VPN connection
and start sniffing that interface and
you know do any other tool that you
might imagine but let's run some fun
stuff on the device itself because I
believe let's see here yeah I do have a
couple of megabytes here too
used so let's go over to these packages
and availa else here I see I've got a
ton of packages in fact more than my
buffer will hold but let's make sure the
one I'm looking for and here is oh not
that one that's next week yes so let's
SCP and grep over to our device and in
slash temp and once again that's it no
authentication I love this this is
perfect for so many different scripts
because now you don't have to rely on
having to put in that password every
time you can automate a whole bunch fun
communications between you know your
your devices so now that I have n grip
over there let's go ahead and install
that and play with it a little bit on
this target package install start I P K
this is the point at which you should
feel free to go grab yourself a beer and
hey would you look at that our packages
are installed let's go ahead and have a
little bit of fun with n grep and grep
of course is Network grep which
basically allows us to do the same thing
that you would use to grab a file but on
any network packets instance the
Interceptor has got blending packets
going through it on the bridge interface
we can go ahead and pick out some choice
bits so we're looking at the bridge and
we're looking for user password on port
21 I wonder what that might be and I
just so happen to have a target over
here so let's just go ahead and pretend
that they're connecting to an FTP server
and would you know we are looking at
what's going through that FTP and of
course user and password did fail but
since this is a plaintext protocol
we would be able to see everything that
was going through there if in fact noob
with password noob did exist on hack 5
that org which does not but that might
be a reason why you want to SSH tunnel
your FTP traffic anyway I thought that
would be a fun way to illustrate SSH
connections using a security certificate
based authentication rather than turning
off the passwords if we wanted to we
could go ahead here on our open wrt
based device and set up another drop
bear listening on a different port so
that using password authentication just
in case we ever did lose these key pairs
because if that was in the case you'd be
reflashing this bad boy now would be
that fun so yeah if you have questions
go ahead and email feedback at hak5
org love to hear what you guys think I
think next step is maybe using a zip it
to wirelessly control an interceptor or
maybe a pineapple I just love the idea
of all these little wireless devices
talking to each other seamlessly using
SSH and we'll be back next week
basically breaking all of this down and
showing why it's that important and why
just relying on you know no certificates
and the password-based authentication
isn't the wisest choice so anyway thank
you very much and let's go ahead and
thank one of our awesome sponsors
I love the freedom that my motorcycle
gives me when I'm riding twisties
through the mountains or chasing sunsets
down the coast but the servers that I
support at work don't seem to have this
idea of paid time off so I don't always
get a break that's why I love the Nokia
booklet 3G 12 hours of battery life
Windows 7 Bluetooth and here's the
kicker always on 3G because I don't
always know where I'm going to be when
the exchange servers have like an FDA
seizure the boss's new laptop gets hosed
but I get all-day connectivity for the
sexy aluminum ultra portable that's just
under three pounds slips right into my
tank bag I don't even have to worry
about bringing the power cord
the intro price is to $99.99 with an 18
T data connect plan and two-year
activation you can pick one up at Best
Buy exclusively either in-store online
find out more information at Nokia comm
slash booklet 3G arch CentOS mint Ubuntu
what's the right Linux distribution for
you and how do you find out honestly the
best way to go about it is to just try a
whole bunch and nothing makes it easier
than just using a whole bunch of live
USB or live CDs and here to make the
process so much simpler Shannon what's
this program it's not only simple but
it's very very pretty too
oh of course you find the pretty ones I
know I thought DD was pretty at once
anyway at once well I found this tool
it's called Linux live USB creator and
it lets you take a USB flash drive and
stick as many or just a few different
Linux Linux OS s on it so you can figure
out which one you like the most
nice okay now we've talked about ways to
burn Linux ISO as 2 USB before using I
think that was unit Boonton that's
exactly what was gonna happen and this
hobby well the better than it being
about this one is that it lets you do on
this thing called persistency mm-hm
which is where normally if you're
booting off of a live CD or a live USB
flash drive you can't exactly save files
and save settings because it's live so
what we want to do is use this thing
called persistency which basically saves
all your data and saves all your
settings onto the USB flash flash drive
after you've you've finished doing
whatever you're doing on the linux right
so and we get to specify how much of
that and depending on our USB drive
because you've got a 2 gig in there and
what just for your rocking now I'm doing
Puppy Linux right yeah probably a ton of
space left over puppy is really really
small yeah there's times ok so how do we
get into what do we do
alright well you got to go to Linux live
USB comm and download the executable
file and from there it just boots up
this nifty thing called the Linux live
USB creator pretty it's very pretty it
has a flower at the top and a rainbow a
USB
a new icon in my mat cried oh that's so
sad so the first thing you need to do it
walks you through all the steps - and
you can also follow along on the website
which is really really easy so step one
you choose your key which is your USB
key mm-hmm so I choose that
step two is choosing a source either you
can do an ISO image that you already
have on Windows a bootable CD which
obviously I don't have one on this
crappy little netbook yeah or a download
file the cool thing about the download
files is that it automatically goes out
and finds the fastest mirror for the
kind of Linux that you want to download
I found Puppy Linux underlight Linux's
and I chose it because of the name puppy
okay why have you actually find it now
that you've you know played with it for
a bit umm it's cute it's really easy and
it already has everything installed for
you so it's it makes everything simple
nice and then even an even getting it
opening it up for the first time on your
USB flash drive it pretty much walks you
through the steps to get it like live
installed I guess you could say yeah
yeah so it's really easy and then after
that you choose to manually install err
automatically and I just you choose
automatically because it makes it so
much easier and it takes about 20
minutes or so for it to actually install
everything onto your USB flash really
guess it depends on the size of it you
know the ISO like how fast your internet
connection is all those other factors so
I guess it would be faster if you had an
ISO already on Windows alright yeah I'll
look at my VirtualBox directory where I
get the media library of distros now
step three is where you can choose your
persistency for Puppy Linux of course I
couldn't choose mine it just kept it at
live mode I think that's because puppy
just has a built-in maybe oh maybe yeah
I know well I know I bet it would be
different with a different distro yeah
but under step 3 that's where you can
choose how much of your USB flash drive
size you want to actually use for save
files and settings and things like that
so if you've got a 2 gig key and it's
like a you know 700 mega bun - whatever
you might have like a gig in something
for you to save all yours which is more
than enough really this is something
that I needed back when I was first
playing with like backtrack 3 on my Asus
EPC because every
oh yeah I remember those days when I
started up I had to set my like my
configuration files for kismet and my
wireless drivers and all that stuff and
it just makes things so much easier if
you could just set something as at the
same time though I will say that when I
was first playing with backtrack 3 and I
was very new to it it was nice that
every time I rebooted everything was
back to normal
oh yeah that's good I kind of broke some
things oh you would okay so moving on
step four is the options menu where you
can hide created files on the on the USB
key format the key and fat32 which you
don't really need to do or enable
launching Linux live and windows tell me
about that that's interesting and that
and I think that's where it differs a
lot from something like a unetbootin
where it's just like take I so put on
yours B when you enable Linux live in
Windows it actually brings up kind of
like it's just in its own little windows
inside of your windows OS right so you
could run Puppy Linux inside of XP it's
like um what is that called VMware or
something game where VirtualBox yeah
yeah and actually you what was your
experience with this because they're
going to be a little bit of frustration
here and it's because of a prior
VirtualBox install uh yeah it if you
already have what is it VirtualBox
something or yeah you've got VirtualBox
installed already yeah host PC and it
didn't let me launch the Linux live from
Windows I don't know it gave me some
sort of error code whenever I did that
that's because so I took a look it's
actually because it's trying to use the
portable variant of of VirtualBox to go
ahead and launch the the operating
system and if you already have
VirtualBox installed there's some
conflicts there that make sense it's
calling VirtualBox portable a portable
tool is kind of a misnomer because it
actually does require administrative
privileges and you need to actually
install some stuff onto the the host
machine so you can do stuff like
networking which is kind of important so
you know this isn't something that you
would be able to easily go to like a
computer cafe or something plug in your
USB key yeah hope to get in your linux
within their windows without you know
little finagling so those are your
options under step 4 and then step 5 is
just create and it starts creating your
new linux live USB flash drive you have
to click on the little Harry Potter
lightning bolt to start it I see the
appeal now I like it

whatever it is for your computer just
reboot and boot up to the USB flash
drive and then it brings up Puppy Linux

simple of that as that and then I found

flash drive anyway mm-hmm which was nice

have a question from one of our viewers
Ricky writes in I just recently started
using WordPress and I'm having a lot of
trouble trying to design a layout for it
I was wondering if you had any
references or anything to help me learn
how to do this I understand HTML and
only know a little bit of PHP any help
would be greatly appreciated well you
and I can totally sympathize on this we
both use PHP or PHP we've got a
wordpress for our personal blogs and I
don't know how many hours of time I have
spent like choosing a wordpress file or
a wordpress theme and designing it the
correct way that I want it because I'm
super picky so yeah and it's not even
just about finding a theme you like
because as soon as you find that theme
and install it inevitably something's
gonna break or you're gonna be sitting
there tweaking it mm-hmm so prepare to
get your code on regardless but now I do
really like the content management
system it's actually easier now with the
upgrades sure is like oh my god this
upgrades are like that now used to be so
difficult and you know hack 5 that'll
work is running on it darren kitchen
calm little plugin MC calm okay and but
I didn't let you know if you want to
really get your hacker on with some
WordPress you can be a very fulfilling
experience if you like the web depth
thing but I will recommend not to do it
in the cloud rather run WordPress and
you're in all of your stuff on your
local machine and to do that the simple
way I recommend both WAMP for the window
side and
xam peepee both of those are packages
that make it super simple to set up
apache PHP mysql and all of the other
stuff that you would need to actually
get a nice installation you know an
environment set up and then the
wordpress install is like a couple of
clicks so that's nothing to worry about
but the difference here is that rather
than like you know when you peel I gotta
go in there and like make some changes
rather than have to FTP your changes up
all the time you just you know in
notepad or whatever you use ctrl s you
know save whatever refresh your browser
that's nice two monitors in FTP yeah
seriously or or using the built in
WordPress thing it's nice when you want
to just tweak something real quick yeah
we're pretty good advanced or whatever
and you can you can't if the code a
little bit but that's not for like
massive development because you're not
going to get the same tools that you
would have in like a notepad two or
notepad plus plus or whatever you use
also want to mention a PHP net is where
I go when I have a PHP question I'm like
I don't know what that function does and
we're also going to send you Ricky this
new book it's called PHP reference for
beginner to intermediate PHP five by
mario lyric and I can't talk today
awesome so go ahead and email us your
address so we can send you the book
hopefully that will help and some other
resources I will say when it comes to
WordPress themes
I'm not calling any particular one out
but I have you had experience with some
paid themes particularly revolution and
our theme iya premium we have both used
on hack 5 org sometimes you don't spend
like 25 to 50 bucks on a theme but I
will say you kind of get your money's
worth it is worth it well do they have
support that's the biggest deal is the
sample and the documentation oh yeah
there's no fun when you go into a free
theme and you look at the code and
you're like I don't know how many times
I gripe about pages not having any
documentation on how to use their code
or whatever comment
just comment the code but in a lot of
cases you can even talk to a developer
or something like that I'm not promoting
either of those in particular but I will
say from experience that I have had you
know a fantastic time hacking around
with the acceptor I do need to fix the
hack five one night I know that hacked
org does need a look whisper snippet
I'll get to anyway so um and of course
the WordPress codex is the place to go
if you are new to WordPress hacking you
want to learn what all the functions are
what the loop means what you know I
can't even think of the excerpt and all
the other functions that come with
WordPress once you start learning the
codex you will realize that WordPress is
such a powerful content management
system you can do so much with it more
than just a blog and last but not least
also check out wordpress comm slash
support there's really good forums and
we would love to hear what everybody
else thinks as well you haven't found
another good resource for for a forum
hacking like our team hacking like forms
or communities but if you know of some
hit us up and if you've got questions
hit us up as well
questions at hak5 org is the place we
like the question we might take it on
the air and we encourage your feedback
regardless we do need to get out of here
but I first want to let you know that
the hack shop is in full force for the
holidays so if you were looking for you
know your pineapples your Interceptor
monkeys pretty t-shirts the hack five
shirts the evil servitude everything's

want to do that here they come with
stickers you do it up yourself but yeah
