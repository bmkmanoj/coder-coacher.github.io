isn't in the software center repository
let's figure it out this segment is
brought to you by Full Sail University
we all already know how to download
stuff through the Ubuntu Software Center
you just click on the thing and then you
wait for it to load and then you choose
whatever you wanted to search for and
then you just click the little install
button but what if what you want isn't
found in the software repositories it's
either not there or you want to you know
maybe save a little bit of time waiting
for the stupid GUI to show up and you
want to do it in your command line BAM
see that command line wherever it went
see my computer's too slow for it cuz I
opened up the dang software center well
I have an answer to this and you may
have to compile code you may have to
install some kind of crazy binary
package or you may want to just create
your own software package for Ubuntu or
any other Linux distro in this case
there are five six I don't know
something like that different ways that
you can install packages if they aren't
in the Ubuntu Software Center and I'm
going to show you how right now so first
off I wanted to download the nexus 7
ubuntu touch repository which obviously
isn't found in the software center and
it looks like this now you may be
thinking yeah you already did this on
the show but I'm going to show you
anyway so for this case I would just
copy this over and I'm gonna use this
command called apt-get and let's paste
it in here sudo apt-get repository PPA
fablet team tools now PPA fablet team
tools that is the name of the package
that I'm trying to download apt-get is
what I use to actually install the
package ad apt repository is adding that
repository to the apt-get repositories
so I click enter of course put in my
password because it is a sudo command
and it adds the package to my system may
tell me that it's already there because
I've done this before
but if it doesn't it'll go ahead and
install it for you now you can also
install packages like Skype and Google
Chrome all sorts of stuff like this and
if you can't find them in the software
repository you could always find them
the dot de Bie file on their own
third-party website whatever that might
be and in this case you would just
download the dev double click on it and
click install once it shows up in the
rest posit orry's now let's get a little
bit into apt-get because we all like to
use the command-line don't we so first
off of course we want to search for
whatever thing that we're going to try
to download so I'm going to type in apt
cache search and I'm gonna see if python
is part of the list maybe there it goes
okay so I see there's a whole bunch of
different kinds of files involving
Python in here that I could download so
I could look through here and find
whatever I wanted and download that said
package let's go ahead and clear that
out because that's a lot of information
you can also do such things as adding
your apt repository and for this example
that would be the nexus 7
Ubuntu touch PPA now any time you want
to add any kind of new repository you
want to make sure after you do that you
update to do that you just type in sudo
apt-get update it's so easy and it'll
update all the different repositories
that you have installed and of course to
install you just type in sudo apt-get
install and whatever the package name is
to remove this it's pretty much exactly
the same you just type in sudo apt-get
removing the package name they make it
very simple to do this through the
command-line and pretty much anybody can
do it you can also upgrade with sudo
apt-get upgrade and sudo apt-get remove
if you wanted to and clean up you can
clean up any kind of caches that are
extra from downloads that you want to
get deleted from here and last off we
also have an easter egg because of
course it's not Linux without an easter
egg right so this one is sudo apt-get mu
that's right it's a cow because why
would you not have a cow right it's fun
now if you do have some kind of de Bie
file it's super easy but what if you do
have these ppas what does that mean what
is it so anyone can really create a PPA
through canonical
launchpad system for my example I used
the Nexus 7 Ubuntu touch software
package of course remember use these at
your own risk because once you add it
it's there and it could be made by
anybody you you don't really know who it
was made by so use at your own risk
once added you can just install it with
app get or the Software Center and then
you can also compile packages from
source code now this is where it gets
really fun packages can be compiled from
source generally you won't really need
to do this because most packages that
you really want to download on your
machine aren't probably already done for
you but in case you're making your own
packages it's very simple you just
download the tar.gz or whatever kind of
zipped file it might be and you need to
install this thing called build
essential so this is a package that
looks like this
sudo apt-get I used to do apt-get
install again haha build essential this
is going to install it why for yes of
course
and we'll just wait for that to install
now once you have build essential
installed you're going to want to find
whatever the zipped file is the tar.gz
file you may find it from Gipp github or
wherever you want to extract this and
then change your directory to the new
directory created for that set code you
run want to run a file called configure
slash configure or check the readme or
install file that's inside that new
directory if configure doesn't work if
you get any kind of errors while you're
installing this new repository run
apt-get install for any of the packages
that are needed and can keep on running
configure until you're completely done
with all the installation
installed packages that you needed now
once you have all of this stuff ready to
go you want to compile your program you
run the make command for this then sudo
make install to install your program and
sudo make uninstall to uninstall it if
it didn't actually work or if you broke
something if you've ever run into binary
programs these are a little bit
different they're closed source software
well they might be closed source
software and it may be in binary form in
which case you would want to download
the tar bz2 or the tar.gz and run
sh script now you know every single way
that you might need to download some
kind of package or some kind of
repository and hopefully you don't have
to run into the ones where you have to
compile it that much but if you do you
now know how to do it I want to have
your feedback I want to know if you've
created scripts if you've done this
several times before or maybe you have
easier ways to do this outside the
command line that I don't really know
about let me know in the comments below
or you can email me feedback at hack
five and coming up we have trivia and
techno last but first let's take a quick
