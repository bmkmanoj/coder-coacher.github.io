by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen and today i am
joined by peter estimate m ski how are
you doing i am so happy to be here we
are of course up in eugene oregon
beautiful place and we are starting a
new series on drones yeah will be fun
although it's just sake drones because
that is of course the term that gets all
the media attention
yeah they do what how would you define a
drone and how is that different than say
a model aircraft well you know
essentially what we think of when we
talk about drones is actually this big
stuff that flies and does bad things to
people like surveillance drones like
predators or shooting rockets and yeah
exactly so military basically and stuff
that we want to talk about i think is
rather the stuff that we have access to
and this we would rather call it UAV or
UAS so so UAV is an unmanned aerial
vehicle correct and in UAS would be an
unmanned aerial system system what's the
difference there that's that's also very
everyone probably you you will ask will
have their own definition of so as ten
people's you'll get 11 the definition is
probably yes exactly and but essentially
UAV as the name says is unmanned aerial
vehicle namely there's no human sitting
in there right I don't think human can
fit on this one in fact it'd have to be
a very very small human yeah I don't
even think a newborn won't fit on it
it's like it probably would be another a
squirrel squirrel it's maybe not so UAS
is probably a broader term then it's
like the UAV as we call them it's like
we we saw these about autonomy t when or
doing more things with it when we talk
UAS but UAV but we don't the midterm
actually doesn't contain it okay so this
is so another area of call vehicles is
then
just to the platform just the view yeah
and this wisdom is well it's a vehicle
that then does something it's part of a
great greater system it's like it maybe
include some software on your laptop it
might include a ground station and so on
and so forth and so the difference I can
the way that I see it is the difference
between say a model aircraft and a drone
is a drone has a certain level of
autonomy where a model aircraft are an
RC or a radio-controlled aircraft is
literally just something that is flown
from some person sitting on the ground
yeah then up in the with it yeah I think
I think the division word that you can
make is basically you have no
sophisticated electronics on the vehicle
flying so RC airplane is basically just
a radio link controlling directly the
servos on the vehicle and that's it
it doesn't have anything else by now yes
they do have microcontrollers and stuff
like that in even the simplest systems
but you could implement it without use
of microcontrollers that I think when
you get to a spot where you you have the
requirement of actually having a
microcontroller that does something more
intelligent than just moving a few
servos I think this is where we start
talking about UAVs right and start
talking math and drones in this sense
that it's an aircraft that is of course
listening for you to tell what to do but
if you stop telling it what to do for a
moment it's not about to fall out of the
sky that's right a matter of
intelligence yeah that's that's right
even though it's like if you look at
fixed-wing airplanes they would also not
immediately fall out of the sky but well
tell that to my girlfriend every time
she flies because every time we fly I
have to explain to her essentially how
lift works and how air foils work and
how it's okay on a 747 we need like one
engine it's fine exactly all right what
we're really interested in building here
is going to be a drone UAS UAV and of
that variety you would mention fixed
wings like an aircraft's like you know a
regular like airplane that we see in the
sky yes however
really interested in this variety that
are called multirotors explain to me
what is a multi rotor as opposed to
rotorcraft that I may be familiar with
previous to getting into this hobby yeah
so what we we know our we see is since
little kids are the big helicopters like
now putting aside the fixed wings
obviously so something well way bigger
than this but in essentially a small
rotor craft the big difference here is
that we have more of the rotors that's
why more your order obviously and you
know the difference is also this is
mechanically simpler or it can be forget
also very sophisticated but they what we
now take helicopters that we now so
you're saying that mechanically a four
rotor multi rotor is mechanically
simpler than a well I guess this is
technically a two rotor because you have
this guy in the back around yes so it's
been around yeah but you also have
several servos that have to actuate
linkages in the middle of it for a swash
plate that is creating differential
thrust on the cyclic of the of the main
rotor and so on it's like it's actually
becoming quite complicated the
helicopters that we see out there the
news helicopters and stuff they are
actually quite complicated systems and
we boil it down with a multi rotor
you're gonna just four four motors right
when I look at these propellers these
are just plastic propellers there's no
what this has a swash plate as you say
that allows you to actually vary the
pitch in fact of this of this rotor
while it is going in right while it's in
motion changing how much it spins yeah
yeah this is just fixed yeah it is just
fixed and basically you have four moving
parts that's it and here you have 12
years of years and linkages and like
that so yeah
plastic propellers fork brushless motors
in this case and and restless electrical
signals and electronics is that it would
you say that's one of the reasons why
this has become such a popular multi
rotor this being the four rotor the
depending on who you ask a quadcopter a
quadrocopter a quadrocopter however you
decide to pronounce yeah gonna call it a
quad yes yeah it's like I think Google
hit hits should decide what which term
is the most popular one there you go
let's leave the Google yeah and because
these are just like there's oh it's like
yeah did the market in the last couple
of years you can find a quad committee
for in fact this is one that I love to
fly indoors and annoy my cat with it's
like forty dollars yellow plastic you
know yeah I think they're one of the big
reasons why they became so popular is is
the price because they are produced in
such huge quantities and also the simply
simplification of the mechanicals so
they have just having the four moving
parts and I'm a of the same exact they
same exact moving part this is why you
produce four hundred quads you produce
four hundred of the same thing yeah
and as with no economy of scale right
and and also what why we are also very
interested in it's like it you need the
electronics to fly it and we like
electronics well in fact you're probably
wondering to yourself ok this is hack
five like are we not going to be hacking
the Gibson let's start enumerated
networks here you know as you guys know
we love to do that stuff as well and get
curious about radio and this is just
another one of those amazing things
where dude you know it's like hackers on
a plane it's like connectors in the sky
let's get some drones going on and
there's a lot of reasons for various if
everybody has like a different reason
why they get into this hobby or or you
know further into the soon to be
commercial drone base what is what got
you into multirotors into and into
you know UAS aircraft yeah so basically
by being a hacker for since I can
remember and having Linux on my computer
tinkering with my computer putting it
together the parts and then discovering
that and having a computer science
degree I'm like oh I like software I
like writing software so I could
transcend the interior of my monitor
space basically into the real world by
going into that hobby it's like it you
have a microcontroller you have a
computer also you're saying so it's like
the physical manifestation code yes so
yes II literally if your code crashes
you crash yes but little quad goes
upside down yeah or spins like crazy and
knows your own wrong I got into this
simply because initially the joy of
flight I mean I've always been
fascinated with flight and I feel like
there's just something really freeing
about like being able to project
yourself into the sky there's of course
an element to it where yes you can go
and buy this off the shelf but this is a
very good start
right and you're right it is it is like
it's a well it is kind of a toy but you
get started with this toy just like
maybe your first computer was a toy and
next thing you know you're like you know
yeah do the Kuna actually or a gateway
2000 but then you're like I'm gonna
build a souped-up rig and you start
getting into you know modify modding
them with carbon-fiber folding frames
and the next thing you know you're
building full-on airframes with the
complicated equipment and it's like it's
like the joys of building a computer
back in the day we're like a liquid
cooling rig and you know my rated hard
drives and yeah very much the same kind
of thing because there's so many choices
with each component yeah really like
yeah it's like I started also with this
brushed motor the first quarter copter
that you could commercially by and then
starting replacing the electronics in it
and like writing new software for it
adding some new things into it and as
you say it's like replacing
your front panel to have on your
computer with it with the four lines of
characters showing the temperature of
your CPU yeah and not just that I mean
when you start actually drilling into
some of the nation's stuff and so and
some of the sensors that you can put on
here you can actually like to do some
really interesting you can search you
can interact with the real world it's
like you can go out there yes and
interact with the real like outside of
your of your room yeah fly your flier
stuff in fact one of the speaking of
telemetry and automation and some of the
stuff that you can get back from it like
we're going to put a Wi-Fi pineapple and
a drone obviously but one of the things
that I love to get back is just a very
simple telemetry which is a video camera
feeding me into a pair of goggles what
it sees because it's like this beautiful
mesh of like the dream of 90s virtual
reality and all of those you know years
of playing descent and half-life and
quake and doom and all of that put into
this this one spectrum of it that's
called fpv or first-person view it's
just like playing first-person shooter
except you're in the real world yeah and
it's also not every one of us has take
time and money to get into actual
airplane flying sitting in the airplane
and flying yourself and it is I think
the closest thing that you can get to
without actually getting a full-blown
pilot's license right at the moment at
the moment yeah exactly
coming back to that but you're and and I
mean essentially what we're talking
about here is robotics we're talking
about open source we're talking about if
you can do I mean imagine a Beowulf
cluster of gyros you know so alright so
it's all that geeky stuff and there are
so many cool uses in fact for this
technology because it's not just I go to
the park and I fly for the joy of it
there's amazing stuff especially here
it's apt that we're in Oregon where
there's so much agriculture being done
here and forestry and forestry and the
this technology applies to that yes now
that definitely it's it's the precision
agriculture where you want to transcend
the moment where you're like spraying
everything independent of how much
fertilizer or whatever they need or how
much water a pesticide yeah and what you
what you can do is rent a huge
man-carrying helicopter fly over the
field and map it out and see how the
plants are doing or you can invest way
more money and do it almost every week
and be on and really put water where it
is needed and not everywhere send a send
an autonomous drone that can map out
your your farm and actually give you
real actionable data using sensors like
thermal imaging and an infrared imaging
to show you where your irrigation is
being effective and stuff like that it's
also fantastic for land surveying for
reality search-and-rescue is kind of an
obvious yeah obvious one that I know
that in 2007 there was a massive
wildfire in California and it was the
first time in fact it runs were used as
a you know in one digital paradise for
the firefighters tell were the nicest
Coordination of the firefighters yeah
you can tell where those hotspots are
you know where to deploy your
firefighters not only where to deploy
where to keep them out of yes you were
to start evacuating yeah yeah it's great
for again news gathering right so say
there's welfare or another like natural
disaster or something like that in
addition to search-and-rescue in some
instances it would not be feasible to
send a news chopper now right now that's
what's being done because if commercial
regulations that are we have seen often
enough people flying news helicopters in
weather conditions that are more than
sketchy sure and and so it not only just
news like when we talk about traditional
news but also citizen journalism there
was occupy Oakland Occupy Wall Street
all of those demonstrations going on and
at least I know anecdotally in the case
of Occupy Oakland there was you know
citizen journalism quadcopters overhead
doing video of the event to just show
like here's what the police are doing
here is how everybody is being cool yeah
about the whole situation so there's a
lot of really amazing uses for the even
anti poaching of rhinos in Africa so
there's so it's more than just evils or
illegal fishing or stuff like that yeah
yeah you have plenty of and actually
speaking of illegal fishing there is
actually some really interesting videos
on YouTube of people fishing with octo
copiers yeah or or filming and whales in
the middle of ocean that yeah where it's
not feasible for you to be out there
yeah you can send your it's like a
projection of yourself it's like your
avatar this is some real cyberpunk stuff
here yeah so William Gibson take note
for Daniel Suarez actually well actually
actually there was sick and in certain
again States like they're already where
the ideas of drones and riggers and
stuff like that oh no absolutely totally
feel that yeah so well before we move on
I shouldn't I think while we've talked
about you know why we're into this and
why there's so many amazing uses for
this technology we should probably
mention that there are some safety
guidelines that you should absolutely
follow and the first one
it's common sense so sudo apt-get
install some of that stuff because
thanks before you fly thank you for yeah
exactly and we're going to be getting
into it and complete build out here and
you will see that we're not going to in
fact even install propellers onto our
aircraft until we know that everything
is worth working fine we're not going to
fly over people until you know in fact
that's just generally a bad idea I mean
this is still we're in the infancy of
this stuff I was talking about like the
interest of building computers and you
know how cool that was and like the
early nineties or something like where
we are with this where is such in the
infancy of this stuff so find out what
the rules are in your jurisdiction
correct I know that there's a lot of
great guidelines for example here in the
United States there's the Academy
of modelers America I think there's
aircraft modal aircraft I think yeah I
forget the exact but the AMA as they
were and you know they have some great
guidelines that even the FAA recognized
back in the 80s and in an aviation
circular basically saying that these are
good recommended guidelines and it's
basically boils down to stand or 400
feet because you don't want to be up at
a thousand feet where other aircraft are
stay at least three miles away from
airports because again you don't want to
be in the in the flight path flight path
you don't want to cause any danger to
anybody on the ground or in the air and
don't fly you know in populated areas
especially not with an untested aircraft
that's right just be careful just to
think before you fly and and just don't
be a hazard to anyone around you it's
like with anything that you take in your
hand and you go on the street just think
before you do stuff right and with that
we are going to go ahead and kick off
the series coming up we're going to get
into the hardware of these multirotors
as well as all of these stuff that goes
into and specifically we're really
interested in the brains the flight
controllers there's a lot of choices and
we have picked an awesome one and that's
what Peters here because we will be
using an open-source flight controller
the paparazzi we're gonna build out our
first quad we're going to do our safety
checks are made in flight we're going to
start adding on telemetry like GPS and
other things like that will which will
allow us to do interesting stuff like
augment us as a pilot with things like
being able to hold an altitude we're
being able to hold a position in space
XYZ and then finally even programming
these to do some autonomy with like hey
fly to this Waypoint and then fly to
that Waypoint and maybe even maybe even
take off all by yourself
fly over there on land all by yourself
so that's that's great yeah this this
will be a lot of fun I'm super excited
about this I want you guys to join us
with this so with all of that we're
going to take take a quick break but
we'll see you real soon
it doesn't matter if you're an unmanned
aerial vehicle or a on woman aerial I

5 swag
we've been doing a lot of really really
cool work with our little rtl-sdr dongle
and the antenna and of course
software-defined radio in general so
today I decided to take a breather from
all of that hard work since Darren's out
of the studio for tip today and I'm
checking out something really easy and
very very cool so there's a program for
Android it's called
SDR touch this basically uses your RTL
SDR dongle an Android adapter and your
Android seen here to give you a
basically little radio and an SDR
compatibility on your iPhone or on your
Android phone so today I have my regular
antenna like I usually do this little
guy and then I have it plugged into the
Android adapter right here and I'm using
a nexus 5 to pick up the signal on my
Android phone keep on saying iPhone for
some reason so I'm gonna go ahead and
get this all set up so you can see my
Android device right here and SDR touch
looks like a little antenna with a
signal coming out of it kind of reminds
me of Wi-Fi pineapple I already have it
turned on so I'll go ahead and turn it
off real quick this is available in the
Google Play Store it's totally free but
if you do want the pro version that one
cost $9.99 it's 10 bucks that's a little
bit expensive in my opinion so I just
went with the free one we'll go over the
differences between those two and a
little bit but first off just to get it
working you don't need to root your
phone or anything like that if you
already have rooted your phone that's
fine totally works just perfectly either
way you simply need three pieces of
hardware you know the antenna the
Android adapter and then your phone and
then you need the app you'll also need
something called the RTL 2832 you driver
from the Google Play Store and that's
also free so that your SDR dongle is
going to read correctly onto your
Android phone so go ahead and open the
app and then click around a little bit
now you'll notice you simply have to
move your finger back and forth to
change the channel change the frequency
you can also move the center piece which
is your antenna to whichever frequency
you want to choose and you can see the
numbers change at the top and this is in
megahertz which is just like SDR sharp
if you've played with that a little bit
now over on the side we have all the
different
options so first off I can go up to the
top and I can turn it on so
automatically it's going to tell me that
the driver is turning it on it might ask
you to say ok to that since the driver
it might be the first time you're using
that so just click OK if it gives you
any kind of advice and then you should
start seeing some kind of spectrum if
you don't see the spectrum click on
spectrum over here and this is
interesting so it tells you unlock this
feature and many more by purchasing Pro
keys so I say no thanks and I still get
a spectrum so I'm totally cool with
getting a spectrum for free I'm ok with
that I don't know why it does it
whatever so I changed my radio to W FM
for a simple example of being able to
listen to the radio the presets button
down here right underneath spectrum that
one's going to allow you to do any kind
of really cool presets that you want to
save again this is only available for
the pro version so I say no thanks but
that's just if you want to save any kind
of options that you've already set under
that is low CPU that option will lower
the CPU usage of your phone and you will
definitely hear a really really big
difference with the audio whenever you
do this but on the other hand even
though it sounds crappier it might be
useful though if you're running really
low on battery because this does drain a
lot of your battery now next up we have
set and megahertz so I can click on that
and this is basically the same thing as
moving my antenna around so it's going
to set the frequency so I have mine set
to 98.3 2 right now but I can switch it
to anything that I want if I wanted to
very simple the next button down there
is w fm of course that will change if
you choose n FM or something similar so
I'll just go to W FM for the example and
you can also do things like AM and FM
USB there's tons and tons of different
differences in there so you can use all
the ones that we're used to on SDR sharp
settings underneath there if I scroll up
on this little menu on the side I'll
click on settings so this is where you
get your audio settings for your antenna
so I have my gain control all the way up
and my audio gain only about 2 1/2 I
found that to be the best settings for
my particular antenna but yours
might be a little different of course
all of these guys are a little bit
different from each others so just play
around with it and customize it to
whatever you need
there's also ppm correction in the
settings too so if you need to change
that a little bit just fine
super easy to use and if you've done it
on SDR sharp you already know what
you're doing now these will work just
like they do if you setup SDR sharp of
course on your computer if you need to
change the offset of your of your dongle
you can do that under offset and that's
under settings right there oops
and if you want to use this program with
some sort of remote there's an option
for a remote so you can basically
connect this to your computer that is
running RTL TCP so I have not checked
out that program myself so I'm gonna
just hit cancel because I'm not going to
be remoting into anything squelch is
another option down here so you can
change this frequency up and down you
can see the bar right there changing a
little bit I noticed a little bit of an
audio difference whenever I had it about
here maybe because there's less less
disturbance going on less audio going on
around it not sure but it's pretty fun
little thing to play with if you want to
record the audio you can also do that if
you set up the pro version as well so
I'll hit no thanks on that of course you
can also hit help or exit if you just
want to close out of the program so all
of these are really easy to use very
very simple menu and there's only a few
differences that I noticed between the
free version and the pro version so your
spectrum is the first one which I was
still able to receive so I can still see
a spectrum on the free version and
recording can only be done on the pro
version I was not able to record
anything but I can see my spectrum just
fine so you know just try it before you
actually pay for it that's my suggestion
so I'm gonna turn up the audio on here
so I can listen to it so I hear a lot of
static I'll just scroll over have some
oldies going on ya buddy
if I want to I can change this around a
little bit till it's clear and it's very
very easy to line it up exactly on the
main bar of whatever channel that you're
listening to I have to give it props to
that because it's so detailed it's so
easy to move it around that you're gonna
get a really nice clear image a clear
radio radio signal from whatever channel
you're planning to listen to so I'll
turn this down real quick I did want to
show you another thing on here when I
change it to low CPU so right now it's
pretty clear you know I can hear the
audio just fine but if I hit low CPU it
gets staticky in the background there's
a lot of static so definite big change
there but very useful since my battery
is getting pretty low so I'm gonna go
ahead and pause that and then I'll hit
off to turn it off completely now a
couple of things to keep in mind with
this this is a big battery hog like I
said with audio and the screen running
your spectrum you'll see a decrease in
your battery pretty quickly mine is at
14% now so yeah obviously it drains your
battery also it's going to make your
phone run a little bit hot on the back
and this is pretty similar to like when
you're running Google Maps on it you'll
notice that there's quite a bit of heat
distributing out the back of your back
of your phone audio will continue to
play if you turn off your screen as well
so you'll need to hit stop whenever
you're done using it but otherwise it's
a very easy program to use I personally
like this because I don't take my laptop
everywhere I go but I might necessarily
want to use my eye and Royd whenever I'm
you know going shopping or something and
I just want to listen to the radio or
listen to whatever the emergency is
going by on the highway or something
like that so it might be kind of fun to
listen to the radio on your Android
device I don't know what do you guys
think it's an it's an easy product so
might as well download it and see what
you want to do with it let me know what
you think of course you can always email
me at feedback at hack 5 org and of
course you can comment below if you're
on youtube and that was SDR touch for
your Android device available in the
Google Play Store for free
it's time for the Technol is photo of
the week and this one comes from mark he
sent us a short little series of
pictures actually he says I was watching
your amazing program on a flight from
London to New York that's a really

good work on the show I'm really
enjoying the SDR stuff regards from mark

totally want to note three now now that
I know that it can just slot into your
