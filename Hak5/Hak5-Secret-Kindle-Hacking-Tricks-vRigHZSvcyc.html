hacked three VPN servers in 15 minutes
and a Windows detail short to boost
horsepower all that and more on this
episode of pack five
this episode is brought to you by goto
assist Express dimdim easy free web
conferencing and Squarespace hello and
welcome to hak5 my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
and I'm Matt Lescott and now that we've
done the Mouseketeer sign-off we can
encourage you to keep watching because
it's gonna be an excellent show really
good one as always but for real for real
yeah we took a week off sorry
it happens oh wait sorry we went to we
went to Toronto sorry they went to
Toronto yeah how was your Labor Day
weekend huh what did I do
Oh jack oh cool yeah I do absolutely
nothing and it was everything I thought
it could be PJs all day and just like
please I don't wear PJs mmm so Matt was
naked with a bowl of jell-o just let
that simmer for a bit so um yeah you may
have we actually got some comments on
603 604 this is what happens when we
clump out the sauce together shoot two
back-to-back in the course of two hours
and they know I'm occasion and then go
and make yeah yeah I mean you know was
it season for most of season four we
were doing two episodes a night and it
didn't work I mean it was great for us
but too much time warp it was too much
of a time warp and we decided that to
get things more you know I don't know in
tune with feedback and stuff like that
we're gonna go one a week right because
especially with 401 through 415 like
there were changes like everything yeah
and that's the thing is with the
beginning of every Steven even Season
five some extent always takes us like a
couple weeks just to feel like you know
find our stride with a new set with a
new format and all that stuff but I
think we have a killer show for you guys
this week they really gonna love at like
console access we got some open source
goodies we got some Windows Server stuff
we got a decal that's going to improve
your system horsepower performance daily
so make you a rock star yeah and we so
yeah we needed it a week off because you
know every cuz shooting every single
week and we brought back records red so
that makes me very excited it's alright
don't do it it's the most yeah it's
delicious I don't
no I'd much rather have landshark that's
the whole reason to go to Canada for for
more than 48 hours you can I think it's
more than 24 hours because you can bring
back a trip or I think it's 48 my
Canadian people's know what I mean
whatever yeah to to force yeah so anyway
that's what's going on with us so yeah
let's get right into it
Shannon your void and Warren cheese out
here I am voiding warranties I went to
this blog it's called the reverse
engineering blog and they basically walk
you through how to figure out how to
open up the bootloader on the Kindle one
it's just the first gen Kindle I know
that there is a new hack out for the
Kindle 2 that aired as soon as that
aired the exact same day as my Kindle
episode things that one of you do this
like whenever you hack Hardware whether
it's the Wii or whatever like like
there's a new firmware there's a new
hack there's something that comes out
the same day it airs so that if we want
something new to come out for the Xbox
360 I just have to do some kind of
garnet yes I want to I want to do it
yeah it's like when Leo buys a Mac and
then they lower the prices yeah bitch
about that only every time he buys a Mac
but not not too much you know just like
tongue-in-cheek like oh that's why I
dropped em fries
yeah it's like what's an Alex $700 or
with Photoshop cost um we are getting
way off we're in a different realm now
let's get back to the hack 5 universe so
so you're you're breaking into your
Kindle are you afraid you're gonna void
the warranty a little bit and are you
afraid you're gonna destroy it yeah we
should probably so we should probably do
the segment and see how it goes
okay but first let's take a break yeah
sounds good
hi Shannon I've seen a lot of hacks
lately with the Kindle especially
getting a bun - on it yes from what I
understand though there's Linux already
on it we're hacking that what are we
doing here yeah there is Linux on here
basically what I'm doing is I'm turning
myself into an Amazon employee and I am
trying to get in here so I can actually
see the firmware and see the bootloader
I want to get in there and find the
username and password and find all the
different commands that I can do to this
behind the scenes so what are we going
to need to break into the Kindle here
well there's a couple of different
things that you will need but luckily
everything's pretty cheap except for the
computer and the Kindle the Kindle one
is the first thing the Kindle 2 here not
the Kindle 2 if you want to donate one
though right feel about success would be
amazing the second thing you need is
this very flat 20 pin 0.5 millimeter
ribbon cable let's take a look at that
here it's kind of interesting what we've
done here yeah it's this little white
cable it has 20 pins on it across and
you just plug it into this little open
space in the back of the Kindle I don't
know why they left this open but they
did you're gonna set their firmware
somehow yes so I think this is how they
set their firmer before they actually
send it out to the different people to
their different because I don't like the
four pins on the motherboard of the faun
router that you can get in you know
little console axis very same exactly
exactly the second thing you need are
some of these little jumper cables so
that you can tie these to this
usb-to-serial TTL cable which runs all
the way into my computer right so that
cable is basically taking cereal and
putting it through USB so you can
actually use it so that you can actually
see what's going on great and technical
note there's the TTL part drops the
voltage that we don't fry anything out
so oh really
yeah and well I don't know I got a bunch
of links and stuff to where you can
either build these yourself or buy them
and they're really cheap yeah they're
very cheap the flat cable is like two
dollars two dollars and fifty cents so
it's it's pretty cheap heck as long as
you have the big parts already the other
thing about this flat cable is when
you're starting to do this hack you have
to kind of you have to get rid of a lot
of the different little pins you can
only have there's about five different
pins that you can use numbers 3 7 and 10
for a ground cable so you have your
receive and your transmit cables and
each of these needs to be tied into the
serial to USB to TTL the next thing you
need is your actual programs on your
computer you need a driver for the
serial to the USB TTL and you also need
putty or some kind of configuration tool
surround yes so you're able to change
the serial port and all that good stuff
so I'll go over here on my computer
first thing I need to change is the
speed so I'm going to change that to 1.5
200 and then this is the comm 3 which I
figured this out by going over here into
my computer management and device
manager and then prolific USB to serial
comm court is comm 3 so I changed that
everything else stays the same so I open
that up now I have my command prompt I
guess you could call it sure so our
terminal is listening to everything that
is going everything that is going in
here now this is really really finicky
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
you just have to write really hard yes
these cables are so itsy-bitsy yes they
are and I'm kind of unsure about whether
I should solder these or not because oh
yeah well definitely like the one on one
side I'm like yeah yeah solder them go
ahead and get them in place and make
sure that it works every time but at the
same time it's so finicky that you might
not move it at all but it won't work it
won't be after we solder it the the
finicky part is that we're using these
little alligator clip jumper cable
dealies yeah and it's just that if we
mess up the solder and we have to cut
the cable and it's going to be a pain so
for right now before your next segment I
figure let's go ahead and do it this way
at least a flat cable something like 2
bucks yeah I should work about like a
three times I screw them all up ok so I
have everything plugged in already
I have these connected to their proper
pins so I just cut on the power button
on my Kindle okay let's take a look here
alright so as you can see it just
started booting up and it's telling me
that the power switch is off so there's
still a little bit of signal coming
through here right because the operating
system doesn't when you turn off the
Kindle it just puts it into suspend yeah
so you know there's still stuff going
through there so I'm gonna cut it on
okay yes it worked this is good cuz I'm
so glad it worked for the first time
yeah it's awesome
okay so right now it's going through all
the steps of booting it up you're gonna
see all sorts of stuff in here there's
like email addresses and devices it
looks like your standard Linux boot up
yeah yes its linux 2.6 kernel okay it's
armed so it says welcome to Kindle I can
type in root press enter and ask me for
a password I don't know the password I'm
gonna put in Fiona which is the darn it
didn't take it that's fine yeah it
doesn't like me it's not letting me in
because my login is incorrect so it's
going to keep on asking me for a login
again and again I can't get into the
actual boot screen with all the
different commands so this is because
before the Kindle ships out they
actually change the password they do
which is yeah I think I mean a lot of
manufacturers just release the same
product with like the same password
expecting the most people won't try to
you know boot through the serial port
that so it's not letting me bypass the
login screen it's taking me
automatically to that screen so I just
check out the battery I'm gonna let the
thing completely power off and then
power back on and hopefully bypass it
this time man this is a boot manager so
these are all my commands all the
different things that I can do and it's
called
you boot mhm which is kind of like grub
that thing that you
for the USB multi pass okay so we can
take a look at the parts he shares all
sorts of things in here but from an
device memory modify calculate board
resistance all sorts of different things
and it's really really cool
I just love the fact that you can look
through all these different things that
you're not supposed to see right and of
course we we can't get into the
operating system but now that we can get
into the bootloader we could potentially
download the firmware firmware do the
other sides exactly on the right track
so I'm not going to be doing this this
week but the fact that I can't find the
username and password just grabs me I
can't actually get in there I can't
flash files I can't you know boot up
regularly from the I guess you would say
the Amazon employee directory almost
right because once we get in there we
can actually load up the potential Linux
applications that are compiled for armed
yes I want to get in there and I want to
do all sorts of cool things that you're
not supposed to do sweet but I need a
password so now how we're going to do
that the reverse engineering blog the
guy that wrote this he came up with an
update file that you can put on your SD
card that will update as a flash update
I think that's why it's called flash
update firmware update yeah
firmware up with update to your Kindle
so that it will basically reset your
passwords so that you can change it and
then you will know it mmm and then you
can get in excellent and you'll be able
to do all sorts of cool things on your
Kindle so we're doing that next week yes
all right
hopefully and it's all cricket yeah well
cross your fingers hope that Shannon
doesn't break it and let's take a break
find out what's going on with the land
party hey baby won't talk to you about
this most land party you gonna head on
over to game dot hack five or three
fifteen four three two one you know some
killing mainly destroy maybe even some
flag tape
that's how we roll but in the meantime
you can head on over to hack five land

throughout the show we've spoken ad
nauseam about the importance of
protecting yourself from
man-in-the-middle attacks and having a
traffic snaptun and why it's important
to encrypt it and if you think it's you
know not a trivial thing to do
you know I rest my case so you know in
the past we've talked about things like
using you know SSH tunneling to protect
your traffic and I think it's time that
we speak about the retouch on VPNs so
I'm going to put together a segment for
you guys now about three different ways
to implement a VPN server in your home
just using your spare PC or what have
you so that when you're out on you know
open Wi-Fi or wherever you are that you
can tunnel back home and use that as
your default gateway and use that to
browse the Internet and and to do
whatever important stuff you need so
that you have an encrypted link and it
is super super simple to set up both on
the server side and on the client side
you don't need to worry a lot about
configuration and you don't need to you
know it can be as easy or as difficult
as you want it to be and throughout this
series we are going to take the you know
the manual approach to it and get our
hands dirty and in bash but for right
now I thought I would demonstrate three
really simple ways to get set up so
we're going to be talking about a
service that does use open source and
Linux and all that fun good stuff as
well as - for you Windows users and I
thought that would actually start with
the simplest and this is actually
something that I've touched on if
believe it was in the first season
episode 4 but I think is a important
thing to recap and that is that there's
actually a VPN server built into Windows
XP I know
Windows XP is not a server but there's a
very limited PPTP or point-to-point
tunneling protocol VPN server built in
that allows us to connect back to our
home computer and well okay only one
concurrent user but if it's just you
trying to get back home and use it as
your default gateway get some files from
your home PC this might be a solution
for you
so I have pulled up here to windows XP
virtual machines and use one as a server
and one as a client and I'm going to
show you how super super simple it is to
get this set up so I'm going to open up
my network connections create a new
connection and this wizard makes a damn
stupid easy an advanced connection allow
incoming connections we skip this part
and say allow virtual private
connections and then we choose a user we
could actually add a user here if we
wanted to I'm just going to choose
administrator these are VMs I don't care
about and I'm going to click properties
on tcp/ip and this is actually where you
can specify an IP range so I'm going to
give it 10/10 18.1 through 10 10 18 .
well I don't know I'll say 20 but it's
only one concurrent user so chances are
you're probably not going to use that
many but you know whatever it's a DHCP
pool let's let's give it those addresses
so I click OK here and next and finish
and what you'll see is that I have an
incoming connection link here and we see
no clients connected and it's like I
said it's scaled down it's pretty dumb
let's come over to our client I need to
find out what my IP address is first
okay so I'm on 1010 Oh 147 so over let's
pretend that this machine is on the
Internet
and now I'm going to be doing all of
these here on the land at home but
really to extend it to doing over the
internet it's just a matter of you know
opening the ports in your firewall
forwarding it over to your service
making sure that everything's good there
in this case all you would need to do is
I believe it's TCP 1743 I'm not positive
on that it'll be there to correct me but
so let's go back over to our client
machine and I'm going to run NCPA dot
Cpl just a quick way to get to network
connections I'm going to create a new
connection and this is the simple
procedure connect to a workplace that we
would do any time we VPN wanted to
connect to a VPN I'm going to call it on
VPN and it's on 1010 ODOT 147 and my
correct I am correct okay and yeah there
we go
so I log in as administrator and my
stupid password and I can see here if I
take a look at the properties and their
networking and tcp/ip under advanced I
can see that it actually creates this by
default it sets this as the default
gateway on our network and what that
means is that my client that is
connecting to this VPN is going to use
this connection for all of its network
routes not just network routes that
don't reside locally or whatnot is it's
going to use this for everything and
that's good because that means that we
can browse the internet knowing that
it's going through this secure encrypted
connection say ok to all of these
prompts and go ahead and log in and it's
going to go superfast because it's right
here local and bam I can see it says
unconnected hooray and I got one of
those nifty IP addresses that had set 10
10 18 - and my server 10 10 18 1 I could
access it say like I had some file
shares on there I could go to 10 10 18.1
and if there were some folders shared I
would actually be a
see those or any other service that I
may have running on that server or well
I say server but it's a Windows XP
machine and if I take a look over here I
can actually see incoming connections
one client and there's administrator now
like I said this is not a corporate
solution this is really just a home
solution and I believe this works very
similarly in Vista and well it worked in
Vista it should work in Windows 7 I
haven't verified that but you know if
you're just if you're running Windows at
home and your computers on all the time
you know downloading your torrents
whatever it does you want to check in on
things it's not a half-bad way to do it
that way you're not sending anything
over clear text so now let's take a look
at one of the more like Enterprise
focused ways so I'm going to get rid of
these VMs and pull up a few others and
before we get to the Ubuntu let's take a
look at Windows Server 2003 ok so I have
what two windows servers here ready to
go and we are going to go ahead and
create a routing or remote access server
and that's just a fancy way to say we're
going to create a VPN server that you
can quote-unquote dial into and since
Server 2003 and I'm sure with 2008 my
buddy here Matt would attest to this
that they've made it dumb simple to add
services so I actually have a console
pulled up here you see I have this set
up as an active directory this is salt
hak5 org this right here is pepper if
you really wanted to know and so these
computer salt and pepper are going to
connect to each other I've got a couple
of users here I'll create a new user in
my active directory I'm going to call
him Bob Bob resan that's not his middle
name and that would be B Bob person at
salt hak5 org I'm going to create a lame
password for him
and sure never expires hooray
okay and I'm going to right-click on Bob
Bob Orson and save properties and in the
dial-in tab I want to allow access to
VPN now here I can also make a few other
changes I can say give this person a
static IP address in my segment last
week I believe I was talking about some
VPN tricks you can do in Windows and I
think I glossed over this and I'm not on
crack on this segment as you can notice
that I will slow down and actually let
you know that that that is something
that I should have checked in that last
segment and I probably did and didn't
mention and that's an important thing
there's one thing to note about that
though that that's not going to work in
a mixed mode environment so if you're
running in Active Directory domain
controller it has to be native so you
know your Windows 2000 2003 and above
this isn't gonna you know so you're not
going to get this option here in this
menu if you've got some 98 ME clients
like seriously okay so with that said we
could also add some static routes here
but suffice it to say right now we're
just going to allow access to the VPN
click ok so we've got Bob bobbers and
added here now let's make this a active
directory let's make it a routing and
remote access server so I'm just going
to do it the the stupid easy way and go
to my manage my server thingy and add a
role and I'm going to choose remote
access VPN server hit next a few times
and next a few more times and here what
we want to do is actually set this up as
a virtual private network access and NAT
ok now I'm going to choose my first
connection here and yeah I'm going to
leave the basic firewall set up and I
want to actually specify a range rather
than DHCP and for me this is just it's
going to change depending on how you
want to implement it in you know your
corporate network or even if you're just
playing at home go download yourself and
if you know you can get a 180-day
evaluation copy of the Windows Server
stuff and you know play with it because
now then you can put it on your resume
and tell your employers at least you
know
we'll just play with it so I'm gonna
specify a range here and create a new
range and I'm gonna 1010 19 1 through 10
10 19 253 there we go so I have plenty
of space here I'm on you know a slash 24
and plenty of people can connect
concurrently it's gonna be great and I
now I don't want to set up anything
radius this is this might work we might
come back at this later in the series
and start talking about radius because
this as well as the next VPN solution
will actually allow us to tie in with
that in fact the next solution using
Linux will actually let us use LDAP to
tie back in with this over Active
Directory and that would be that user
Bob Bob person that we've created rather
than UNIX users I'm getting ahead of
myself
let's stay back on this so we're not
going to use the radius server and we'll
click finish and if I come over to my
console here I can actually add a new
snap in and that will be routing and
remote access and I'm going to add that
server this computer we can see salt
here the local server is already set up
and I can take a look at my properties
here and you can see under IP that this
is my range and under here I can
actually see what connections are made I
can manage my policies I can turn on
rowdy or logging it actually shows these
ports and these are actually the
different connections I allowed two
hundred and fifty three of them and
they're kind of like mini ports as if as
if I actually had a bunch of modems
connected to this that you dialed into
so let's go ahead and connect to this
from one of our other servers and let's
just make sure I've got this IP correct
that's ten 1001 eighteen so let's say
that that was a public-facing name -
just like I did in XP it's pretty much
the same wizard in Server 2003
called salt don't dial a connection
you're a server come on
10 1001 18 said what I said yes
and just like the last connection it by
default sets it up to use that
connection as its default gateway
considering this as a server-to-server
thing probably don't want to do that but
if I go ahead and click connect there we
go and I could not verify user name and
password because I am not using the
correct account let me try that again
but this time be Bob Orson okay I'm
gonna save that and registering my
computer on the network
hooray and as you can see I'm now
connected I have my IP address and it's
from that poll that we set up I mean I
don't think it could get any easier so
there you go two ways to set up a VPN
server in both you know your standard
Windows client XP Vista whatever and
your Windows Server 2003 very similar in
2008 so we're going to take a quick
break and when we get back I'm going to
show you how to do something very
similar something even easier in my
opinion using an Ubuntu server for free
and using Open VPN again free is good so
wanted to tell you guys about a service
that I use every day and it makes my
life a thousand percent easier it's
going to assist express to be honest
when you couldn't live without it sure
there are free alternatives out there
but this is the solution that works and
is absolutely bulletproof 100% of the
time if you're still going to people's
houses or trying to troubleshoot
people's computer issues over the phone
you're wasting your time not their time
so do yourself a favor and go to go to

that's go to assist comm slash hack 5
try it free 30 days now that I have made
Tom B shrivel in the corner and cry for
all this use of Windows I'm going to
take a step back and we're going to
switch over to the good side and you
Linux and some happy open-source stuff
so that we can do the same thing
free ish and we'll get to the issue in a
minute we are going to be using a very
awesome product that we've actually used
before in the network monkey called Open
VPN this is actually the way that we
could get that private tunnel there on
the network monkey with the tap
interface with Wi-Fi and the good stuff
and the good stuff so I'm going to show
you how to use Open VPN in a very easy
way using what's called open VPN access
server okay it's a version of Open VPN
that's been compiled and put together in
such a simple way with a management
interface it ties in easily with your
Active Directory using my favorite
technology in the world
LDAP you can do radius and it just makes
things easy so if like I like the the
whole purpose of this segment if you
want to get a VPN running up in your
home so that you're not insecure on your
public Wi-Fi and whatnot this might be a
solution for you so let's take a look
here what do we have
it's very easy you just go over to Open
VPN net you choose active herbs our
access server download you have to
register but once you register it's
pretty much a breeze now I have it
downloaded here and I'm actually going
to share that out because I have a
server here ready to go where is that
server it's one of you there we go
there's my happy server okay so my happy
gube unto server here on 1010 Oh 255
that's the broadcast 10 1000 137 ok and
I need to get this over to there so real
quick I'm actually going to use one of
my favorite tools tools what's called
HFS yeah that's the stuff so we've got
hfst it's an HTTP file server it's a
single executable and you just run it
you pop a folder or a file into it next
thing you know you have basically the
equivalent of an Apache server with a
directory listing so I'm going to go
ahead and add that here and this is
my folder where I'm keeping my Deb here
this is the debian package to install
this guy love some packages they have
rpms if you're on the Red Hat side of
things they've got it set up for just
about every major distribution of Linux
I just happen to be using a bun - 964
server here so I've got this all set up
in my HTTP file server I can actually
verify that I look at that 295 unread
messages and go to 127.0.0.1 and I
actually see that listing here so I'm
gonna go ahead and W get that over from
my server so I've gone ahead and
installed it with T package and it's
just now a matter of running the
installer script so user local Open VPN
a s and the anit and we just have to
answer a few quick questions here I'm
going to tell it to actually use our @ 0
and I'm gonna say yes I do actually want
to use root as my administrator you know
for security purposes in a production
environment I probably wouldn't do this
I'd create another user just for this
and lock it down for this demonstration
we'll go ahead and use root it quickly
installs it it's pretty lightweight and
now we can go ahead and get to our
management interface and this is the
thing that I love and that mat here will
agree with is that one of the beautiful
things what makes a UNIX tool great is a
beautiful web interface and here we are
we have browse to our IP address on port
80 443 the default port for the admited
min and yes we're gonna get a security
in a warning because the SSL and all
that fun stuff but we're going to
proceed anyway and root because we
didn't specify anything cool and here we
are and I love the fact that we get a
beautiful interface much like you would
see on like a consumer router or like
you know Linksys wrt54g or something
popular like that and it's you know just
a few quick simple steps that we need to
actually create is set this up so that
we can start using it so first thing we
need to do though is actually go back to
our virtual machine and create a you
so user ad whoops user ad noob and then
passwd for noob we're going to give
noobs some lame password great so we
have a new user
his name is noob and we are going to
connect to them as a VPN connection it's
going to be awesome where is my there it
is so the most important thing that we
need to configure here before we
actually get going aside from just the
user is actually setting it up to allow
access through the internet using you
know this VPN server here as our default
gateway so for that we actually go under
VPN settings and we choose under routing
that yes we want to allow the client
internet traffic routed through this VPN
so we'll go ahead and save that setting
now we also under authentication we can
take a look here that we have three
different options here we've got Pam
radius and LDAP LDAP is well you guys
know LDAP is my favorite LDAP is what
you could use to tie this in with an
Active Directory so if you're in a
corporate environment here where you
don't want to spend a lot on client
access license for you know your routing
and remote access like I have showed you
in the previous vis expensive
alternative because then you can start
getting Linux into the environment and
go ahead and integrate it that way or if
you're running radius that's that's a
great way to but we're going to go ahead
under Pam there's not really any
settings what I want to do is user
permissions there it is I want to create
a new user we're going to call them noob
because that's our user and save him and
that's pretty much it so now we just go
back to the overview and start the
server oh I'm sorry
before we start the server there's
various one other important thing that I
forgot to mention remember what I said
that this is free ish sure okay so Open
VPN free open VPN access server since
they wrapped up in this beautiful
package to make it so super simple to
set up has a well there's a license okay
you get two concurrent users for free
and if you would like to purchase
additional users concurrently there
this license of $10 a user which
compared to a Microsoft client access
license is all much less expensive or
further on in this series we'll go ahead
and do it
you know by hand and get her you know
get dirty and bash and start playing
with it that way but I really like if
you just want to get set up real quick
open VPN access server especially if
it's just you and a friend trying to
just protect yourself on that open Wi-Fi
again so let's go under license I
already have my license key ready to go
no you can't have mine I'm gonna go
ahead and enter that and now we should
be able to start the server great so our
servers started let's pull up one of our
XP clients and I'm going to show you how
dead simple it is to get set up with
this so we still connected to that VPN
yes we are let's disconnect from that we
don't care about that connection anymore
what we want to do is pull up our ghetto
browser no we don't want to go there we
never want to go there we want to go
over to 1010 135 135 or 137 it was seven
I am being told and we want to go to
poor 8 443 and we want to make sure that
this is HTTPS and of course we get the
security dialogue get on this and we
click yes and we're gonna log in as noob
here that user that we just created and
this is how super simple it is so your
clients all they need to do is go to
this website log in and they get the
option there to download a client for
Mac for Linux or for Windows or if they
already have the Windows they can just
download the Open VPN client config
we're gonna just run this installer here
and next install
and now we have happiness on our desktop
and seriously we just double-click it
already knows who we are it already
knows what to do I just enter in my
password of lameness click connect
it's authorizing me I get an IP address
and I am all set up and I can actually
take a look here and now I have an IP
that I am connected through and it is
that easy to set up Open VPN if you use
the access server the only limitation
there is like I said with the license
you actually do have to pay a little bit
if you want more than two concurrent
users but I hope this just gives you an
idea of the options that are out there
there are plenty of these websites that
offer like free VPN you know hotspot
yada yada
listen year you don't want to use one of
those you want to use something that you
trust something that you run yourself at
home or I mean if you can't trust your
Ihde who can you trust
I mean if you're on Comcast things could
happen I or Time Warner I'm not gonna
leave Cox out either I think I should
digress and say if you have questions
about this or suggestions for future VPN
related topics be sure to hit me up
darren at hack 5 org and if you prefer
the cracked out version of darren let me
know i can just get the pixie sticks out
next time so i'm gonna get the rest of
the gang here and we're gonna wrap this
bad boy up

alright guys so just before we get out
of here we want to let you know that we
have a lot of stuff cooking in the
pipeline or in the pot or whatever the
hell you want to call it and what we're
doing is we're actually open sourcing
some of these ideas that we're going to
be bringing to you on future episodes
because Matt is a huge fan of open
source ya know I do have to say the
OpenVPN stuff yeah
tits McGee thank you thank you
yeah right gel see ya so hak5 labs is an
interesting experiment I know and I
think this is something that we should
do like henceforth it's a great way to
get the audience involved in you know if
you ever wondered about the production
of the show what it takes to actually
put together some of this stuff
especially some of the more intricate
hacks that are coming that require a lot
of programming or not want to get
involved in that your downloads the see
we could use some help
Monday the 21st we are holding a
conference with our awesome sponsor
dimdim that's going to allow us to host
a great meeting where you guys can get
involved with the development of some of
these segments and see our screens as
we're kind of working things out if
you've got ideas of your own we would
love to hear from you it's how you can
pitch to us and how you can get a direct
feed right to us because you know God
knows we just we don't have the time to
idle in IRC all day and you know though
we answer all of these emails you get
this rich experience when you get a
group discussion going on and I think
it's and you know dimdim is a perfect
platform for that kind of thing so I'm
stoked about that oh and then we're
using dimdim later like next week I
forgot to mention we have a guest coming
on the show next week over dim dim
that's going to show us some nifty code
of his own that allows you to tie in
some Google Maps API s as well as yah
what is it dumb YouTube API is to
synchronize GPS with video how crazy is
that
so you can see where you are in the
video on the map next to the player I
mean that's some crazy stuff
cool yeah so anyway yeah get down now
