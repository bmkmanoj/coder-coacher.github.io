Linux all that and more this time on
hack 5 hello and welcome to hack 5 my
name is Darren kitchen my name is
Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of techno laws
welcome everybody yes I am totally
playing Mario Kart from 1992 up here
how'd you do on that by the way I got
let's see 4th place so I got one point
out of how many
hey it's been like a long time since I
have played that game when this is
moving from it's from 1992 wow yeah I've
met I remember playing this tiny - when
I was like what 7 well the last 5 we're
we're old
yeah and play things that you're even
older than us stuff from the 70s it's
gonna be rad so we are talking about
names today oh man I can't believe that
it has been literally 10 years over ten
years since we covered this topic on
hack 5 about building like a homebrew
arcade machine we did that in season 1
yeah we built ourselves what we called
the hundred dollar arcade cabinet
because we what we recycle it a lot of
PC parts no I remember that yeah it's
like recorded in SD all the season one
stuff with standard-definition oh man
this thing of youtube had just come out
it was pretty cool anyway just came out
so it's interesting because the games
themselves haven't changed a bit
we're talking about emulating video
games from the 70s the 80s the 90s
probably before some of you guys were
born after all but the ways to play all
of these games has it's kind of evolved
a ton over the last day
yeah absolutely I mean and we really fun
is today in collaboration with our
sister show tech thing Hey yeah we're by
the way if you haven't seen that show
it's awesome oh yeah I do it with Pat I
do that show with Patrick Norton and
it's over a tek Singh Kham and you can
also find it at hak5 org yes and the
hack 5 YouTube channel so there you go
so subscribe to that as well and we are
collaborating together on a build of an
arcade cabinet you know building a hard
homebrew arcade cabinet is a lot of fun
it's personal I'm pretty fulfilling too
ya know cuz you can just buy video games
but like there's something really nice
about like putting I mean hell we even
have
arkaid button that was right there our
arcade button yes they are for a
different reason but it's really fun to
be doing this and so what it means is
that we're going to be able to play the
classics we're gonna be able to play all
of those amazing things from invaders
space invaders joust defender Galaga I
own you and Galaga and if we do it right
we might even be able to play some gems
from the console era so when it comes to
emulating arcade machines there is one
go-to piece of software and I'm sure you
know the name of it names name yes so
school me on name okay so what is a meme
that's the question that everybody asks
it stands for multiple arcade machine
emulator so the first one was created
around 1997 and they've been going on
since then and they basically recreate
arcade game systems in software form on
modern pcs so that way older video games
aren't just dying away when our consoles
die - oh right you guys can't read your
cartridge think of actually now that you
mention it that is very at that's a
really interesting point - how we need
to protect the legacy of like you know
technology and computing and all this
stuff in general if you happen to be
anywhere near springfield missouri go
and check out the 1984 arcade we
actually did a documentary on just that
that fantastic place but is season five
or something it's like a living museum
of arcade history and now they mention
it they like went on at great lengths
about what it takes to repair those
sorts of machines because they're using
like in some of the cases is using
discrete logic they're using chips that
aren't manufactured anyway and so when
these things die like the vectorscope
monitors for example on the billions you
will find like tempest which is
fantastic by the way when those die they
they're dead
so there's a very legitimate awesome
reason to have emulators like MAME and
guess of course the accompanying files
that they read the wrong so those are
called roms just like you said those are
read-only memory files they contain the
game that you want to play so read-only
memory chips are found in game
cartridges
arcade game mainboards etc etc so ROM
dumping is when you have a cartridge and
you want to actually dump the memory
dump the game from the cartridge onto
some other saved file history like
something that you can use on a modern
PC like you would use for with an
emulator so it's so it's a file that
represents that physical hardware
that we had previously as children held
in our hands and gone yeah exactly
kids are missing out these things I know
right good times man
so it's are keeping archiving gaming
history but also some people have used
it for illegal sales so of course you
have copyright holders who are not big
fans of roms of course a newer console
manufacturers have added security
features to disable some rom dumping but
generally what i've seen and noticed
about online people they've been able to
reverse-engineer this so the whole
security thing hasn't necessarily worked
in all cases right so well actually when
you think about it this is commodore i
believe that one kind of yeah they try
ok well the interesting thing about this
is if you look at console history with
roms right they literally are because
those original consoles using cartridges
there's just chips on those boards
holding the you know the the software
the game data in these little chips
right
and then as consoles move to optical
media what were they using CD ROMs CD
read-only memory and it's through like
ah you know mod chips and things of that
nature that you'd be able to take a burn
to disc again like a burned CD is no
longer a ROM it's no longer read-only
memory so the same kind of things
happening over and over but what I find
really fascinating is that the original
Famicom so the device that we know in
the US has been Nintendo yeah ed you
know used floppy disks as its medium for
the game data and they shut that down
because as you know floppies are really
easy to copy oh yes they are even did I
don't copy that floppy movement for a
little bit there so anyway just find
that esoteric and fun but that's the
awesome part about going down memory
lane
through the means of name oh it's so
great okay so we should probably
describe what kind of operating systems
and main works on yeah well I mean it is
in of itself it's kinda like a virtual
machine right it's it's how you think of
it like oh I want to run this other
thing that's not a computer most
computer on this computer so like many
other virtualization platforms that
you'll find like VirtualBox or things of
that nature
they're cross-platform so MAME runs on
there's like ravers of it for Windows
Mac Linux Raspberry Pi everything in
between so it does run on pretty much
everything but I think that we should
talk about MAME from the command line in
Linux you want to take this one oh of
course
especially as you have switched over to
Linux of your primary operating system I
could see why you would want to go with
this and running name is pretty simple
in that it's actually just a command
line program in Linux which I mean bash
amazing possibilities with endless
piping's and and three directions so if
you're looking to integrate it into
something else it's really cool that it
is simply a command line tool and anyway
if you know you just have a wrong that
you want to just get started and playing
grabbing yourself a copy a MAME may be
just perfect grab that for whatever your
distro is and you should be off to the
races so the end of the vanilla main
distribution that only comes in source
form which means that you are going to
need to do all the compiling and all the
dependency fetching yourself which is my
favorite thing to do in the entire world
yay but if you prefer something ready to
go like I do sorry I think you will like
a steal MAME they offer are ready to go
download of name which is super super
great
SDL stands for simple directmedia layer
and it's a graphics library for linux
and you can find a ton more info over at
STL named Wally weak org and no that's
not a saying for Walmart no even though
it kind of sounds like it doesn't sound
like now they say it's essentially a pre
compiled version of STL name for your
specific distro you want to head over to
the download page yeah yeah so you head
over to their downloads page and you
basically select from this list and you
know grab the right one for your
distress so you're running ubuntu 16.04
so you have grabbed the one
for Wiley werewolf and then I press go
and it's going to give me the option
64-bit 32 bits or the sources so I'll
just use the dot de Bie the dot dub for
64-bit right and so you already have
those downloaded and ready to go you
will need to grab yourself a copy of
name as well as name - data and MAME -
tools specific to your Linux
distribution yes exactly
right I'm gonna get the installation on
ok so that's pretty much just a mattr
commit and command-line installing a Deb
just like any other we did this the
other week with Open VPN it's D package
dpkg tak I and then in this case you
have in fact let's LS real quick so that
the LS start out Deb make sure that we
have all three of them in the same
directory yep so while they're here so
yeah D package Takei MAME start at Deb
of course okay so you're probably going
to get an error like I did about
dependency so you can satisfy all of
those by running sudo apt-get tak eff
install so I'll run that real quick oh
that's fantastic cuz it's like hey you
need all these packages cool let's do it
that's quite a snap but you know ok so
now that that's done I can run the D
package tak I'm named Deb command again
and now we can just run the main command
Danny works yeah that's so exciting
there you go cool except we haven't
completely have any runs we haven't
downloaded any legal roms and yes there
are plenty of those there's an entire
homebrew scene of people making roms for
these machines that are no longer
existing and I don't know it's just
really cool why don't you quit out of
that ok and take a look ok oh this mouse
so I'm gonna take a look at man name
alright and as you can see there is a
lot involved in this in fact these are
just the command-line parameters let
alone all of the various configurations
and configuration files so to say that
it is a very extensive program is
putting it lightly this is kind of like
the Emacs of emulators as it were so
yeah I just wanted to show you guys that
real quick to like if you just want to
dive right in but you know if as you can
see it is kind of extensive it can be a
little bit exhausting so if you're like
me and you're just wondering you know if
you want to run your own custom solution
based on names and that may be the
perfect solution for you but if you want
something prettier instead of just
wearing a command line name well
thankfully there are all of these
beautiful front ends and distributions
that take a lot of that work out of it
and we're gonna cover our favorites as
soon as we get back know what's even
better than a retro arcade getting an
awesome deal on a domain name and that's
what Shannon and I do whenever we have
brilliant ideas and want to bring them
to the Internet we go to domain.com they
have a super simple domain discovery
system that makes it ridiculously easy
to find the right domain for you and
their checkout system is a breeze to
have your website up and running in no
time and get this the guys over at
domain.com huge fans of hack 5 so they
have the hook up just for you it's a
coupon code that'll save you 20% use the
coupon hak5 that's about as hak5 and get
yourself 20% off when you go to
domain.com and get this they have been
supporting hack 5 for years and years so
you should send them a tweet at
domain.com and say hey thanks for
supporting hack 5 and when you think
domain names think domain.com we're back
and I'm ready to make meme pretty
because we are building a freaking
arcade after all I mean I don't want to
sit there with a keyboard in a mouse I
wouldn't much highly prefer either these
guys right here or a console controller
like this one Shannon your pony died
because it wasn't pretty enough oh my
pony never dies
oh yeah now we're gonna talk about
front-ends versus distributions which is
really beautiful to think that there's
actual Linux distributions specific for
MAME because there's a Linux
distribution for everything you could
possibly imagine I love that there are
main gist rows yes
but it's basically let's let's talk
about the pros and cons here front ends
kind of amazing because what they do is
they do require some more work to set up
they are more customizable they are
upgradable independently of the other
components as opposed to a distribution
so the name emulator itself or whatever
but you know you can put in some work so
if you're looking to get started more
easily just
absolutely yeah so distros are less
customizable they're a little bit less
work and they are tied in with other
components like the emulator in the
front end so that means that your
upgradability all of those components
are all baked into one thing so kind of
update the entire system as a whole it's
easier yeah and there are some very
popular main front ends though that we
should discuss first one being advanced
menu so this is the advanced project so
this allows you to play arcade games
with all sorts of different kinds of
hardware like any TV monitors your PC
monitors they mention LCD screens in
here I wonder if LEDs I guess that would
work and they run with all those
multiple operating systems that you
would pretty much expect hey shout out
that it runs and boss yeah right and the
one thing that I wanted to point out
about this is advanced menu which
emulates the sounds and the animated
previews of games - that's nice it's
cool yeah the one that I find a little
bit more attractive is the Xbox menu the
this that's an older one yeah one of the
newer ones to hit the scene that looks
amazing I think is this one called
attract mode attractive basically it's a
graphical front-end for those command
line emulators so same the one that we
just showed you MAME you'll also do mess
and nest Opia which is outside of the
scope for this but there are other
emulators and the idea here is it just
it hides the operating system completely
and it's intended to be used with a
joystick or a gamepad or a spin dial so
you don't need a keyboard to operate
this thing
and it makes it ideal for arcade
cabinets like they're building over on
tech thetan and of course it runs in
Linux OS 10 and even windows-based
systems so I'm gonna say right now I'm
gonna really emphasize that I think
Linux is a better choice as the base
operating system for any maze it's not
just because it's ak5 it's because
inherently Linux is usually more secure
than a windows-based system and when it
comes to like security you want to keep
all of your systems updated and you
don't want to have an old Windows box
kicking around on your network because
it's running your arcade cabinet system
right maybe wait maybe this is just an
offline thing maybe you go general Adamo
so you do maybe Ethernet to transfer
over a lot of those rooms unless you put
them on on the USB flash drive okay so
moving on it drives are their popular
main distro so distros are the next
thing the first one being something that
I really fancy it's called puppy arcade
so this is lightweight it's easy to set
up it's a main that runs on Puppy Linux
so no installation is required for this
one which is great so it can be run off
of a flash drive and it emulates tons
and tons of different consoles in fact
it emulates all of these things up
highlighted right here yeah so oh wow
okay so so yes peas on here SNES of
course Virtual Boy ms-dos it's got a
little DOSBox thing going I'm okay with
this all right cool another one that you
might want to consider is if you
remember we've mentioned at the advanced
menu if you're interested in checking
that out and you don't want have to go
through a lot of the setup if you wanted
just like burn a CD Projekt there's
advance MAME CD or advance CD and it
just runs off a CD or a USB Drive and
it's only 20 Meg's which means it leaves
tons of storage for all of your other
roms yeah yeah yeah that's great if
especially if you have a computer that
me maybe it's too small to put an
installation on or something like that
so that's really really nice and then
while talking about emulating machines
from the 70s and 80s so they weren't
fast to begin with so if you have an old
machine kicking around this is a
fantastic way to breathe some new life
into it I wonder if this one works
oh yeah it's from my flash drive so it
would probably work on Raspberry Pi oh
well it depends on no not necessarily
because that's not x86 and a lot of
these are x86 yeah there's a retro prime
PI though I was about to say we don't
mention retropie we are going to get
like nothing but comments about never
mess with retro pry hi I did try to get
retropie nitro pipes e time to run on it
but it was a little janky sound and you
know what isn't janky retroarch maybe
grow arch indeed yeah he's done Arch
Linux which we don't give enough love
here on hack 5 because we're bun to
people but arches are really fantastic
distro which is great and
Oh arch in particular mm-hmm so this one
is fast it's lightweight it's portable
it comes with a ton of features it
includes retro replay and it includes
shaders for all your graphical
interfaces multiply path shaders yes
sexy so lots and lots of customizations
are available through retro arch and
it's probably one of the most popular
ones that I'm aware of
it's one of the newer ones too and
here's the thing I'm just gonna tease
next week's episode because we are going
to be building one that is based on
retro arch in fact we have it here
running now on this Intel nook and
actually I think this is overkill for
the kind of thing that we're trying to
do you don't need a massive graphics
card for any of this stuff which is
really beautiful so if you want to get a
head start on what we're building next
week what's running here it's awesome it
is called Locka Locka akka dot tvs where
you can find out we're gonna be building
a very own main box with this next week
I guess we'll just go with like a game
pad or something for our build yeah and
then continue on with this series
because this is a kind of like crossover
multi is multi series series where you
can find all about the build out of this
cabinet over on tech thing which is
gonna be really exciting yes thank you
for that that's my other show if you
haven't checked it out yet it's super
super fun and it's a much more consumer
tech oriented but we do some builds
there too for our patreon so you support
us over at patreon.com slash tech thing
it's full of snubs you know what else is
full of snobs is the snubs report I
don't know if you guys have checked it
out but the latest one on travel tips is
awesome yeah and you can find links to
that on the hak5 youtube channel just
scroll to the bottom and you'll see our
vlog eve logs I'm gonna do a car show
next oh what a ride it's nobs
it's gonna be epic I can't wait alright
alright so we have a pen test with hack
5 which is coming up in September it's
from September 18th 16th through the
18th I totally know my dates yes fun
check this out because it's something
that Sebastian and
Rubik's and myself put on and we cover
Metasploit the USB rubber ducky Wi-Fi
pineapple and turtle we put on a mock
pen test in a storage driven environment
that is so different from any InfoSec
training you've ever done it is so
immersive and fun in the camaraderie
that comes out of this it's always a
good time I can't wait to see you there
I've been getting snapchats from people
that are coming and it's exciting I
can't wait and DEF CON Def Con for sure
we're going to be there in force I can't
wait I'm just about to mail out dark
tangent a hard drive full of hak5 - so
that's how you are
yeah we're syncing up these it's doing a
really cool project you know we should
talk to them on the show sometime
because it's doing a cool project to
like archive all of this hacker media
and of course we have hack shop which is
Haq shop.com that's where you can
support us monetarily and purchase
yourself some really really cool hacker
gadgets yeah Wi-Fi pineapple in the USB
rubber ducky we have new ones coming
check them out
oh it's gonna be so much fun hey thank
you so much for your support over the
last decade or so I'm apologies in
advance that it took us over ten years
to loop back around to MAME but it's
really fun to like glimpse of this and
see how far this whole project has come
and so yeah leave us your comments let
us know your thoughts feedback a hak5
org what kind of name system are you
running we want to see those we want to
feature those we want a technolo toe of
the week of your arcade cabinet hit us
up and leave some love below with that
if you just want to show your support
right now share like subscribe all that
social stuff you do that and we love it
with that i'm darren kitchen I'm Jana
Moy
trust your techno list I'm a bird I'm
doctor bird you can do the show with Tom
Merritt so Tom tell me about daily tech
news show what are you doing on the show
this week I know you paper we had a
weather oh I like that one that's a by
boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
