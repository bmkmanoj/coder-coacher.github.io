Sparkle chair Shannon Morris reports on
this segment of hack five this segment
of hack five is brought to you by
domain.com hello welcome to hack five my
name is Darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
it's your weekly dose of Technol us
that's a show for you guys this week we
do yeah what are you doing I am getting
into all sorts of nefarious fun as I
always do and I hear you're making bits
go to other bits
I am sterilizing them yes I am but first
I wanted to share a gift from a fan oh
that's right cuz we got one and then you
know people send stuff over to our 15501
or 5:48 addresses that have been
published here and there and everywhere
but uh yeah and this is a pretty cool
one you ever want to send a gift you can
just go over to a check a shop calm at
the very bottom or it's on there and
what is this oh it's a pocket protector
no no no no this is something very
special
Paul we're gonna have to get a b-roll
clicking this because there's no way you
can't appreciate this without seeing all
what is it two point what it's not a
sticker oh here we go okay so this is
from an anonymous anonymous fan
he said I've included a DLP DC 2k DMD a
digital micromirror device it's the same
chip currently used in cinemas around
the world 2.2 million mirrors on this
chip can be individually addressed and
move at speeds of over a hundreds of
megahertz at its heart you can think of
the DMD as a giant shift register that
requires information to be clocked in
extremely fast and he also forced the
DMD image to hold an image of the hak5
logo so it should stay that way even
even if it's powered on again if you
have a microscope you should be able to
see millions of individual pixels that
make up the image some will be tilted
one way the others the opposite way this
is the heart of the DLP DMD and how we
steer light isn't this really cool sorry
but this is amazing is it look at that
that's a deal
so all of it so the reason that you're
seeing hack 5 is because some of the
mirrors are and it this way and some of
the mirrors are pointed that way and
there's just millions of them and they
can make them rotate really fast so you
can imagine
like in a projector this is how you can
project like 4k imagery
oh that's cinema okay and I am just
absolutely in awe and now looking at
microscopes cuz wow I know I want to buy
a microscope just to look at all this
this is going in like a shadow box on
the wall this is just technologies can
we put it over there next to the other
why would anyone hide that inside of a
projector this needs to this is great
yeah that's Michael so thank you thing I
do not I think it I don't please don't
look it thank you is oh but I like
techno lust
oh Jesus a different technology right
along you are you're into owning your
own cloud I am is last we talked about
own cloud yes so I'm I've discovered
this whole thing about owning your own
server owning your own cloud so there's
no third party in charge of your data
you mean we're holding your data I mean
some company some say an American
company that likes to do business in
America or American agencies maybe their
intelligence agencies right so are
interested in your orbits it's exactly
say your bits so last week we discussed
own cloud and I'm sure you guys
hopefully really enjoyed that segment
but now we're gonna check out Sparkle
share so this one keeps all your
different folders and all your different
projects in sync across multiple
computers and users as well and it
integrates with things like bitbucket
github --get aureus which I've never
used myself or you can run it on your
own server
so today Darrin installed a server and
I'm going to be checking out the client
side of this to see how it runs and how
nice the GUI is you're not getting away
that easy we're gonna actually going to
spin up a new service I want to show you
you are and then what I want to show you
how simple this is I'm going to pull up
another cygwin terminal here I'm in
Windows right now because I'm showing
off the Windows client Shannon is going
to do the Linux client but I wanted to
show you how easy it is to set this up
and so I'm in cygwin which is basically
like a tool that allows you to do like a
lot of Linux
stuff within windows so I've got LS if
you've ever seen me doing like ducky
segments you'll see me doing you know LS
and be like Oh more like SEO clear mall
so I installed cygwin which is really
cool anyway that said let me SSH over to
our new box which we just spun up this
is a Debian server and it has I've never
actually SSH to it so we're doing the
bad thing and SSA Jia's root and I
haven't even added it to my hosts file
but hello so this is like that fresh
this is the first login if I type
history there is no history the first
history is history one yeah so let's go
ahead that it's the instructions to set
this up on your own self hosted server
are ridiculously easy the first one is
to actually don't even need to do that
I'm already running his route but
Sparkle share makes this so simple with
an awesome dazzle script so just going
to copy that into here missed that and
that was it okay so it's got that now I
just do dazzle set up
and it's like hey
have get so let's install get and of
course this is a debian so it's using
yum to install get there's also you know
very similar installation on Ubuntu if
you wanted to sudo apt-get install git
you know aptiom pac-man third they're
all awesome for this reason so are
already we're almost done we're
importing our jpg Keys setting up our
storage and there we go and so now it's
saying great re our setup is complete
all we need to do is dazzle create and
then the name of the project okay
so if you do dazzle wait and you could
say ma folders or whatever help you and
it would go ahead and set that up and
from here we can get our sinky sinky on
it's a cool now we just link a computer
with dazzle link and then it'll ask us
for our computer's ID now i've already
set this up on my windows machine so
i'll show you here i've got this little
guy sparkle share and there's not a
whole lot you can do right here right
you can just see what's changed it can
turn on notifications ooh the about and
I've already set one up on a different
server called hack five so if I pull
that folder up you'll see where it lives
is you know your user folder your
username and then sparkle share and then
the name of your folder if I go back a
directory and though just really the
only thing in here is a little text file
that has your code ah
hey check that out it's just a DSA or
RSA key okay it's just using SSH oh um
and so let's go ahead and set yours up
now great with that and get you all
linked up ok so I am on your laptop for
this so I'm gonna leave the full name as
aardwolf and we'll use a dara nethack 5
as the email share that okay with you
that's fine okay so hit continue and
this is after you've already installed
it and I'm gonna go ahead and skip the
tutorial no let's see isn't it it's just
like Dropbox yeah so it creates a
special folder files you want to add to
your project sync them with the hosts
automatically so yeah just like Dropbox
continue and it's also going to add one
to your status icon which is very nice
shows the syncing process status and
contains links to your projects and an
event log great and you can also add
projects to sparkle share by using the
add to Sparkle share button whenever you
see it on the web the project will be
add automatically added so that's a
pretty nice little perk so I'm gonna
finish that alright so you're all
installed okay now get you linked up so
I am going to go to your where's your uh
it's done but I'm using gnome 3 so it's
all down at the bottom I got just like
over the bottom right and it auto show
there it goes no there it is okay so
sparkles share I'm gonna click on that
right click and then go up to Sparkle
share aha our tools key so it's just in
slash home slash Sparkle share wonderful
should we mention the little problems
that we ran into their witness there are
uh there's an new version 1.1 for Linux
and OS 10 which is 1/x in OS 10 what
seemed pretty awesome and then there's
1.0 for windows and in all the previous
versions 1.0 and everything previous has
this little bug where they only show you
your your link code um during
installation that's the only way to find
it yeah so if you accidentally just kind
of pass that while you're installing and
you're like me and you just hit next
next next you might miss that code and
then you got no way to find it again
you would think uninstalling and
reinstalling it would allow you to get
back to that right but it doesn't
understand all the registry crap that's
installed it turns out ok you know what
to their credit cuz I realize this now
that they they actually made it quite
simple your link code that RSA key is
literally just in your sparkle share
directory
yeah so that's the Darren's ID key that
you had in your dress just this right
here and which of course we made this
harder for ourselves and ended up
looking for it for like two hours you
actually this is a good example of like
I'm totally sympathize here we're like
oh this is Unix I know this it should be
you know yeah Holton stuff you start
making it you make it more difficult
than it actually isn't um really if you
just kind of like read the I did find a
blog online it was not Sparkle shares
blog but it said that you can find the
registry key in a text file but it
didn't say where that text file was so
now we found it so now we found it so
let's go ahead and lock you up go ahead
and open that again uh G edit or
whatever and just copy all of that
alright and then head over to your essay
go back to let's see
it's alt tab or move your mouse to the
top left its gnome 3 right there it is
yes okay
and as it mentions right here to link up
computers we just simply use dazzle link
command so go ahead and use that Shannon
so it's dazzle link and then just hit
enter you okay
you should my ID okay so this is the
whole piece that I just copied
oops oh crap control ship to be you guys
forget to do that okay yeah that's it
and to access projects okay we're we
have to get access to more clients okay
so that's right and so since we already
have a project called hack 5 on this
server now if you just go ahead and add
a project to this so it again in the
bottom right ok and then you right click
on its front share and then go to add
hosted project this is where you can see
integrates with all of these host
services cool and so you choose your own
server so we and as you can see on my
computer where we set this up it says
dazzle create folders and it'll tell you
like for your address you enter in this
for your remote path you enter in that
for you Shannon since we're actually
using a different server its SSH colon
slash slash storage at 64 dot twenty dot
62 dot 2 to 0 and for the path it is
slash home slash storage slash hack five
ok there we go and add may take a while
let's go get some coffee
project okay so project hak5 has been
successfully added access the files from
your Sparkle share folder okay yeah and
if so you can go ahead and hit open
folder look it out no way
so now if for example on my hak5 folder
i don't know i create a new I don't know
I'll go with rich text file and be like
oMG this works then over on Chanin's in
just a moment there it is so it's like
10 seconds or so it's not to remember
their works it does it's not without its
limitations actually I was yeah I was
actually about to do you know one of my
favorite shortcuts in Windows which is
all fwf for create a new folder ah
uh-huh yes Oh file done haha new F for
you and your keyboard I love those and
so I would be like this is empty and you
can sit there and refresh all day long
but it's actually not going to
synchronize it because there are some
limitations with this software does not
sync empty folders and you can't have a
git project within your home folder here
because any of your project folders
because it's actually using git on the
back end that had your really recursive
and the get would get to get and you got
you just gotta get out of here for that
what a painting yeah but still okay
pretty cool I think it's got some
promise I think it has a little immature
but it I think their their site makes
very easy to get it set up and running
it does and if you and while they have
like android client it's not full
feature you can only see files you can't
really sync files with it yet okay um I
think this project is one to follow
because they've done a good job of
saying like these are you know
limitations this is what we're good at
and if they just continually evolving
the client software because I see I mean
the server stuff was the easiest I've
ever set up yeah this project really
simple in fact you can set up your own
encrypted just with dazzle create
encrypted and then whatever your project
name is and that you can only do that to
new projects not
a currently existing one correct right
once you have a project you can't make
it encrypted later and they have a
pretty good explanation on their github
here of the encrypted you know
client-side setup basically it uses open
SSL and aes-256 pretty straightforward
really cool they even mention here that
there are some limitations of course
like for example if you have two people
working on the same file and want to
save that you're going to have a
conflict because it doesn't you know the
server can't actually see understand
those files right it understands those
file names so bear in mind that's not
going to be secure so you know don't
name your stuff like world domination
txt but other than that other than that
it says you know if you also don't
forget your password or your files will
be lost forever unless scientists invent
a working quantum computer here that in
mind well I'm glad they have a sense of
humor yeah they really do and I think
that's important in open-source - yes
okay cool well I'm looking forward to
seeing more versions of this in the
future under everything check it out -
couple more like in the spirit of owning
your own cloud home cloud really got the
great man for that but you know posted
project self hosted you know bring it
back yeah there's a really cool movement
going on right now and I want to see you
cover some more of this stuff
yeah I'm looking forward to your
feedback on what other projects you run
as alternatives to those main streams
that are the drop boxes and the
Twitter's and all of those things so hit
