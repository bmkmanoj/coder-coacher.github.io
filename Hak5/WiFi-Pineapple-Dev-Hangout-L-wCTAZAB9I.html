email that to me right now oh they hang
out or the YouTube okay good but it's
still not up on area right yeah oh we
are not restarting the right place on my
yeah just a bit
alright with it check yep okay hello
hello there we go yeah cool bottle on
listen let me make out stop maybe just
me and Trent off maybe all right as we
live okay cool well then let's do it
again yeah lots of toys on the desk
today Maya maybe you should absolutely
mm-hmm why do we have too many toys
Sabbath suite of toys is that really
where this all came from yeah I'm trying
to figure out like the birth of the
pineapple and that's not actually a very
good image so don't think about that too
much but God its toys isn't it yeah man
this is not the reason why we make
podcasts or why we're hackers yeah every
one of us has a closet full of is a
cables hmm yeah you want to make things
work no don't work mm-hmm the reason why
we want to plug mains into our ide
cables into our SATA ports in a two-hour
AGP card yeah totally yeah we should
keep thinking toys because you know we
will yeah so that's all right I know is
this is this the new harness is this is
the new hotness okay called an alpha uh
and I chay-ara 271 o NHA ya know that
run actually that you know I must say
alpha does a really good job of
implementing some of the socks that we
love oh I we're them thanks or as being
one of the people that got us here
between the mark 3 and mark fork
yeah I mean I never would have imagined
you know two years ago three years five
years ago when the pineapple project
started that we would be making our own
version of a amazing sock you know so
props with arrows too so building on
Giants here man it's just crazy to think
yes it is but it caught us where we are
now yeah yeah oh hi internet web spoke
welcome I'm Darren I'm sub I and we are
the team that is bringing you guys the
new Wi-Fi pineapple and I don't know if
you can tell the enthusiasm but trust us
we are on cloud nine ye releasing this
stuff this is just an amazing experience
for us if we seem a little tired it's
actually because we are and have their
last nine months working on a non-stop
yeah yeah so it's kind of like a for us
it's like almost after the party is like
ah ok we did it we have the native
pretty much no pineapples and you slept
for 24 hours and 48 i finded I did I
have to say I did I just I uh I gave up
but I just oh god you know when shannon
has a sword that's scary what I have
like the isn't gonna you know yeah I
thought we were going to talk about
antennas and then kiss them goodbye yeah
okay maybe next tag five will slice one
in half oh cool yeah but it's really
exciting because now we launched it
right we did where's the fun where is
the Aqua the hack was on hiatus yeah why
well I guess check he has a freak out
yes yes um but I reseda hack hide that
org pan pineapple where you can find out
some bogus all the time about pineapple
II goodness i'm always on there you're
almost always on there yeah i'm making
fun of h fam all the time as he makes
fun of us for drinking sparkly water
instead of beer but you know it's only
three o'clock well yeah that's true six
o'clock on the east coast so no excuses
like in germany yeah um
it's it's kind of weird in that you know
for us to have just like spent all that
time like oh my god oh my god oh my god
get it out oh the manual in this thing
we need to print out that thing and the
design for the case and the things with
the pins and will this port fit on that
thing in all of that and then boom it
sent him so for a moment it's like oh
we're done but no we're only doing
everything yeah now now the real fun
begins I guess but you got a bit into
that we should get into it because it's
really exciting to you know now that
everybody else knows what we've known
for I mean I've been look at how saying
for so long I've been dying to tell
people about what's comic oh yeah no I'm
doing this so I'm glad we could finally
talk about a prop yeah yeah so obviously
the mark five the new hotness the the
thing in the pretty box they were able
to do you know from the ground up from
scratch with what we want and not have
to know like fine I'd something close
and make it work we're able to put in
some of the things that we truly love
throughout years of experience with this
kind of stuff obviously we love the a or
93 31 after atheros qualcomm chip that
is at the heart of this unlocked
versions of that as well as the realtek
rtl8101e everyone calls this thing in
alpha yeah yeah but it's a are 93 31
yeah or it was a real really like Rdio
seven numbers um but so that was like a
good start but and that I it enables a
lot of power and so does doubling the
ram in dublin rom absolutely then when
the other core values of course being
usability sure so dip switches it modes
well i think we'll show those off like
how to set those and embeds we've we've
done i meanwhile leaps and bounds with
the web interface in 10 days to my
horrible rewrite with more 32 the new
hotness that on the last hang yet we
were talking about the 30 was in
continuing of that so yeah that's all
about usability you know I I love me
some blinking lights so give it some
LEDs of course a storage huge microSD oh
yeah I'd up to 32 gigabytes I want to
say new 64 I do 60 flood I know it's not
hard to hate but I want reporting fat
and
so I know on the fat size side of things
32 right because we're not going to
support expat know on the EXT of you
know you're doing use EXT fourth is the
hotness you know well that's my devil
now and is easy actually four months
automatically when you if you if you
give it the riots d card it'll it'll
form an automatic before you can
actually force a format to the user
interface now all right yeah it formats
on first boot right with the two gig
card that we include absolutely so the
reason that we do that is so that
everyone always has the latest version
of the firmware when ships out from here
um and I think that's a big step because
people did get firmer as well nigh don't
know 2.7 was released and they got
pineapple just 2.4 that's not really
what we well known as la one and it's
one of those things where you know when
you're sitting you're flashing all of
these units picked about time it's a lot
of time you do them in batches and so
this way that kind of cuts that out
makes it a lot easier for us and make
sure that everybody always has the
latest hotness I'm so you you should
probably explain because this is where
we're getting nitty-gritty here explain
how that process works well okay so it
starts off with us having a stager on on
the device and it's a stage' firmer
which basically checks and SD card is
inserted these d card is inserted it
checks for two two files one of them
being the upgrade up in file and the
other one being the md5 file md5 file
clearly has the md5 sum of the upgrade
of bin so if those match it'll just
flash whatever firmware we put on the SD
card and you know we've got this nice
sheet of instructions and the SD cards
are on the back so it's easily you know
accessible and easily findable that's
for us to do it also allows us using the
stages so it's not just a flashlight
service it also allows us to perform
some fixes or or you know do bug fixes
with another file called fixes so if you
find a fix is file on your SD card it'll
actually executed before flashing and
can you know if there is a bug on the
firmware or if we do discover something
last minute we can change it in a very
very quick manner we've got this machine
that can flash how many cards in 12 sec
no Sarge seven cards in like 30 seconds
yeah it's also in bacon we were trying
to get state of like button look at the
exactly yeah no but but it really does
it doesn't mean that you know we
to make the best user experience
possible and we want to kind of like
introduce you to the pineapple while
this is happening and it's like you know
it this gives you this mate forces you
to sit there and wait five minutes so
that you can actually peruse through
read the manual and as no you're not
messed up because you should really read
so anyone watching this that doesn't
have a pineapple or anyone that does
have a pineapple should really read
through this instruction I have a
feeling that if you're at the level
enact them where you're you know getting
hacker hardware like the the pineapple
and you know looking to dive into it
whether you're simply just looking to
use off-the-shelf confusions or start
developing your own you're already at
the point where you know what it means
to flash firmware and that absolutely
login need to be careful and that you
shouldn't run it off of battery power
speaking of firmware on battery power
and bad flashes though we're pretty much
unbreakable now right that is HUGE
because it was I mean I must say it was
actually easier with mark 12 and 32
absolutely because even break with yeah
because you can get into the bootloader
called red boot over by just sending a
packet over Ethernet before I booted
salunke guys made an awesome you tell ya
apt one flash flash each other that's
how the case with the a or 93 31 because
it doesn't use red boots no is it relies
on you boot absolute so it relies on new
boot what we've done is we've actually
included a web interface on you boot so
before on the mark for you have to boot
into you boot and you have to with a
serial cable connect so to actually get
into you boot the command prompt you had
to connect over cereal and flash over
tftp and so on that was a bit
complicated we kind of wanted to to make
this easier so what we've done is we've
included a web interface with you boot
that allows you to simply like you used
to with the old pineapple firmware as
you can just upload on an upgrade up in
or a firmer file and hit flash and it'll
restore its to you now you don't need a
serial cable to get into it you just
flip the very last dip switch to the
upper position and everything else the
down position and you just get into this
mode and you can hear it up on 192 dot
168 dot one dot one well under one
there's a very small I mean that the
bootloader is small 120 yeah we've got
hundred to a all right
not even padded I would have loved to
have been able to dhcp so that at the
point where your reflashing or for more
you know how to static an IP address
yeah I'd hope so I don't think that's
too much trouble and I feel like just
that it's it's nice because you can kind
of like really so trying stuff and not
feel like oh no I'm gonna break it and
have to send it back to the hack shop
and they're so we don't we don't have
that anymore the bootloader is it'll
allow you to reflash you from her and if
something does go wrong it's it's not
like you need to to get together I got
it well we previously you used to be
able to you know at least break out a
serial cave yeah but but then even then
right you had to break a serial cable
you had to flash Stockholm whe files for
the device you and how to sis upgrade to
our for more and so on so it's kind of a
nasty progress now it's it's you just
flash it and the way we're planning on
doing this when we release this these
update files they're going to be staged
your files to they'll be the latest
state your files all the time um but we
release the stage and you can flash
directly back to a stage and and you
know use the SD card to just everything
like that if you want so that's really
bringing it back to fact it's brilliant
as opposed to the dip switches there's a
dip switch combo you can use that was a
factory reset all not firm wraps on that
on that from where so that brings it
back to basically your first boot
exactly yeah or will your second boot if
you're willing to get technical but
first well after the first book
absolutely yeah yeah yeah by the first
first I'm posh guy and though in the
past you were able to fix it over cereal
and just break out your screwdriver
unscrew poor little screws pull the case
apart pop in your leads tripod your
uncle now Bob's your uncle like almost
instantaneous yes absolutely so you flip
the switch you plug in ethernet and
that's all you you don't need to see
that right there however we do have a
serial port right on the device that's
externally facing so people that do want
to use serial can now deal without
having to take the device of our time
yet you know the industrial design of
this it's built such that the serial
pins they fit exactly so they they don't
wobble around there and I do I mean we
talked about like you know hack ability
of this thing and I should probably for
warn anyone yet yes please star hacking
however the one on the far right that's
3.3 volt don't don't use it you will
just break advice oh yeah please please
don't break your device that way uh it's
a real quick and easy way it overloads
the CPU and I just goes poof yeah you
don't wanna do that that's not going fun
for anyone um we've had plenty of people
lately doing into the mark for that just
fry the device and then they see all
Kyrie solder this or can do that not
really unless you have unless you have
really really really cool yeah exactly
this young the tools are you good how
are your hands not some know Shakespeare
there or machine that most people just
don't have that you won't be able to so
I can't do it two for two no me neither
um so that's uh I actually did that I i
I'm gonna I'll be first to admit i did
that mistake too i mean i had some mark
forced to break it was okay yeah i was
in the end of the world but but it kind
of sucked with it and that that device
will never do again yeah and actually I
need up with a burn on my thumb because
i was using a yeah will this be you art
yeah after plugs right into my USB leads
go over to the pineapple I'm like what's
wrong with the saying I'm trying
different settings in mini-com trying
micro calm I'm like why can't I get
cereal to this thing I'm finally I'm
like well let me reset the USB I gotta
grab it and pull so I'm like grabbing
hard right and I burn my entire thumb
yeah because I had overloaded the system
in fact I'm glad that my machine still
dude it at that yeah because it not only
can't destroy your your your device you
can actually if you don't have
protection on that USB port which sadly
lots of devices don't eat camp fri your
device and I can't or like actually
break your laptop yeah yeah um that has
happened to you know what else we
upgraded you know it's far as usability
talking about you know making these user
accessible and Joseph we have really
gone through great strategy to make
these antennas a lot better this were
here it looks and smells just like this
one of your old r PSI is there an
amazing i'll just be very careful
because it's actually on the antenna
that you're finding the pin now so this
won't plug into your old gear because
it's pin-to-pin but your old antenna
will plug into this it just won't make
the connection and so in fact what i'm
doing right now is never good for any
radio I'm i did it on this one
I'm not actually using that radio right
now so it's okay if you're also not
powered on oh no why don't I we're done
oh yeah the indicator LED shows you how
much juice you got left but yeah I'm so
anyway the idea here is that it was
actually based with a conversation that
I had with my cosmin during his
development of a hack RF and Mike Osmond
is a brilliant genius when we got the
hardware which is crazy to think too
because the uber tooth was his first
projects he's just one of those child
prodigy kind of people that just like
everything they touch is amazing and so
I was having this conversation with him
in Seattle that torque on up there
talking about the latest hack RF and how
he had actually he actually got rid of
the onboard antennas and I don't know
what what are these people's ideas that
on board antennas on a PCB was ever a
good idea i don't know like the pig
tails they break the really sensitive
you need to you know that's even worse
yes sorry okay so yeah you on board
stuff like I've seen okay be later some
on board stuff the hacker refused to you
got rid and uh and yes so they're used
to you know I actually asked him like
you know why why this connector because
I'm like I'm actually had a hack RF
workshop with my thing and then I made
the new mistake because they all look
the same of bringing my rp-sma and he's
like the guy that won't work and then
I'm like oh really why and then he
schooled me on SMA and TBH it was a con
and may have had a couple of years so i
don't remember all the gory details i'm
also not a ham however i defer to his
judgment when it comes to this stuff and
this is the guy that's developing a
software defined radio from scratch
tells me that SMA is is the way hopin ya
know so we decided smh nicole and it's
just some more solid connector you won't
have it you know unscrewing on the board
or some of that like a much more like
it's yes over-salted on the actual
connector is that connected to antenna
which is awesome the mark ford did have
um you know we had issues with a couple
of issues if your pigtail wasn't plugged
in properly or if there's a kink in your
pigtail you would through the thing it
would go round get it would the 12 ohio
just break down or they wants a curlicue
pigtail as much as it would sound cute
animation wise yeah absolutely yeah so
that's what that was another huge thing
um 10
100 Ethernet USB 2 we mentioned this on
the les tree we never actually got into
the nitty-gritty of the USB to true yeah
there's your interesting way in which
they are 93 31 implements its USB stack
in that it will not recover very well
from a dropped packet from that we
talked about Pakistan where talking
about network packets but in this case
we're actually talking about USB packets
they work on the same kind of
architecture and it just basically will
tell it ova it will when it drops a
packet it's like the next time it sees a
packet from that device is like the
first time it ever saw the packet from
that device which is no good if the
device in question doesn't know how to
respond to that and at least with my
experience the most that I dealt with
that was actually with 3g modems gone I
didn't always use you know extra storage
or you know no extra radios were great
but these were things that we wanted on
the board 3g modems wanted to make sure
that those are solid and we did a lot
with the connection scripts the
keepalive script to kind of make up for
that short coming in that implementation
on the iron and 31 and through a lot of
research finding that if you look at
some other projects to use off-the-shelf
stuff to do basically consistent 3g
routers using the air 93 31 you'll find
that that the common knowledge is use a
hub yeah so the question is why right so
it turns out huh busy near intermediary
right it doesn't lose the connection
with the air and a 331 it loses the
connection with the hub the hub can
recover from that and then suddenly
everything's hunky-dory right and so on
the device the the the mark five the hub
that we're using is actually one touch
that does the buffering correctly right
which also what allows us to do cool
things like microsd like the adapt so
they're all they're all on the USB hub
so they are USB but obviously because
the director on the device that's power
draw less issues there's less packet
loss so that we had before your devices
don't just go down or say hey I'm not
gonna let you scan because ever have
enough power something that you will be
able to like these batteries here for
example you see it right now it's
running off of battery and it's it's a
like wages working on it yeah it would
get more on the batteries but yeah I
mean
free from those four days off those
batteries yeah um so so I guess so yeah
better USB to actually that brings us
into it it's actually a 9 volt power
supply that comes with it international
now finally you know so you don't have
to worry about getting an adapter and
mana works in Germany and there you go
the UK and uh as well as 50 I felt like
that's important because I'll be honest
I love just plugging my pineapple into
the USB port on my computer and off to
the races again though saying that as a
warning you should make sure that your
device has some sort of overdraw
protection on your on your USB port it's
nowhere hardware does but you right we
should absolutely point that out because
the specification is for USB 2 at what
500 milliamps right yeah and we say 50
we're talking about 5 volt if you've got
a new report that's able to say charge
an iPad exactly which is kind of what
you're looking cuz what can happen is
that be that the pineapple with your
like operating under full load and you
know um how going nuts on all the radios
it can happen that you your it wants to
draw too much power from your laptop and
your laptop does not handle it and that
can cause issues however that's a very
rare thing and only really with all the
hardware yep which brings us to the
paddle juices in fact we actually just
got a question here from whit wants to
know about the batteries that were using
i'm going to give you that one will i go
and grab the other two that i have on my
desk oh yeah right so the batteries we
have right now is this though that's the
small one actually this is something
we've got coming soon okay alright so
here is here's the first sample of I
can't actually before I even preface
that let me tell you guys that lithium
ion battery is or something that you
have to like pay a lot of attention when
you start trying to find a proper vendor
there's just a lot of crap out there so
it took a long time to finally find
something that I'm very happy with and
basically just blanket not interested in
five a little more period 12-volt makes
this so much more stable and for that
reason so while you can't charge your
phones with that anymore you can now
without a problem charge your hyna or
not power your pineapple for days that
was the crazy thing is I
did this benchmark on this battery right
here three times because I didn't
believe it the first time first time
ever did it and this did the procedure
at that time was all just make it do you
know radio stuff make it do the regular
stuff right it's wrong karma dude do the
your basic pineapple stuff in less than
36 hours I actually thought something
was broken the second day when I came
the name like how is this still going so
then I did the test again and I'm like
okay well obviously I didn't peg this
thing hard enough so up the transfer
rate and have a calculate pi half the
time yeah okay 34 and a half hours or
whatever and I'm like whoa okay hang on
and then I told the pineapple to just
calculate but like peg the CPU pegged it
is peg the radios go nuts right 34 hours
still I'm like yeah magic battery yeah
also they really do they mainly they
really do I'm so so happy with these and
so yes so this is the pineapple juice
6800 that'll last about a day and a half
I'm very confident saying a day then you
know these aren't as pretty however the
12 803 days amazing so this right here
three days you know it just little LED
their switch this is really need to be
going you know in your immediately
assume this is the one where you do the
deployment and you come back days later
to find out what's on the SD card but
here's the thing that we didn't really
get into this is so beautiful and we'll
have upgrade options in the future for
this because as you can see the pigtails
on these this is just simply a DC out
right this is a two point one millimeter
inner diameter yeah better yeah well
it's nice is it just plugs straight in
some pineapple so you don't need to use
a thing at all a what is it called cable
at all no and then obviously don't do
don't plug them into each other that's I
don't how to say on that and then of
course we're gonna have we're actually
going to have just so that we have a
less expensive version in the future
we're going to have a I haven't finished
benchmarking on this but it should be
technically half the power of that so
that's good love pineapple juices thanks
for the question whip um what else
what us expansion boards well should we
should we saw so many people have asked
us about this so the pineapple five
moons good power it off for a second the
pineapple five has a nice hatch on the
on the back so let me just kind of open
that up and what you'll see is a is a
number of pins I don't know if you can
you can see this on this probably not
but basically we've got number of
expansion pins now we haven't released
much info on them because we are not at
that stage where we where we're going to
release things right now however that's
a larger conversation where we introduce
the hardware development kit exactly
velopment you get to accompany it so
that's gonna be something that we have
in a separate street we've literally
just gotten over our hangovers from why
yes exactly know but but but what what
will be released isn't a software
development kit for it it will be a
hardware development kit now anyone that
wants to play around with these please
be careful because it's not just gpio
that you can use and you know dr things
with necessarily um it's gonna be an spi
interface and we'll get into that later
but hey protocols gay act exactly will
we write some some fun stuff there but
uh but no really careful because if you
do the wrong things on these pins you
will again break your device and i know
people are gonna break out there you
know kits and start hooking up arduinos
not have stuff to it do it on your own
risk but don't come and complain if now
your device is broken because it yeah
good chance it will ya yeah almost meter
on it but we've got there you go we've
got we've got some really really cool
exciting stuff coming there you want to
give an example of some stuff we have
cloud oh I keep that well I mean it's no
okay I actually the better way to phrase
that would be to ask IRC and I'm looking
at it right now what you guys would like
to see in the way of pineapple slices in
that the you know the port here the not
gpio not spi are kind of hybrid thing of
a happiness that can interface with a
whole board the 9330 one what is it that
you would plug into your pineapple
foxtrot right here is just saying
more Ethernet hey you know what you can
already do that even without that you
know yeah absolutely we have one idea
something yeah you've got one on the
back yeah in fact that was a really easy
one to go ahead and implement because
key I mean look so so what he's getting
basically we support these nice little
dongles now it's obviously you know the
dongle but we support ethernet over USB
which actually kind of ties in to a
question your own that I have here from
so that will always work and it works
really well I have to say yeah computer
Chris asked why'd you go down to one
Nick well sighs sighs is definitely in
fact if we have a marked for around here
we could show you that this is only
slightly wider than a slightly wider
it's pretty much the same height and
that was huge to be able to jam
everything that we did into it in fact
if you were to try to say take a mark
for and you know plugin I'd like give it
similar capabilities you'd have well
you'd never be able to do the you know
or expansion boss or the dip switches
but even if you tried to like JAMA USB
to hub on there with the SD card and an
alpha you'd be looking at a rat's nest
and we really wanted this thing to look
beautiful and I honestly think that it
does you know this guy's serve just very
well and will continue to however I feel
like keeping it small was important and
even off-the-shelf stuff like I don't
know I'm just I feel like it should be
pocketable yeah and so so so not only
that but we we looked at the the
benefits that's to either imports would
give us um and the biggest reason for
the two Ethernet is to do a project that
we introduced in 2008 called the
Interceptor or the network monkey the
man in the middle that is a layer to
bridge and at that time it was using a
tour to 11g to to rebroadcast right
there will be opportunities for that in
the future I feel like if that is going
to be the case it needs to be done right
and I'm just going to say that one of
the reasons was precise and then the
other reason was for cost and if the use
case is and if somebody else can like
give me some more use cases in which is
second interface is absolutely mandatory
we're totally all ears and we want to
hear your feedback on the hardware and
one you know yeah I mean a lot of people
have been saying you know hey we'd love
to have it for internet sharing well and
then connecting to the other a porch
normally that's for sharing wireless
internet we have a second card on this
we've got the the realtek which performs
great as a client and we actually built
up to the weapon if it's happening yeah
sure I'll see this in the DMZ wants to
see a sim card adapter uh so built-in
modem we've had we've learned so much
when it comes to certification yes and
regulations and all of those things and
not saying that's not a possibility I
feel like right now the quickest and
easiest way to get the thing on to the
little international do yeah but I don't
know if that would be the bus i would
take get it the code still use USB but i
don't know yeah optically i think we we
have absolute fools oh my bama we have
some cool ideas i plug in to make that
work yeah let's see a raspberry pi 2
pineapple connectivity it'll um you know
you can probably do that i just over
cereal yes you can so uh if the right
kernel module is installed to i should
be able to use this as the client um you
can you can definitely communicate those
high and the the pineapple the pineapple
to over the normal serial port so the
one that you have easily accessible
which is great because this way you
don't need to take the board out of the
box and you can still use a nice case
and have the antennas you know you don't
need to worry about any of that so you
can interface with the pie directly yeah
just pop the RX and TX and don't plug
into that 3.3 volt micro heck says a
micro ethernet switch that's an
interesting idea not sure exactly what i
would use that formless it was like a
home router or something bad you know
that's that's something to think
it's pretty cool what else that yeah
micro X says the sky's the limit
absolute screaming pineapple air strike
let's see a g-force sensor says mr.
protocol that would be kind of cool
because then you can know if your
pineapple got rustled if you know if
it's a longer yeah somebody finds it
cool RM tech RF / you should be very
very careful when you do that Oh GPS
would be another great one because you'd
be able to tell say if you were doing an
engagement for you your municipal
Transit Authority you could put it on
one of the buses or trains or whatever
have you with their permission only and
using GPS you would have an idea of what
train it's on yep absolutely you could
have a whole mesh of them in that case
Ramesh in the traditional sense of Wi-Fi
but like you I can totally see being
able to see on the back end yeah I mean
we will talk about a much more later on
and it'll be a whole whole different
segments but um that's that will just
leave you get up to your bill there's
actually really a lot of good stuff in
here people are talking about NFC and
just other really nifty things that I
having a lot about hey what's up
moms what are you doing okay all right
yeah that's cool so let's see Oh unseen
speakers Foxtrot wants to put speakers
on it so we can scare people actually I
want to skinny on this on you every time
you get up on my face for a second okay
so that I expression just that that's my
answer to that it's like putting out no
I want to be a good food every time you
get a every time technically we can run
the x window system this is true
technically you can plug a display link
in there in a USB mouse and keyboard
yeah let's not a bitch i'm off for every
client that connects at a conference
yeah they'll be yeah every time it says
Frank pots as drink yeah so every time
every time it makes a sound we drink ok
all right let's see you want to continue
with these or we got to be yeahh yeahh
shall we should we continue a bit then
we answer some more questions we've got
Poland team or to go through is your
real quick micro hex wants to know in
regards to the batteries can they charge
just charged at the same time the ones
in the black cases know the ones in the
blue cases yes that's not the best way
to know he's asking like a solar cell
yeah right yeah uh I would say that's
not recommended no yeah uh what else at
the moment I'm limited to us specific
you will get to that in a sec yes okay
so so maybe let's talk about those
software than you what we got it all
here look at that hotness I'm so sorry
but that just makes me so lonely we
changed a few things number one there is
no more basic auth because that's ugly
and not always the best thing to use so
we've got we've got a proper you know
login screen now it looks kind of pretty
but yeah but it but basically protects
your interface and your your files and
we can like talk about auto protection
all day long and that kind of stuff but
basically we've managed to to have you
log in with the root user which our
users on the system which multi-user
supports coming at a later point but you
can basically uh access yeah i'm just
gonna plug it in so i can log in if
still get the yeah yes sorry which is
awesome too because if you're actually
in the interface yes and you lose
connection with your pineapple you
reconnect to it just pops up a logger
interface though on top of what you're
doing so sorry so then no refresher in
the back yeah so we moved away from from
basic off because we didn't like it
we've we've kind of critter fide a few
things which will show in a bit so maybe
well while the pineapples booting up
should we should we cover something else
and then sure okay o dudududu foxtrot
let's say no some some common questions
or people that people have yeah we do
have some common questions here in fact
this one kind of rooted goes into what
whip was saying he says at the moment
we're limited to you a specific shipping
in the US when the products get to
Europe we have to rely on our country
standard shipping carrier we have more
options UPS FedEx etc so yes the way
that the it's called EMS where the
global shipping system works is that
your nations you know nation run
shipping here in the United States
called the united states postal service
in England it's called Royal Mail in
candidates also royal now this
interesting and they deliver it on the
backs of Moses that's what they do wow
so what the way that works is ok cool so
usps in the States ships it over to you
know Europe it gets to like London or
whatever and then boom it becomes a
responsibility of the Royal Mail yeah
and then suddenly all those cool
tracking features aren't as useful yeah
uh it's a very inexpensive way to go
however it turns out actually because of
the you know negotiated rates that we
have with you yes in many cases in fact
to most nations in the Europe ups now is
finally cheaper than usps which is kind
of a huge deal because that was not an
easy thing to negotiate but it's like
half that of what it would be standard
UPS oh yes we do offer UPS in addition
to usps we could look at fedex and DHL
the problems is if we put all of our
volume into one carrier that one carrier
can give us the best deals and the fact
that what fifty percent off right now is
huge so i wouldn't want to you know make
that any less as far as getting into the
EU the website excuse me would you be
able time website for people in live in
europe your ups in hyrum mg sorry can
you repeat I think he's asking to add
eps to the website for ordering but we
have absolutely on there it's on the
check out in the drop-down Jerry totally
show up it'll show up as UPS expedited
and we offer it for every nation in fact
a lot of nations we don't offer usps
because we've you know had bad
experiences with them and you know
packages just historically get lost in
your like you know what not even worth
it um as far as you know the EU working
with a brokerage agency already found a
shipping facility that we can move our
stuff into Europe actually specifically
in London so warehouse in London the
nice thing about that is it allows us to
drop ship our stuff from the factory
straight into the warehouse and then
from there it can get to you
which means that the shipping is a lot
less expensive what it means on our end
and I'm not going to bore you with any
gory details but there's the option of
either getting a trade ID and an eor I
and filling out your CIA DEA and filling
out your quarterly vac v80 stuff or you
incorporate hak5 ltd in the UK it's but
it doesn't matter because either way
everything ends up going a DPP or duty
or delivered duty paid which still means
that there will still be that whatever
it is 10 15 pound vat there's nothing I
can do to get that away that's just how
governments are however the shipping
will be substantially less I feel like
and that process has started and it's
only a matter of time however as I
mentioned there's a lot of bureaucracy
involved just as we learned putting
customer where there's a lot of
bureaucracy involved all right so is the
interface yes I see something back
I just have to rerun the wp5 script
mm-hmm so is the guys that's like a
similar still honey it's on the side
yeah absolutely all right so I've
apple.com / wp5 SH and then just refresh
the page alright so we're back at the
login screen so if you wanna again
you'll see the UI looks pretty much the
same um we've got a few different things
um this time around I don't know what
version this is you don't have
subversion we're supposed to show off no
I don't this is a dissolute that is my
dev lot good flash player you wanna
flash the latest when you want to know
okay yeah the this does it at least have
now it doesn't even have the logout
thing so this is actually kind of an old
version all right sorry about that guys
um so so I guess we have a few other
questions yes the sticker totally
optional if you want it to be even more
discreet yeah um so maybe how maybe shin
from rotting son wants to know we can
get more gifts of seb from the outtake
reel yeah so uh um I'm about to get beat
by I I have this really great video of
Darren though I think I need to turn to
a gif and publish as i see you can i can
pay cash okay everyone we want everyone
been to teach me how to dougie com yeah
ah sorry yeah so uh so yeah microphone
support that's a weird one while we wait
for this to boot up mr. protocol is
pointing out a USB mic oh you know what
actually that would become useful
because then recorders belong to it and
then record it to micro SD now I'm sure
there's a less expensive solution
however then you could stream it over to
another we're suddenly you plant this in
the office on your pet test right in the
board you can also a friend and then
boom it's streaming app it's not going
over a typical bug frequency where you
have to be near bike go over 3g what one
black other videos black I think I also
complained of webcams too but I mean
it's likely el legal problems of
wiretapping or black screen of death yep
can you guys still here as though yeah
we shall hear he says black series okay
what okay um I can talk through and
continue to talk through things though
even for not visible um another oh okay
um yeah go ahead
who you guys here today you guys
and we're back maybe sip it yeah it said
Darren you're back let's see you
rejoined yeah I think it actually killed
the YouTube stream I'm not sure okay
that's not good well then it must just
been a hangout um hiccup but yes case
that seems to be fine so yeah the fun of
life it's all good yes indeed I'm to
wrap up here soon so let's just try this
smear that rtd rock gasps as I let's do
that okay so so what if other people
said a power V that why is it not there
uh it means price it's bigger um that
that's it we don't passive p 0 e deal
with it yeah I'd only effect we could
definitely put likewise XYZ not on there
right we could and then it would be
massive exactly so we're not we're not
going to do that no expensive people ask
him to build their own uh we we did we
we did one of you you wouldn't be able
to for the cost that we absolutely
retail and was there's really it's
because there's nothing else out there
and because I mean trust me if we could
have just picked something off the shelf
it would have been saving nine months of
headache oh my god movie however there
wasn't and it was really a fun learning
experience and now we're uh oh am how
crazy is that or I guess where the odm
in our factories um I can never get
those victim correct either way either
way yeah it was awesome to do that
unfortunately due to the licenses that
we have to do with theros and all those
other fun people in order to get those
chips it's not open hardware I don't
think any previous pineapple has ever
been or ever could be for said licensing
reasons again it's kind of young start
dealing with these giant multinationals
that make a very funky ICS but that's
just
the name of the game so yeah that's but
that's that's the case and and the nice
and what we strive to do throughout all
of that though is still maintain that
same price point and then I can't tell
you how like even with all of the
ridiculous amounts of more cost there as
the ability to do that is huge for us
yeah absolutely yeah so do we do we have
wet it oh yeah we're good oh yeah there
we go okay so we actually see what what
has happened um it's kind of we were on
my old and busted pineapple and now we
just log in and boom the interface
changes there we go it looks a bit
different you'll notice there's a cute
little pineapple exit sign of course for
the log address you've got refresh
refresh like what you call them refresh
buttons yeah so I can actually click
this and it will spin here and tell us
if that note it's found we can find out
if there's any updates to our future the
system ones though yeah so we wanted to
make it easy because people kept missing
a system infusion updates like the bar
one and then people kept complaining why
the bar didn't work properly update the
bar and the work you know but so so this
kind of like puts out there but easier I
kind of want to show off the maybe the
network the new network tile sure let's
go in multan lie at work and we can
already even before we go in there we
can see here that we have w on google +
0 &amp;amp; 1 are enabled
I think we lost you again yep I'll be
back yeah we're back so work on the
client mode tab yeah so you'll you'll
notice that I don't know if we can show
all these ideas and being one of these
yeah they're there whatever yeah so no
I'm just saying showing oh sure yeah we
can show yeah so good so 50 maybe shut
up itself um it can connect to itself
look I'll connect to this network and
and a lot yeah I will do it'll do it
that's um yeah so uh so I don't know
it's already it's an easy way to like
for example now it's all associates
whatever that is is selected and you can
you see that now is prompting you for a
key um so you can type something in hate
connect and it'll you know right yeah I
point out that you're already connected
auto no loopback like having connect to
itself with the other card and we like
make a block for that you could you
could just write it doesn't do
automatically however you can make it do
that there might be reasons why you
would want to for testing like we did
yeah well that's why it's available
great signal strength to when you
connect yourself yeah absolutely oh yeah
we can actually see you're connected to
the local area network here you've got
you know your IP there we can tell
you're you know what network you're on
and the channels and the rates and all
of those other things which is great
because go back to network info we see
it's actually your default route yeah
that's a really clean Internet yeah so
do this ethernet cable that's actually
contains just for you to connect to
right now you right connect with Wi-Fi
and you have internet with yourself yeah
exactly in fact if I just look at the IP
address that it has right here the fact
that it is it's 17 to 16 42 1 however
you fear on the local area network that
it's connected to its 10 7331 200 so if
you do that on you know your phone
because you're on the same network here
you'll have access to which is kind of
awesome then you would need an ethernet
cable at all so yeah in fact this is you
know you've saved this and now every
time you boot this up gonna reconnect
the dissolve boat absolutely yeah so so
what else have we done um what else is
new on the SS h is new auto estate in
fact auto ssh is a testament to the fact
that
uh the the framework for writing fusions
was set up correctly because it's been
really long time since I've written in
infusion I got really rusty and I picked
it right back up in no time and I did
this in like a night and it was super
simple and what I love now is that we
have you know things like empty and
expect and and we're actually switched
from drop bear as to open society yes so
what just great now I can you know
generate a key real quick there and see
it'll take us yeah it takes a minute to
generate a key it's actually quite a bit
from there we go and so now I have my
key and then I can even add a known
hosts here so if I'm like root at 66 2
23 21 for that I don't remember I think
it will Falacci you know add to your
known hosts file you would also awesome
because it does that automatically you
don't have to SSH into the pineapple and
then do it out from the absolute yeah
you can also manage your authorized keys
so if i want to ssh into this without
having to enter in a password or just
you justyou piled in there you just
paste it in here down the other machine
in fact even transferring your public
key you can actually replace the
authorized key file on your remote
server just by giving it the host the
username and the password and it
automates the process of copying that
sssh republic key and sshe over to the
server and putting that authorized key
file in dot slash a safe trip so so say
so so these are kind of features that
are like okay well you know we make use
of the second radio they H well it's an
improvement to the old one it it's not a
new feature how about you go to the
config interface and show us the dip
switches alright so configuration boot
modes that's aight there we go so you
can actually see that we've got these
are the dip switch configurations that
you've got access to so uh the first and
the last one those pins they're always
in the up position for user mode so the
only the middle three count and as you
can see there one is up 0 is down and
whatever combination you put in there
like you can put a command in there any
command up
touch test or uh you know um or I'm tech
or f star a slash slash oh now I'm done
offers a risk all three downs it's gonna
watch your device yo an empty do a
system like that yeah absolutely so so
it does that um we actually make use of
one of these which is why down down up
is not available and then up this
factory reset exactly that's factory
reset so before you press that little
button at the bottom of the pineapple
when it was booted up now you flip those
white switches and you put up the device
and it will actually assist on Theresa
it's great because then you real aughh
in you're like hey everything is grand
just remember to flip that sounds like
there yeah um something else important
kind of is is to say that obviously
we've not as you can see it's still the
three-point Oh web UI that you know on
the mark for Eve no it's not called one
point 0 point 0 for the mark five
because we want to restart with the
first one um we've we've added a few
usability things if you reset your
device or formatting your SD card for
example if you if you go to resources it
just we've tried to make it prettier
easier to see that something's going on
you know we added robbers and so on and
so forth um give me the format yeah sure
go ahead format your SD card it'll be
erased spinny spinny so does you know
and it'll do this the whole thing it
even sets up your swap space yea high
sets of swap space formats it checks for
and such websites that does take a while
so its bigger see card in there right
now I believe that is that a 32 gig it
might be yeah I'm stuff anyway so um a
lot of work a lot of refinements for
usability because yes that's the focus
in addition to you know some advanced
attacks yeah um yeah um yeah good so
we've got some more common questions and
in a bit i'll flip back to IRC and and
see but we got a question about
metasploit on the pineapple yes
technically possible is that really what
we designed it for not all because for
that it doesn't have enough power could
we have designed some other runs
metasploit of course yes i would have
gone full out you would have been like
okay willful kalyana or
about time I guess still back to back
track right ya know so so we um we could
have but why didn't we well it wouldn't
be ninety nine dollars not knowing you
know you can get a pen test Dropbox for
over a thousand dollars easy I like that
the space that we operate in in the what
ahead our core values have been about
the you know performance and the and the
usability but it's always been about
price point to and actually if anything
you look at the mark one at 160 it's
only ever come down for the standard
package and so yes you could technically
put and we're not going to stop you I
mean you've got PHP and Python bash on
there but you can yeah so we you can
exactly Ruby you can install pearl
there's a lot of fun opportunities that
that even opens up but we consider this
a pen test pivot box the focus here is
that we have enough network interfaces
hear that you're able to deploy it where
you want to be and we all have our
backtrack machine our cali machine or a
blue box whatever our flavors we've got
our machine with our tools with our
attacks what we really do is you know
get to it and then from it branch out
into the news hour I'm sure you're gonna
do a segment on this at some point yes
in fact I've talked to Rafael a maje
about Armitage you know retorted runs on
here we've got you know python we can do
amazing stuff in that so it's it's
geared towards pivoting and not
necessarily running all of your exploits
off of here you know there's there's
some mex place that makes sense to run
here and there's some that just get I
don't yeah yeah absolutely I'm sorry
flashing and and the first boot radio we
did have a question about the radio
output the best that I can explain here
is that as hella eirp and that it is
unlocked and sense that it is it will go
as high as the ship is designed to go
within the limits of the FCC and so or
if you're not in the US not the FCC but
whatever your regulatory domain is we'll
leave it at that um we take a question
about a trade-in program and I feel like
it's important to note like if you guys
on the Hangout you guys know hak5 is
totally supported one hundred percent by
the hack shop we are a small outfit in
fact for the five hak5 are in
and then all of our friends that kind of
come together to make all this happen I
mean Colleen's filling in here for Paul
right now T being uh we're just you know
friends trying to make you know live the
dream and and make this happen and I
feel like as much as I you know love
like would want to just give everyone
one for free if I could this is still
what supports the show yeah and we're
going to do what we can to know backport
you know the some new features as
applicable to the older hardware where
we casually but we're small and we're
not at the point where we could offer I
don't even think Apple of offices in
trade-in program I know now so so so so
speaking of the mark for though it's not
like we're gonna discontinue working on
it completely obviously the development
for it will not be nearly as fast as it
has been for the mark five and you'll
notice that in the past months after
through point O came out we haven't been
doing too much development on the market
for because we were too busy working on
the mark five and we just got no rest
from that however we what we have an
abandon the mark four and we really are
not planning on stopping development so
we we will still update the user
interface we will still update and like
the system infusions and then maybe
you'll see back ports or you will see
backwards about the features from the
mark five that work on the mark four
possibly even that work on the mark for
with the second radio if you play an
over USB however if it doesn't work
because you have power issues or because
you know your setup isn't right that's
the downside on these things so some
features are designed for the mark five
and those will obviously not be
backported you won't see dip switches
you won't see what give the SAP come on
you can't do that in software kysela so
it's not and though remember you could
like hold down button for different
amounts of time that's replaced in this
sense by you but the whole usability of
it is different um now we are continuing
with within you i and i want to say you
I because you'll see much less this
upgrades coming out so much less
binaries that you reflash it'll be more
through the usual which is what we were
doing with three point 0 anyway we're
heading that direction already or three
point on the mark for and this this new
interface um but it is really something
we we're still focusing on
and and we're not just letting you down
okay a couple more questions we gotta
power through this to not hold Colleen
out too much okay cool so uh openvpn
absolutely we're focusing on tunneling
in fact look forward to forthcoming
video series on tutorials on usage I've
already made some great headway with s
shuttle which I've talked about at the
past on hak5 it's an amazing python
script again we have that now to be able
to quickly and easily tunnel all of your
traffic over an ssh tunnel but make it
look like you know just like any other
VPN type interface same thing with
openvpn same things with you know ssl
tunnel s tunnel p tunnel sure ping ping
tunneling ya VES tunnel https tunnel
there we've got a lot of the stuff
movement activities are already in the
open wrt repository so you're already it
was well HTTP p tunnel s tunnel a self
or all there so if you're familiar with
working with those there's nothing to
say that whether or not there is an
infusion for it yet that's what's
beautiful about this is we can even make
those things easier and that's what
we're all about so yeah absolutely what
else Oh as far as which kind of goes in
with you know the pivoting we have
another question here from youtube says
what if i want to connect the pineapple
to Wi-Fi that has a captive portal login
system two things about captain portals
really fun if you didn't notice a couple
months back doing a captive portal from
the pineapple which is awesome to notice
that some new devices automatically open
up captive portals from the pineapple
for us which is a fantastic avenue for
exploits however it's a good point if
the pineapple can host two captive
portal great with the pineapple connects
so that's actually not a problem because
the pineapple uses not and you just
because as i agree though from the
pineapple oh you don't um what it's not
so basically you get your pineapple to
connect so let's check to the access
point now it'll be stay connects to the
access point and you just won't have
internet on this that captive portal
link has been clicked right it's all you
need to do is grab a phone or your
machine connect a news
connect to your pineapple and try to
browse the internet the site from the
router will pop up you say except an
Italian you do I'm sorry said I'm like
I'm sitting here thinking like oh yeah
we could totally figure something out
where you know a web interface front-end
two links or maybe we firefox on it yeah
yeah you were doing wandering I way over
thought that as well as in same boat
with you yeah yeah that's the hacker
yeah and even if even if some cap
portals are resistant to that for
whatever reason or don't want to play
without there's always things we can do
to automate this you can say if you know
that it has a captive portal will make
sure that you know the pineapple does
this for you and submits two forms for
you yeah that's pretty cool somebody
wants to know about stress fracture
what's to know about tango mode well
changa mud was all about bringing two
pineapples together because they both
have awesome radios yeah pineapple has
two awesome videos however that is not
to say that what's better than two walls
and radios for or awesome rates i'm not
going to tell you not to do this this is
this this is just this looks ridiculous
and we've we've worked we've worked
around that a little bit and we've uh
it's actually really easy all you like
to do static this to 1726 942 to and
then plug it to thur net into the other
ones ethernet and then Bob's your uncle
what it also doesn't rule out is
attaching if you have a mark for
attaching your mark forward to it yeah
in fact more for a companion if we back
to avoid the network tile however then
the network confusion the updates that
from the new mark five we put that onto
the mark for now you've got a very easy
or even if you use just the infusion
from whistle master y Wi-Fi manager
turns the mark for into a marvelous one
written elastically yeah connect to the
other why find that shares it out over
Ethernet so just plug this Ethernet into
there and boom you're marked for just
enhanced remark five and now you've got
both radios to do fun the various stuff
sure so um I think the last thing
software-wise on my and I'd like to
mention is we stuff we've got coming in
the future and um I mean we've done a
lot for development purposes so now
we've got Python which is a huge thing
we've got
b5 which again is a huge difference
being a Jewess five yeah yeah sorry
subjugate five yeah we can do a lot more
with it Python obviously is going to be
some lot of module developers
interesting so people want to write or
developers for the panel are interested
so people would like to write apps and
Python or apps and whatever and they
want it to interface with the network
sorry with you with your web interface
now at the moment that's not really the
user to do it the user interface
requires PHP files now what we're
working on right now is a command line
interface basically for the entire
pineapple which controls everything from
Arnold karma to executing commands over
the network and so on so so we've got
this commands gonna be totally modulus
and binding with the within you you I
it's going to let module developers
basic they ship their modules or their
infusion sorry their infusions with
binaries and these binaries will
modularly actually be included in the
CLI and so every time you had a tool you
add a tool to to also the pineapple
absolutely absolutely yeah so it's not
just that it appears in your web
interface there are also appears in the
command line so you can run commands for
over ssh or over when we release over
the network so you can you know peeing
on a cert port or tell it to do certain
things over certain port and it will act
on that and it'll be able to call
infusions not only the things we write
but also the things other people like
and will release more info on that when
it's when it's ready right doctor
decides the process but it's it's
absolutely opens up possibilities for a
lot of command and control and gives a
standardized way for that command and
control we've seen the cool things
happening on Android or with SMS but
this kind of offers like so this is this
will give you exactly this will give you
your your base for all of this and this
will allow you to you know use on any
device you want to write automations
first and whatever you you would like um
it also enables us to kind of you know
play around with other tools a little
bit we're finding more things into it
for example we've been having a few
reports about karma not being so great
lately because devices have changed you
want maybe mention that I mean it's a
cat-and-mouse game and what happens is
the landscape changes in a factory if
the landscape is changing it only
emphasizes the fact that the pineapple
well you know was successful and popular
and that's great and will continue to be
because it this is the way that
works like game of chess is a game Pat
mouse we've got some new tricks up our
sleeves we do it we're working on so we
don't want to talk about them
specifically today and give that all of
that out right at this moment however
there's ways to make karma more
aggressive there were spaces to give
karma Dharma yes ways to you know just
exactly yeah as low and the worse I ran
over your dogma ok so right we're here
with packet analyzers and with all of
the latest and greatest hardware taking
looks yes everything and patient now it
all boils down to that simple you know
engine it dis ingenuity jeff is that
were an absolutely it's a lie yeah right
a little either gets your connection
going so the the thing is people people
you know very i meant about the subject
and saying that the mark for now doesn't
do what it's meant to do some of these
features can be back ported to the mark
for that we're working on some of these
features will require second interface
and some of these features will just not
be able to run on the Mach 4 just
because they've space wise and and they
just they won't run we want we will not
back toward them we will maybe supply
tools so you can but we won't now saying
that though i think the main thing to
take away from this is where we're
working on that way we've got more
things we know what we're doing agrees
about exactly know what we're doing
we've got things that were working right
now we're not going to talk about it yet
because i guess we just gave a nod mouse
and we we're we're trying to catch right
now so um yeah um and that's that's just
how the landscape is you know this
that's the world of hacker dumb you know
you breaking things you get break and
fix and break and fixed and so you know
on our next break there will be a fix
and then after that there's the other
thing and then there will be out of the
break exactly so that's that's pretty
much where we're going exactly that's
that's how always work cool let's see oh
there any more questions from that I now
saw our lights on 27 or 33 27 27 cool
you want 33 she could probably installed
33 no problem way a 27 yeah
and so I mean the the core of it is the
core of it sorry pineapple jokes is to
just you know take all of these awesome
tools you know and then we've only
started scratched surface on all of the
tools that we can put on here and then
bring them to a very accessible and
affordable way and now that we have all
of this it's we're really seeing the
power we're only scratching the surface
of the power that we've now facilitated
and we're going to get into discussions
here soon about you know updates to to
karma as well as the hardware and
software updates that will be doing or
development edits who are the hardware
stuff you know and feel free to start
acting just be very very very very very
careful because it is not gpio um and
yeah i'm looking forward to we've only
even begun does it start garnering
feedback I mean even the first units
like have only made their way to
people's homes and so yeah yeah the
first thing tomorrow make today I think
or yesterday today yeah so and so we're
going to keep continuing to receive
feedback we're definitely still in a
heavy damn cycle right now as well as
you know putting together I know on my
end i'm putting together some
educational video series on instructions
on how to make really cool stuff there
also be a development blog and a look at
our blog on a Wi-Fi pineapple calm so
there's a lot there's a very very bright
future for the pineapple we're going to
do more of these as we kicked it off
with 30 and now you can see what we we
had asked you know hoping for since 30
and so yeah it's taken a while but we're
so happy to be here and at the same time
thinking like oh my god we made it
except except we made it to the starting
line yeah yeah it's very fun to be
starting again and it's so great to see
everybody that's shown up in IRC and
that's been you know tweeting us and
getting on the livestream doesn't mean
so much orms we wouldn't be able to do
any of this without you guys this is
your community and we are humbled to be
able to serve you and excited to be able
to make it in that next step into the
realm of actually putting together crazy
stuff in obedience can't tell you how
proud um so yeah I guess I guess that
should drop it
up and just whip once to see me an IRC
more so yeah he needs to sit up I need a
second I I need another model and he
need to do it get a display leg adapter
and get some more monitors because yeah
I missed having the third monitor
dedicated to IRC so all right i'll see
you there whip all right so anyway with
all of that said as we remind you on
hak5 i guess i'm darren I'm sub this is
