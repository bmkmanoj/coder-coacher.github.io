by Toyota Shannon Mohr's from CES 2014
here at the xi3 booth with David David
hi how are you doing today doing
fantastic Shannon it's great to see you
again great to see you too thank you for
you know remembering me it's so exciting
who could not remember Shannon Morse
you're so sweet now I know you guys have
come out with the piston you've also
come out with some really interesting
new relationships with your product tell
me a little bit about what's going on
this year well we're at CES again this
is your four and it's bigger better and
better than we've ever been we're three
times larger as far as booth space we've
still got the rotating cubes up top but
one of the things we're doing is really
starting to focus in some vertical
markets so for example right now we're
in what we call the patient room of the
future we've partnered with one of the
leading healthcare providers in the
world that uses technology to help
provide better care to patients the
company is called Intermountain
Healthcare headquartered in salt lake
city utah and they wanted to be able to
find out could they help reduce costs
could they have patients spend less time
in hospitals if they applied technology
in new and exciting ways and they ended
up choosing us so we're really excited
about that that's so cool I love hearing
that you're trying to make health care a
little bit easier and a little bit less
of a cost cuz right now it's you know
well health care is crazy at the moment
in the US tell me a little bit about
what product are you putting it to these
hospitals and how does that work so
we're showing a couple of new products
here of course we're showing I'm talking
about our modular computers our newest
modular computer is this one it's called
the x7 a modular computer it's the big
brother of the first one came out with
quad core eight gigs of RAM up to a
terabyte of solid-state storage a lots
of i/o including triple monitor support
native out of the box you can use this
as a server in fact that is what
Intermountain Healthcare is doing they
call it a near edge server
this is being deployed right now is part
of a telemedicine pilot program in
emergency rooms and intensive care units
throughout their entire network can you
compute data that's gathered from your
pulse oximeters from your your heart
rate from your level of carbon monoxide
in the air or whatever but the idea is
can you gather a lot data and crunch the
data right there in the room the answer
is yes by using something this small in
this timing and also using this you you
mentioned earlier about the the patient
being able to control things as well
well exactly I mean it's one thing to
say okay we're going to put a computer
in hospital rooms and many hospitals do
that but what you also want to do is you
want to make this stay as enjoyable as
possible for the patient so when the
medical professional leaves we then
allow the patient to take over and
control the TV watch whatever shows you
want surf the web access any of their
content on the web control the lights
the heating the air conditioning the
curtains call a nurse say hey I need
another blanket all that could be done
medical professional comes back in they
take over and yet all the data is secure
because it's all HIPAA compliant that's
so cool I love the fact that you're
making it easier and making me a happier
patient when I'm at the hospital now
there's also something else that I'm
really interested in as a gamer the
piston so we of course a year ago
announced that we had into a partnership
with vow that they had invested in us
and we were coming out with the piston
console piston was a really tiny box
designed specifically for gaming
unfortunately we've kind of merged away
diverged if you will from valve because
they've decided they're going to focus
on Linux and we're not opposed to Linux
because at the end of the day our boxes
run Linux better not be no of course not
I mean we ship standard out the door
with a linux load but when you talk
about games in the computer world most
of them are written on what OS on
Windows the hugest part of the
marketplace is some windows today so
we've decided that we're going to
continue down the path of
windows we will continue to evaluate
Linux we love valve wheel of steam when
you launch piston and Rui the first
thing that pops up is team right and so
why would you want to abandon 50-plus
million gamers the answer is of course
not we don't want to do that and we also
think we have the hottest looking steam
box out there right the smallest one the
most powerful but for now we've diverged
and we wish them well I love this the
piston it's one of my favorite things
ever I want to play some games out there
yes absolutely I totally want to play
some games out there is there anything
else that's going on with xi3 this area
that you would like to mention well for
your viewers they should know that we
have launched the version 10 of the
piston you I as part of that we have
begun to optimize games specifically to
play on piston so we have 50 titles
today newest latest greatest most
graphically challenging games so xi3
settings if you will first time you
download it recognizes that it's been
loaded for the first time sets it to
this but freedom we give you the freedom
to say you know what I don't care if the
girls hair is whispering in the wind I
want to turn down the hair so turn down
the hair turn up the anti-aliasing do
whatever you want it's you should be
able to do that and you should be change
that so we give you that every game in
game settings you don't get that on
consoles you do get that on PCs but a
lot of gamers don't know how to do that
so we'll walk you through that entire
process and we have more things coming
down the road so that's so exciting now
how how much does it cost and where can
people find out more information so
certainly you can always go to X I 3.com
the letter X letter I the number three
dot com board / piston and pricing is
still 999 it is what it is but remember
it's also under the hood a computer so
you can actually load your most favorite
and most used games you can jump out to
the web you can also load your most
favorite applications that you need you
want to control the lighting in your
home the HVAC you can load that software
onto piston but you can also listen
itunes go watch netflix go to hulu watch
TV locally through like an Aereo all of
that on piston it's a computer it's an
awesome computer it's under 2 pounds I'm
totally gonna take one home with me bat
no I'm just kidding David thank you so
