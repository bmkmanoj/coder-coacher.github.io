you persistent backtrack for installs
and a new user land image for the Zipit
and snow all that and more on this
episode
this episode of high five is brought to
you by dice go to assist express and
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain hey what's up
welcome to hack five my name is darren
kitchen don't be so enthusiastic I you
get so mad at me every time where I'm
what hey you're welcome to act 5 i'm
darren kitchen supposed to say you're
Shannon Morse that's Shannon Morse we've
got an excellent show for you guys this
week so confused that's okay it'sit's
senioritis this happens at the end of
every season we've got one episode left
of season six which will be next week
coming to you from shmoocon so if you're
going to be in DC or the conference I'll
not give me a moment you really need one
yeah bars and tone mmm and we're back
and we're going to shmoocon this year it
is next weekend and we're going to be
interviewing people and watching people
will talk about stuff on a stage and a
guy shooting stuff out of a gun and
Schmidt calls t-shirt yeah yeah man
t-shirts anyway yeah the hits the funds
of contents that we love to cover over
here on the Easterners and there are
many brain so aren't your that was good
getting kicked out of harness into him
Paul would tell you all pretty in a
church yeah that ended up burning down a
little burning cars gonna be there dude
of course are you kidding me that's
gonna be awesome to see 80 so if you
guys are down for the show then I
sometimes will be around there next
weekend ah it's been a great week it's
been a busy week it seems like it's been
forever since we've been on set so let's
do up hak5 classic before we go up to
shmoocon and then end this season and
then reconfigure the entire show so this
is what it looks like is what it looks
like yeah it's snowing outside it's a
snow day so we're kind of like have some
beers and toxin tech but we do have some
awesome stuff we're basically doing a
lot of linux stuff we iron that i am
getting into the new backtrack for
having a little fun playing with that
getting persistent as to all set up for
you guys so that you don't lose your
documents and you've got users images
lends an easier OS for yours of it I'm
going to need you to flash my even
coolers
that when you're done with that because
I did you break it no no but I'm saying
the old user land and that was tight
yeah this one's a lot easier so yeah I
like uz and we have a lot of links that
people have sent us that if I will share
with you some cool stuff going on the
first one about dual booting Android and
Windows Mobile and it makes me so sad
because I'm rocking the droid and this
isn't gonna help me any actually does it
only work on the HTC nexus thingy well
no that's the thing is they've taken the
operating system from like you know HTC
the the whatever the latest hottest new
droid phone right and then they ported
it so that you can dual boot a windows
mobile phone so here on one of those sad
sad sad phones that runs when it is
mobile there's potential there that you
might be able to dual boot into a cooler
operating system okay that's cool it's
just like I do on my laptop dual booting
windows 7 and Ubuntu she pronounced that
right just for you but I'm switching to
mint I knew hi so I just thought that
was really cool and it's a shame that I
can't dual boot android and windows
mobile but then again at the same time
London going backwards why would you
want to so congrats to you window folks
did you see the video that Chris from
the guy from the geek group did the geek
group made a video about basically a
pineapple saying well it fry and they
fried a whole bunch of volts into this
pineapple and I'll let you guys watch
the video to find out if it lives or not
yeah we're not talking about one of
these guys are talking about the actual
fruit it's pretty cool because they
specifically said like thanks to you
guys over at hak5 for you know helping
us create the show I've been talking to
them for a while they've been getting
their school together and they've
started a really cool show so you know
we support them so cheers to you guys
congrats zapping up anyway well yeah
woohoo that's what's up uh well onto a
different drink you hear about the decaf
yeah it's back up or is it back down now
it's back up now it is yes okay I went
to their website and I saw this there's
another letter that they got I don't
know yes they got out and back on the
20th
you know what we give up and reporting
this will leave that sometimes at that
stuff and and just to say that it may or
may not be up it was back at last time
we checked yes who cares it's it's up
and stand there's a mirror as I found
out today when I was looking for Aussie
man we talked about it on episode 60
8609 with move ex it's the way that you
can tunnel your ssh traffic through dns
so that if you're like a t mobile
hotspot or all those hot spots that
don't let you get on the internet
without paying but they still at you
translate zns so i put out a tweet and
then of course everything is on
archive.org or on room 362 calm so
thanks mobic for the hook-up on the
mirror and hopefully dan kaminsky will
get his website back up soon hmm yes yay
oh wow what else here so much Oh
bypassing security on yeah so apparently
you can bypass we hey where's your droid
do you want to try it yeah 3 here yeah
and I already tried it and it works it
says yeah so basically what you can do
is um there's a lock interface on the on
the droid where you have to like hit a
couple of different dots and then it
lets you into the actual interface but
if you don't know the password you're
not supposed to get in well if somebody
is calling you if somebody is calling
you on this droid you can actually hit
is it the back button right you can hit
the back button which will take you to
the actual home screen with all the menu
items on it so you can go to any like
web cookies you can check the person's
email all sorts of stuff so it's a very
open privacy problem and was a windows
that basically said or Android that said
something like we're working on this
issue and yeah I'm out of Italy attached
but this has been you know like almost
every phone has had this I don't yeah
the security of our handsets has really
taken to the same scrutiny that our
desktops are and it's just a matter of
time before that industry matures but I
just thought it was interesting that no
not even the you know the linux-based
Android is impervious to these security
flaws that are baked right in we've seen
this again and again you did it on the
center yeah my centro same pro
I did it years and years ago on a
windows mobile device so yeah so it
seems like they haven't figured that out
yet for the years and years that mobile
smart phones have been out so except for
the blackberry surprisingly has some of
the best at least you know that I've
seen they've got some really good
enterprise stuff and as far as like
encryption is concerned but then again
we got to get Jason Applebaum on the
show because he'll probably come on and
then I'm very very sad when it comes to
cell phone security you'll teach us
about security yeah I'm sure make sure
he gets those NDA's I'll care to come on
and talk to us about fun stuff I agree
so what was it oh right so the other two
that I just threw in the a block I
flashlights yeah although I think we're
running along on the a block so why
don't we just push those back to the DJ
tease trivia and GTFO so anyway we would
like to thank our awesome new sponsor
dice and we'll be back in just a bit

maybe wow them with a zip it OS rewrite
and there's a lot more than just jobs
get tips tools and advice to give your
tech career a boost at dice calm as you
guys know when it comes to the fun
packet sniffing in black hat stuff my
favorite operating system is backtrack
they make it really easy because they
bake a lot of the great tools right in
and you don't have to worry about
dependencies and different versions
stuff everything is just pretty much in
there and years in the making the fourth
version is out not in beta not in
pre-final whatever it's backtrack for
finalized out and I'm excited to be
using it there's a couple of big changes
I mean first off if you're new to the
whole backtrack 4 it's based on debian
now so right there and it's also you
know KDE so there you go if that's your
flavor and it's actually moved out of
the remote exploit realm and is now on
its own at backtrack linux
org so that's where you should go and
get yourself a copy in fact if you just
want to futz around they have a vmdk all
ready for you to go if virtualization is
your thing you could pop it right open
in vmware player or you know the
superior VirtualBox stuff but anyway
regardless one of the things that I
wanted to talk about today was getting
set up with backtrack for final on your
laptop that's what I do I think is just
make yourself a USB key and one of the
things that I learned early on playing
with backtrack three I think on my eeepc
was persistence and at the time it
wasn't a big deal what I'm basically
mean by persistence is when I would boot
up backtrack three on USB or an SD card
on my eeepc I had a fresh copy which was
great because at the time I was still
kind of like new to that stuff and if I
fucked anything up I didn't need to
really worry about it too much because
I'd reboot and you know all of my
changes were gone and everything's good
except for the fact that well when I did
start making changes that were important
like my configurations for kids MIT and
stuff like that yeah they weren't there
anymore and that was kind of a pain to
have to edit comp files every series
every single time so that's what
persistence is all about setting up a
USB key so that every time you restart
it's it's pretty much installed onto the
USB key it's like having another hard
drive in your machine we don't have to
worry about grub or anything like that
it's you know removed it's on its own
separate media so we're going to go
ahead and set up backtrack for on its
own individual media now I already have
my asus here booted up off of this USB
key here this is just to gig nothing
fancy but that's what I just gone ahead
and downloaded the ISO from backtrack
linux and then i use unetbootin which
we've talked about many times in the
past great great windows tool makes real
simple to just go ahead and burn if you
will that iso onto that USB key so now
I'm booted into backtrack here whoops
there we go yet still boot it into
backtrack and what I'm going to do is
I'm now going to install backtrack
instead of on my hard drive and install
it on to this here eight gigabyte SD
card and yeah you're going to need an
eight gigabyte or larger SD card or USB
key I went into this thinking
SD card perfect i got plenty of these
laying around eight gigabytes or larger
and then i found out later that i'm
going to need a bios tweak before this
bad boy is going to boot off them so in
the meantime I have a little USB caddy
to basically turn this into a thumb
drive regardless the process is the same
and really all we need to do from here
now that we have backtracked for booted
into booted off the USB key is to plug
this little devil in and we're going to
partition him and format them and set
them up to copy over the operating
system and set them up so that every
time we boot our files don't change so
let's go ahead and get started and then
go ahead and plug this guy in here and
the first thing we're going to need to
do is find out where where he is on our
system he's going to be you know / day /
/ sdb SDC we're not really sure so let's
go ahead and issue d message and let's
grep for that for and this is a pretty
generic way to do this either HD or SD
because it's going to be depending on
what your drive is and we can see here
that it is SDC are 8 gigabyte key so
let's go ahead and begin with F desk
fdisk is what's going to allow us to go
ahead and partition this guy we're going
to need to set aside a partition for the
operating system and then for swap so
let's go ahead and run fdisk / dev / SD
c now right off the bat there's already
a partition on here from its previous
use let's go ahead and mix that so
anything on here you might want to back
up beforehand so let's issue d and our
partition number and now let's go ahead
and create a new partition so n and this
will be the first partition it's a
primary partition and partition number
one and we're just going to go ahead and
with the defaults there for the first
cylinder and what we want to do here is
I'm just going to go ahead and make it
like 2500 mags 2.5 gigs whatever I just
make it two gigs a larger you're just
going to be way easier that way we're
going to need to create a second
partition and this will be for the
remaining space
on the drive so now that we have both of
our partitions created we need to go
ahead and set what their file system
type is going to be so we're going to
hit t4 type and we're going to choose
one and we're going to set that and we
can actually hit L here and see all of
the different types we're going to
choose be the hex code for basically the
windows 95 to vfat the fat32 that's
going to make easy to get this all set
up we're going to choose the second
partition and we're going to choose 83
for that and that's going to be our
Linux partition and now we just need to
set one of these two active we need to
set the first partition so a for active
one and finally w to write this all ok
so we've written our partitions let's go
ahead and get the formatting going on so
MK f sv fat will create a file system of
v fat or fat32 if you wish and that's
going to be in select dev / SD c 1 we're
going to do the same thing for ext3 so
mkfs ext3 and for the persistence we're
going to have to set B 4096 and tack
capital L of Casper RW and that's going
to be same place / dev / SD c 2 and
finally all we need to do now is copy
everything over from our running
instance of backtrack 4 here to our new
drive with our new partitions and our
new file systems and then we'll make it
bootable so let's first go ahead and
mount this guy here so we're going to
make a new directory in / MNT and we're
going to call it s dc1 and then we're
going to mount it with mount command and
it's in dev SDC one and we're going to
point it to mount sec one just like we
just created excellent and now we just
CD over to there
now we just need to copy everything over
and rather than do a CP or anything like
that we're just going to use our sink
it's going to make it easy going to make
it recursive going to make sure that
everything copies over from the media
that were booted on right now to our new
partition so we're going to issue our
sink tak are for recursive and it's /
media / at cd-rom 0 and I'm pretty sure
that's going to be the same across the
board for all you guys star dot or /
star and that is going to be everything
in cd-rom 0 tak r is going to say all
the folders all of those holders
subfolders everything and it would just
say dot which basically means the
current working directory as opposed to
dot dot which would be previous and then
crazy stuff but dot is where we are as
we can see we're in / mount / SDC one
okay so while that copies great so
almost done here we just need to set up
Rob and that's going to allow this to be
bootable so let's go ahead and install
grub by grub in stall tactic no floppy
floppy and then a root directory and
that's going to be mount SD c 1 and
that's in / dev / as you see okay so now
we have grub installed we can go ahead
and verify that and there's one last
thing that we need to do to make this
persistent we actually need to edit the
grub menu you may remember this from the
multipath stuff real simple let's just
go ahead and fire up nano and let's take
a look at the file in / mount / SCC one
boot grub and its menu dot list so what
we're going to need to do is change the
default you'll see that we can just
change this to 4 and come down 0 1 2 3 4
this is already menus already built for
us and there's already a persistent one
in there so we're going to say always
use that we can choose it by default but
we're going to say make this to the fall
so if we don't press any keys when it's
booting up it's going to go into that
we're also going to append to the
of it vga equals 0 x 3 17 now this is
going to set X window to go ahead and
use a resolution pretty generic one of
1024 x 768 I noticed that when i
actually do mine on my netbook did I
call it a netbook 13 inches in a netbook
oh my gosh feels weird to say lapped on
my laptop here it's going to go ahead
and boot it's actually done really well
about detecting the proper resolution
and it goes right into 1366 x 768 for me
so but just go ahead and pop that in
there and save the file 12x yes and
there you go we've set it up all we need
to do now log out and reboot so there
you go you're booted into your very own
persistent backtrack for installation
and from here you can customize it to
your liking you don't like the wallpaper
cool change it next time you reboot it's
going to be there I tried this out with
installing software I record i installed
gtk record my desktop which is actually
one of the applications are used to do
some of the screen recording when it
comes to doing some linux stuff on hak5
and work great rebooted boom there it
was so anyway I encourage you all to go
ahead if you're not going to do this on
a bootable just at least go ahead and
grab yourself the vmdk try it out in
virtualization great little operating
systems toy around with awesome awesome
community so much support so check it
out now at backtrack linux org and then
send your questions be back in this
thing like that that you would like us
to see play around here with code name
own sauce or pone sauce if you will to
feedback at hak5 org
Judy I'd love to drive the three hours
to Annapolis but I think we can fix your
kitten screensaver from here I just need
you to open port 5900 on your firewall
firewall got little boxy thing the
internet goes through look at me just a
year ago what a noob trying to do tech
support the hard way little did I know
go to assist Express is the easiest way
to control another person's computer
online provide instant support to your
friends family members and clients and
amaze them by getting it all done over
the internet you lower your support
costs you lower your travel time and you
can even provide support remotely even
when your client isn't physically at
their computer brought to you by citrix
all go to assist express sessions are
encrypted 128-bit end to end and you get
twenty four seven support so try go to
assist express free for 30 days and you
go to go to assist calm / hak5 don't be
a noob like me I wanted to bring best to
zip it for today's episode for a couple
of reasons one of those reasons being
I've gotten a lot of questions about how
to actually get into like a WPA
encrypted wireless network as well as
this new average user user land
interface by root Nexus nice yeah so
they're pretty cool okay so right off to
that we have been getting a lot of
questions about the DA stuff I think
real quick I should feel the question
though that a lot of people have been
asking about as far as like aircrack and
kismet are concerned and it the device
turns out shares the same hardware as
the iphone hmm far as the wireless radio
is concerned and unfortunately there is
no open firmware for it that's why in
like the first unlocking part you
actually have to copy the firmware off
the device to put it back on because
those bin files there are the firmware
they're not open and sadly that means
that we can't do any packet injection or
I'm something that was so well huh yeah
do other fun cool stuff like games and
whatnot but yeah we get on the wireless
running into a little game boy kind of
yeah okay so first of all the wireless
network so say you don't have WEP in
your house which you shall not sure
you have WPA or wpa2 encrypted so the
first thing you want to do is go ahead
and boot up your zip it and this is for
if you're using Elias of 20 seconds
Elias of 27 the new one by root Nexus is
really really easy you want to turn on
the wireless radio in this little guy so
you're going to go into the terminal and
type in ifconfig f1 eth1 up you p then
you want to create a wpa supplicant
configuration and this would be a file
for your router and your password which
you are creating you type in wpa
underscore passphrase hack 64 which is
our WPA and then our pass phrase which
is tekzilla kind of an inside joke and
then you make one of those alligators
greater than yeah you mean a walk
greater than the one that eats the
bigger number Waka alligator more fun to
call it a waka no alligator pac-man why
can't work on work but I like alligator
that's what I learned when I was in like
second grade alligator so the operator
that tells it to put standard in into a
file yeah so you create that and then
you create the name of your new wpa file
which for us is going to be hack 6w PA
or whatever or whatever you want now you
want to connect to you your WP a network
using the configuration file that you've
just created so you type in wpa
underscore supplicant tak DW EXT tak I a
th1 taxi and then the name hack 6w wpa
attack B as in boy so now you want to
get your IP address from your router's
dhcp by typing in d h client space eth1
and enter and you're done there you go
yeah actually so it's actually pretty
easy once you find the step somewhere
yeah all right well then it's like what
the heck I'm still analogous to 27 New
Zealand image and all I've done is just
copied all of those commands into like a
shell file or shl script so that
whenever I boot up it just kind of
automatically do it so I'm going to type
it all out but yeah okay all right
now for the fun part we're going to load
up at the average user user land image
now if you're following your like what
are you talking about these are the
forty dollars if it's that you can find
at like tarjay or online twenty fifty
bucks and then you know pack them really
really easily in shannon's gun into
great detail about getting set up on
that so for that reference was it 516
615 x rated there but ya episode 6 15 is
is what's going to let you know how to
get going on these bad boys and
basically up to the point where we need
to go over to the new image yes so once
you get all of the information out of
episode 6 15 up to the part where I
start talking about phys disc great
that's where I'm gonna start you out
today okay alright so what I need to do
right now is take out this SD card and
plug it into my computer I'm going to
open the phys disc right GUI and then I
want to right click on whatever the SD
card is and that one for my computer
upstairs it was like LOL drive i think
so i right click on that and i choose
booth min i think which means open and
then I choose image Laden no clue play
image I don't know I don't know Laden
I'm leaving I don't know I have no idea
my sermons and then you choose the use
the average user image file which I just
stuck on my desktop to make it really
easy after that it takes about 10
minutes for at it to actually upload the
file onto the SD card and then it will
say ok we're done so you pop out the SD
card and you plug it into your zip it
and it starts loading up the new years
Elaine image and it's very slick looking
I got a guy right off the bat like you
don't have to login as root urine yeah
it has nice little icons all over the
place a very small text at the bottom
and the mouse was a little tricky at
first I didn't know how to use it what
you end up having to do is click on the
options button and then move around
using the d-pad so do you have to hold
that because before you had to hold down
the smiley face ball yeah you don't have
to hold anything down on this one you
just click on the options button and
then you move
around with the d-pad by holding down
either right or left up or down and then
if you want to use arrow keys again and
then you click the options button again
and it turns off the mouse okay nice
little mouse toggle yes so if i'm using
the IRC which this does come with IRC oh
the original intended purpose of the
Zipit to do messaging those for example
in that to scroll the way down to like
the IRC client you know read what's
whatever its new and then I click on the
options button again to turn off the
mouse then I can start typing in
whatever I want press ENTER now you're
saying that this is much easier to
connect so so we've gone over if you're
doing the alias of 27 how you would get
on a WPA protecting upriver supplicants
and duw ax and stuff how do you do this
with the new guy with this one you just
click on the connect button there's a
little icon on it that comes already
pre-installed click on that and it walks
you through all of the steps excellent
so what are some of the other features
though once you're online what have you
found that you really like I'm here
alright well one of my favorite things
is that it comes with some games already
installed on it has SNES or Game Boy and
NES features on it okay so it comes with
Super Mario and some Wario games as well
as Tetris it comes to some roms yes oh
cool i guess that's legit sure yeah just
make sure you own the game before you go
and download the image so comes with
those there's a calculator on it there's
the Wi-Fi connectivity there's also the
Internet Explorer Internet Explorer
there's the internet on here that
evening it comes with mobile bookmarks
to like Twitter and MySpace and Facebook
and stuff already on it so you just
click on those and it takes you straight
to the mobile websites for those and
it's pretty good browsing from what I've
been able to tell so far yeah well it
doesn't do flash but then again neither
does the ipad so WTF and it's about 10
times cheaper yeah yeah that is yeah
it's just how do you think I got Jeter
in there well um yeah so there's no III
player okay which is very nice there's
mplayer on here as well so you can play
videos yeah root Nexus has gone through
I'll just I don't know I just got to
give mad props to him for actually going
ahead and customizing it like a lot of
us were doing individually and then just
putting out his user image there and
that's what open source is all about
it's like hey I figured this out and
just share this and then it's just going
to get better and better from here and
it's great that all of these things look
superb even on a 320 x 240 display so
there's also an ssh and to telnet client
on this which is very nice and there's
an ftp and telnet server so that you can
move files back and forth from your ftp
on your computer yes so you can move
around Europe you know your mp3s or your
robes or whatever yeah I mean you know
sure tell them it's not really that
secure but we talked about this before I
mean it's it's lightweight and it's easy
and typing on that keyboard can be a
pain sometimes or whatever when you're
doing a little bit of dev go ahead and
just tellin it right in I love that idea

before we wrap up the show we have
gotten a ton of great questions about
video I don't it's kind of interesting
like finally fielding some of these
video questions because go figure we do
it on the show I mean that's true well
seeing that you edit the show 24 7i
guess you would be the perfect person
ask that about it's it's kind of fun
because I swear the show like half the
fun really is just hacking
production it really i think it is a key
because there's some creative stuff that
we've come up with first and foremost
the question we got a question about
about some of the video lights that we
use on the road yes and you know when we
were at CES these guys we're just doing
great for us now you can pick up some
expensive LED panels and stuff like that
that I mean they start at like two
hundred and fifty dollar or 4 30 bucks
and I can't get it off its mount you can
pick up a couple of these each so these
right here are SEMA SL 20 LX liked here
another one of these guys and what's
cool about them is that Ellen have cut
them on that you can shine them and your
friends eyes ah come on about the fun
thing is that uh that these guys oh yeah
that is right yeah fish like breasts up
here these guys stack so I can go ahead
and take one on these little mounting
guys and they're like you can find these
on sale for like 30 bucks and they've
got their own internal battery they have
a charge of 45 minutes to an hour and
they are super bright I think they claim
600 lumens I'm not really sure but you
know line just send me about anyone with
these so picked up a couple of these for
CES we've used them in the past before
and now we've got a whole bunch of them
that we're going to be doing like three
camera lighting with and they work great
I like them with one small little caveat
okay with that as inexpensive as these
guys are there's the problem that the
original SL SL 20 LX will not allow you
to run the light while it is being
powered it's weird you plug in the power
cord and you can no longer run the light
then they created the new version the
international version it's the LX I same
price you find these online real cheap
and basically they fix that problem and
then it comes with the different plugs
to use them in the UK or wherever else
travels may take you which is good stuff
yeah that's good for you it sure is so
I'm going to be using these and the
little caveat other than that though
is that sure they're not the same
quality is a two hundred fifty dollar
light panel but we're on a hacker budget
and so we just picked up these and I'm
going to be using here is got a roll of
my Roscoe minus green here this is is
that pink well yeah it's why do you have
pink film well it's called gel why are
you making a porn I'm not making a porn
if I were you'd have to go to paypal to
figure it out anyway oh well yeah this
know this right here is is pink gel that
basically removes the green tint that
this may cast I mean it's very subtle so
it's not like oh you know if I take this
uh just come off the back it's really
not that dangerous but oh yeah it makes
your shirt less green Kiwi so it's an
official TV shirt no joke whatever so
anyway that's that's what I'm doing I'm
gonna be modding these pretty easy
unscrew I'm you populate you cut that
film out and it pops right here on the
frosted plastic so you get you know
whatever we just white balance 25.2
anyway so who cares but that's what I'm
going to be doing as far as lighting is
concerned we got another question follow
up about these creatives I have two of
the new creatives the third gens as well
as I've got a codec on order for the zi8
they're kind of hard to find call
because I was being asked what am i what
am I going to do about because i'm
recording an episode in the UK i'm a
motorcycle on tour and all that stuff
and it's like are you really gonna bring
like one of these big-ass cameras and
yeah no no the other thing is though
Frank 5 we need three cameras to do all
that fun switching stuff so I figured I
would just go ahead and give these guys
the the proper test and we'll we'll see
we'll see how it works out I'll probably
have more video blogs in the future
about how i'm using these but I figure
between these two for you know person
one in person to camp and then this is
the first generation vado HD for the
center if I'm going to be using this one
a lot because I rented a CB f500 little
honda motorbike and then i got a lot of
questions about this before about how i
actually do this i basically just take
my helmet take this this is
all covered in velcro on the front and
back and then on the inside of my helmet
it's covered in velcro as well so when I
pop this bad boy on I don't know how
you're welcome you're going to be it
will see that but yeah you see this just
pokes right out just over the top and it
doesn't obstruct my vision at all
because it's so low this is actually
where there was a breath guard that it
took out that you don't even need if
you've got the I've got a visor that has
some I don't know some weird coating
that makes it not fog up but yeah it
doesn't obstruct my vision pops right
over the top fits me perfectly and it's
all just held in Oh with velcro so if
doesn't it give you like a little bit of
rug burn on your nose it turned out it
was so i put the soft side of the velcro
on the camera and then I put the hard
side of the velcro on my helmet as well
as few other different places
strategically like I'm on my you know
like I'm my motorcycle jackets are you
like haha I just weird places it was
great i could like mounted anywhere but
whenever I put my helmet on I wasn't
used to there being this stuff here and
I was scraping my nose oh ok that's what
that was very good well we do have a
couple of other things we wanted to tell
you about first off is our Twitter its
