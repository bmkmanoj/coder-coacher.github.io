break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I'm checking out
your feedback now I get tons of feedback
about recent hack tips and here are a
few of the ones that are my favorite
tips and tricks from you guys first off
is Robert he says I like to use jobs
tagged el and kill tech 9 pin number to
kill any stock jobs so what he's saying
is job's tak el and he presses that or
he can use kill tack 9 and then put in
the pit which would be something like 1
2 3 4 at the end to kill any of those
stop jobs very interesting thank you
Robert next up is Brian he says you can
spice up your history with very nifty
time stamping and I did test this out so
I know it works first off you open up
your terminal like I did in mine and
second you type in sudo G edit / ATC so
G in it / ATC / - dot bash are see and
enter put in your password prosciutto
and this is gonna bring up G edit with
the bash RC file let me make this a
little bit bigger for you guys alright
so in here you want to look for that SOS
H opt tak S Line so I'm just gonna ctrl
F for that tack s
so it's right there and right underneath
that he says to type in export hist for
history time format equals percentage a
percentage B percentage D tack
percentage our space and then end it
with your quotation marks once you're
done with that you go ahead and save it
like normal and don't change the name
close and you want to go ahead and
reopen your terminal so I'm gonna close
this terminal reopen it new session and
let me make this a little bit bigger now
if you type in history instead of the
really boring old one that only has
about two columns now you have actual
history files with timestamps and the
date Wednesday February 20th and then
the date the time p.m. and G edit you
can see I've been using lots and lots of
G at it basically lately very very
interesting thank you so much for
setting that in now next up is Nick he
said I got tired of having to type in CD
tak LS CD / blah blah blah so I made an
alias to change into my last directory
made to do this you can type in latest :
alias
latest equals
and then quotation marks CD Groff a LS
tak LTR pipe tail tack N 1 pipe a wk '
print dollar sign 9 close that
apostrophe grav a and quotation marks
nick also says be very careful with your
quotation marks your apostrophe and the
grave a as they are all different now
this is so nice because you can just
type latest and it goes into your last
directory that you were working in
that's pretty cool I like it a lot and I
tested this one as well now next up is
mr. protocol he wrote in with this tip
know what device a disk is mapped to
four LS HW with LS HW it needs to be run
that as root or sudo to display accurate
results
LS HW is a small tool tool to extract
detailed information on the hardware
configuration of the machine it can
report exact memory configs firmware
versions mainboard configs cpu versions
and speed the cache configs bus speeds
there's so much that it can do for you
and it works on DMI capable x86 or ia-64
systems and on some PowerPC machines for
example the Power Mac g4 is known to
work now just running sudo LS HW shows a
whole lot of information and kind of a
sort of messy layout now for his
purposes he only needed to see storage
devices so he says I can pick the
correct one to manage now this command
gives a more manageable set of data you
can type in sudo LS HW TAC short this
displays a nice view of the hardware and
system specs to take this even further
you can type in sudo LS HW tech short
and pipe that to grep dev and this is
going to show an even shorter list of
devices and a quick description now what
do you think of these tips which ones

would you change make sure to email me
