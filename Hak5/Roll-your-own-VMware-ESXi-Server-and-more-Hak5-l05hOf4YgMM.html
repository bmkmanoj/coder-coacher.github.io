of virtual server that's more fun than a
barrel of strippers
Darren builds a motorcycle camera mount
for under five dollars in I review a bit
amongst the most fantastical free and
open-source video editing app all that
and more on this episode of hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by frost brewed Coors Light the world's
most refreshing beer prototype the
sandbox style action game developed by
radical entertainment and stated for
release on June 9th and Squarespace and
viewers like you
hello welcome to hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen i'm man less time and I'm
Shannon Morse and on this episode we
were bringing to you some awesome
virtualization some little bit of mod
seduction and this have open source
goodies yep anything else it's fun sex
it's like everything of everything whoo
yeah I can't believe the response we've
gotten from the VMware Simon's and the
virtual stuff and it's absolutely blow
my mind how people are like I run the
same setup and I'm glad I'm doing it
right nobody ever said that wrong man
don't be all you know architect of this
stuff I've just been doing it for a
little while so if it works for you
great you know you don't have to follow
best practices lord knows I don't right
now but we'll get into level or is there
a wrong way to do it yeah probably my
way okay the way I've currently got it
the way I've been telling you guys it's
from all right you don't know the
redundancy right right
yeah but that's just because you guys
need like another hundred grand we have
it yeah I mean I have a back-up plan so
in place and it works and we've tested
disaster recovery takes you know less
than three hours which i think is great
considering most assess recovery plans
take about 24 hour turnaround sure but
that's not going to help you in your
HIPAA or something right we have all
three on set oh yeah hey welcome back
snobs fighting in time for efforts of
they're chillin it's all good turn I
miss you earth but yesterday mr. Hale
yeah yesterday when the episode gave
about me um I missed you too Matt I
visit I've been having fun we're close
now you know when I went to go and buy
this stuff they actually had to get a
manager if you do an override because I
was only buying a foot or something of
this tubing and they thought it was
making a bomb and they had to go and get
it like approved or whatever and then
the cashier was like I don't know why
they do this because we were making a
bomb you do have a three foot anyway and
I was like well oh wow that's thanks
that's a hardware store we shopping when
I built one I that's what I use three
plastic so I use plastic your your team
leader he's gonna get us working like
bad chemicals new system I'm playing
with the ulcerous bad chemicals though
specifically this is scheduled for E and
I don't know you'd be following like the
Twitter stuff I know it's just bad but
you'll probably hurt yourself put it
down is that the same thing as PVC uh I
get that away from yes it's the little
stuff it's not that the Box stuff but um
lately on like on my Twitter and my blog
and stuff I've been talking about a
little interesting project that I
thought I would get into and that is
mounting a camera to my motorcycle
because it didn't work out mounting it
onto the cat as we all know but the
motorcycle I can supposedly tame so why
not put a camera on it and share the
good rides with you guys on my blog like
speeded up towards music I'm bored and
as you can see here on my blog I
actually had some photos going on of
what I ended up doing this is sent to me
from a good friend on Twitter and his
name escapes me at the moment but it's
right here so he's not really a good
friend who's just a friend
he's in the chat right now his name is
surrender ah I just took me my college I
names at the end and I had a bunch of
numbers and I can't get behind handles
with numbers speak um handles so that
you built this okay so it goes on a
handlebar right now this is based off of
a Instructables to build a $5.00
motorcycle mount there are alternatives
commercially if you want to spend some
money I actually found like a $300 like
a helmet cam mount Deeley where do we
this one yeah the one that basically
looks like a action sports camera you
know it kind of looks like an eye sight
though right like just with a little bit
more stuff too it's got lasers and it
records SD cam I think it's all cool and
stuff and it's got the mounts to go on
your handlebars or wherever you want to
put it right but it's like three hundred
dollars just for a single cam and if you
go to the next hive got looking at this
one if you just take a look at that or
one of these it'll just you know mount
on your handlebars and this one's only
like 130 dollars I wanted to go with
something a little bit more versatile
because I don't know how I'm going to be
shooting on like a flip camera like you
know
cheap solid-state Delia clips have the
things with screw holes yeah they do
yeah so this is something that's going
to work with anything that has a
standard mounting hole for a camera so
like anything from an SLR to a HD camera
that we shoot onto a little flip Deeley
or just you're you know do you okay so
instead of buying something specifically
meant for yeah because I wanted
something reusable cuz if I if I'm going
some more core something you've already
got laying around exactly I don't want
to spend a whole lot of money yeah yeah
so the idea is a mount so the first
thing I did was a try to Joe be a
Gorillapod awesome little things should
be in everybody any every any even
amateur photographers photo bag because
they just wrap her on anything no but it
was just too shaky right so I ended up
going with this and this is what the the
finished product looks like here and
it's basically a piece of PVC tea pipe
that is cut in half right and then we
just put a cap on the end of it and this
is nothing more than a quarter inch
screw it gets a machine machine bolt
with a twenty thread right and that's
the same thread that you would find on
the bottom of your camera I popped a
couple of of these locking washers onto
the end of there and I mean they're
super simple to buy you just need a
couple of parts that have got
what should I should I not do it right
now
I don't trust you all right well with
power tools how's this been over this
how is this I'll let you I'll let you
drill and here I've already got this one
done right so we're gonna drill hole in
here we're actually sending this one to
our other revision3 biker buddy
Serafina she's she was talking about one
as well here we go
and where'd those players go and
actually I redid this one because I want
to go with a little bit more as you can
see with the half-inch when you use the
extra this is one inch screw and once
you get the locking washers which are
very important up in there it doesn't
really give you a whole lot you're
supposed to use this with a wingnut
right you pop a little wing net on this
job' and now you can like tighten on the
bottom right but you only get like two
threads and it's not holding that a
whole bunch so I'm gonna go ahead and
pop a washer on this dealy you know pop
that on the inside that's not gonna fit
fit last time when I had a half-inch
anyway point being you tighten this down
we're gonna say that's tight tight
enough for television right and then
that's my new catchphrase it's time for
television and then pop out our wing nut
and say like this was already you know
just cut that dilly in half the other
thing that I'd like to do is take a
little bit of this tubing here and this
is just three quarter-inch internal one
inch outside diameter vinyl tubing and
this is good because when you pop it
inside it will not only reduce a little
bit of vibration but it will keep it a
lot tighter and then you secure all of
this hose clamps with these hose clamps
yes so you pop a hose clamp on there
these are great you just tighten them
down with a screwdriver on your
handlebars and essentially you have a
mount you know right between your gauges
I have some
a little test video I did it works okay
until I go into passing mode where I'm
going 55 and it well it looks like I'm
going like warp speed or something here
so hyperdrive is active yeah next week
though I've got some modifications I
want to do to the mod itself and some
software that we can talk about because
optical image stabilization on the
camera itself just isn't doing it new so
I'm going to try some different things
and play with some software that
supposedly does this using Nvidia's CUDA
so that should be kind of fun
we'd like CUDA yeah like I am yeah but
if you guys have some ideas cuz you know
there's I've been kicking around a whole
bunch yeah I've been looking at some
commercial solutions they're really
expensive so somebody in chat saying
that I went plaid nice reference to
space balls anyway I got a bunch of PVC
dust on me so I'm gonna cleaned up but
let's go ahead and it over to
Shannon see what's going on with this
wasteland party online Platt this one's

about it back to you thank you very much
Darren next up that has something that's
more interesting than a barrel of
strippers it's ESXi
alright guys so we are back in the hack
house and hack 5 headquarters in
Williamsburg and then once again I am
here to bring you virtualization last
time we talked about architect here on
sand and some of the solutions that you
can use for that a little bit later on
we're going to actually show you to
build one but right now we're actually
going to show you how to build a virtual
server that will fit in this bag
basically what I did is I had a little
extra hardware at the house as I'm sure
you all do this little machine here is a
shuttle that I built way back when I
used to be my primary PC also it's a
Pentium 4 3 gigahertz with hyper
threading and it has 2 gigs of ram and 2
500 gig hard drives in it there's a
couple critical things that you guys
need to check out and one of them is if
your hardware is even supported by ESXi
which is what we're gonna be using the
free version of the bare-metal
hypervisor that vmware provides for
starting out with virtualization and
things like that for you guys but
basically this is users experiences with
different hardware platforms whether
they be pre-built machines or just
designing your own we can see here that
this PowerEdge 4000 C has an Intel IC H
5 raid chipset in it and that it is
working so the nice thing about this
shuttle PC is it has an Intel IC h5 chip
inside of it so that's the actual RAID
controller that we're going to use very
basic raid functions however it will
suffice for getting ESX installed IC h5
if you actually create a raid structure
on the board ESX I still sees separate
drives so you might have to go with a
little bit higher
costing raid card if you're going to
need to do raid 5 and stuff like that
but I digress for our purposes we're
building virtual server that will fit in
a duffle bag here we go
so we've already downloaded the VMware
VI ESX I whatever you want to
call it vSphere blah we have to use
three point five because three point
five is still supported by 32-bit
platforms if you're going to use a
64-bit platform go ahead and download
4.0 but no the 4.0 will not run on
32-bit platforms okay moving on so we've
already got the ISO burned to the disk
we're going to go ahead and start the
machine now monitor is on that's a good
sign it's a little loud that's cool it's
in a bag so here we've got the the boot
process and we could see hyper thread
two gigs of RAM yay
and there's one more thing that I should
let you guys know about and that is make
sure that your if you're using SATA
disks make sure your RAID controller is
set up to use IDE enhanced or the raid
functionality of the onboard or raid
card whatever you guys are using
otherwise ESXi will not install it
requires a SATA raid or scuzzy or SAS
adapter to install itself - let's go
ahead and here we go we're going to do
the thin ESX installer and this is where
we are loading the VMware ISO image so
right now we are beginning the
installation of esxi 3.5 so far so good
right so we're going to go ahead hit
enter to install we're going to hit f11
to accept we're going to select disc 0
they're both the same 500 gig disks hit
enter and we have selected a disc that
contains at least one partition with
existing data we're going to hit enter
to continue and finally f11 to install
now as you can see we've got the
installation complete we're going to go
ahead and remove the installation media
right now as soon as that disk and enter
to reboot while it's doing that let's
give you a little background on what
ESXi is ESXi is meant to be a bare
minimum install to create a bare-metal
hypervisor without a whole lot of muss
and fuss so what it's meant for is
basically
any machine that is supported your rack
mount servers or you know even if you
have a whole crapload of you know power
edge or optiplex with you know raid
cards in them you could turn any machine
feasibly as long as it's in the hardware
compatibility list into a virtual server
now nice thing about ESXi is it's free
you have to register for license however
beyond that point you're free to use it
now it doesn't contain some of the nicer
features like vmotion and things like
that but it does contain I scuzzy
functionality so if you have a beast of
a machine you want to connect it up to
some honking disks you can do that
alright so as you can see here we've got
the ESXi server up and running what we
need to do is we need to set an initial
password it's got the DHCP address from
the the server so we're going to go
ahead and do is we're going to customize
the system this is make figuration
screen of ESXi this is it there is no
you know needing to go in nitty-gritty
it's running it's doing its thing it's
setup almost ready to go we're going to
configure a root password and it's going
to be connect 5 X 5 ok so now we can do
is actually browse over let's go ahead
and hit escape to log out so we see it's
a shuttle Inc FB 71 board with CPU of 3
gigahertz and 1010 o 55 so let's go over
there 1010 Oh 55 ok and we've get a
security error because it's a
self-generated certificate no problem
get the cert confirm the certificate
it's ok here's 3 I VMware ESX server
landing page this is what you're going
to need download we're going to download
the VMware infrastructure client some of
you may already have it you may not but
it's provided here just download it
right from this machine here and install
it I've already got it installed so
we're going to do is we're actually
gonna login to the Machine and this is
the same client that you're going to use
to configure virtual Center server
full-blown ESX implementations the same
stuff so it's going to be 10 10 o dot 55
root is the add user name and
then hack five should be the password
and we're going to select do not ignore
and then connecting and it should if we
did everything right which I'm thinking
it did it's going to load the main form
it's going to load the inventory of
course of which there is none however
boom here we go this is a full-blown
bare-metal hypervisor which is running
on a machine that fits in a duffel bag
you can literally take this anywhere in
a duffel bag and deploy virtual servers
at a remote location if you needed to
coming up in a series we're going to
show you how to actually create virtual
servers take physical to virtual servers
this is going a whole lot longer than I
had anticipated
as far as the series goes so I don't
know if you guys are getting sick of its
lemme know if you guys have any ideas
for you know what you want me to cover
just let me know I mean I do this stuff
every day so it's second nature to me
but there's something you guys want to
hear about or see shoot me an email mad
at hack 5 or or posted in the forum's
forums hack 5 org Shannon has an open
source video mixing utility thing AV MUX
I don't know it's craptacular name but
it's apparently a great product and then
later we're going to be ending the show
but first darren has trivia Darren
please help me last week's trivia
contest was map your network the most
creative one wins and I got to give it
up for Levy Durham who put together an
awesome diagram of his network that has
all run on a single cell phone that's
pretty high he's actually got it running
on a virtual machine Linux on top of
Windows Home Server and he's got the
stuff backing up to like time capsule
and Windows Home Server so really nifty
stuff thank you everybody who submitted
I saw some amazing networks you guys are
really geeky like man I thought the hack
house was like you know twisted pair up
but you guys have going on - so stick
around just a moment tell you about this

sandbox gameplay check out the radical
entertainments prototype it's stated for
release on June 9th for the Xbox 360 ps3
and Windows if you guys are interested
in filmmaking kind of like Darren is
over here you're probably using
something like I don't know Sony Vegas
what else is there Pro Final Cut you
know the me stuff if you're really into
multitrack editing and myself I'm not as
into filmmaking as Darren is that's why
he's our editor so I used this lovely
little flip that I just got in the mail
since I discovered this thing I was like
okay I need to find something to
actually edit all of my little
itty-bitty videos that I do on this
thing so I found this creative little
tool it's completely open-source and
it's called a vitamix avi avi D MUX avi
D max I'm not really sure to be to tell
you the truth either way let's get paid
to pronounce things right no we do not
it's a very very simple tool for pretty
much any user to figure out and it lets
you do everything from cutting you can
do filters you can put two different
clips together and you can create them
into like ipod format or DVD formats
lately up to you this is what I like
about this program it sounds pretty
simple I mean it is it is as has like a
core set of features but once you learn
those like four features it's pretty
much it right very much all you need to
know you just need to know like the four
different buttons on the program so so
what are those four different features I
want to take a look at well first thing
you have to do you got to drag over any
kind of video that you want press ok you
have your video bar down here where you
can run through it at the very rubbing
ya scrubbing see he knows all the all
the different definitions and things the
terms gosh is crazy
the thing about down here is that you
can clip you're moving into something
small so say you have some retarded
information at the beginning and at the
end you don't want that stuff so you're
going to clip it make an A and a B start
in a stop point so I'll make my start
point
yeah after that right after all the
bloopers or the mistakes as we call them
or like trying to start a segment but we
can't get it for the life of us yes yeah
so we set her a point yes and then I set
my B point there you go now I just have
these two parts right here okay
and I could save it like that if I want
or I could add another thing at the end
of it another one of your different
videos over here yes you could another
thing about a VI D MUX
if you want to call it that is this very
nifty tool called Auto so I'm I know I'm
going to put this on my iPod so I'm
immediately going to go over to iPod
mpeg-4 it's gonna ask me to choose the
different kind of format I'm saying 640
by 480 it's much better than 320 alright
press ok and over here it automatically
sets its mpeg-4 and it's AAC for the
audio and of course I can go into
configure mode and I can change it
around I can make this grayscale if I
wanted to or a cartoon mode only thing I
want to do stuff the bitrate yeah I
could boost the bitrate right here and
then when I save my file just save video
throw it on my desktop I'll call this my
test run dot what is this mp4 and safe
and of course it just takes a couple of
seconds to encode it
now I was taking a look at this program
earlier and the thing that I most liked
about it now I mean I'm going to use
something more serious but this is
actually a cool tool for even at the
serious filmmakers that have an entire
folder full of stuff that they need to
either transcode or crop or add a filter
to because it has filters and stuff
right you can yes no you could they do
this thing called add to jobless so you
can create a folder stick a whole bunch
of different files into one little
folder and then view your job list or
add more files to that same jobless and
save everything and you can render out
everything all at the same time so it
even gives you this choice to shut down
your computer after it's done so you
could leave this running over the night
right so when you wake up in the morning
you can start up your computer and you
got all of your files everybody's got a
thing I mean that's that's one of those
features that you know anybody that's
using the more high end stuff is going
to be used to is adding all the stuff to
the job queue and then run the entire
job queue at night right and come back
and have everything done of course your
regular home user the first thing
they're going to think is I got to do
every single wine one bite wine it's
gonna take forever
yeah it's nice too I mean even if it's
not going to be overnight just you know
get your editing done hit job cue go
make a sandwich and it also gives you
the choice to do a secondary track if
you want to add music over the top of it
reputation so much different kind of
file types over here or up at the audio
Auto part it doesn't have like a
timeline so it's not like your
traditional non lading or editor where
you can actually move around clips and
move around audio and stuff but for just
like splicing Clips together and
removing hearts adding an audio track
it's like I don't know hell I mean it's
more intuitive and Windows Movie Maker
so let's see my little test run right
here it's cross-platform
it is open source we like that stuff
your act 500 times VLC does well you can
see that it is grayscale so my grayscale
worked at least hahaha well anytime you
were messing with video codecs fun stuff
is sure to hell yeah one of the reasons
why I like this program is because I
can't play my flip videos in VLC with
sound the audio is just not there that's
cuz you have to play it on Windows Media
Player that's an equation with that
three communiques terrific s-- how do
you how do you know I always just called
terrific so I can use
a Vig MUX and transcode it to whatever
all what cool all right okay you throw
that together with a little bit of
virtualdub
and you've got a full solution for your
open source goodness if you guys have
other open source free applications you
guys like to use for video editing
definitely hit us up feedback a hack 5
that or Luke would love to hear what you
guys think and I am looking for a good
one yeah other than a vit MUX this one's
sweet but who knows there might be
something better or worse out there you
don't have it at one point I even had
like a free version of their pro app but
then they discontinued that's like gosh
I'll have a link to this website with
downloads and screenshots for you over
at snazzy calm man or show notes a heck
of a dory one other thing I wanted to
mention before we get going is and I
will probably do a segment on this or
some more details later but I was
reading some cool stuff coming out today
that actually is something that mobic
sand the hack 5 radio guys we're talking
about like over a year ago was the
possibility of of using steganography
with retransmissions of TCP data so you
guys know how to CP it works with where
if Shannon's the router right and I'm
going to tell Shannon you know that
Coors Light tastes very refreshing and
then and then Shannon goes over to Matt
says scores light refreshing she missed
