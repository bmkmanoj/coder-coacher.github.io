viewers like you
if you get value from this show and can
spare even a dollar please consider
contributing at Metasploit minute calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob fuller but you can call me Moo vics
today on Metasploit minute we're going
to be going into initial access now
jareno CMD I'm sorry I don't have the
correct pronunciation you wanted to know
how to how does out as a pen tester as a
red teamer get initial honest how does a
bad guy get initially well you go to the
receptionist and you say hello I would
like access to your network by the way I
have chocolate or ducky or go create or
that I have a document I need to print
okay fair enough fair enough
yes what are you some of your favorite
ways so I'm like we said in persistence
we're going to keep coming back to this
passwords are the hazards bane dollars
as passwords passwords are really way
that I get an initial access and and
you'd be surprised that like that's like
that's the majority of the waste
throughout my entire career that's
that's really how I got access find that
kind of surprising a but I understand
why you would go for passwords first in
that it is the weak link so you know
like yes you could try some elaborate
x-play remote code execution all that
stuff that might possibly set off alarms
right or just login with test tests that
an admin Tomcat Tomcat
so the initial examples that I have here
are Tomcat JBoss GlassFish and Jenkins
those are back-end servers that kind of
do a bunch of stuff so anyone familiar
with any kind of Java code yeah I'm
doing with Tomcat guys just on stuff
because it's just like oh you hate to
have to run all that stuff but they
insist via specific versions that your
stuff can go on and one accounting
server will only
run on the yeah if so and the great
thing is like it's built in to literally
load java classes right to load java
code so if you get to authenticate to it
you can just throw a Java file at it and
it goes tada
here's some code execution for you and
that's cross the board on Tomcat JBoss
Craster's then Jenkins Jenkins actually
is a a test server so it will run code
tests to make sure it compiles correctly
or does whatever it needs to correctly
and then spit out results well it has
this wonderful thing
slash script where you can say slash
script run this thing for me so if you
sort it you say well it's really useful
so the great thing is like there's a
Metasploit module for it where you just
say hey run you know give me an
interpreter session and it goes ok here
you go these are my super session there
are ways to get around it by securing it
but those are my four or five ways for
passwords for back-end servers
then we go into web dev and then web dev
is like this forgotten technology though
yeah because 1998 called man wants its
web tab share back right well it's still
there it works even in like Windows 10
you can still connect to a web dive
share and it's built-in right right so a
lot of people share boy do I need to say
anymore right
yeah but xampp I'm one of my favorite
projects it's great but earlier versions
1.73 and below have default passwords
for its web dev all automatically
enabled web dev location so you upload
PHP file run PHP file and wherever xampp
is installed with a out-of-date version
you get code execution oh that's
fantastic
it is and PHP meterpreter is awesome and
we've already added to really is and the
hop payload and love the hops yeah okay
and then finally Citrix so if you have a
Citrix end point and you have anyone and
it's
2-tier domain as everyone does puts you
know LDAP connected so that you can just
you know have users authenticate and
stuff and you have any bad users guess
what happens I load Citrix up and even
if the only application that I have is
notepad I open up notepad look go to
open run CMD it's just like kiosk
breaking right so if there are any
technologies you know to break out on a
kiosk right those are the same
techniques you're going to use for
Citrix right and then you get code
execution on the Citrix server oh that's
hot yeah so those are under my voice for
a password based code execution initial
access sure now the one that I think a
lot of people like initially think of is
well you know you learn the environment
you find out as much as you can about
the company and the way that they work
and then you craft a very like
specialized phishing campaign for that
organization your spearfishing does it
work right social engineer and you know
again just like the passwords people do
it because it's so successful and we've
heard numerous stories about the
statistics of how often it works and you
know it goes after the other weak link
you know if passwords are one of them
and as you're mentioning with defaults
that are sadly not turned off then the
people are the other one right you find
phishing to be yeah it's it's actually
not built in the Metasploit framework
itself but if you get pro Metasploit pro
or Metroid Express I think still has it
as well as I think cobalt strike had
some phishing sites like a caged Birds
in a varmint is kind of the social
engineering to acquit actually has you
know fishing as its main you know source
of Awesomeness but I find that now I'm
building my own fishing is actually
better because I can cater it to exactly
what that organization needs or or is
expecting so I'll build an HTML page and
do stuff like that
but there's really fun technologies
these days for doing fishiness um my
bread and butter back in the day was
Java applets now that Java applets are
kind of like the bane of browsers
existed right there like
or different those but we're layers of
like don't run this no idiot don't run
this and you just be click yes in your
own right so the new hotness and don't
tell anyone about this don't don't tell
what excited you're watching Metasploit
right but yes there that is the windows
click once stuff click once applications
so in Windows if you download Chrome
there's it your you're going to a
website it goes would you like to
install Chrome download Chrome and then
the little box as soon as you do it pops
up right loop I've seen it there's no
download that happened it just goes and
installs feels like ActiveX back in the
day for some reason what is that I don't
know that's a click once application
it's a dot application
so whenever internet store goes to the
Dada application it automatically loads
it oh that's so it's not very easy and
it's written in C sharp so all you do is
load up c-sharp and write some code and
that code does awesome things and public
publish the application and you're done
and weird signing or anything oh yes
Visual Studio does the signing for you
Oh perfect you so you sign the
application and you're done
so you do have the ability to export
shell code for c-sharp in in in mass
plate and we can go into that and narrow
episodes like yeah yeah because these
are we're already a couple of Metasploit
minutes into this minute right we're and
we're just talking about initial exes
and will actually go into the click one
stuff later and then finally I'm getting
away from fishing is obviously the
remote code execution and remote code
execution is great but literally of
maybe only use it three times and the
entirety of my career Wow
I mean but that's the thing though is
like that's the scary one where it's
like oh oh em gee RCE right
yeah there's execution for Windows
server it's like wow this is going to be
a bad day for everyone but it's not that
often it then it actually works like
that is actually useful well that seems
to be because it's detectable right
right everyone as soon like there are so
many vendors up is an interesting point
because you know typically you're told
like oh what you do is you scan the
network you know as passively as you
find an exploit finding that finder oh
look they're running and all
version of Apache and then right next
thing you know you pop the box
I'm never gonna happen it's it's not
what I mean
MSO 8 every night well I'm a so intro 67
is a special case right but if you go to
any training any training except for
ours later in July June you'll you'll
you'll get MSO into 16 or some other
exploit some other thing that this
because it's magic crap because when it
works it feels like magic because you're
just like I want access to that box
click boom I'm in speaking of access to
that box aren't you running HFS that
thing that we talked about back in Gibbs
in one see this is the reason you you
got me hooked on HFS and if you haven't
checked it out it is an amazing little
file system utility mu bik's is known
for his pendrive of awesome yeah so go
and check out the episode of hack 5 from
10 years ago in for for calling 3 or 4
and so I guess this would be an example
of why you shouldn't run ten-year-old
software mind you it's in a very limited
scope like this is a what I used to in a
jiffy copy a file rather than sneakernet
it well it's not ten-year-old software
anymore he's he's constantly about the
and doesn't source he's actually really
great when this exploit came out the
person who reported this exploit he
would talk to the guy who makes it
Roseto I apologize so if I'm butchering
your name but he got it fixed really
fast and was like oh oh this is awesome
so we're ok so you want to show us
because I every now and then to get a
file across network I run this yeah so
what this is doing is actually running a
scripting command that you can run on
those systems so you can actually tell
on HFS server to do certain things with
different scripts and it has a problem
where it has it uses a % 0 0 is at the
end of end of the command but it still
processes the rest of it ok so you put
that and then you put in the good stuff
after right so it actually uploads a VPS
file or Visual Basic see a visual basic
script blank on that and then runs the
visual basic script and I get a shell so
get UID I am DK
no decay and I can load me me cash we're
done here okay so I'll be updating my
software huh huh thank you for that
there actually you're good in the
Renault purses let me let me know in the
comments what you guys think cuz I'm
having a feeling that this guys is going
to go for that yeah either that or I
just toss it in the furnace there you go
that's not eco-friendly don't do that
now let us know what you would do if
movies popped your box you can email MSF
at hack 5 org or you can let us know in
the comments below we do read all of
those and like Rob said these episodes
come because you asked questions and so
if you have questions specific to
matters play and you want to see us
cover this or that let us know it really
drives the show yeah that there's
something else that drives the show huh
me yes yes patreon.com slash move X mu b
IX it really is awesome that season 5 is
completely supported by the patreon
other patrons that are the patreon
patreon patreon or patreon ORS I think
that's where these these might be
anyways the people that put a dollar
behind if you get some value from the
show and you want to give some value
back to continue its existence that is
epic and if you can't totally understand
you know you like it share it just
viewing it
your donation or the view counts epic it
keeps this going and we're just blessed
to be able to do this yeah I really
appreciate like the hack 5 crew
supporting this throughout five seasons
already yeah this is season 5 there we
guessing and you know what if you would
like to get even more hands-on with
Metasploit you're talking about this
come June yeah and so in June next nice
throw yeah so in June 26 that we're
going to be doing a pen testing with
hack 5 with all of it with us with so
good pack 5 to write here and sit on the
couch with us and have to pay a little
bit yes but but you get a little bit
with hack 5 and you get toys you get all
high five gear
in an epic ak5 hacker tactical satchel
and you get training from the people to
develop tools and you learn you know the
Wi-Fi auditing with the pineapple and
the social engineering with USB rubber
ducky and the Metasploit and some other
fun stuff that we have known so yeah
just I mention this because our this is
our very first one and so we want to
make a big deal about this because it's
going to be epic and we want to invite
you all out because it will never be at
this price again and it's kind of epic
that we can share this with you and open
up the hack house and let you in and
just dive deep for a couple of days on
the pen testing goodness so what you can
do is head over to hack 5 dot
training and see how you can get in on
pen testing with hack 5 yea alright so
that's it I'm moving and I'll be hacking
to the cows come home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
