brought to you by Intel's Core i7
processor find yours now at em wave com
Netflix square space and the musical
stylings of Paul Tobias
hey guys welcome to another episode of
hak5 this is your weekly dose of techno
lyst we have your gamers your hackers
and your IT ninjas I'm Shannon I'm
Darren I met I'm Chris and now that we
have been asked to you sign off in place
welcome guys we have an awesome show for
you guys we were doing a lot of fun
stuff I've got a interview a little bit
later in the show with Ashley shore to
talking about hackers are people to an
awesome documentary that i'm sure you
guys will be interested in Chris
Grayling's in the house we are talking
to him about public key encryption I
know Matt's got some interesting stuff
going on with drivers and sham you're
gonna be organizing mp3s out the wazoo
empty threes and fours all that fun
stuff whatever there you go music files
what's going on with you guys this week
um well Chris you're down here i am not
feeling too well know that well we'll
try and get you out of here is
responsible I'm sorry um I I'm stupid
busy um my buddy called me from
Cleveland yet last night and was like
dude man you gotta come up to Cleveland
and I'm hammered I remember you don't
like you're gonna get there by the time
this did your boyfriend don't tell you I
think he did oh oh so Jeff so Jeff woods
a house key if you're out there
everybody now knows that you're drunk
and more on you Shay so what about you
job oh just a lot of work Swamp the last
couple days yeah wait I'm glad it's the
weekend finally although I am I have my
little red phone over there oh yeah I
kind of you know bring Batman beds on
the Batman phone so you know might need
to go back to the Batcave but uh other
than that you know just living it up in
Richmond so it's good to living it up
while being sick while being six well no
I'm gonna wake up sick tomorrow I'm like
you know if you remember at the point
where I kind of know what's happening
and then I
I know that when I go to sleep it's all
over I kind of transform it I don't know
like honey yeah yeah so yeah you Darren
dude we have been getting a lot of great
feedback from the last episode sometimes
so I guess I'll first of all talk about
this bad boy if you've been watching hot
cows calm watching the live stream of us
doing our thing 24-7 like you guys say
big brother I still haven't seen the
show so I don't know what you mean but
we're gonna be voting Shannon off soon
so don't worry um if you've seen the
other foam missile let us know I have
any way totally hooked it up and and you
guys have been having a blast with it I
wanted to let you know what's going on
with the code for that talk to Jason
Applebaum you may know him on the
extreme as apple crisp and he's the
awesome coder behind the Java front and
back-end system makes this guy work
wanted to add a whole bunch of awesome
features want to put the source code out
there and have you guys kind of
contribute to this we're going to put
that off bye week because turns out
something about finals I don't know it's
been so long since I've been in school
but you know after thanksgiving and then
you got finals right before you go on
christmas break what's that ah good good
luck to all you guys with your finals so
we're putting that on hold so he can
basically comment up and clean up the
code because well we could put the
source out there right now you would
probably pull your hair out going what
the hell is a dollar sign or whatever it
is in Java it's probably about that long
and Java for a dollar sign but whatever
anyway yeah and it turns out everybody
likes unetbootin dude have you seen the
emails about unetbootin yeah yeah I got
a lot of feedback about unetbootin yeah
well uh way in particular was just like
do you see the thank you happy birthday
email that was so sweet because today I
might have been an invited in induced
coma I don't remember now you're totally
off the stuff get over it are you
talking about huh right right we don't
encourage any bad behavior here no just
happy so um basically unetbootin like we
said in the last episode ways to burn
isos to your USB Drive multiple ice hose
and
and he actually put together a
collection that he had of all of these
boot disks that he used to repair
computers and stuff all into one USB
Drive and that's awesome I wanted to
point you to room 360 to a friend move
Ock's you know he's got an awesome
article over here about a multiboot
security live CD that I think you might
all be interested in it's got everything
that you could possibly need including
backtrack three damn small linux it's
gotten knoppix it's got off crack it's
you know it's got all the security tools
so you need all burnt when you're sneaky
I mean you know it's the holiday season
so you can get a 32 gig but USB Drive
for like what like 40 bucks or something
maybe not that shape okay under a
hundred dollars yeah yeah any too good
so I mean treat yourself to some open
source software papi linux puppy linux
yeah what is there's a puppy in the
house today there is we'll have a will
have crosscut to that so what's going
home with you I've been working my ass
off yeah it's been it for reals it's
been a tough week for all of us I like
didn't really have one other things are
giving is absolutely retarded because
you've got all that work that you need
to do then you've got to prep Walt
because you're on this well because you
were on vacation you've got all those
were built up and now you're like oh
crap now I got two weeks to get it done
a four and a half weeks before I take
off again so you're like yeah it's you
have to get all this crap done before
you go on vacations there is ms plus
plus plus we've got to get ready for the
big announcement drumroll please oh you
want to do that oh hell yes I do we are
going to CES ladies and gentlemen yeah
January eighth through the eleventh tak
five in partnership with revision3
tekzilla and every other show that is
going to be there BF at CES covering the
event live two days we'll be releasing
daily episodes on thursday friday and no
on friday saturday sunday if we're wrong
it's in the lower third yeah whatever it
is and I days so you guys are out at CES
I do know that it takes apparently
forever to get anywhere even between the
two buildings it's at the stands and
like the Las Vegas Convention Center
which is like five freaking football
field hands we're gonna let me see
Beauty know the sand is uh oh yeah like
yeah holy crap I got some in my crotch
you know kind of go down right away cuz
he cut out the stupid stuff that they
got in the trunks cuz those lame and
then you go to never mind this I'm way
off top so anyway so anyway well CES
January eighth through the eleventh of
you guys gonna be there you shoot us an
email so that we can get some sort of
meet up going on we're actually out
there and maybe get some of you guys on
you know what are your favorite products
yes I'd see you definitely i already got
Evan Oberman is working hard finding us
all the cool stuff that he wants us to
cover we want to hear what you guys are
interested in because we are going to
bring the hacker perspective to CES
we're not going to get kicked out like
dude skis with the TV be gone but there
might be pineapples in our future so
anyway hit up let us know what you guys
want to see and and I think that's good
for the a yep so I'm gonna go ahead and
let you guys know that when we get back
we are gonna be talking with Chris about
public key encryption ways that you can
securely transfer files from PCs you
don't need to worry about you know just
one factor of authentication is really
good stuff but first let's find out
about this week's land party all right
thanks d guys this week slam party is
half life 2 death match I love half life
2 it's one of my favorite scene games to
play I'm pretty much rock everyone at it
or at least I like to think so toilets
in the face hurt they do you remember
east coast land that we went to in live
events that means just landed oozing so
I'm going to do that we're going to try
and bring that feel back we're gonna be
playing half-life 2 deathmatch on
December 13 you can go to game hak5 org
the server is pretty much up all the
time okay uh so you can log on and you
know get your game on practice a little
bit if you don't know your own servers
you're gonna need it so the toilets and
radiators in the face and like I said
all I got yeah pretty much so december
13-game hak5 org and we would like to
thank the fine people at em wave for
sponsoring this week's land party look
the new Intel Core i7 processor or
processor extreme inside your next media
tower or gaming rig the smarter way to
take on highly threaded games and
applications the core i7 processor which
recently just came out there's three
miles available now the 920 the 940 and
i believe the 960 extreme absolutely
destroying and all the benchmarks that
you guys can possibly thank god i just
built a new pc i know you did after i
knew it was coming out so i was like nah
but the core i7 processor features
intelligent multi core technology that
kicks into overdrive is your activity
becomes more intense what does this mean
for you it means virtual worlds and
environments are rendered seamlessly
with physics and AI distribution across
8 software threads means less lag for
you so you can focus on your gameplay
and the only thing you'll be sacrificing
are your enemies not your system's
performance you guys can go to my comm
to get york intel core i7 processor and
when your check out use the coupon code
hack five for ten dollars off an intel
core i7 processor want to thank intel
and em wave for sponsoring this week's
land party and right now we're gonna
kick it over to a break and come back
with public key encryption and driver
back up
so if you ever wanted to log into your
machine securely and I'm not just
talking like I got a password but I'm
talking securely Chris you can tell us
about public key authentication yes
what's that two-factor happy yes it's
just a too fat to another layer of
security its two-factor authentication
well actually the token itself is just
another one factor but then you combine
that with a passphrase and you get to
factor okay so what is it different okay
so there's a passphrase we all know
passphrase is what you use to log in
that's something you know it's
passphrase what's the other factor the
other thing is something you have which
is in this case a key file so you know
with public key authentication we're
using a asymmetric like say in this
swamp this example openssh and putty so
you can generate a public and private
key and you use the public key to
encrypt your you know to encrypt and
with along with the passphrase and then
use the private key to decrypt that so
you can read it and you know okay we
need to do and as well as authenticate
with a server so not only can you
decrypt files but you can use it for
authentication so we're going to show an
example of using this with ssh which is
a great way to log into stuff but what
are the advantages of using like a
public and a private key as you
mentioned okay most the advantage of the
way that we're doing it with the public
key authentication is that you use a
symmetric encryption which means you
have a private key that stays you know
at Fort Knox and that's like the guy
behind the door that's you know that's
going to ask you for you know how your
password in your token and then your
public key is what you just give to
whoever you think needs it and they're
gonna have that public key so I can I
can post this public key on my website
absolutely give it to anybody's everyone
yeah give to everyone that's how that's
how it was how it works from and anyone
can encrypt a message or live in in
various share imitations encrypt it with
the passphrase and then the guy behind
the door takes that has his little
private key decrypt sitting and can okay
so you've got the public key you can
encrypt things with it but you can't
decrypt anything you need to provide
Vicki okay very good so now we can so if
I've got the if you gave me your public
key and I knew the passphrase I
could go to you and I could say oh
here's my public key and I here's here's
the passphrase encoded with my public
key exam that next to the private key
adjust the encoding rings and they would
and if they matched up and then you
could reuse anybody's and then that was
the same then you would give me a
username and password prompt at the bash
shell or whatever it may be that i'm
logging into you can actually you don't
even need a username password well you
need boom okay but you don't necessarily
need a password you're using that to
factor as your password so kind of roll
into things here I said I'm nice and i
set up a Linux VM and I'm in the windows
vm and what I did is on the leg side we
have openssh installed sure so with
openssh we're just gonna I'm just going
to hit enter here and yeah let's see
what we do is how we generate the key
pair so in this case I'm just going to
call it some stuff because I already
have some keys i'm gonna use and then
with the passphrase well we're just
gonna use hacker because you know okay
so hackers our password here and then it
actually gives you a key fingerprint and
this is what you get if you use putty
and you know you log in right if you're
familiar with how do you log into an ssh
session pops up the little message
saying is this your fingerprint yep so
so there it would make sure that this is
so you would need to know that as well
if you're you would yeah you need to
know this okay so just to make sure that
you're actually connecting but thank you
but once that good you know that you say
that you tell pedley yes remember that
kind of client remembers cool so so is
that all we need to do on the server is
there anything more so what I did and
I'm not gonna cuz it's kind of boring to
watch me ASAP a file I transferred the
key file that i made over to my well
let's see the connection what do you do
is oh so i actually did it from this
from this side right here so what I did
is a I have a folder here with a bunch
of putty you know files and here's
actually my keys putty being our
favorite SSH on Windows yes exactly and
so I actually just did it with a command
prompt type II SCP and I actually the
first time to actually set it up yeah I
use the username password okay and I PSC
peed I grabbed the file that I generated
on the openssh side and dragged it over
to the window side the reason being is
that we dope with openssh you can't
import a putty generated key
into openssh you heck you can import and
openssh key into putty but you can't go
the other way since it's not a standard
I don't way that they form at the keys
there is there you know there's probably
a way to do it but I'm also been
emailing I probably will get email about
it I went on their site I went on there
and I didn't see it so anyway so well
when I already email update your blog
with that exactly so I already
transferred it over and what we do is we
go into putty keygen and we import the
key okay so in this case I just do the
doesn't really matter which one you do
sit so we're the public key that we just
got my pastor enough putty key generator
yep we enter in the passphrase and now
we have the public key and now I can
save it and I already did the dot ppk
file here and i'll click exit out of
this this file is what I saved let's see
this is open that up well if you want to
actually send it what it looks like head
plus plus that guy it's a there's your
public great okay so i saved it into a
putty format and and the cool thing is
with putty if you open putty dot exe
here the putty configuration i can type
in yeah this is what we do on the client
side so we're going to go ahead and
water is my IP right and in ssh here
right now that I have the key file I can
go on here and off browse select my key
and now when I go back here to session
just make sure that's correct click open
I'm gonna rock Rogen is login as root
roggen is Lilly frog in his loot login
as root and it's going to ask me for my
passphrase okay type in hacker and I'm
in beautiful so n and everything in
between this is secure so the only doubt
your passphrase does not get sent in the
clear because scripted but even if
somebody was man in the middle they
don't know ed duyvil key yeah they would
need to have not only what they need to
have the private key they would need the
public key and the passphrase so you
have you know you have to really screw
this mrs. security it's you know it's
layered it's there you go I like it ok
cool and also we can set this up on our
home servers exact open up what port 22
for ssh or you can even change it you
can just you know in your IP tables you
can change to whatever you've got a list
of ssh servers like
openssh drop their some window stuff
yeah you don't have to use it with putty
and openssh you can use there's a
million of them out there you can do
between right way to connect back to
your home and you know what I think that
we need to follow up with this later
almost a tunnel yes because we'd talk it
supports public Wi-Fi there we go some
more we got the first bit of that I
think we got a good grasp of public key
authentication and now i think i'm going
to hand it over Shannon and Matt because
we're going to learn about driver
backups jess is important as security
exactly there we go take it away guys
guys what we're gonna be talking about
today is a comparison of different ways
to backup your different drivers now you
might be asking yourself well why do I
need to backup drivers when you know
there's always new ones being released
these are really good for older machines
you know where it's very difficult to
find driver download locations on the
corresponding you know yeah motherboard
vendor video card so if you've got a
machine that's actually working maybe
not so well you know because grandma
downloaded the you know II card that you
know she wasn't supposed to and now it's
completely borked you know something
like that what we can actually do is we
can actually extract all of those
drivers out of the system and then put
them back in once we've actually blown
away everything and go ahead and do that
now there's there's for utilities i'm
going to show you i'm sure there's more
out there oh yeah the first one that
we're actually going to take a look at
is a little bit a low level so it kinda
gets down deep into the you know what
actual drivers are installed um so you
said you didn't want to download your
drivers no I have to go find him no it
takes forever I hate that right but I
already you know I'm gonna have all my
Microsoft all my windows drivers already
so exactly it's like the realtek and the
logitech and all that good stuff that
I'm wearing the tools that we're
actually talking about today all
pre-select non-microsoft drivers good so
we're not backing up you know gigs of
different drivers that we don't need to
install because obviously rat me install
when you install a machine yeah exam but
things like think
even if you don't back up any other
drivers there's really good you really
need to back up like ethernet drivers
which rarely ever change so what we're
going to show you is driver view here
and we can actually go through and see
that it is pre-selected every
non-microsoft driver so here we've got
the nvidia 6600 or 6800 GT driver the
realtek driver some security driver so
on and so forth and we can actually save
the selected items to a text file now
this utility will allow you to get an
abstract of what drivers are installed
but it won't allow you to save them so
this is just a driver viewer so we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
take check out double driver okay this
tool looks very similar but will
actually allow you to back up drivers to
a destination okay that's what I need
right something like that this is a
little bit high a little bit advanced
for basically ninety percent of what you
know you need to do so I personally I
would not recommend this tool to you not
saying that you're an uber anything but
I'm just not just saying I'm just saying
so very similar interface and this one
will actually allow you to backup your
drivers the next tool we're going to go
into is a tool that Chris told me about
its called driver penny it's pretty it's
got you know nice little this time
interface I like it um this tool is
probably its number two on the list for
a reason okay even though it's a very
nice tool they make you register too
even though it's free to register to
actually use it consistently so anybody
that make is offering a free tool that
makes me register so they can give me oh
so you really don't like registering for
stuff thank you but no thang but this
allows you just like every other tool
that we're talking about to select which
drivers and any non-microsoft drivers
that we want yeah this one looks like
it's not pre-selected for you um right
so we actually have to go through and
select them all and we actually can go
down here and select you know which if
we want to you know sort by a certain
subgroup which we're actually going to
do the last tool that i'm going to show
you
is the one that I'm going to recommend
to you this one's called driver back up
two point oh and thank you I can't
remember his name but he actually
recommended it to me but this one
actually shows all the drivers but we
can actually go ahead and click on a
third-party drivers so nice okay so
here's our video our audio our monitor
so on and so forth and what we're gonna
do is we are going to back up real quick
i'm gonna show you how simple it is to
start it back up so we're so long is
this gonna take watch so we're gonna do
is put the pen down and we're going to
browse to a path this is gonna be the C
Drive okay and we're in insert a
description my computer it's no computer
and we're going to allow and generate
files for automatic driver restoration
which is very important because we want
to use the same utility to restore our
drivers once we've got your new computer
built that's really nice so you don't
have to go searching all over the place
to pick up your drivers again exact you
might have backed him up but you know
you don't know where they ended up
exactly so what we're gonna do is we now
that we've got the rootsy path we're
gonna click start back up um and oh wow
it's done holy crap so we can actually
go in and we can see it's nice see
here's the backup file and here are our
drivers nvidia geforce 6800 GT marvell
yukon now restoring the drivers is just
as easy instead of clicking back up
we're going to click restore and we're
gonna actually open the backup file and
this BK I file and would you leave it
there already checked for you yep all of
them aren't there they're sorted yum to
their specific components oh god that's
awesome so it is perfect for what I need
so we just backed up all of your drivers
in less than 30 seconds and now
restoring them he's only gonna take you
30 seconds that is so instead of logging
on you know all that other stuff so if
you guys want to check it out you can
find more of my below my blog Matt less
talk com
and we want to thank netflix for not
sponsoring this but the trivia that
we're actually going to do right now so
thanks to netflix for sponsoring this
week's trivia with netflix you can rent
over 90,000 titles online including lots
of blu-ray with free shipping both to
and from your home they now have over 40
shipping center so almost all deliveries
happen in just one business day and the
netflix plans start from 499 as a new
member you can get a no-risk two week
free trial membership checkout WWNN

important dude Netflix is on the 360 the
xbox yeah shannon has been consuming my
time with fallout 3 mom because she's
been watching heroes lately but I
finished it no except for that one new
episode oh so exciting is pretty good
too really what God you watched it
without me hey hol you watch the entire
third season pretty much without me
bitch hmm so yeah heroes debate gets a
little hot heated in this um do
something on the third blackberry yeah
there's an application for the
blackberry that you guys get Darren
actually told me about it it's called
smart flicks it's by pics of software
and basically what you can do is you can
sit if you if you guys don't like having
your laptops and at the you know on your
couch you you know bust out your
blackberry or your iphone i know there's
compatible iphone one as well add stuff
to your q deletes up from your q
recommendations so what we want you guys
to do is we want you to add us as a

recommendations from you and you can get
recommendations from us and i told there
and that he's not allowed to watch any
documentaries anymore
thank God I know right so sick of that
crew exactly um so yeah netflix on the
360 you can watch stuff in HD it's the
first platform that you can actually
watch netflix instant queues on demand
HD and it looks damn good oh it looks
for night I say phenomenal so this
week's true last week's trivia winner as
soon as I can find my paperwork here I
think it was gonna start well imma start
well is that I don't say his name yes I
tell you you know it's funny because on
on days when the show comes out people
skip right to the part of the trivia
dude they seriously they can so
literally like four minutes four minutes
after the show releases there's already
an answer so I think we need to start
like hiding it in the show maybe like
just kind of go died away somewhere in
the middle of the segment mwah yeah so
you can't just like skip to you know
three quarters and find it but last
week's trivia question was in the first
technology preview of doom which I
played dub doom evil unleashed what did
the secret messages say about Jules and
Tom that was correctly answered by
masaryk well and the answer was Thomas
King and Jules sucks I think they even
put a seat thumbnail on the forums
Darren actually showed me after the
episode miss art will will be getting a
copy of hackers are people too by Ashley
Schwartz how we actually are going to be
going to a dot documentary she's alone
made the documentary we're gonna be
going to interview that Darren did with
her and very actually pretty lady I must
say she is she's so nice is she really
yeah we saw her up at a freak Nick I
didn't get to talk to her much but
yeah she's a really sweet girl what she
was sitting right next to us dude she
was right national court anyway exactly
how I've amiss I must have been freaking
hammered on it Everclear by then I don't
know anyway this week's trivia question
are you guys ready it's gonna be a tough
one finally thanks d polaris trident and
stiletto mmm three words three objects
three people I don't know which of these
three man-made objects do not belong and
why man-made yeah like hammer nails yeah
they're man-made why don't they belong
answer the question on the hak5 or
revision3 forums correctly and we'll be

mammals yeah we give them all out man
that's cool whatever so revision 3.com /
forum or forums dot hack 5 org to go and
answer the trivia question right now we
are going to check out that interview
with Ashley Schwartz out with Darren and
we'll see you guys a little bit
so tonight we are joined via Skype a
very special guest it's ashley schwartz
out from the documentary hackers are
people to actually how are you again how
are you I'm not bad so tell me a little
bit about this documentary hackers are
people too yes hackers are people too
and this documentary is a low project
that I started on about a year and a
half ago and basically it's a portrait
of the hacking community in their own
words and it's aimed at average America
to give Americans a chance to see
hackers for what they are and who they
think they are and it kind of dispel the
negative stereotypes that have been
portrayed for years in the media okay so
I mean is this is this your first
documentary it's my first film project
very cool so what inspired you to make
this um well for one thing I was going
to school for digital media in orlando
at the university of central florida and
it wasn't i was really getting if you
had the program that i thought i would
and I was just itching to work on
something so I can learn how to edit and
I've been going to hacker con since I
was 16 it's just this group of people
that I really fall in love with and I
was talking to somebody and they made
some comment that they're like oh
hackers you know and I was like no
hackers are cool people and it was just
I started noticing that people didn't
thing about hackers way I thought about
hackers I guess I kind of just took my
view of them for granted and i was like
huh wonder if there's no documentary
made about them and then i started
looking into it and you know the last
documentary was made back in the 90s and
things have no changed a little bit and
nobody's going to watch in like an old
VHS movie and so I was like oh I could
do this and that I proposed the idea to
some of my hacker friends at shmoocon
and they're like yeah right on go do it
so I'd to figure out how and I did okay
so how did you fall in with this this
hacker crowd ah well my dad winch were
tau is the CEO of the security awareness
company and he's been in the security
industry for like 20 years and he's been
going to defcon since the first one and
he kind of just dragged me along with
them one year and I had no idea what I
was getting myself into and at first I
just kind of saw them as like partiers
and crazy like nerdy types and then I
really started to understand that they
were just really short and intelligent
and like I could have these really
awesome powers Asians with them and I
would always learn something
and then I'd come home from the cons and
go back to my regular life so to speak
it was like oh I kind of miss those guys
yeah so much time after con hangover if
you will it's me yeah menting yeah yeah
okay I really miss them so what kind of
obstacles did you encounter like going
off like oh I'm gonna interview a whole
bunch of hackers that doesn't sound like
an easy thing to do hmm well I think one
thing that works for me is that I'm a
girl and hackers tend to speak to girls
or want to speak to girls Laura so zinta
back if I was a guy but um I mean I
encountered a lot of obstacles any
independent filmmaker would encounter
along the way you know money issues and
equipment issues and having never done
anything like this before I kind of was
just fumbling my way through it but then
as far as like the actual hackers at the
conferences I would we just we had no
real plan of action I dragged a friend
with me to help me do the interviews and
we just started asking random people so
I didn't want to be like famous hackers
or just nobody hackers I wanted a broad
range of the community to show the
diversity and a lot of people were very
like uh you want me to talk about
hacking on camera I don't think so yeah
and then there was a lot of people that
who knew me and trusted me and do what I
wanted to do and so who were very
willing and there were a lot of no's for
every person we asked there were four
people who said no and then there were a
lot of people who they would say no
initially and then they would sit back
and watch watch me do some of the
interviews and see the kind of questions
I was asking and then they'd be like
okay I'll do that let me sign your form
that's an interesting approach so we're
just trying to be friendly um I found it
at Def Con and to work on in 2007 and so
just basically five days of filming of
all the interviews I end up with like 60
interviews so this premiered at Def Con
16 and it was very well received by the
the hacker circle so what's next for
this film and what's next for you as a
filmmaker well right now and actually
for the last few months I've been trying
to get it into film festivals which is a
whole nother world and crazy process
right now it's been an accepted into one
which was a few weeks ago the Flint film
fest
in Michigan and I won't hear back about
the other like 13 that I entered until
january or so but keep your fingers
crossed so we can get into some and we
also sell copies on amazon and film baby
and hackers are people to calm and we're
just trying to get the word out you're
definitely bridging two universes here
the whole hacker universe and then going
to traditional documentary film route so
that's very interesting so we'll be
checking and see how this progresses
where can people find more information
about the documentary if you go to
hackers or people to calm we update
fairly regularly like news and an
interesting things about what the movie
is doing and also we have this really
awesome holiday special going on
normally the film is 1337 plus shipping
and handling but if we are offering free
shipping all through December and if you
order five or more copies you get fifty
percent off your order rock on and we're
also going to be giving away a whole
bunch of them free for you guys as
trivia winners so thank you so much for
helping us out with that and uh oh yeah
totally well it was great talking to you
Ashley and I look forward to seeing how
this progresses I think we're gonna take
a quick break but as we jus we're gonna
watch a little clip here of hackers are
people to thank you thank you
people complain that it's not like it
used to be it's not all on the
Underground it's not all secret and well
the people in the underground are still
on the underground they're there if you
want to work that hard and you know you
really want to earn that kind of
credential then you want to be called
that then you can still do that it but
what's going on in public what's going
on here and now is something that wasn't
even possible or realistic when in the
day in the in the old days it's changed
a lot over the years this community got
going let me back in the 70s even long
before the Internet is a popular term
and grew through the 80s as more people
became connected through dial-up VBSS
and it is the internet came of age in
the 90s and he really began to explode
for the longest time it was academic
people
understood computer science and like to
learn more about weight
and over time though as more and more
information became available in the net
grew and networking internet access
became basically free computers became
free operating systems became free long
distance tellico charges became
basically free all the lot of the
original motivations went away and is
that happen that changed the group
dynamic the culture was good it was
strong it was it's good and it's just
different now so now there's multi-tier
stairs there's a group of people who've
been doing it for many many years and
they're still interested in learning and
discovering and you know just testing
out the quality of systems and then
there's a lot of real idiots who just
they come Nick they come to something
like this because they they think
they're going to be taught how to break
into their bank which they're not going
to especially if they come up Saudi and
just go teach me how to hack because the
last thing you want to do
I think now you know a hacker is
somebody that is a talented and talented
with technology and passionate about it
not just talented because they went to
school and learn something but talented
because they know when they go to bed at
night you know they think about
technology or when they when they wake
up in the morning they think about
technology you know technology makes
them happy everything I do a brief my
wife swears like talking numbers when
I'm sleeping do I feel that's a
lifestyle absolutely it's a lifestyle we
live that we breathe it um will die
going that way will be 80 trying to tell
these young uns you don't even know what
a 2600 hurt is I don't actually know if
it's something that becomes a lifestyle
for anyone I think you either have that
mentality in you the the idea of I want
to see what's happening behind the
curtain and if you're not born with it I
can't imagine where you'd get it it
starts off with curiosity want to know
you know can I do this could I do this
differently could I do this better more
efficiently i also like spreading
knowledge i like looking this at
somebody's face and seeing the lights go
on in their eyes you don't think oh
that's how it works it's like a yeah
it's not black art you know it's not
magic it's just turn this knob and hit
that button like oh cool and now they
have a skill it's sort of like teaching
someone to fish instead of you know
giving them a cheeseburger and I like
teaching people how to fish that's
really cool all right shin so we've been
getting a lot of questions recently
about how to kind of clean up our media
collections I know myself I've got like
40 gigs in threes when I hear how many
gigs you guys got these men these
collections are getting massive yeah
they really are a lot of times when you
get them from the Russian sites or
Amazon on DRM all this legal their holy
tagged sometimes you've got mp3s from
your own collection they just ripped
from CDs that may not be they may not
have the same tag right that can be
really annoying screwed you're trying to
put together a good road trip mix or
just flight mix cuz you're flying to
Missouri here next week you want to know
that your stuff is gonna be accessible
on your MPG layer of choice it helps to
know exactly what you're listening to so
you can so not all of your not all of
your mp3s are called untitled or not all
of your tags are listed on the ipod to
untitled it's just a vast
list of stuff I do not listen to
actually yeah you're gonna see my
listing rate you can see how much take a
look so what are these applications that
are gonna help us and save us I found
two laps the first ones tuneup media and
the second one second one is tag scanner
the first one I'm gonna talk about is
tuneup media cuz I know it the best okay
I use itunes a whole lot probably too
much and a tuneup media is basically for
itunes it has four different sections on
it clean cover art now playing in
concerts I'll go through the last three
first okay guys they're the smallest
sections they're easier to get through
on search so what is that concerts
basically shows you depending on what
kind of artists you listen to it'll show
you what kind of concerts are going
around in your area Depeche Mode coming
up soon how about you r and you're in
Baton there's a Beethoven festival
concert okay so you can see it listen to
Beethoven all right anyway which is kind
of funny so what um also it shows now
playing so you can check out videos on
youtube like I have 3 11 in my list so
it shows me 3 11 videos cover art gives
you a choice kofoed is pretty cool I use
this one quite a bit in the free mode
though of two tuneup media you can
either go with the free mode or the one
that you have to buy but obviously I use
free I totally hear you because I mean
not only that but like when it comes to
cover art I mean if it's like if you get
like a sugar cubes album there's
multiple covers for you know there are
so when you come up here for instance I
have a perfect circle thrown up here you
can choose between your favorite cover
arts by a perfect circle so my favorite
is this one so I'll just save that and
that goes head and saves it were like
right into the files yeah it does it
saves that into the id3 tag cool and
then the last section is clean clean is
the one that you'll use the most with
tuneup media it's very very simple to
use if you have any untitled artists
untitled names of songs of any of those
mp3s that you've thrown into your iTunes
you can just drag it over here drag and
drop and it starts processing your song
immediately so I threw up Lauryn Hill
the miseducation of lauryn hill and I
have no clue what the song is called so
I just called it untitled so we'll
see what comes up in a couple of seconds
oh and there we go I've got it right
there so it threw it up right here and I
can even hit it down here and look
around and find out what song it is in
check out the album according to this it
says in this album it's number 16 is
called tell him so so you need the other
15 tracks to complete your album
experience yeah if I wanted those mighty
tracks or I could just you know keep the
one that i bought completely legal
totally so I'm gonna save that and it's
gonna immediately change my itunes tag
over to tell him see there you go tell
him it's great yeah a lot easier than
then going and hitting up the CD DB
every Simon but the thing is how do you
know that that song tuneup media told
you to download is the same song that
you have in your itunes whoa double
whammy what are we never now alright so
for the most part they always get it
right I mean I've never had any problems
with them so what I do before I decided
to change this change the name on a song
like I know this is no effects dinosaurs
will die so i'll hit play and then i'll
come over here and drag and drop it yeah
and I'll make sure that it comes up with
the same exact name in title that's just
a little bit too anal for me but well
yeah I'm a little anal I'm a little bit
to organizational I'm sorry yeah it's
just the way but it'll actually play it
play you a sample of what it thinks it
is so you can match it to life yes oh
well so you can browse down here and
dinosaurs will die is the one that's
pulled up so there you go I was right
nice so what about the alternative yeah
so if you don't use you to iTunes and I
know a lot of people don't use it you
can also use tag scanner in tag scanner
isn't exactly the same thing but it lets
you change around your id3 tags and
unless you organize your actual mp3s
that are in your My Documents folder or
whatever your mp3 folder whatever it is
that you have on your computer so I
pulled up a whole bunch of these songs
from one of my favorite animes called
Sailor Moon mm-hmm and ask yeah it's
awesome as you can see here the artist
yeah there's no artist well because I
Sailor Moon I mean yeah I'm song yeah
it's awesome right
but I have all the titles right here and
over here under music renamer I can go
over here and i can add the title of
each song so we could actually like if
we had the artist in the title and
everything we could rename and
categorize our actual files and our
folder structure yeah and then this and
can we do the same thing with the id3 so
rather than the file names can we do the
same thing with the id3 tags UK now
whether it's version 1 version to be the
next step is called tag editor you go
over to this one and it shows you the
id3 tag it shows you exactly what you
can put into your data for your id3 tag
for each and every mp3 that you have
listed on tagged scanner so over here
you can see you can add your own picture
if you don't know what the album picture
is just add your own you can add lyrics
I would go over to Amazon find the
picture and import it right into the
file me a little bit leg work there but
we can go ahead and do that you can do
it if you really really want to sort
that much that you know so we are
interested in and how crazy you guys get
with your mp3 collections what kind of
utilities you use to manage to organize
cuz i just mean you can use for windows
whether you're on there's a lot more so
i can shift out a whole bunch of
different other ones one thing i don't
like about tuneup media is that once you
download it you don't have the choice to
cut it off to disable it whenever you
open up itunes oh that's a piece o it is
a pain in the ass but it's a good song
lip clean up your collection i love it's
not anything it's so nice so hit us up
we want to hear what you guys use on mac
on linux on all that other crime bit
where it ran out of work cos whatever
hit us up we have some questions that we
need to get to because you guys have
some interesting ideas and thoughts and
questions we encourage that a feedback i
high fived org but first want to tell
you guys about Squarespace and how they
are hooking us up with our land party
page Leah so squarespace com is the
place and if you go over to hack 5 land
dot squarespace com you can find our new
hak5 land portal this is a place where
you guys can go to basically vote on
what games you think we should play next
is where you can give us your feedback
on how the game went we got
leaderboard so that's gonna be a lot of
fun so when you're in the hak5 land
parties start taking some screenshots
ended definitely us well actually if you
go there right now you'll see we have a
video of me kind of getting getting
owned by a zygote down out unreal
tournament so much for that reign of
glory and I was doing pretty by myself
yeah Paul it was owning it up did you
notice it yeah yeah at least he was
doing way better than me so I'm thinking
a little Pulver's Darren well anyway so
if you want to like weigh in on what you
guys think we should be playing next
head over to HL 2 i'm sorry hl2 to hak5
lan dot squarespace com &amp;amp; moullin think
Squarespace because it is a beautiful
publishing system for any km if you need
a blog a portfolio all the way up to
like a big corporate site you can
totally use our tools they're very easy
if you want to get granular you can get
granular if you want to use a WYSIWYG
you can use a WYSIWYG I've just playing
with it today hooking up the hak5 land
site they did an amazing job Dan over
there put some awesome effort into
making the hak5 land site look beautiful
Alex calm and you can use the same tools
to do the same kind of stuff it's just
one release july twenty fifth and it's
it's really unique the way that they're
doing this because you don't need a lot
of programming experience it's like
having dreamweaver in your browser but
not confusing because like everything's
kind of intuitive like i had i mean i
didn't read any documentation on this
whatsoever I oh I think I'll watch like
the video on their homepage would you
guys check out so you know it's powerful
enough to to host big media sites to die
mean you know like Kevin Rose is being
hosted office Sarah Lane they will sit
off it it's good stuff so I highly
encourage you to head over there and
check it out because Squarespace rules
and now our hak5 land party pages over
there I love it you had a shot yeah it's
very left 4 dead itch you there we go so
we have some questions yes we do we have
one question for this week spy skybar
baron he writes that i have a computer
from my school and I was wondering if
there's a way to wipe everything but
like Microsoft Office and the OS
operating system so how can I do that
well normally if you wanted to totally
you know like wipe the hard drive on a
computer I'd say the easiest way to do
it is with a little tool called Daniels
boot and nuke or otherwise known as dban
org the place to get either your DoD
level or even your RCMP level hard drive
wiping on kind of interesting that the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police has a
better wiping method than the DoD but
you know whatever it's just our
government I don't know that hooray for
the Pentagon because maybe before it sad
stuff so um but you don't want to fry
the entire hard drive you just want to
make sure that what you're deleting is
actually gone and for that i recommend
highly recommend a program called Esteli
it's a command line program it's called
st exe it's by marco sonabitch over its
sysinternals now working for microsoft
kicking it hardcore it's a program that
you can use to make sure that that file
is not seeing the light of day anytime
soon so you know if you want to donate
your pc to some schools but you want to
make sure that those completely legit
mp3 is that you got off that are you
cite all right way off there they will
be so I hope that answers your question
if you have more questions where can
they hit us up at feedback at hak5 dot
org where we are getting a storm of
question we are back in frappe getting
buried an email it's fun no only dare
ever say something because that's why an
it Darren is not very efficient at
reading and responding to you however
the rest of us she has been very
efficiently respond in multi task no
I've not been efficient I'm I'm getting
very late everyone okay I came to work
today and you told me all you have been
doing all day is checking emails you
latta me yeah yeah Jeff will do i
replied to one hundred and then I got
through another 50 and then I still got
twenty fives just so so anyway then
Darren changed the the PHP code on the
hak5 website so that when you submit it
you know a question or what a comment it
goes to all of us instead of just me and
now I'm sure that the rest of the guys
will deal with that cuz baby its
delegation and my inbox is hopefully a
little later now
maybe I think that is our show um couple
things we need guys let them know about
