carbonite
welcome to act tip the show where we
break down two concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and 19
inches I'm your host Aaron kitchen and
today we're getting into some fun bash
history tricks now you see in the world
of Linux and kind of computers in
general there's more than one way to
skin a cat
or so the proverb goes actually on a
side note that proverb dates back to 16
78 with the second edition of John Ray's
collection of English proverbs and then
later it came to the states with Mark
Twain's 1889 novel a Connecticut Yankee
in King Arthur's Court and some have
pointed out that rather than a feline
cat in question they may have been
referring to a catfish which usually
gets skin to be for cooking or the
gymnastics performance involving passing
one's legs over your arms or hanging on
to a bar but either way I just want to
make it clear that here a hak5
we love cats already now with that all
out of the way our recent look into
hiding passwords from bash history
spurred up theory of feedback including
this one from me me oh three nine who
wrote to avoid passwords and bash
history use this export history control
equals ignore space and with that any
command starting with a space won't show
up in history so you just hit space and
then LS and then boom it's not there how
fantastic is that of course me me oh
three nine goes on to say that you can
also do this by setting export his
export H is t ignore equals and then a
quotation mark quotation marks then we
can add pass we can add W get and we can
add LS and we just go ahead and at us
and then we end that quote and now
suddenly our history will ignore
anything including past W get whatever
that's kind of a fun one to add so thank
you so much for the tip Mimi now the
only epsilon alpha point
doubt that only if a user were to gain
access to a system during that session
the password could be actually retrieved
by echoing in our case dollar sign
password and this is true so if I do say
password equals one two three four an
echo dollar sign password we'll see
there we go I've got one two three four
and that's why we should definitely use
you know we should definitely unset the
variable with the aptly named unset
command so unset password and if we echo
password again it's not there I know
pretty easy pretty fantastic stuff now
metalhead noted that he used the history
taxi command out of force of habit when
logging out of a session now the taxi
option clears the history and
alternatively the taxi option will
delete a specific entry from history's
overdue history and I see every all of
these have a number and if I do history
tack d-57 for now just run history again
and I'll notice that 574 is gone except
there is a 574 it's just been replaced
with me deleting 574 how freaking crazy
is that
anyway fisgard zero points out that
issuing hist size equals zero we'll set
the history size to zero and thus
nullifying the history completely and
finally over soft points out that dot
bash underscore history the file can
actually just be deleted I know that's
simple alright we'll be back with more
in just a bit after this quick break
