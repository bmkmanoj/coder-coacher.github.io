uber hires hackers not for what you
think HTTPS blocks Russian Wikipedia
band and LTE is going to hit 5 gigahertz
because you know verizon says it's open
all that coming up now on threat liar
happy Monday people I'm Patrick Norton
this is a threat wire for august 15 2015
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
and a big thanks to everybody
contributing to the show on patreon.com
/ threat liar us developing sanctions
against China over cyber thefts is not
the kind of title that usually sets us
on fire here but the Washington Post
says quote the Obama administration is
developing a package of unprecedented
economic sanctions against Chinese
companies and individuals who have
benefited from their government cyber
theft of valuable US trade secrets
that's a heavy statement especially
given the financial state of China and
this would be the first use of Obama's
executive order the one called blocking
the property of certain persons engaging
in significant malicious cyber enabled
activity catchy isn't it that's the
we're going to punish nations and people
who harm national security or economic
health them harms prescribed in the in
that executive order harming or
otherwise significantly compromising
provision of services in a critical
infrastructure sector ie don't mess with
the infrastructure causing a significant
instruction to the availability of
computer a network of computers ie don't
screw with our networks or three this is
the big one causing a significant
misappropriation of funds or economic
resources trade secrets personal
identifiers or financial information for
commercial or competitive advantage or
private financial gain now given that
the FBI claims the Washington Post
reports and this China alone accounted
for most of the fifty three percent jump
in economic espionage in the last year
or so well you can connect the dots even
without the OPM break-ins now whether
the White House will use the sanctions
at all much less right before China's
President Xi Jinping of China hits
Washington next month it's going to be
interesting people it's going to be very
very interesting speaking of private
financial gain remember that business
email scam that took a bit kuti networks
for over 40 million dollars targeting
or hacking into the email of executives
and control wire transfers between
companies well Krebs on security reports
that the FBI says thieves stole nearly
750 million in such scams for more than
seven thousand victim companies in the
US alone between october2013 in august
2015 overall the larger picture victims
comes from 50 states 79 countries and
the total internationally is over 1.2
billion dollars big shock krebs quotes
the FBI quote fraudulent transfers have
been reported going to 72 countries
however the majority of the transfers
are going to Asian banks located within
China and Hong Kong and the scam is
picking up speed as in a two hundred
seventy percent rise with all due
respect to the president's potential
sanctions get yourself some 2fa some
two-factor authentication in your
purchasing system that backs up email
requests for wire transfers use a better
system and protect yourself people in
cheerful news for folks that hate
oppressive government censorship the eff
says a Russian order to block Wikipedia
was foiled by wikipedias use of HTTPS ie
an encrypted connection from the users
browser to the servers at Wikipedia what
happened well russia wanted to block an
article on charas has she slit offended
the government was quote says the eff
left with only the option of ordering
the entire site blocked or leaving the
offending page accessible which they did
block all of Wikipedia which apparently
pissed off loud amir putin when he went
to check his wikipedia entry cuz well
you know cuz after just a few hours of
blocks russia reverb in its policy
claiming that the material says the eff
have been taken down it hadn't according
to wikipedia editors says the eff though
the title and URL of the page had been
changed so the eff claims https by
preventing granular blocking i were
going to block this article from all of
Russia has not only saved Wikipedia but
they also said it prevented github from
being blocked in China Google services
and Iran and more and that more new
services especially should follow the
Washington Post example and get their
sights on the HTTPS to make it more
difficult to block information meanwhile
censorship still sucks and governments
can be really scary another light news
remember earlier when I mentioned the
uber had hired hack
is there not to go after lift remember
the Jeep Cherokee heck Wall Street
Journal says uber just hired Charlie
Miller and Chris valasek to work on
security at uber advanced technology
center in Pittsburgh basically to keep
ubers new self-driving cars secure
another here yet but when they come out
in the future because self-driving cars
who wouldn't want to attack those if
your iphone is jailbroken threat post
says watch out for key Raider which
quote has the ability to steal
certificates private keys and apple
account information it's in the wild
somebody found a couple hundred thousand
accounts worth of information on a
server and finally from the dang it just
as five gigahertz Wi-Fi started to get
useful Verizon and t-mobile what to use
the open five gigahertz bandwidth or LTE
phone service I am grossly
oversimplified go read the article and
ARS technica thurs a link in the show
notes if you're curious about whether or
not open bandwidth can be used by
carriers to supplement their wireless
bandwidth which I guess they think it
should be and everybody else the planet
is like no verizon stop stop right now
you want to see your pet right up here
it doesn't have to be furry or adorable
you just need to support threat wire on
