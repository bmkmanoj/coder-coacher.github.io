by domain.com if you want to make ubuntu
run seamlessly inside a windows box
perhaps you'll be interested in this
tool called an linux and linux is a
complete ubuntu system that runs in
windows all except for windows 7 64 bit
which is why I have this honking piece
of plastic right here and it uses a
program called co Linux as its core co
Linux is a part of the Linux kernel that
ports into windows it's kind of like
running Linux in a vm except with co
linux and linux merchants itself into
windows and linux kernel instead of
running through an emulated pc and linux
is for fun and development and it can
run almost any linux applications
without having to do any kind of
modifications so with an linux you get a
fully functional linux system with no
desktop interface it gives you the
second panel or a start menu where you
can load linux applications the apps can
be run simultaneously with windows apps
and then you can cut and paste text
between them or anything you want it
really analytics comes in a couple of
different versions there's a KDE version
which is a full version and then there's
an xfce which is a minimal version and
you can find both of those over at and
linux org and just go over to the
downloads page and choose which kind you
prefer when you go through the whole and
linux installation on windows there are
a few really important steps to keep in
mind first up you need to choose your
startup type I chose brun and Linux
automatically as an NT service because
it is the most convenient choice you
don't have to do any kind of
configuration if you choose this option
you'll also be asked to create a
username and password for an Linux login
make sure to write those down or put
them into your phone or something
because you will need those in the
future for windows file access I chose
cofs as it gives you a lot easier
configuration compared to Samba Samba
will though let you share files with
very special characters in the name also
if windows starts like freaking out
because it's not Microsoft Certified
just click continue anyway it really
doesn't matter it's okay all right so
now once the installation has finished
just restart your computer and unblock
any windows firewall settings that may
occur from the installation
to start using and Linux first you need
to run the antique console I'll go ahead
and do that now so I'm going to go ahead
and log in with my username and password
which is hack and my password which I'm
not going to give you ok so we are now
logged in you can then close this window
and go ahead and start up any of the
programs and applications that are
available in the boot menu it's kind of
like downloading all the Linux programs
straight into Windows without using a
linux OS yeah it's kind of cool huh all
right so I'm going to go ahead and play
with some of these programs delicious
let's see what we have here conquer
they'll start with Kay's isn't that
adorable so I'm just going to pull up a
couple of different programs and try
them out well actually I'm going to go
to a different website on there let's go
to hack five make sure that internets
works and we have this nifty little
organizer and at the same time I can
still run my regular windows browser on
the side and if I get bored I can just
close this and I can play with this cool
and there's a whole bunch of other
really cool stuff you can play with like
a console you can jump into Kate or
contact which is very useful
and Linux looks to be a very handy way
to use Linux applications in DD if you
like it tell me so feedback at hak5 org
coming up soon we'll be answering your
viewer questions but first let's take a
break and check in with Darren for the
nibble we were asked what would hack 5
be like if it were a paranormal
investigation show so we went to domain
calm and register dot TV to find out
these are the hack files virgin kitchen
when you set a thousand decapitated
rubber duckies washed up on shore you
weren't kidding were you know I can only
imagine this is the result of a crashed
alien spacecraft and they're deranged
experiments and what makes you say that
the wreckage
that's a soda can
look there one of the alien creatures I
mean I mean back over here
right here eat-in kitchen have you been
drinking again the stuffs up the pod who
would plant a stuff cephalopod at the
scene of a crime
Paul Tobias
if you're building a video site or your
website has a play button a dot TV
domain is the way to go TV websites let
you showcase your original content and
create a unique site not just another
YouTube channel go to domain calm and
search for the perfect TV domain for
your new idea then use the coupon code
hak5 at checkout to save an extra
fifteen percent looking for hosting save
fifteen percent on that too at
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
you guys know what they say MTR isn't
your father's traced around no indeed it
is the ultimate command line tool for
finding out where all those tasty little
packets are getting lost or little guys
now from the bash command prompt go
ahead an issue MTR tak tak report tak
wide with attack tag curses and your
destination of choosing an empty air is
gonna bring up a curses terminal
interface which is constantly updating
with a report on the hops the pings
complete with host names best in average
Layton sees percentage of passing the
packets lost on each link it's really
great too because you can change the
sorting method you can go into different
display modes to see cool graphs and
whatnot I love this thank you so much
for Brian for sending this and it's
going some complimentary hak5 swag you
can do just that send your four bits to
hack 5 org slash nibble</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
