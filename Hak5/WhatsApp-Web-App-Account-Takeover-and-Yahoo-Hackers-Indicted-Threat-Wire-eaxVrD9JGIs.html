telegram webapps venerable to account
takeovers four have been indicted in one
of the yahoo hacks and the white house
has a new cybersecurity coordinator all
that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for March 21st 2017 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom first off a
very special thanks to our patrons
supporting the show every single month
if you want access to extras hit up
patreon.com slash threat wire for more
information our first story comes from
Twitter actually Twitter counter if you
were on Twitter last week possibly
following the national election in the
Netherlands you may have been welcomed
by swastikas and Nazi like tweets due to
a hack of several media outlets
well-known politicians and celebrities
the hack occurred due to a third-party
service called Twitter counter which
allows Twitter users to analyze their
tweet data as well as tweet directly
from the service while Twitter Keller
doesn't store credit card details or
passwords for Twitter they do have
authentication to tweet on behalf of a
user's account via their service
according to Twitter counter they
started remediation tasks shortly after
finding out their service could be the
potential entry point for the hack by
shutting down the service and auditing
their systems toward a counter is now
back up and working the company suspects
that this is done by the Turkish state
in response to an anti-immigrant party
in the Netherlands
though the dispute between countries has
been going on for quite some time and
before commenting please don't kill the
messenger my personal opinions on this
topic aren't up for discussion twitter
counter advises users to change their
passwords use two-factor authentication
review the list of apps authorized
through Twitter and of course contact
Twitter if your account might have been
compromised
checkpoint an Israeli security firm
found vulnerabilities in the web apps of
both telegram and whatsapp late last
week both apps allow you to use
end-to-end encryption via web browser
alongside that of your phone while the
encryption is secure the file uploaders
were not and could allow an attacker to
gain full control of an account
including accessing contacts
the other files saved in the app and
message history if it was saved in a
blog post published by the firm they
discussed how the web apps did not
restrict certain types of uploads
correctly as they were able to bypass
the restrictions by hiding malicious
HTML code behind a JPEG image or video
the attacker can send the encrypted file
to the user and a user would open it
from the blog entry quote once the
victim clicks on the document the
whatsapp web client uses the file reader
html5 API call to generate a unique blob
URL with the file content sent by the
attacker then navigates the user to this
URL after that URL loaded the attacker
would be notified and could override the
session in the web app taking control
over the account furthermore since
whatsapp only allows you to have one
session open at a time another bit of
code could be used to keep the account
open as long as the attacker wanted and
a user would be locked out telegram
required a little bit more work from the
user uploading a file is similar but in
this case it would be a video file and
the user would have to click on that
video after opening it for it to work in
telegrams case multiple active sessions
are allowed so the user wouldn't even
know both issues have since been fixed
by the companies the security
professionals advise users to stick with
using the mobile apps and not use Web
Apps at all for into an encryption for
Russians have been indicted on charges
by the US grand jury in the Northern
District of California for the hack of
over 500 million Yahoo accounts as
announced by the Attorney General just
sessions of the US Department of Justice
along with other agency directors and
I'm going to try to pronounce the names
correctly but it's probably going to be
wrong because I don't speak Russian so -
Dmitry do co-chef and Igor Shushan are
agents of the Russian Federal Security
Service and the other two Alexei Baylon
and Kareem veritas are Russian hackers
according to the FBI the hack occurred
due to a social engineering or spear
phishing attack against the Yahoo
employee Belon did some recon on the
internal networks of Yahoo to find the
Yahoo user database and the account
management tool used together both two
tools allow the attack
to find targeted accounts and make
changes to those accounts also they were
able to steal cookie data so they could
access accounts without changing
passwords the group used stolen cookies
to access more than 6500 Yahoo accounts
according to the FBI they were charged
for wire fraud trade secret theft and
economic espionage just to name a few
lastly this week is a story submitted by
Walter via our patreon community page
thank you so much Walter for
contributing Rob Joyce who previously
ran the NSA's Office of tailored access
operations that ta Oh for short is
heading to the White House to be the
White House cybersecurity coordinator
according to Tom beau cert homeland
security adviser
Joyce is well versed in offense and
defense for cyber security
according to Walters Post quote
previously sans reported in June 2016
the leader of most skilled people at the
NSA who carry out nation-state attacks
like Rob Joyce of t AO shared the
techniques his team would use to stop
nation-state attackers like themselves
in a briefing that was recorded in a 35
minute YouTube video which is linked
below in the show notes this is the most
authoritative talk on offense in forming
defense that I have ever seen it is
flash status because it's useful enough
that someone may try to remove it from
YouTube thinking it gives away too much
it doesn't do that what it does do is
provide the best evidence yet explaining
the CIS critical security controls and
very specific guides on how to implement
those controls are the best only way to
make NIST and ISO frameworks and
guidance useful in organizations that
take cybersecurity seriously and excerpt
I am going to use best practices for
exploitation are you going to use best
practices for defense it all comes down
to that before I go I want to give a
