5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are checking
out more of mal Tico's interface how to
add your own links and selection options
so today we're going to start with the
bars up at the top so you'll see several
different ones beginning with the
investigate tab over here and then you
see manage organized machines in
collaboration so we're just going to
stick with investigation investigate and
manage today so this tab gives you a
whole bunch of pretty clear options
they're very very obvious first is
pasting your nodes and those again are
the separate notes over on the side that
you can drag and drop into your graph
you can also do things such as copying
and cutting nodes you can clear nodes
and you also have the cut option do cut
copy and delete as well now when copying
and pasting you get options like
allowing melty go to keep the original
and skip or merge them so if i click
copy so i want to copy poterba comm so
i'll click on copy and then go down to
paste and choose paste you get a bunch
of options in here to either keep the
original you can skip an entity you can
keep both entities or merge the entities
and you have a bunch of options as well
down there so I'm going to just hey keep
both entities and then it'll make a
separate copy for me now you can also
copy nodes to a new graph as well by
right-clicking on your node so if I just
wanted to copy this one to new graph I
can choose copy to new graph and I can
copy with or without links and with or
without neighbors so links are the
arrows that you see checking one petrova
calm down to all of the different
transforms that I had created neighbors
are going to be anything around it
anything and basically in the graphical
interface of the first note that I chose
so I'm going to say copy with links I'm
not going to see any links because I
haven't made any and then I can go back
to my original graph so now you'll see
up here I have two graphs BAM
super super easy now you can also copy
with neighbors as I said before this
means that you can copy all parts of a
graph that our neighbor in the note that
you choose and these would be connected
with the original node with a whole
bunch of different arrows all sorts of
places now you can also copy to a
notepad with the right-click option as
well and the next item in the
investigate tab gives you the option to
show only 12 results or you can show all
of the results so say you have a really
really big graph with hundreds and
hundreds of different transforms that
you've created if I wanted to I could go
down here to number of results and I can
increase this all the way up to 110 k10
thousand two hundred that number right
there is 50 or twelve since I don't have
over twelve right now it's not
highlighted so I can't choose anything
over twelve transforms so next thing is
the quick fine this is going to let you
search your graph for a specific word or
a certain node great great choice to use
the quick fine if you have a very large
graph and next up we have entity
selection so entities are the actual
nodes on your graph if you click on
entity it goes to link selection link
selection are the arrows so I can click
on all these different links pretty cool
right so I'll go back to entity
selection under this this lets you
choose either to use multigo in link
selection mode or the entity selection
mode the other options allow you to
select multiple nodes as once you can
add similar siblings siblings are going
to be neighboring links on the same
general node and then you can also do
things such as select parents which are
going to be the main node that you bring
a transport form off of originally and
of course if we move over just a little
bit more we find a whole bunch of
options to zoom of course zoom is
self-explanatory so that doesn't take
very much to understand obviously you
can also choose to add your own links
between two nodes by left clicking on
one and then holding it till you reach a
target so say I want to connect Alpine
dot poterba comm and put turbo comm so I
can click on this choosing up here
you're going to choose link selection
and then left clicking on a node and
holding that down until you reach the
node that you
cific Lee want to link so if I move this
over you'll see two different arrows or
you'll see one different arrow
connecting the two nodes and from there
I can create a label for this one so
I'll call it my link I can change the
color I can change a label two global
settings either yes or no I can also
change the style the thickness and the
description of this when I hit that
it'll turn red and I'll show my title
next to it so you can tell that it's
very very easy to edit all those
different properties this can be very
handy if you need to create a report in
multi go to show like a general populace
or maybe your boss or something similar
to that I'll be right back with a little
bit more of the interface tutorial right
after the break the hex shop is hack
fives premier store for all your pen
testing needs including one of my
favorites I've told you about it before
but I'm gonna tell you again the USB
rubber ducky which looks like flash
drive and it types like a keyboard so it
can type scripts into a computer crazy
fast like this week's favorite from Mary
div it's a script that creates an
association for Windows 7 to connect to
the Wi-Fi pineapple that's pretty cool
and of course we couldn't do the show
without your support so we would like to
thank you with something special use the
coupon code snubs with any order for
your very own sign hack tip stickers and
thank you again so so much for
supporting the show we're back with more
melty go in more on links so you can
also change the properties of a link I
mentioned before you can right click
whoa who is so cool but you also have a
nice little window in the bottom right
hand corner that you can change
different things into so if I choose my
link right here and I just labeled it my
link you can go down here to the corner
and you can also change different things
down here so I can call it hack five yay
and then hit enter and it automatically
changes on my graph as well so pretty
easy way to also change your links now
you can't edit the links that are
generated by melty go at least I haven't
been able to so far in my testing and
you can highlight only one path taken
from one node to another via the
investigate tab as well so that's pretty
cool so for example if I wanted
- I could highlight let's say I can say
select also it selects all the different
paths I could say select none
select parents so if I choose reach
let's see let's choose this one there we
go
so a lot of these are not highlighted
right now because I don't have a lot of
options what I can do is I can bookmark
one so I could hit the little star right
there so I could bookmark it I can also
select by type so I can choose ones that
are DNS named or I could choose the ones
that are only do domain names or I could
choose MX records pretty cool and of
course you're going to have a lot more
different options under type if you have
a lot more different nodes on your graph
now under the manage tab I know that I
mentioned that and I'm just going to run
through it really really quick under the
manage tab you can choose to show your
custom link labels or not so that would
be located right here so I can choose to
uncheck that or I can check it I can
show my transform links or not if you
end up showing all these links obviously
your graph is going to get pretty
cluttered pretty fast so only show the
ones that you really need for whatever
you happen to be working on and there's
some other pretty obvious directories
and information under manage if I want
to I can choose local transform wizard
so this is going to enter details for a
new transform I can also do manage
transforms and discover new transforms
pretty cool and I can do things under
here for entities and over on the right
side we have showing notes so if I want
to create notes I can show them there
show additional labels and document
information all of this is pretty
self-explanatory so I'm not going to go
into crazy crazy details about them all
but next week I'll show you a little bit
more about the interface but I think
I've talked about me way too much this
week so let's go ahead and end it now
let me know what you think about multigo
and what your favorite commands in it or
different transforms that you've had a
lot of fun with tell me what you've
discovered with multigo how you have
actually used it in real life so send me
a comment below or you can email us tips
at hack 5 org be sure to check out our
sisters
hak5 for more great stuff just like this
whoo I'm tired from that week at Def Con
so I'll be over there reminding you to
trust your Tecna list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
