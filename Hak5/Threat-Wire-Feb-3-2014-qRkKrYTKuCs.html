against Germany orange gets hacked the
UK gets secret courts and the life of
hacker hero Aaron Schwartz is celebrated
on the silver screen just one year after
his tragic death all that more this time
on threat wire hello internets I missed
you
if you don't recall I'm Darrin kitchen
not only from hack five but also this
year's show threat wire it's a little
bit of a reboot so please don't mind the
fact that it's a little rough around the
edges but otherwise this is your summary
of what's threatening security privacy
and Internet freedom and we begin today
with the Chaos Computer Club or say say
say as well as the International League
for human rights they today filed a
complaint with the federal prosecutor as
a general's office in Germany and if
you're not familiar the CCC is Germany
and well I mean Europe for that matters
largest and longest-running hacker club
they've been going for 32 years
the criminal complaint against the
German federal government and Germany's
secret services like the bundes bundes
the vice- v al Khaimah mine duchess Nick
so good sorry I can't pronounce that um
as well as the US British and German
agents the supervisors German Ministry
of the Interior and German Chancellor of
quote illegal and prohibited covert
intelligence activities of aiding and
embedding those activities of violating
the rights of privacy and the
obstruction of justice in office by
barring the cooperation with the
electronic surveillance of German
citizens by NSA and GCHQ
now the CCC asked to hear technical
expert and whistleblower Edward Snowden
as a witness and requested he be granted
safe passage and protection from
extradition to the US the CCC lawyer
Julius mins Vai says that quote
investigation by the federal prosecutor
general is necessary and mandatory by
law no such investigation has happened
within Germany though it is reported
that German federal prosecutors are
weighing the diplomatic ramifications of
even investigating the NSA hacking of
German chance
Angela Merkel's phone this isn't
actually the first time that a European
government has you know come under fire
for this kind of spying I mean last
month we saw the European Court of Human
Rights actually request the UK
government to justify the legal grounds
of its mass surveillance activities this
was prompted by again another CCC
supported group this one privacy not
prism you can learn more over at privacy
not to prism org dot UK you know it's
not just the NSA and GCHQ that have all
your phone records no an unknown hacker
group made off with some 800,000
customer records from European telco
orange personal data includes names
mailing addresses email landline and
mobile phone numbers orange technical
director stated that quote passwords
we're not affected and less than three
percent of customers were affected still
if you're one of them stay on the
lookout for phishing attacks and by all
means change your password for you if
you're a journalist in the UK be warned
currently while your notes photos
digital files that can be seized request
for such seizures must happen in an open
court that may not be the case after
today the seizures could now be
conducted in secret hearings due to a
deregulation bill that has come before
the Commons now the rules won't change
on how the police access that data
however since no media outlets could be
present in these secret courts the fear
is that judges will be persuaded to just
go ahead and sign off on them I'll be
keeping an eye on this one and
continuing to do as I always do and that
is fly through Heathrow with a blank
harddrive
just one year after tragic death of our
hacker hero Aaron Schwartz his life is
being profiled now celebrated in a
feature-length documentary it's titled
the Internet's own boy and it's directed
by Brian natin Berger who's previously
done we are legion the story of the
hacktivists it debuted this week at the
Sundance Film Festival the documentary
includes home movies photographs video
clips of his television appearances as
well as interviews with friends and
families to kind of draw the paths from
the programming prodigy to the Internet
activists leading up to is a
and of course the treatment by our
government the documentary also goes a
bit into Aarons law the attempt at
reforming the 1986 Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act which unfortunately hasn't
been getting much attention from
Congress who is kind of preoccupied with
the whole Snowden thing the Internet's
own boy is the story of Aaron Schwartz
Aaron Schwartz was a software programmer
internet prodigy whose fingerprints are
pretty much all over the Internet
Aaron was initially arrested for
downloading academic journal articles
from the online service JSTOR he never
did anything with them
but that began to your nightmare for him
that really kind of kept ratcheting up
in intensity that ended with his his own
suicide about a year ago but still I
mean I I'm honestly I'm thankful because
I've seen nappin burgers work and I at
South by Southwest with the premiere of
of we are legion and and I think that
this has the potential to you know kind
of bring this awareness to a larger
audience I'm thankful for him putting
forth his energy in this it's just I'm
just still infuriated I I'm still my
soul was crushed by this and every time
I think about this story it just leaves
me feeling empty so kind of bittersweet
but I will be looking into this and now
typically we do have a comment every
week but since we've been on hiatus I
guess we're gonna have to start fresh
and with that like I said just like to
ask you to you know ask you what's in
your heart like how do you how do you
feel about the Aaron Schwartz
documentary and please keep it positive
in those comments also remember that you
can subscribe over at threat wire org

where the conversation goes on all week

Allen char and others for submitting
awesome stories such as the one about
James clapper or wanting a Snowden to go
ahead and return those documents he
stole the Canadian spy agencies using
Wi-Fi to track you and the NSA using
LinkedIn to hack a Belgian cryptographer
professor that one's really good check

and a bonus thanks to everyone who has
