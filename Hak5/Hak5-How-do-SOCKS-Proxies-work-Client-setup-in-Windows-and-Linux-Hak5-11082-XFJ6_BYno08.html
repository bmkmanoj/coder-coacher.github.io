by ting all right it's time to set up
our socks5 Roxy let's do it it's got
some tall yes let's do it here I'm going
to show you in Linux first real quick
because that's totally easy basically
SSH tak capital D and then a port number
on they use 8080 and then user at your
host and then boom wait seriously
yeah that's pretty much it and then I
actually haven't set up key pairs so
it's gonna ask me to login and I'll add
that host and then I'll give it the
password and we'll be all set but you
know suffice to do well that's the real
basic in fact we're gonna expand a lot
more in Linux here soon when we get into
key authorization and maintaining
persistence but but for the basic but
for figuration yeah yeah that's that's
the gist of it how is Linux easier than
the one that I doing when I was Linux
easier it's always easier come on know
that ok well this is the one for Windows
you download putty you open it and then
you go
UK tank fire dancers name yeah you
entering your host name for it and just
gonna leave it way to whatever that's
the default then I go down here to
tunnels mmm and I choose I'm gonna
choose port 8080 because this sounds
good
and then 127.0.0.1 mmm it's my home and
then I hit dynamic and hit add and then
open and then mine's gonna ask for my
username and password to maybe one day
yeah well they know it was going a
little slow today network is slow did it
there we go nothing and I won't see that
part up well it's really slow there it
goes alright magically it goes on after
we cut off the webcam yeah so guess what
Darren yes I am no clue what I just did
yeah let's break it down I mean that
this isn't even the best way to go about
it there's slicker ways and we're gonna
be getting into that but I figured we
just lay the fundamentals yeah we're
gonna do this
keys so that you don't have to type your
password all the time automate it so
that it's not some ugly box and we'll
make it services and cool stuff like
that well I the technology is basically
the same the way that it's happening
right now
this is just one step of it obviously
the next thing is configuring your
browsers yeah and didn't we like skip
the whole week's actual setup of the
proxy yeah actually that to your right
the server in this case was already set
up from I got a private server at
domain.com and the way that they're set
up by default is that they naturally
since they have SSH installed will go
ahead and accept connections for Sox
products ok so this is just a client
this is just the client side next week
I'll get into how to configure the SSH
daemon on Windows and Linux but you know
for the most part this though as the
user is like a good example of how to
start getting you know using it I mean
the next thing obviously configuring
your browser and we'll get into that in
a bit with some cool browser extensions
to make that easier
but essentially what you've done now is
if we say this is your laptop right yes
I'm assuming that's my laptop that's
your laptop right and so you're on
wireless network here at the at the hak5
studio and then we've got this server up
here in the cloud it's our virtual
private server because you know we don't
wanna spend a whole lot of money and
this way it's really easy okay and this
virtual private server is up in the
cloud with the rest of the internets
right right and so what you've done now
is you've created this this connection
here start using one colors yeah you've
created this fun connection here to the
internet private server
oh - okay - the VPS got it and it's
inside this tunnel Oh that'll be sssssh
right that's why in putty it tells me
SSH tunnel exactly so that's the
terminology is this right here is our
tunnel so I'm basically connecting from
my computer through a secure tunnel to
the VPS
and then the VPS is connecting me to the
internet right and so the way that it
typically works is with SSH and putty
you would normally just go ahead and
type in that host name or the IP address
yeah as well as well the ports default
22 in this case and then you click OK
login you'd be all set right and yeah
what that would provide you access to is
like the actual command line on that
server so that you can administer it ah
what you did when you went down into
putty under tunnels and created that
dynamic yeah Tunnel is that you um you
basically said hey I want to be able to
from this virtual private server here
now go out to other web sites on the
internet so we'll say like Facebook is
over here you know and maybe Twitter is
here okay well I have a question um so
before actually connected to the VPS the
ddk dot hack 5 org yeah I had to put in
my password before I could connect hmm
couldn't somebody sniff my password and
figure out how to get on to the tunnel
yes and that's why in the next week
we're going to be talking about
key-based authentication using symmetric
key pairs and that's going to be able to
prevent now it's SSH inherently is
secure at least in this case we're using
SSH version 2 there is a vulnerability
in SSH version one where you could
pretty much that's an age you can pretty
much get the the password from someone
ok that's we're using version 2 and
still there's opportunities to fake that
stuff convince the client to go back
down to v1 if it's configured
incorrectly or at least in my mind and
yes you could potentially get the
password or you can connect to the wrong
server or whatnot that's why we're going
to do SSH key pairs ok cool and we'll
get into that later
now dynamic um earlier when we discussed
PI e you were like do dynamic what's the
difference between that local and the
other one remote remote my three choices
sure so you know there's the you've got
the opportunity to
make a dynamic tunnel as well as a local
or remote now what a remote would mean
is say there's like the hak5 IRC right
so we've got an IRC server over here and
we want to create a connection to this
IRC server so that our communications
with it are always secure right yeah
it's like VPS to it and so what we could
do you know because because over here
like you know this now this endpoint is
encrypted yeah and so now to connect our
VPS to the IRC server what we would do
is we would make a remote connection and
then we would specify the IP address of
our IRC server here and a port number in
this case IRC is port six six six nine
okay and we'd make a port that we
connect to it on we'll make it six six
six eight whatever you want and that way
what will happen is when you go to the
VPS you now have a remote link on that
port over to your IRC server ok so
remote is just for like one specific
site or write server whatever website
there you go and then dynamic is for
like the entire internet there you go
awesome ok cool so I want to be on
dynamic and then a local would be
another like local resource because it's
not just this one virtual private server
up in the cloud there's multiple - and
so if there were say this was the hak5
office I'd be able to you know get
access to or share resources between
those two networks like your printer
things like that what about that port
the port numbers you were mentioning
well that's ok that's like sometimes
when you log in it says you know port 22
is already filled out and I'm just like
why port chain 22 well the port 22 380
80 well that's a better question the
port 22 is because that's what SSH uses
up you know every deborah's is a port
and for the most part and SSH decides to
use 22 that's one of the lower ones now
the reason that you did 8080 is because
you can choose anything between 1025
10:25 and 65,536 or five I can't
remember I think it's five you you could
technically use you know lower than like
10 pounds yeah you could use 1024 in
below but it's like not recommended or
it's going to get difficult like for
example and Linux you need root access
to do it I just say use anything between
these and you're going to be fine
because it's easier yeah okay and those
are just the magic numbers that you put
in make a pour it out into the
wilderness right so when you're doing
though when you're creating that tunnel
is that you're you specified 1 to 7.1 to
7.0 0.1 I've seen that number before on
those shirts that says there's no place
like 1 - 700 - old wood or or an IP
version 5 : : 1 but that's a that's a
different discussion um yes so that is
what's known as localhost so your
machines that my machine that's your
machine so your machine or typically has
like a couple of interfaces uh W LAN 0
it's going to be called something
different in Windows but on the Linux
side this is your wireless LAN you'll
have your ETA 0 the H 0 that's your
wired Ethernet port you'll also have low
on Linux or on Windows I forget what
it's called but basically these 3
interface your Wi-Fi your Ethernet and
your local and that local here that is
that number that's the local oh ok it's
a loopback so basically you could run a
web server on your machine and then you
could go to web in fact that's how I
develop like PHP you know I run a web
server on my machine yeah I go to HTTP
colon slash slash 127.0.0.1 and then I
see the web server that I'm running and
I'm not I don't have to share it with
anybody else but by myself and that way
I can develop stuff yeah it's running
services locally ok I think I I'm
getting it now well what this is getting
and you read
this connection here once you 7.0 2 0 at
1 or 80 80 mm-hmm what you're making is
basically an alias what you're saying is
so you're giving your computer and
nickname well not necessarily a nickname
as much as it's now kind of like a route
so for example we've got like on your
computer
yeah your web browser would cool little
dots and you get some tabs over here and
you're like hmm so much for something
you know and it's like your web browser
you can specify a socks5 proxy in it it
is socks5 compliant lots of different
programs are and so you can say hey web
browser I want you to use a proxy and
it's like oh what's the address the
proxy and you say it's me oh my local
host so this is why even though I'm
using putty to startup the connection to
the VPS proxy I also have to go into my
browser and set it up via the browser
else the browser's not going to know any
difference right because it's just going
to try to connect to the internet
there's there's two parts to your
connection to that virtual private
server ok there's in this case DDK hak5
was the host name and that's up here in
the cloud right that's the external
facing or on the cloud kind of thing
right and then they're used
it's also your 127.0.0.1 on port 8080 so
this one is 22 this one is 8080 and so
what you're doing is you're making a
relationship between and connections so
now you can have multiple SSH tunnels to
various servers roaming I don't like
switch between em or have like a
specific one to go to a specific site
Hey absolutely you don't have to use
8080 it's just that's the port that gets
abused for everything I'd like to use to
701 5 because it reminds me a
counterstrike
regardless you know this virtual private
server is here in the United States
there's and then why are you answer and
then there's Alaska right it's a
terrible Alaska ok so when I put that
number into putty up
destination wouldn't the internet be my
destination well that's the beautiful
thing is the Internet is your
destination through this so what will
happen here is when you go you know pull
up your web page now it's going to be
when it's configured to use your proxy
to your localhost which will then go out
through your tunnel your virtual private
server and then since its dynamic good
go out to your Facebook or whatever
website you pulled up okay yeah oh okay
and then and then it's going to come
back to one yeah yeah yeah that's why
it's my destination twice your
destination so yeah I'm understanding
you awesome
okay now do I have to set up every
single program on my computer to use the
proxy well like I said a web browser is
a great browser
well no here's the thing a web browser
is a good example because it's socks5
compliant a lot of other programs like
for example I think pigeon is as well
valiant utorrent do I have to setup that
one
I think utorrent can do it as well but
that's the thing is it's a it's a thing
that your client or I'm sorry your
client your your program has to be able
to understand how so in essence it's not
as beautiful as say like you know of a
VPN which looks very similar to this
yeah nature except it it becomes what is
known as your default gateway and this
does not do that and there's ways to
hack around that and make that work but
when we get into VPNs we'll talk about
the routes and how to make this do
everything yeah for right now we're just
worrying about our web connection I get
it programs will do it pidgin will do it
you know whatever programs you may have
you know I got to be honest like when
when I was first studying this I had no
interest in it I was just like I don't
get this I don't know why I would ever
want to use this freaking putty freakin
proxies I would understand here's why
now I get it
yeah here's what you would want to okay
so you're just hanging out
at the coffee shop as you do right and
yeah better than this some people might
not right and so there's a couple apps
Wi-Fi these got some laptops hanging out
around here right and and uh oh what's
up with this guy oops that is horrible
Dan it's a it's a fez yeah we'll make it
we'll make it a he's got a little tassel
going on
hi boom we've got a black Fez on that oh
it's a bust
yeah we've got a hacker oh no there's a
hacker in the Gibson who's using the
work load of like three users something
honest am I going through this SSH
antenna was going to encrypt all my
traffic so that he won't be able to
steal my password right because you know
when you're on the with ease yes and
he's on the with ease specifically open
ones yeah you could basically use
Firesheep or other great tools that
we've talked about in the past so if you
were going to make your connection over
to Facebook by going through your
wireless LAN so go from your computer
through your wireless LAN over to
Facebook and the entire time this
section is visible today open yeah but
if you use this you know he could see
this this whole tunnel if you can't get
in the tunnel well it's just garbage
ah okay so garbage pile man to thrashing
rights and stuff this is awesome cool I
totally get it we scribbled enough I got
a lot more to cover let's get into some
extensions yeah I want to find out how
this works in just a bit
we'll be back
you guys know as well as I do that the
mobile phone experience includes a lot
of headache a lot of confusion and
powerlessness when the plans are just
littered with hidden fees and steep
penalties stupid rules
unnecessary premiums and you know the
bottom line is as a consumer you're
either overpaying or being underserved
now ting is a new service brought to you
by some cool geeks up in Canada that
bring us clarity usability and big
savings to mobile phone users and
they've built a service based on the
Sprint network so they've offering 4G
Android phones to create a customer
experience like no other and the support
folks are smart passionate and will
actually empower you to solve the
problems you know not some automated
phone trees who loves those most
importantly ting has one simple plan
that offers fair and honest pricing get
this megabytes minutes and text messages
each of them billed separately if you
use less than you anticipated it's no
big deal they're going to credit you the
difference at the end of the month if
you use more they're simply going to
bump you up to the next appropriate plan
without any premiums or hidden penalties
just head over to ting comm slash hack 5
and check out their online savings
calculator and you'll see why I really
don't leave home without my Tang modem
you know how I feel about Wi-Fi but
seriously this stuff is awesome for that
and they're gonna hook you up with up to
75 dollars off your first month if you
