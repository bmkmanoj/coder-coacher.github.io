its 1.1.1 service it claims to speed up
your internet connection while adding
security but does it really work how
does it work and why to answer these
questions let's look at what the service
really is in essence 1.1 1.1 is an
alternative DNS server so let's break it
down a DNS server in layman's terms is
the phone book of the internet it's a
table of all the domain names that you
can remember like example.com
and their corresponding IP addresses DNS
servers come in many different forms
from ones run by nonprofits corporations
and commonly Internet service providers
cloud flairs 1.1 1.1 is an alternative
because for the most part people tend to
use the dns server that comes by default
with their internet service more
technically speaking when you connect
your phone or computer to a network say
a coffee shops Wi-Fi your university the
network at your office or even at your
home a server on that network usually
gives it an IP address along with some
settings one of these settings is which
DNS server to use the default
configuration for most phones and
computers is to use whatever the server
gives it but these values can be
overridden by overriding the default
with an alternative like cloud flairs
1.1 1.1 you are choosing to use that DNS
server or Internet address book over the
one provided by the network there are
many alternative DNS servers than what
your ISP may provide like Open DNS is
208 6 7 tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu or Google's
888 but what are the advantages to using
an alternative DNS server in the case of
cloud flairs 1.1 1.1 they are billing it
as both faster and more secure ok so how
does this make your internet connection
faster as an example when you go to a
web page say example.com
your computer needs to look up the IP
address associated with that page before
it can ask the server hosting that web
page for its content the process of
looking up the IP address is made
possible by querying DNS in essence your
computer must go to its DNS server and
say hey what's the IP address of
example.com before
can go to example.com and say hey
example.com give me your webpage this
lookup process takes time the longer you
have to wait for the DNS server to get
back to you with this information the
longer it will take before you can even
ask the domain for its webpage typically
this is pretty quick because for sites
that you frequent your computer will
cache or remember their IP address
before domains that your computer does
not know the IP address of it'll have to
go up to the cloud ask the DNS server
and wait for a response what makes it
even more challenging is that not all
DNS servers or Internet address books if
you will know all of the answers
sometimes your computer will say hey
what's the IP address of this esoteric
domain and the DNS server will be like
hmm that's not in my listing hang on a
sec I'll ask someone up the food chain
and then it will last the next DNS
server if it has the IP address of the
esoteric domain you're looking for and
if that server does not have the address
it too will need to ask another DNS
server and so on and so on eventually if
you are asking for a domain so unique
that none of the lower-level DNS servers
have it in their cache they will have to
ask one of the root servers so the root
name servers or root DNS servers are a
set of thirteen DNS servers
strategically located around the world
that maintain a list of all domains on
the internet without these in essence
there is no internet that we know of
today it's also the reason why when you
register a new domain or make a DNS
change it'll be some time before it
takes effect that's because the new
domain gets added into the root servers
databases and they have to not only
synchronize with each other but they
need to disseminate this new data down
to the lower level servers as well you
might be asking yourself now why don't
we all just ask the thirteen root
servers but that would not be super
efficient and it's a topic that we could
cover in another video
suffice it to say back in the 90s it
could take days for a new domain to
propagate across the vast number of DNS
servers on the Internet today it is just
hours or less right in fact before 1973
every computer online kept its own
complete listing of every other computer
on the then pre-internet in a file
called host
txt as you might imagine this caused
numerous problems when names and numbers
changed not everybody updated their own
copy at the same time so to make things
easier in 1974 Stanford University was
basically appointed king of the internet
and started keeping the master copy of
this magical host txt file every now and
then people online would grab an updated
copy of the pre-internet directory from
Stanford and if you wanted to be added
to the Internet you basically emailed
Stanford and said hey you want to add me
to that list it wasn't until about a
decade later that DNS would become a
thing though the host that txt file
lives on today seriously it's still on
your computer right now go take a look
so this DNS architecture makes it so
that not every DNS server on the
Internet
needs to have the complete data set
because if they can't answer a client's
question they can always ask up the
chain until an answer is found in more
recent time hardware advances have meant
that it's more affordable for a single
server to have most if not all the
answers in this case for the majority of
queries an answer can be given without
needing to spend extra time asking up
the chain and therein lies white cloud
flares 1.1.11
is supposedly faster than your ISPs
default DNS server because for the
majority of DNS queries you're going to
ask they've got the answer because they
have spent a lot of money on a big
server that can keep a ton of records
and look them up super quick and that's
pretty much it so as we've described
when your computer tries to pull up a
webpage asking a DNS server for its IP
address is only a very small part of
browsing to that site once the DNS
server gives your computer the answer
they're out of the loop and it's up to
that website to respond so as you can
see a very fast alternative DNS server
can in effect make your internet
browsing faster but only by a small
margin in the next video we will look at
the security aspects of DNS and a new
technology that promises to make DNS
queries secure without a whole lot of
complication so what do you think
