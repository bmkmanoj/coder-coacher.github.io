malware a court deems PC border seizure
unreasonable and hackers really like
their caffeine fix all that coming up
now on threat wire I'm Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for May 13 2015
you summary of what's threatening our
security privacy and Internet freedom
hey thank you to everyone who has
supported the relaunch of the show we
couldn't be more proud of this awesome
community and of course if you guys are
new to threat wire on the hack 5 Channel
this is the show that we did for a year
on tech feed and now we brought it back
so let's go ahead and get started
whenever you get a new router for your
house or your office do you change the
default username and password not the
Wi-Fi password but the password to
change settings and things like that on
your router nope
do you know if your router has enabled
remote administration meaning that you
can change settings even if you aren't
on the same local network yeah that's a
problem with a lot of consumer routers
they support usability / security a DDoS
protection firm called encapsulating a
series of denial of service attacks
commonly referred to as DDoS attacks
since December they've recorded over
40,000 IP addresses from 1,600 ISPs
where attacks are coming in from the
attacks are being used to overwhelm
websites with so much traffic that they
become ddosed or the website basically
just goes kaput for a while the routers
are infected with several different
types of malware and the compromised
router could also be used to snoop on
data transmitted or get access to other
info on the network such as network
security cameras that's a little scary
because an intruder can simply use a
shell script to search for an open SSH
port on a router and attempt to log in
with the default credentials and then
boom they have access so how do I as a
small business owner protect my network
router from intrusion first off make
sure that your username and password are
not set as the defaults second scan for
commonly used ports to make sure that
they aren't open with a tool like the
one from you get signal calm down in the
show notes you would want to scan for
ports 22 23 80 and 443 and lastly make
sure that your firmware on your router
is up-to-date Hey do you remember how
if you travel across US borders your
computer and phone can be searched and
seized for pretty much any reason the
Fourth Amendment protects us from that
kind of thing but at the border that
protection doesn't really exist luckily
a federal judge for the US District
Court of DC named Amy Berman Jackson
disagrees after a Korean business man's
computer was seized and then duplicated
and searched her court granted a
suppression of the data saying that
there was a lack of reasonable suspicion
of ongoing or imminent criminal activity
and it was invasive to the man's privacy
this is the third time a case has ended
with this kind of outcome and it is a
good thing to hopefully this will stir a
new precedent that seizing laptops or
other devices is a huge invasion of
privacy and can disrupt a person's life
given that it takes weeks for a device
to be returned after an investigation
and lastly in the head to desk part of
the internet apparently hackers are
stealing money from folks who are using
the Starbucks mobile app with auto
reload on they're linked credit cards
this is how it works when you sign up
with your Starbucks loyalty card you can
download the mobile app and then you can
pay with it the app requires that you
sign on to you Starbucks account to set
it up and then when you want to go buy a
coffee or my favorite a Frappuccino you
can just scan your mobile app barcode at
the register if you have auto reload
turned on you can automatically send
money from your linked credit card to
your loyalty card whenever your balance
goes low so then you can still get those
gold stars hackers were able to log into
a user's account run the balance Solo on
the loyalty card that the linked credit
card would just keep getting charged and
then they could change the email address
on the account and some themselves a new
gift card to either use or sell on a
black market so principally this goes to
show as a huge reminder that if your
username and your password for your
Starbucks account or for any account for
that matter is really easy to guess you
might want to change those there is no
fraud detection set up for auto reload
within the app luckily Starbucks is
covering a lot of those issues you may
want to turn off auto reload as well or
just unlink your credit card I seriously
feel like hackers really like caffeine
don't they I wanted to take a moment and
remind everyone watching the show that

feature your comment on our next threat
wire and before I go I want to give a
huge thanks to everyone who has
supported the show so far over on
patreon if you can find value from the
show and you can spare a few cents an
episode or even just a month please

episode because they are all so friggin
adorable I just want to hug all of them
our plan is to do this show three times
