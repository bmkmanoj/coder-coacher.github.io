packets backing up your cloud identity
and more I'm Shannon Morse and you are
watching hak5
this week's episode of pack 5 is brought
to you by netflix go to assist Express
remote support made easy and domain com
got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain hello and welcome to
another episode of hak5 my name is
darren kitchen and this is your weekly
dose of technol list we have an amazing
experience to know I'm gonna know did
what would he wait didn't introduce me
did you already forget about me who are
you and what are you doing on my set ya
know she is back ladies and gentlemen it
is smells in studio damn right or what's
left of it yeah what did you do I've
been gone for a month and you've taken
down almost the entire set well where
did our TV go you've sold everything I
am it's all part of the plan Oh actually
we set this plan in motion 701 before
getting laid off anyway so the fact that
they said we can't afford to pay anymore
just kind of goes to you know they set
me free you like a dumb yeah what do you
do for it what do you do now I'm a
podcaster really and nobody knows what
that is except for people that watch her
show I tried to explain that to somebody
on the airplane when I came over here to
Virginia you came all the way over here
because we're we're shooting an episode
in Toronto that'll be next week so stay
tuned for that but but you came over
from Waynesville sir yeah from
Waynesville listen where I've been
shooting the show on my own which has
been a great experience yes with these
little guys awesome by the way yeah I
love that camera if four episodes into
this season and are 50 for with remote
and I think that it's so far the process
is really worked out really well I'm so
I'm actually having tons of fun with it
and I've made my brother a camera guy
and my friend CCL so yes I'm not even
fun seeing yourself you're coming up
with great stuff and I love it but it's
so much better having you here and oh I
missed you too I know you know squee
much come on at least he didn't glomp me
so I don't know smell funny hey what's
not ok so excellent show for you guys
this week though we've got some
follow-ups about the Wi-Fi hacks from
last week
you've got ways to protect your online
identity yes but first we got some
feedback about what well remember the
Zipit yeah how could we forget in fact
yeah had you unpacked it and remember to
bring it we be showing up a new user
land and make it work for you Justin
boxes it is we've got a new user and
land image for fun hackery stuff kind of
coming up later with the Zipit swim meet
ever subs gets around finding the box
yes I'll find it but we got somebody
that's sending something similar this is
sent in by his name is guy and he writes
in and just says I just thought you
might want to take a look at this it's a
tiny netbook or a big zip it now I'm not
sure it doesn't have Wi-Fi but at least
you get to choose your own chip and when
you use USB maybe you could roll an air
serv ng on a phone and well you get the
idea it is the nano note and it really
does look kind of like a zip it it's
copyleft hardware so yeah it's open
hardware okay full linux kernel it's
based on open wrt awesome which is the
same thing that you know the pineapples
based on right it's got similar specs to
the Zipit in similar form factor and
everything at three thirty six megahertz
you know mips cpu so kind of similar to
a smartphone really released last jen's
it's got a 320 240 color display also
takes the SD micro SD has a headphone
jack that's kind of nice it's missing
something Wi-Fi yes yeah that's no
that's bad we can't have this nope
object and how much it how much does it
cost 100 bucks oh no screw that i'm not
sure if it's just development boards at
this point but i'd much prefer the Zipit
really i'll be honest i love you know i
love tinkering with little linux fidgety
devices bits I mean I know that you're
big fan of that but it it's more fun
when instead of buying a hundred dollar
development board that's made for that
you take a fifty-dollar consumer
electronics and make it do something it
wasn't supposed to hey yeah so thanks
for sending that in it's pretty cool
keep sending those in because we love
little Linux gadgets here to play with
but I'm going to
I want to know my fam yeah it's a shame
that it doesn't have that but cool specs
mm-hmm other than us PE I mean with
Wi-Fi or with USB you might be able to
do a little Wi-Fi anyway whatever I
digress um ooh big stuff happening with
a new project it's been in the works for
gosh almost a year now if you guys have
been following hak5 you know that we
have big projects on a regular basis and
the fact that's one was supposed to be
for last season just got too caught up
and right but but you know with some of
the original series or whatever the the
USB switchblade USB hacksaws stuff like
that and then which were great USB
devices for penetration testing physical
security good stuff and you know then
with the Wi-Fi stuff working with Robin
on Yas Agha and then again with the
Interceptor on the network side and
working with Tim and a couple others
again for a new project and I thought I
would just tease you about what's going
on here because it turns out at the last
few con we ran into Adrian remember
Adrian antique iron geek right so he's
actually doing a little mini talk on
this right now because we both got
talking and I was like hey we're
actually working on a very similar
project and you know I was gonna send
him a demo unit and everything next
thing you know he emails he's like hey
so I'm working on this chip and I'm like
that's the exact chip and your code is
doing exactly what I so so we've been
working on it together now and it's
pretty good to collaborate and stuff
it's just amazing how you know hacker
minds work acting too like yeah so so I
don't know how well this is going to
come up on screen maybe I'll just go to
my wallpaper and here is the USB rubber
ducky in fact if you saw that discovery
interview I did a few months back you
probably saw this guy so they'll just do
this in this cam and USB rubber ducky
nothing crazy about this plug it into my
USB port oh oh is that what what what
was that I saw that little black yeah
what happened at atomizer open back door
with a bunch of ports did a lot of
reconnaissance it OMG yeah so like the
Switchblade except better because it's
windows mac and linux and there's no
software just detect it and it doesn't
rely on exploiting a hole in like XP
it's you know it'll work just as well on
a windows 95 box as it would work on it
windows 7 box as it would work on its
every 2003 or a mac or linux or whatever
you want to do it so i don't want to
give too much away but I just kind of
wanted to tease you about this one new
project if your a/c coder if you're like
super sharp with C and in embedded stuff
you might want to hit me up but other
than that you'll see more of it in the
coming weeks cool I guess yeah look
forward to that exciting alright so that
was a fun lengthy a block we haven't
done one of those in a while I know it's
been forever yeah I've missed the studio
not so much you but the stoat studio
well it's different with you out there
because the show takes kind of a
different more produced feel and
everything's just like a lot faster so
this is a more laid-back OG stay right
here yeah I don't know it's too early oh
yeah we've got to drive 700 miles after
this show so no beers yet I'm not
driving you get will get a rickards red
when we get into dude yeah oh we get
into Rick go get into Canada laser head
a.m. tomorrow but we'll still have a
beer that's fine with me i always drink
early when i'm in all right well let's
get going to push it and tell us about
this week's LAN party yay our next LAN
party powered by the bar siiii sports
league is left for dead we'll be playing

hak5 got a great idea it all starts with
a great domain at domain.com so last
week Darren had this challenge to get a
whole bunch of clients to associate with
his Wi-Fi pineapple using a d
authentication attack courtesy of
airdrop ng and of course this led to a
whole bunch of viewer questions like
this one from mark be how does D off
work if a client's connected to an AP
when they're using encryption it's a
good ? it lies in the way that Wi-Fi is
made the 802 11 working group the people
that bring us Wi-Fi be a and G that's
best bang why why Wi-Fi group are you
are you trying to say something Wi-Fi !
a GN okay i guess it was be AG in
bagging baggins link dildo oh my gosh
anyway we're totally gaga so um but know
that the management frames are part of
the the spec that the 802 dot11 working
group put together and it basically says
that there's all of these different
parts of
of managing and establishing a Wi-Fi
connection so they are authentication
which is basically like the challenge in
the response is the handshake if it's an
open Wi-Fi there's really nothing to it
if there's encryption then there will be
like a regular encryption handshake
whether it be WEP or Swiss cheese which
is the same thing or WPA yeah then
there's Association request which is
like hello I would like to associate
with you I'm sure you get lots of emails
like that yeah yeah and then there's an
association response which is either you
know acceptance or rejection or have
their generally rejection well you
probably just hit ignore but then
there's a reassociation request which is
so like if you take your laptop and like
you're on a big like campus university
with ya bunch of Wi-Fi you walk out of
range well then you find like another
one that's got a stronger signal and you
ask it to reassociate and then it's got
a response whether you know yea or nay
there's a beacon which is a management
frame which is basically the access
point saying i am linksys hear me roar
you know just broadcasting it's SSID
it's time stamps there's probe request
we talk about those in the segment
because that's what your laptop sends
out when you turn it on because it
remembers your Wi-Fi okay and it's like
is linksys around is my work life I run
those are probe requests and then probe
responses are what the pineapple all
right yeah Liam the pineapple says yes I
am here wait my broken one oh I tried to
make it better more gooder and I I
didn't work so well dinner I let the
magic smoke out good job um but that's
what it mimics that's what it's spoofs
is the responses zone of the legitimate
one and then last but not least i think
one of the most interesting ones the
authentication packet basically just
terminates a communication session
secure and secure and all of these work
whether it's you know Wi-Fi with wpa
with WEP with whatever and they're all
unencrypted because that's
because that's the way that 80 to 911
working group put it in the spec and
it's just that that's their very nature
management frames are unencrypted okay
and it makes sense because you couldn't
have an encrypted association request or
an authentication request because we
can't we can't begin speaking in
encrypted unless we've talked unless
we've already shared the keys and
figured it out yeah except the D
authentication you would figure might
want to be encrypted just because well
if you're d autentico ting me that means
I've already associated with you so
we're already speaking encrypted why do
you want to know but it works in our
favor okay so this leads on to another
viewer question that we had for this one
this is from test account if that is
really your name mm-hmm I was wondering
how do i prevent the dr authorized
attacks and man in a man-in-the-middle
attacks on my laptop or computer all
right test account here's the deal as
far as I know far of rewriting the
firmware in your Wi-Fi radio probably
not going to be able to convince it to
just go ahead and blatantly ignore the
authentication packet we can however
monitor for them and then you'll at
least know when you're getting a d off
packet I know that kismet just natively
goes ahead and shows you though I don't
have enough kismet foo to pipe it out
into something and said knock and make
little things pop up with growl or
whatever but but suffice it in fact we
just got to get dragon on from kismet
cuz yeah I've got to have him on but so
if i justit to say it's not that
difficult in fact i posed the question
to twitter and within a few minutes
tinman or 10 man 2k as he's known on
twitter went ahead and put together a
python script that does just that it
uses ska-p as one of those awesome
Python libraries for for the stuff and
it also relies on the air crack sweet so
you still have to use airmon-ng to put
into modern monitor mode so you can you
know see all the packets in the air and
stuff but it will you know ill it will
watch the traffic and
sniff out those individual bits it it
warns you when authentication has
happened Association has happened and D
authentication has happened okay so
you've got the Tonka yes you and take a
look yeah I see you're going to be the
attacker and I'm going to be the victim
here sweet alright so I've already set
it up in backtrack are three I haven't
updated that one and went ahead and got
you the latest aircrack-ng so you can
also use exiles tool suite okay so i've
already got airmon-ng running and there
is airdrop ng so basically in a minute
once I get this going just hit enter and
it'll start sending deny any Enys and
then you'll take down the hak5 Wi-Fi and
half the neighbors it's free so okay
tell me when to press enter okay this
sounds awesome alright so first thing I
need to do is is grab my Wi-Fi card BRB
being in a studio I love this cuz the
virtual machine automatically detects my
alpha here so if config wlan0 up now i
just need to put my card into monitor
mode so airmon-ng start wlan0 and there
it is mo n0 is my car to monitor mode so
now I just have to run this script so
let's take a look at the script first
it's called auth watch it's a Python
script so let's nano off watch and you
can see all he does here is call Scotty
and then it looks for a packet addy off
packet and then it will print the bssid
of the access point and then the client
and then the reason for disconnection
and that's a whole nother story we don't
need to get into but suffice it to say
it prints ones let me just begin the
authenticated it also looks for an
association and authentication and and
you know I don't even know like I'm not
very good with Python I can I can read
it but this is one of these great
examples of how powerful it is because
all it says is if P has layer and then
like that's I guess a string within it
and then print I don't know just
the code is really really sweet it's
like what 20 lines this is great so yeah
that's all it is so it just loops around
listening to listening from you know
what's getting from ska-p which is
getting from the airmen and it just
prints of its season association or d
authentication so now all we need to do
is run Python with auth watch and tell
it Mon 0 because that's my interface
that it will be monitoring and there we
go it's monitoring and you can see it's
seen the Association so why don't you go
ahead and go ahead and kill us all and i
just press n just press enter and there
we go so you can you can go ahead and
see that it has seen the authentication
packet i'll go ahead and close this
close that before okay neighbors are
getting up yeah that's awesome don't
live next to a bunch of hackers and and
there you go so you can imagine that you
can now take this and extend upon it
that's just kind of giving you an idea
of how you know I'm not trying to
belittle the code I'm just saying it's
easy to notice that there's the
authentications going on and if this was
a proper like intrusion detection system
they're probably red flags and all this
stuff and that's that's a topic for an
entire another series we really need to
do IDs and snort and stuff like that
yeah but I hope that gives you an idea
if somebody else knows of ways to like
modify firmware or something like that
so that your computer will just blanket
not even respond to a dr just like yeah
whatever kick me you can't kick me out
you know like yeah like like I'm Wi-Fi
squatting that'd be cool but yeah I hope
that answers your question guys of
course you have more questions about
this stuff or anything that we've ever
talked about on the show ever feedback

seven tips at revision 3.com / go to
assist Express let's face it your life
is online gmail google docs delicious
Flickr Twitter to some extent and these
are just toys I mean to our of operation
they're very critical and while I trust
the cloud I even use online backups of
the cloud I'm not going to trust that
the primates aren't going to rise up and
try to
no take over the cloud detonating a
tactical nuke over the Googleplex wiping
out technology for miles with its
destructive EMP blast Shannon help me
okay I don't know what your obsession
with monkeys like destroying the world
and monkeys taking over your internets
and everything is there like some little
monkeys well super snubz can save you I
should get a cape super stuff there you
go cloud backups okay I know that sounds
like kind of rhetorical almost yeah but
cloud backups I back up my hard drive to
the cloud yes well what if the cloud
goes down yeah exactly so there's things
like back up a Phi which will back up
everything from delicious facebook it
backs up google documents and twitter
and gmail flickr on Amazon's s3 cloud
okay that's that's what that's the
amazon server simple simple Seaver
server is so super stuff okay so so back
up my cloud stuff sophie the back up my
data from my gmail my delicious and my
word personal attacks of all over to
amazon that's going from one guy to
another though and it's two gigs for
free or you can get 10 gigs and it's
forty forty dollars a year which is kind
of expensive dollars a year for flickr
but I'm just no I just a lot of pizza
there's all these different things that
you're already paying for it's just one
extra thing you gotta pee for there's
probably some free stuff out there that
we can use instead of backup like free
stuff I do too so the first one I found
was called flickr edit okay this one
lets you backup everything from the
names the copyrights the titles the
commons and the actual flickr photos
that you've taken it also lets you
upload new pictures once you do all
sorts of things that have to do with
Flickr and you can get this at sunken
city org slash flickr edit yeah i played
with this a java program seems kind of
cool it's open source please love it
java application yeah it's wonderful and
it can handle not just one account but
multiple accounts that's how you're
pretty much good to go yeah it's very
nice
well you can actually use that to like
upload photos so I mean you might as
well just have it on your desktop anyway
I like the idea of getting your stuff
back down another one that I found is
called gmail backup this one's strictly
for Gmail obviously and I wonder what
that does no it's it uses i'm at to back
up all of your gmail basically your
entire mailbox it supports incremental
backups and it stores them in EML files
okay yeah so that that's pretty standard
yeah you can open them up and like
outlook for example or thunderbird if
you're open sources Thunder board bird
it also includes any attachments that
you've had so like if you attach a
Google document or a picture attorney of
your inbox boom there we go yeah you're
good to go it saves everything and it
runs by command line so it's easily
automated and it's it's scheduled yay
bachelor scripts for the wind alright
cool so I don't have to think about it
could just sit there and do incremental
backups of my gmail in case of major
monkey catastrophe right alright so the
next couple they both do google
documents we live in google docs
especially when being out there the
remote production yet like if gmail ever
went down and we kind of get into our
documents we would probably die yes we
would fail for a week yes it would be
very sad so it backs up all of your
google documents to your hard drive it
uses the dot the first one gee doc back
up this one uses dotnet 2 point 0
framework okay so it runs on windows mac
and it also runs on linux with mono sure
yeah but that's good stuff hmm and it's
free obviously an open source i love
free and open source me too and the
second one is called google doc back up
PHP script this one's a debated backups
for you google docs well that's my
favorite languages yes scrap
cross-platform runs on this main three
there you go it's Mac this PHP so you
could automate it and this one's also
for you no purse or so you know take
your pick ok so the 14 delicious that I
found is using double you get sweet i
use w get all the time in linux yeah so
it comes with linux and there's also a
widget windows version linkedin oh great
yeah we'll have that link to this i
don't have it in the show notes and you
basically just sticking it a command
line and it back up backs up everything
into an accident xml file
here you go I mean it's just bookmarks
how big could be yes really nicely so
that once a week boom done BAM and i'll
put the actual line that you have to put
into WK in the show notes so that
everybody will see that nice won't have
to see the whole long road and it's also
really easily scripted and it's
scheduled very low maintenance it seems
imagine just scripting and scheduling
all of these I also checked out Twitter
because everybody knows that Twitter
doesn't save all of your old tweets that
you've sent out and I racing them after
a period of time I think um that might
actually be a good thing sometimes when
it's three of them yeah tweeted in you
in it you shouldn't of yeah I do that a
lot to follow abstract excerpts all the
time I have like who had a club dance in
the sauce so so if I really wanted to
keep my tweets for posterity sake how
would I go about doing it I found three
different ones the first ones called
tweet or you can find it at tweet a ke
kaam okay tweet take or something tweet
tweet tweet 'ok Twitty doc got a tweet
ache Oh head hurts hill tweeting and
then there's one at tweet back up to
calm and Johan Birkin also created one
which is um i'll link it in the show
notes I like that one that one's I my
favorite because it's open source yeah
exactly it's open source cuz I don't
like the idea of getting my twitter
password to other people like Twitter
Fisher calm you know and all of them
work pretty much the same tweet back up
you don't have to download anything if
I'm correct but the other two you
actually do have to download a program
to back them up mhm and it only backup
every minute or so because that's what
twitter's api currently assess it's just
like tweet might be pc where the api
only allows it to go out once a minute
ah the deed us that is twitter here yeah
so take your pick on those all of them
work pretty well as far as I'm concerned
they weren't good for me already I also
found a wordpress backup which everybody
should do if you have a wordpress please
back it up it's I do this it's so easy
to well I use simple what can I use but
yeah I've got one that just shoots it
over to my gmail and I guess if my gmail
is backed up to with gmail backup then
there we go so what what's this way all
you have to do the one
that i found on here is WP DB backup
it's a plugin for wordpress so you all
you have to do is add it to your
wordpress and then fix it to whatever
your I think that's the exact one I use
because I know that the one is actually
will do other databases as well so I've
got it doing like the forums and the
wiki which will be back up real they're
very very soon well yeah that's cool
yeah so it and we'll have the link also
in the show notes and you can learn
about all sorts of different WordPress
backups and information about how to do
it on the wordpress blog I love the
WordPress codec their codecs they are
they are so good at documenting that I
mean that that's like half the value an
open source project is how well the
documentation is you ask me so what's
you know what's the final word on this
should I find a word you need to back up
your stuff I mean even if you already
have it in a cloud if you're really
paranoid or if you're like me and you
have lots of important stuff in the
cloud already like your google documents
just make sure you backup everything
it's important of course you know you
may not want to spend all the money on
backup if I so definitely like try these
out and see which ones you like the most
excellent now I think I may actually
just go ahead and use backupify for the
little stuff that's not going to use
more than two gigs anyway thanks for the
free service oh and also make sure like
if the program that you download ask for
a password make sure that you put in a
secure password for year back well this
that's another thing to consider though
if you're backing up your gmail I've got
like over 40 character password for my
google stock just because I live there
if if I'm just backing that up to you
know my hard drive or where we're
somewhere insecure what good is that to
make sure that you have that secure yeah
and what good is going through all the
trouble of like making sure I tunnel and
all of this different stuff to encrypt
my my so precious password just so that
somebody can you know take my imap
stream or or steal it off a hard drive
yeah so if it's as simple as like I
don't know like locking up your hard
drive yeah there you go truecrypt
truecrypt unless there's a Frenchman yes
would you shut it sue so gonna have to
quarter you a costume uh
