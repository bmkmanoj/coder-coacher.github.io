buy it laughing welcome to hack tip the
show where we break down concepts tools
and techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas before I get started
hit that subscribe button over on
youtube.com slash hack 5 if you want to
see all of our newest hack tip episodes
and definitely check out all of our hack
2 playlists we have tons of videos lined
up for you I can't wait to get them I'm
super excited about them I am our host
Shannon Morse and today we are covering
more networking in the terminal now that
you know from the episode I did two
weeks ago how to view much of the
networking information about your
network in the terminal we're going to
look at how we can kind of mess around
with the network now so first off I
wanted to review again ifconfig tack a
so I'm going to go over to my computer I
have config tech a and I'm going to
check and make sure that my network is
in working order luckily everything
looks good now we're going to make the
wireless network running promiscuous
mode because yes you can indeed do that
from your terminal so I can snip traffic
on my entire network if I turn it over
to promiscuous mode not just my computer
so sorry in advance to my co-workers who
are watching this episode down yes I
wasn't promiscuous mode on our local
network sorry guys love you so I'm going
to type in sudo ifconfig and then my
wireless network is this one right here
it's really annoying to type out but
that's what it is
Thank You Linux size 8s zero and then to
change it to promiscuous mode I just
type in P ro mi SC / misc
for promiscuous mode hit enter and then
put in your password because it's a sudo
command because you're making changes
and then if I hit ifconfig tak a again
you will notice that instead of saying
it's running just broadcast running
multiply cuss it says broadcast running
so misc multicast so that means that you
just changed it to promiscuous mode ha
super easy super cool now
I want to change this back so because I
don't necessarily want to run in
promiscuous mode unless I am doing some
kind of penetration test I'm going to
just type in sudo ifconfig wlan0 and
then - Pro misc like so and then to
check that again I'll do that and it
should just change back to broadcast
running multicast and it does so cool
I'm back into my normal mode now if you
want to you can also check ifconfig for
a very specific network interface if you
want to by just typing in the WL PE 5 8
0 number and then it won't show me
loopback it will just show me the
wireless interface so good to know if
you want to view more information on
your wireless network you can type IW
config which looks a little bit
different it has a little bit kind of
different information to see all sorts
of data in there this is similar to I
have config in many ways you will notice
if you are on a computer with lots of
different network peripherals you can
also check iw config and then W LP v 8 s
0 just to see that one interface and not
all the other ones as well with it since
we are messing around with our network
connections it is so important to
understand the 6 modes of wireless and
how to use them depending on whatever
your needs might be whether that's the
penetration test or you're just browsing
the web make sure to check out our hack
tip episode 9 I realize that's a really
old episode from several years ago but
it this is 153 I believe that we're on
Wow yeah so it's kind of an old episode
but hey it's still relevant so that's
the one I'm going to link to we gave a
very in-depth explanation of the modes
that you can switch to including master
managed ad-hoc mesh monitor and repeater
I'm not going to explain them here
because well we already did it so check
out that one for all the research now I
am going to move on and talk about
something different let's say that you
want to restart your network interface
in the terminal you don't necessarily
want to go up into your GUI with a mouse
because I don't know maybe you don't
like using the mouse that's why we're
all using the terminal right now there
are a bunch of ways to do that but my
favorite is sudo I have
Figg wlp 58 zero down now you're not
going to see any kind of output it's
just going to do it in the background so
now if I type in ifconfig I should just
see Lo and yeah that's all I see now if
I do want to bring this back up which I
would hope you do if you want to log on
to the Internet
I have config wlp five eight s0 and then
up so pretty much the exact same thing
and I'm going to type in ifconfig again
just to make sure that it's back up and
running and I have an IP address
it looks like I'm good to go alright now
that I'm back on the Internet we are
going to take a moment to thank our
sponsor and then I will be right back
after this free let's be honest your
code is your world if you create it you
tweak it and you lovingly obsess over it
every single day so picking the right
repository management tool is super
important only the best for your code
right that's why the team at Atlassian
created bitbucket this bucket is the
gift solution for professional teams
helping over five million developers
build with a purpose the bucket gives
teams of all sizes free private
repositories with state-of-the-art
features like the world's best pull
request algorithm built in continuous
delivery and integrations with your
favorite tools like docker I know a lot
of you guys use it out there AWS and a
juror plus you get JIRA integration
since it is from Atlassian giving your
team everything you need to take your
code from concept to customer the
is for the code that takes us to Mars
it's the code that decodes the human
genome or drive your next car or maybe
it is for your next info spec tool visit
bitbucket org slash for the code to
start your free account
that's bitbucket org slash for the code
tried bitbucket today what will your
code do we are now back with more
networking in the terminal next step is
viewing your routing table most of this
routing table that you will see is quite
self-explanatory all you have to do is
type in route and then you will see your
routing table it's super easy this is
the linux kernel's way of navigating
through out your local network to send
the correct packets to the correct
places whether that's sending them out
to the
network or setting packets of data to
other computers on your same network you
will notice a couple of things in here
most of it is self-explanatory but then
you have these flags so a flag you which
you will see very commonly in aji which
is the other very common flag that
you'll see so you means up and G means
gateway respectively so pretty easy to
figure out there rel can be really
useful if for some reason your computer
is losing connection to your gateway you
can check to see if it sees the Gateway
in route it should have a G under flag
like currently you cannot see my Gateway
and you can also add it back so for
adding it back you would type in route
add tax net default gateway and then
does eth0 now for the most part you will
find that Linux and networking work
pretty well together on newer machines
most of it is generally automatic if you
do run into problems though these
commands can really help you get started
on fixing any kind of issues that you
might come up with on your own network
also Google is your friend when it comes
to solving network problems I often find
that many issues that I might have had
are easily solved on the Ubuntu forums
or a quick question on Twitter luckily a
lot of people are super friendly out
there and they're very very up to
answering any issues that you might run
into thank you so much to bitbucket we
have a bunch of hack tips heading your
way so again make sure to subscribe to
our YouTube channel it's youtube.com
slash hack 5 I also have a whole series
of playlists that you can check out over
on the playlist button which is on
YouTube
so you can see all the different hack
tips series that I've done until then I
want to hear your feedback comment below
let me know about what kind of issues
you've run into in the terminal when it
comes to networking and lastly be sure

more great stuff just like this
I'll be there reminding you to trust
