on hack five hello welcome act by my
name is darren kitchen ohio not my wash
yet
God dang it yes sorry I got alright sign
up for the G my name is Shannon oh yeah
my name is Darren hi we just did that
part we know how to podcast this is your
weekly dose of techno less and we have
lots going on today q yeah I'm let you
know what you lead I'll follow
okay great so today we are going to be
discussing something really fun and we
actually have a special guest oh this is
very exciting I met Kevin at flying meet
ups which by the way is one of the most
exciting and fun things about this whole
hobby is not only do you get to learn a
lot about math and science and
technology and cool stuff and avionics
building drones but then when it comes
to the camaraderie of flying them
there's many different clubs and it's
just always cool to get together with
your people and to geek out and to race
it turns out that there's a lot of you
there's a lot to going into a race it's
not just showing up at a park and like
starting to race your quad with a bunch
of other people no in fact the majority
of racing is done in what's called
first-person view or fpv and that's
typically where you put some camera a
transmitter on the quadcopter and then
you stand there wearing some cool
goggles that make you look awesome and
then you you become part of the
quadcopter and it's kind of like pod
racing if you will it really is a really
a fun experience and not as much
line-of-sight racing as it were but
anyway there's if you're in the Bay Area
there's some really cool meetups there's
the Bay Area fpv explorers and racers
that meet in Berkeley and it's just
that's where I met Kevin and he's an
expert and it's awesome to pick his
brain because that's one of the really
cool things about this part of the hobby
is just like everybody sharing knowledge
and things like that
so highly recommend if you're if you
followed this far and you want to
continue on with this that's a great
scene to take it into and with that
let's learn about some fpv if you've
been watching heckfire for the past
several
weeks we have been building our own sub
250 gram quadcopter and it flies I was
super excited about that part because it
actually flew and it was one of the
things that I built but we left a lot of
spare room on it for an fpv payload or a
first person view payload so there's a
lot of extra area in here as far as
weight goes so that we can actually put
them on here so here to help us make
sense of first-person view is expert RC
modeler and flight system designer
Kevin McKay hi Kevin it's good thank you
so much for joining us so give me a
little bit of background about what you
do and like how you got into RC modeling
well I think I like a lot of people I
saw this video on YouTube where drones
were flying through hoops and it was
just I saw that I wanted to build one I
think that's what happened to Darren
Tooman
he saw one of those videos did you run
into any hurdles when you were starting
off yeah you know it's a it's a
relatively steep learning curve and I
spend a lot of time and money figuring
out what was going on and you know it's
so new there was a ton of very specific
documentation so this fellow yeah did
you burn any components what we stood
lots of money on burn wasted a lot of
money no the dead components I always
gotta buy - yes sometimes three right
that's I learned that real fast so the
goal of today's episode is understanding
first-person view and understanding the
components that go along with it so
Kevin's going to help us understand that
very well a so first off I want to
explain what is first-person view
because I think that's the most
important part sure yeah it's um you
know when when you are looking through
the goggles and seeing exactly what the
drone sees it's very immersive
experience it's for all intents and
purposes you become the machine yeah I
have seen Daren do this he's let me wear
his own fpv goggles in the field while
he's flying and it's really weird
whenever he turns the drone around and
it's looking back at you I think it's a
completely like out-of-body experience
it's creepy but it looks so amazing to
have that kind of experience what did
you agree absolutely
it's a strange thing to be approaching
yourself or past yourself and not
recognize yourself it's very
disconcerting so let's go ahead and
start off with these components the
first thing is the system that's
actually on your quadcopter and I love
what you've done here this thing is
freakin adorable and I love that it has
little eyebrows it's super cute so what
are the components that go on this baby
so for the fpv portion there's a video
transmitter and this is generating the
signal and it's transmitting out of this
antenna and then you have a camera which
is actually you know providing the data
that's getting fed out so those are the
two major components ok so just that
mm-hmm and then you should be good to go
of course you need some kind of ground
station we'll get to those later but
first off is this analog or digital
vidya says this is analog digital tends
to introduce a lot of latency oh yeah
that can be a problem especially if
you're flying right it's kind of
important you don't want latency so
let's get into like some of the really
in-depth stuff I want to learn so what
our channels and bands and like the
different brands that you see out there
I have seen Fatshark of course boss cam
is another one I believe I've seen
thrown about what do all of those mean
so those are vendors and they have you
know bands that they operate on and then
within the bands there are different
frequencies or channels okay so and
essentially it's allowing you to fly
with other people so that you're taking
so this is 5.8 gigahertz and it's
breaking up that spectrum into smaller
segments so that each person can be on
that on a different frequency and fly
with other people right so whenever I
hear Darren like come back into the
warehouse super ticked off because he
got stomped on right is that what he
means is when like he's there's two
people on the same Channel or something
right right or just they're physically
close enough that one person's signal
you know interferes with his viewing
yeah so what channels do you find really
often are they're like super popular
ones that are
most common well a lot of people use
Fatshark and and generally when racing
people are often are on one Patrick one
four and seven and that gives a lot of
space so there's not a lot of
interference so there's not any like
overlapping of the two exactly yes okay
are there any types of frequency
management techniques that are used in
the racing world to get the most you
know to get the most racers in the sky
simultaneously sure sure people will
have frequency tags and then so that'll
be a specific frequency for each racer
yeah that's one way to do it some people
actually just separate the VTX in the
antenna from the drone and then every
racer will get their own and that will
ensure that you know because they'll be
all configured with very specific
frequencies okay that's cool and are
there any kind of like legal precautions
you should keep in mind for like where
you live right is very every every
country is gonna have their own yeah
specific areas that you know you're
gonna just need to check and make sure
that you're within good to keep in mind
you very good to keep in mind so talking
about the the component the VTX I know
that there's different wattages that
you're going to be using there's right I
believe there's 25 milliwatts there's
200 milliwatts and then it can go up all
the way up to like 2 watts so it makes
sense to me being like a total fpv newb
here that I would use like the best
power possible because you know I want
the most hardcore one is there any
reason why I shouldn't do that yeah so
you know you know around the 200 mil
watt range that we find that people
you're less likely to step on the other
racers and stuff like that so that's you
know that's a good range it's gonna
depend though on the frequency in there
ok so again with the you don't want to
overlap on the racing buddies right ok
yeah so don't stick with to go down to
200 mil what's yeah that's a good place
yeah is that the most popular what do
you would say I'd say in racing here I
think that is yeah ok cool now moving on
I would like to discuss
because I am big into cameras and
photography I have seen board cameras
and micro cameras there's cameras with
like built-in DVRs which I think are
super cool it's super fancy but probably
really expensive too and there's all
sorts of variations too there's a field
of view which is fov there's CCD and
CMOS so does all of this information
does it just come down to like your
personal preference or is one technology
specifically better than another
technology yeah a lot of it is going to
be personal preference and then the size
of your drone will kind of dictate where
you're gonna be so that's a good point
tend to be a little smaller yeah okay so
size of course especially if you're
trying to stay under 250 grams size and
weight are probably very important I
probably couldn't fit like a huge I
don't know 4k camera on here but I'd
probably be good with a little one
that's like under HD do you use HD or 4k
or do you stick with something yeah I'm
usually using analog because a lot
really yeah because there's no latency
in the video feed oh man that latency
yeah you gotta get better attack so you
can get like 4k video yeah that would be
going to happen and it'll be amazing but
not yet very important to see you don't
crash zero latency yeah do you get zero
latency yeah you know I actually admit
about to 600 TV lines so it's you know
there's not a lot of yeah so how do you
typically power one of the cameras so
you know the the power system on these
is usually about 12 or 14 volts and the
cameras gonna one about five so
generally the VTX will have a filter and
then a regulator that will drop the
voltage down so the camera can get the
five at once okay cool and then once the
voltage gets down you can actually get
that transmission going down to your
ground station right okay gotcha
now very important different fpv
frequencies I'm assuming those required
different antennas - yes we have lots of
different antennas
I love SDR so this is kind of up my
alley yeah it's something I understand
so what are the common types of antennas
that you use for fpv so most frequently
you'll see a circularly polarized
antenna those are adorable
yeah so this is an omnidirectional and
it will receive or transmit in all
directions okay which is pretty cool and
it's sending out the signal in a circle
so that is this what they use what they
call a cloverleaf yes exactly
gotcha okay and then you have dipole or
monopole yep in other words what's the
difference between those so here's a
monopole and it's just got one one unit
but then and you know you can see it's
there's multiple lobes on that okay and
then this one is just the single unit so
you're only getting one direction right
right so is it better to use these it
depends on the situation but with this
you're never it's very hard to become
out of phase because you're transmitting
and receiving in so many different you
know directions so what's the difference
what is the point of having both like a
right hand circular polarized antenna
and then a left hand circular polarized
antenna so with circular polarization
you're transmitting it it's going like
this and say if you're using a monopole
and you transmit and hit a wall and it
comes back then you can get ghosting on
your image and it can become confusing
yeah so this will just kind of it when
it if it reflects off a surface it will
be out of phase so you won't get that
ghosting or multipathing so can I can I
mix and match my antennas can I do like
one of these and then a left hand wire
yeah you would want to transmit and
receive on right hand okay and then and
so if if I'm flying left hand and you're
flying right hand it's it's just gonna
because of the phase it's gonna make it
less likely for their interference okay
so that is just like one extra layer of
security between us two so that we don't
end up with that overlap right that
seems to be like an ongoing issue as FB
is overlapping with other reason it
certainly is really have to be nice to
each other right
so we have VTX we have cameras and we
have antennas that's the absolute basics
I believe of being able to fly fpv but
what about accessories I believe there
is something called an on-screen display
are all of those different accessories
necessary can you tell me a little bit
about them
yeah you know this is the basic thing
you need to fly an on screen display is
nice to have it can tell you your
voltage you can hook it up to a GPS so
you know where you are yeah it's like
that but this is the basic deal okay so
you don't necessarily have to get those
if you're if you're just learning to fly
absolutely I had this video transmitter
and a camera and a receiver and goggles
and you're good cool well speaking of
goggles I know we have I'm sitting over
here I do want to say thank you so much
for giving us the like this high-level
overview of the basics of fpv components
I hope that this also gives our viewers
some confidence when shopping for your
right system so we have been looking at
these fancy looking quad copters down
here which by the way again very very
cute I love what you've done here is
this under 250 grams no this is over 250
yeah over 250 you heard it here so these
are from razor quads tell me a little
bit about razor cool all right so razor
quad is my company and this is one of
our designs and it is a very compact
very little active racing frame it's
specifically for racing
it looks awesome I love it yeah it's
ludicrously fast actually how fast can I
go this will go about 60 or 70 really
yeah yeah we're a helmet guys yeah
that's awesome
well thank you again so much Kevin this
is really really cool and for everybody
at home you can learn about Kevin's quad
copters at Razer quad com we'll put that
in the show notes as well as have a
lower third right down here and with
that we are going to go ahead and take a
break really appreciate
thanks it's really really cool cool and
we'll see you right after this break
I did the most amazing thing this
morning I had an idea and I brought it
onto the Internet let me tell you how I
did it
I went over to domain.com and I use
their epic domain discovery system to
help you find the perfect domain and
then they're quick and simple checkout
system had my website up and online in
no time I'm not lying guys this is
literally what I did like a couple hours
ago and I used coupon code hak5 you know
why because domain calm has been
supporting hack 5 for years they love
what we do they love you guys and they
want to hook you up and that's why we
have that special code that saves you
15% off so I just want to remind you
guys that you should tweet at domain.com
and say hey thanks for supporting act 5
all these years and then when you're
thinking about getting your next domain
go to domain condo Shannon and I do get
your website up an online real quick and
easy when you think domain names think
domain.com so know that we have a good
understanding of what's involved in an
fpv fly system I want to know what's
going on on the ground what do I use
right Shannon I feel like any one of
these that's pretty much it has no
opening on it no an in it but you don't
see I mean no no this is these are video
goggles and we're using to demonstrate
my favorite pair which are a pair of
phat sharks I like the HD ones I say HD
they're not have you ever seen a
physical fat shark
I have not however I have taken up sea
kayaking lately so maybe I will one day
the video goggles there's many brands
foscam sky sky view what I want to say
anyway there's a couple of different
ones these are probably the most popular
within the quadcopter drone racing arena
and one of the most the one of the
reasons why is because they're modular
so these bays here it will actually pop
off as you can see there and if I give
you this you should be able to do that
with nails and basically the idea is
while we've talked about there being
lots of different frequencies that you
can use to flight quad copters like this
is an antenna for a 1.3 gigahertz system
well that's 1/4
five point eight the nice thing about
something like this is they're very
self-contained they're compact and you
can put different modules in to pick up
different frequencies are you breaking
that over there okay cool well there you
go there you go in fact you can see here
what we have is a bay here where you can
put in a head tracker I'll talk about
that in a sec and then over here we
actually have our receiver module this
is a module that has dip switch settings
for four different bands so it'll
actually do Fatshark
race band and then these band a and er
there's boss cam bands that we're
talking about before it's more of a
universal one you can kind of think of -
yeah but if I were running a 1.3 system
I would put in a 1.3 module in there and
I would have left security around it
whatever you know if if your look if
you're trying to be all stylistic then
you got into the wrong hobby so yeah
that's a that's a fun one I prefer these
just because you not only is it more
compact and it's less equipment to carry
and they're battery-powered and
self-contained you also get that
experience where it's like the
quadcopter you know starts banking to
the left and you're seeing through its
eyes so you start being all you can see
your body does this so if you can't help
it it's really cool the way that it
works you know like there have been
times in my life where I have been
flying and then come up on birds and the
birds take off and then I take off from
the birds bank to the left and I Bank to
the left and in that moment no one could
tell me otherwise I was a bird okay do
you use a DVR with these so the DVRs on
the newer fad sharks are actually built
in there is like a micro SD card slot
there where you can actually go ahead
and see there we go and just put you
just put a card there it's got the it's
it's not the greatest but it works and
you get like a crappy AVI file but
whatever your footage is there that's
not the kind of stuff you typically see
shared on social media you only see
somebody will strap a nice GoPro to the
front it's a nice HD or 4k stuff that
online I wish sheeters I wish we got the
the footage that we get back is
is nasty but it's enough to fly around
with and you get used to it
so what about diversity receivers and
all that weird right so if you are going
to not just if this isn't for you or if
this is for you but in addition you want
to get all like crazy with it you
totally can it just depends on what your
your time and budget are some people
like to in addition to goggles or as an
alternative to goggles with a display
like say like a 17-inch monitor you know
with a giant battery and you could do a
tripod with all of this equipment and
stuff coming off of it that would be
what we typically call a ground station
and we may build one here on the show if
there's enough interest I've been going
to for a while I don't currently have
one but typically what you find in
systems like that is this you know
whether it's mounted on a tripod or as
part of like a little Pelican case that
you open up you'll have displays perhaps
so you've got a monitor you can look at
rather than just the video goggles or in
addition to them for spectators who also
want to take a look at your flights DVRs
so you can capture the footage you know
it's always nice to use like something
like a GoPro or a Mobius to record the
footage on there to get the highest
quality stuff but if for instance you
accidentally end up in the drink you at
least have footage of your epic crash
and other things that will be included
in those are diversity receivers like
you said so this is an example of just a
regular single receiver and so the idea
here is you know I screw on an antenna
and now my my Fatshark goggles here can
pick up the transmission from my drone
okay and the these being cloverleaf
antennas have pretty good range in all
directions right but if there's a
particular direction that I knew I'm
going to be going farthest on I may want
to also put on say a patch panel antenna
or a yagi antenna or many other so
there's a few anonymous
specifically trying should build a
ground safety Japanese as fun as it gets
until I can ten etherion things of that
nature that would be the idea what the
diversity receiver is say we had one of
these getting our just circle like that
we could also have a diversity
they have a panel antenna which would
like have long range in one direction
and what would happen is both of these
antennas would work with a box that
would choose which has the better signal
strength okay and then switch to it
depending on which does so you get the
best of both worlds so are there
different well I know there's different
brands of course but are there different
like modules and different capabilities
between them yeah and it really that's
the problem with this industry right now
is there's not a whole lot of
standardization things are getting
better with stuff like race band but you
really once you're in a vendor you have
to stick with that vendor which is one
of the reasons why I say a system like
this where there are modules is is
really convenient
so yeah you really have to do some
research because if you're going to be
doing some of the more esoteric
frequencies like 1.3 gigahertz or 900
megahertz you're going to be limited to
different equipment and capabilities I
mean there's nothing stopping you yes
that it be this pretty no no actually
there are many build-your-own like
goggle kind of things using like foam
and off-the-shelf LCD screens they've
become a lot less expensive they are
large but they're also cheap so it's a
trade-off I say if you know you're just
a bling with this it's fine like find
something used okay and see if it's for
you and if it's for you or borrow one
from somebody at a flying field or at a
flying event like I'm talking about and
get a feel for it and if it's for you
then I say put some money in the ground
station equipment because similar to
your your controller your controller
you'll use with multiple drones your
transmitter your goggles you'll use with
multiple drones and if you do it right
you're not going to crash them I would
hope yeah so the idea that was just to
get you guys familiar with some of the
terminology and the components of
systems in the air and on the ground to
do that fpv stuff I know that there is
so much more into this but I wanted to
lay the groundwork in case there is a
lot of interest and we will implement
our own in our sub 250f BV or potential
fpv quadcopter so yeah let us know
that's gonna be really fun yeah and you
know what this oh man this is so
this is an H but Kevin's gonna be on
next week to talk to us about an X more
on that next week and it all makes sense
boots yes yeah I think that about wraps
it up let us know what you thought of
today's episode you can always email us
feedback at hak5
org or you can comment right down below
if you're watching this on youtube there
you go
very exciting also if you are looking to
build your own fpv quadcopter or
whatever have you we have our very first
flying with hack 5 it's so similar to
have we do pen test with hack 5 now
you'll be able to come to the AK 5
warehouse and learn from the experts and
save yourself a lot of time and money
and trial and error and get hands-on
with a preset set of equipment we will
have kits that we will all be building
together learning the ins and outs
learning how to tune them learning how
to fly them and it's gonna be a lot of
fun so I hope you guys will join us for
that it's a very exciting endeavor and
it's really something that's a broad
audience open for anyone so it's not
like pen test with hack 5 where it's
kind of like you know you're already in
pen testing this is like bring your kids
you know it's one of those sorts of
things this is really exciting this is
very much like a you know a parent child
like hobby you know there's so many like
fathers and sons get into this and so
it's really rewarding to be able to do a
workshop with some experts to build
these to bestow upon because this didn't
come easy for all of us yeah and so
we've distilled it down to the
essentials so that in a weekend you can
you know walk away with the confidence
and a quadcopter that you built and the
tools to maintain it and the knowledge
that we've put together to save you a
lot of time and a lot of forum threads
you don't have to just read ad nauseam
so and make sure to check out hak5 org
that's where you can find out about all
the events that we are planning to
attend
I believe Daren is having a couple of
meetups down in Australia coming up yes
and I am Cindy if you're watching this
before May 23rd mmm
if you're watching this before May 23rd
I'll be having a meet-up in Tokyo make
sure to hit up that RSVP link to find
out all the information on that there we
go all right with all of that said thank
you so much for your support throughout
the years thank you for keeping us going
I can't believe it's always long we're
living the dream you guys are making it
possible with your direct contributions
to all of our shows find cool schwag to
find some stickers and mugs and t-shirts
as well as our awesome penetration
testing equipment like the Wi-Fi
pineapple and turtle USB rubber ducky
etc over at hack shop calm I'm going to
Japan whoo-hoo with that i'm darren
kitchen
trust your techno west great okay you're
done now now stop now you're scaring me
