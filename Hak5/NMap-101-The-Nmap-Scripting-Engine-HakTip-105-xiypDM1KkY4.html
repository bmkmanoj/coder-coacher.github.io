5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
welcome to hack tip the show will we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we're checking
out the nmap scripting engine what now
we know that nmap comes with a ton of
handy commands and options pre-installed
for you but what if you want to write
your own script to do some sort of
special scan this is when the nmap
scripting engine aka
NS e comes in handy scripts are written
in the Lua programming language which I
have not learned and I probably should
and it comes with several options to
start off there are over 400 different
ones available so I'm just going to give
you a few examples today of the ones
that I have available on my own computer
system of course if you need to find
other ones you can find all of those
over at nmap gorg's / NSE doc and if you
want to download any of them you just
click on the name of it and save it now
mine are all saved into this default
folder this directory which is home
slash USR slash slash and map slash
scripts you'll see there are tons of
them in here and all of them are named
very very precisely so I first had to
move over to that folder to get them to
run in my terminal
all of these can run in nmap 5.0 or
higher so make sure that you have an
updated copy of EDD map and remember
last week when I showed you how to check
the version yeah there you go now try
this simple command to start off I'll
type in an map tak tak script and you're
going to use tak tak script for all of
them banner and your target so I'm going
to use dot 7 for again for this week's
examples very very handy one let it run
and once it completes you will get a
banner grab of any of the open TCP ports
that print out whatever it's able to
actually find when it connects so at the
bottom of this one we see port 2 2 2 2
which is TCP is open unknown what the
name of it is the service but we have a
banner grab SSH 2.0 open s
eh haha there we go you can also use
this handy one which is HTTP or other
scripts now particularly this is going
to look like I'm going to put it in
quotes HTTP wildcard quote and then my
target and hit enter and let it run now
this is going to give you all of the
output for any scripts containing HTTP
or any other code word from your
scripting like library so you'll notice
if I go over to my directory and I
scroll down we'll see a whole bunch of
files that are listed with HTTP in the
name so this is going to run through all
these different scripts and output
whatever information it's able to use
from those different scripting scripts
that are already pre-written
not much to see here but very handy if
you're looking for any specific
information now if you want to do just a
default script output just something
very very simple you can also use
another script command which starts with
scripts again script type default huh go
figure
and wait for your output and then you'll
have your complete scan so you'll notice
on this one it is pretty similar to
another one that I think we've shown
previously which is tack s capital C
Tech SC so that's basically the exact
same thing is that so save yourself a
few letters on your keyboard and just
type SC other than just default you can
also use all auth discovery external
intrusive malware safe and bold as
different category options in your
command as well now I'm not going to
show all those because that would take a
look a little bit longer than what I
want to but I will be right back with a
few more different NSC options that I
found but first let's go ahead and take
a break and thank our sponsor
the hack shop is hacked vibes premier
store for all of your pen testing needs
including one of my favorites the USB
rubber ducky which looks like a flash
drive and it types like a keyboard and
it types scripts into a computer
crazy crazy fast like this week's
favorite from I am gigabyte x86 I've
probably totally messed up that name but
whatever this one will paste your ASCII
art into a notepad dock that's pretty
cute and it's adorable and I like it so
it's pretty cool and of course we
couldn't do the show without your
support so we would like to thank you
with something special a personally
signed sticker from hack tip and you can
use the coupon code snubz with any order
from the hack shop to get your own
sticker thank you so much for supporting
the show again we couldn't do it without
you
we're back with more from NS e now if
you're having trouble with a script
which I found to be a little bit common
because not all of these are written
particularly for your system you can use
this command to troubleshoot it it's
very simple you just type in nmap tech
tech script again if I could spell that
right there we go
FTP I'm going to use this one FTP anon
which looks for anonymous login
availability on a page or on a
particular target script tak trace and
then for this one I actually need a port
so I'm going to use port 21 10.7 331 7/4
hit enter and it's going to bring you
back a whole bunch of information so
this is going to open end map with the
script command using the ftp anon NSE
script which is failed in my directory
and it's going to run a trace on it
while connecting to port 21 on my target
now pretty handy and if you want to look
through that you can actually find a
troubleshooting issue that you can fix
in the future if you wanted to now
lastly I have one more that you can use
and this one is also actually pretty
useful as well this one is the update
database command so this one is very
simple it's just
scripts or script tack update DB and you
hit enter and it'll go ahead and update
if you need any kind of updates now I'm
almost done what would you like to see
next about nmap we are almost done I
want to know if I missed anything I know
that I still need to cover Zen map in an
upcoming episode so I'll be doing that
but first off leave me a comment below
or email us over at tips at hack 5 org
and be sure to check out our sister show
hak5 org that's hack 5 for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your Tecna list
