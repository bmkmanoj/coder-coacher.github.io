break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today I'm getting into
more Linux terminal 101 last week
I promised cats and I give you cats okay
well maybe not those kind of cats but
we're actually redirecting standard
inputs with a command called cat this
stands for concatenate files
it reads one or more files and it copies
them to a standard output it's very very
useful in some sorts of some standard
outputs it's kind of like type and dos
if you guys remember those days so if I
typed cat LS output txt this will lift
list the contents of that file to me so
I'll try that cat LS tack output which
has saved since my last tack tip and it
gives me the text of that LS output txt
file LS cannot access no such file or
directory all that is written inside
that text file nice now usually cats
used to display very small text files or
sort of like that one but you can also
use it to join a large file back
together sometimes larger files will be
split in this way if I had three files
that were named something like hak5 MPEG
dot 0 0 1 all the way up to hack 5 MPEG
dot 0 0 9 and I had a whole series of
them I can rejoin them by typing
something like this of course that
commands not found silly I can type in
cat hack 5.0 asterisk
remember those wildcards yeah hack 5 dot
what happens is the wild-card asterisk
will take all of the hack 5 MPEG 0
something-something files and to join
them from 1 to 9 and it's going to do it
in order which is really nice so
standard inputs right you can
by cat and it does nothing because it's
waiting for us to input something so it
just sits there now you can type in some
kind of input like a trust your Tecna
list for example because who doesn't
trust their Titan the West cool and then
you can hit control D which tells the
cat command that it's all done so
control D and there you go
it'll retype it for me and we're done
okay now it is going to retry retype
trust your Tecna list as the output we
can use this to make a text file like
this cat greater than sign trust txt and
then you press Enter and you type in
whatever you want it to save trust your
Titan list and I'm going to press ENTER
again and ctrl D and then ctrl D again
that lets it know that it's ended now
type in cat trust txt and it brings back
trust your Titan unless it's going to
output whatever your text file is now if
you want it to redirect standard input
you can do this cat less than sign for
that redirection trust txt so that less
than sign redirects the source of the
input from the keyboard to the text file
not really useful until we get a little
more in depth with redirecting inputs
later on now next week pipe lines like
in Mario or Mario depending on where you
live in the world but first make sure to
email me tips at hack 5 org with your
thoughts or you can comment below and be
sure to check out our sister show hack 5
for more great stuff just like this I'll
be there reminding you to trust your
Tecna less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
