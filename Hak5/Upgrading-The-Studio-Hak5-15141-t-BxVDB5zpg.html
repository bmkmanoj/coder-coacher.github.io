by domain.com
hello mocha nack5 my name is darren
kitchen is your weekly dose of Technol
estándares going to be a very
untraditional episode similar in that
episode of hak5 where the house flooded
i'm going to give you an unprecedented
back scenes look at how hak5 is done and
answer some of your questions like
what's up with the hat the answer is I
don't feel like going in there and so
with that there's a lot of change in the
air and I kind of want to show you some
of the things going on and I get into
some of the projects that might be going
on I kind of give you an idea of how
crazy things can be on a day to day
basis here at hak5
so including this that is a Onion
Routing 50-inch projection screen thing
but I need to be installing this weekend
but come on up and I'll show you around
this video these here just some boarders
looking to go out from hack shop so
hello orders and back there is a
chalkboard for some sketches and other
segments coming up and this is what is
left of the studio I know there used to
be a giant camera crane right here but
we just took that down and here the
remains this poor studio but we just
started adding in a bunch of poles Paul
Hey
our mountain cameras instead of this
old-school stuff which i came up with
which was TV mounts that just kind of
swung up the biggest thing is getting
rid of tripod legs a lot of room so
anytime you can stand somewhere having a
dog to camera is better there's not a
whole lot of space in here though when
you consider that what we started with
in 2005 was nothing more than a hundred
square foot yeah a hundred square foot
10 by 10 dining room this is a kind of
considerable I'm sad to see the JibJab
I've been really excited about how we're
gonna be using this space this is
actually the oh we got a gym replacement
wasn't put on earth did you do Paul I
just gave Paul the credit card and said
build a new studio okay cool spinny cam
it can go this way this is like that
thing at Space Camp that they stick you
in and you're supposed to like stabilize
it where you're from spinning out of
control
oh my god you're gonna be able to make
people so sick on the livestream and
with land see you can zoom in and focus
and everything so basically you've
replaced all cameramen with robots
oh my god what is this thing called a
wild shot it's a wild shot the guy's
witty is a pretty funny - yeah that's so
fantastic hey I wouldn't know anything
about that
mmm dude I love that you've got the
whole thing running off the pineapple
juice - yeah they work on our lights are
you working on cool
well here you know what I do have again
saw these over here just grab one of
these yeah sure why not
just a note three you want to do it
there we go
cool
number five no sound
then we've got back here I guess you put
a chromecast on one of these yeah one of
them is a program monitor so we can see
what's going out on the live stream oh
yes more about that here soon and then
the other one will be for IRC oh you
want to show them the hm
it's the I know nothing's hooked up
right now but I just want to I own ously
to do this episode this way because I
want to document this chaos and mess so
that we can look back on it and laugh
yeah they can look at my office yeah I
can't believe we're gonna air this yeah
this is an absolute mess this is my
favorite part of Paul's office this is
what does the magic it's it's to you
right yeah but it doesn't go into the
case that this oh that's oh yeah that's
right it's like it's that thin is the
entire piece of equipment by black magic
that does all the switchy switchy so
paul can come over here and do all the
button Pressey but we'll get into that
more later but it's just it's kind of
insane in here audio yes it gets it's
either freezing in this office or hella
hot because October and November are the
hot months for separate the first an
Francisco so that's why we're gonna
combat it with crushed ice the cocktails
later yes where's the pineapple bar
going so we've got dedicated green
screen set going here we've got that
that'll be great for like
hack tip and extra via Oh what you got
new green screens I know you did that
we've got the pop out one is this a 10
here
okay problem aboah status when you guys
do this yeah your arms get chopped off
and always have to find interesting ways
to make that work
no more chopping off arms so if you ever
see somebody like way very close to the
edge of the screen there's a reason why
they're there yeah and then we've been
shooting another university on that so
that's good stuff
what what are you drilling over here
like okay it just has this little kind
of universal mouth that they make for
everything all right big enough well
this tripod head mount screwed together
so whenever I need to move a camera you
just tighten that slide it out pop it
wherever you want yeah that's amazing
we're at boat we're right here and again
when I'll be listening for the prompter
system so it mostly just made a mess
mm-hmm so showed me how the polls work
because that's kind of like a huge and
impart surf I've never yeah so it goes
all the way up 14 feet to the ceiling
that's pretty awesome Paul it's just
tension oh there we go
a little bubble level that's way all
this yeah well rub the cables through
the ceiling air I mean you did cables
through the ceiling for that camera
right there yeah that's our top camera
for when we line up well it's still the
hacker way yeah yeah so the core concept
here though behind the poles is that
this is going to allow us to do be able
to put these poles everywhere and be
able to shoot all throughout the entire
room that means that we can open it up
and have a lot more sets for more shows
and live streams and things of that
nature and so we're shooting on some
different cameras with visual panty yeah
so that's a field camera yeah and it's
just a big video camera well kind of
this is the smaller of the bigger video
cameras this this big guy and so I mean
all right but yeah so we're doing
something a lot smaller now that's it
standardizing on SLRs I can't wait to
see how that makes so I'm actually
recording this right now in my phone
the Galaxy Note 3 so it can do this
split screen which is really cool the
front-facing camera on the rear facing
camera what on earth is that
that's the 12 to 35 oh yeah there's a
really wide angle that's so cool
and it's F 2.8 constant that's so turns
out studio cameras are ridiculously
expensive but Panasonic's micro
four-thirds digital SLRs or even
considered SLRs because they don't have
a I don't have a reflection like these
they don't have my own they call me or
listen or analyst system cameras on VHS
sure well it looks like a DSLR main camp
that's sweet and so now we'll be able to
clamp a bunch of these on the different
poles and then have multiple sets that
are all tied into the live mixer which
means on Friday nights we'll break out
the ice crunch or thingy and make some
cocktails and make some live shows nice
and so otherwise on a regular day what
do we have we have my mess of an office
oh look it just nobs by snubs what are
you working on
and writing notes for today's segment
yeah what are you what are you recording
alright well I like crazy and Kali Linux
this is me attempting to be
oh I'm just shooting hack 5 right now
yes and and I'm chugging sparkly water
like it's going out of style
I'm gonna go bug Sarah hey getting a
caught up from orders over the weekend
oh my gosh this this is an average crazy
day at H a k5 and associates alright hey
Paul what do you say we like most to a
commercial break and then when we get
back we'll find out about trivia no I'm
gonna have to call you back
actually hang on just a second you know
it really doesn't matter if you are a
monkey in the middle or a hacker working
for bananas you've got that killer idea
when it hits you need to snag that
domain name and the web hosting vast
domain coms quick domain discovery
system it's easy to check out and having
a website up and running in no time I
mean I love domain oh come
their affordable reliable easy to use
and they're on social media at
domain.com on twitter it makes it a
really fun place to do business because
there are huge fans of hak5
so they've got to hold up it does 15%
off their already affordable domain
names and web hosting I have to do this
use the coupon code hack I have a
checkout that's right they've got the
hook-up hak5 so anything domain names
think domain.com yeah 40 tons of bananas
welcome back now it's time for the
trivia question of the week
