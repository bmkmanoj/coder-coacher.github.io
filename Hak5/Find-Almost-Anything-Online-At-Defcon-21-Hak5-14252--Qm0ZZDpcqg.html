by go to assist so John what is the
latest with showdown and actually before
her that even for our new viewers that
are not you know that have been living
under a rock what is showed an all right
so show it in is a search engine but
unlike Google was showing you can find
devices let's say you want to find you
know an eye is 64 no web server you know
running no windows XP or something I
don't know you want to find an operating
system you want to find a device you
want to find a router printer anything
that you see around the house webcam you
can use throw them to find that and so
how does show Dan know where everything
is on the internet so the way it works
is I just basically port scan the
internet randomly so you one day you're
welcome you're like you know I think I'm
gonna put scan the internet today and
then you just fired up n map and then
went to sleep for what three months a
little bit more than that and I actually
did that that started because I won't
try to port scanner so I love
programming and I was like well I love
in math but I want to figure out how it
works myself so I wrote a basic since
scanner and I just started randomly
picking eye peas and checking them and
it was very slow at the beginning I only
grabbed you know like a few 10 results
per second or something but yeah I
immediately realized that I expected
more Apache web servers more like engine
X and like popular would you kind of
deploy yourself but there are ton of
router ton of embedded devices like
Cisco switches like with you know full
root access public everything like that
so very quickly can become apparent that
this is not what I expected to see and
especially as I've been adding like
other services like memcache or reddit
and stuff like that like Mongo recently
it's like whoa this is not what I think
should be happening and I'm just
surprised by the just systemic issues
that are actually out there in internet
and a people up at least for a long time
weren't aware of until show damn made it
easy to find and so how did you make
easy to find because basically like this
is like this I love this because you
know when I was a little kid I would go
do what's called war dialing really just
you ever do that were you dial every
number on the phone book to see if
there's a modem on the other end and
you're doing this with please tell me
you're not doing 65,536 port numbers no
no I don't do everything so I scanned a
whole internet but i only check from
your like a few dozen ports so I check
all the popular like ftp SSH SNMP i also
have netbios and like samba so sometimes
you can like remotely mount systems and
others and weird stuff going on where
were you for you found samba shares just
open on the internet like completely
open public that you see like lot of
small businesses to have like these like
file servers or something and it totally
misconfigured and you see like passport
social security numbers everything like
the information that you need to fax
sometimes whatever they store that local
in a file server and sometimes it ends
up on internet I think this is one of
those things were just like within a
small IT shop that people have this kind
of sense that there is security through
obscurity like well no one knows our IP
address so how could they get you know
it it's like like hat like having your
number not listed in the phone book I
don't I even sure it goes that far I
don't think they even think about
security I don't think it's even on the
radar what they see is that I want to be
able to access my stuff remotely when
I'm at home I'm a small business owner I
want to be able to see everything that I
thought that I own anywhere in the world
so whatever IT needs to do to make that
work that's what I want yeah convenience
convenience is king and that actually
ironically it's not just true for small
business owners even true huge companies
that rent like you know seaman Schneider
like you know people who run power
plants or sell software for power plants
exact same business reasons they want to
instead of sending out a tech guy to
every location they want to have the
ability to have one tech guy sitting in
the office managing your 20 different
water treatment facilities so that the
same reasons why small business owner as
a file server big companies that run
power plans you know when web servers
and that's the latest new hotness with
showdown and the kind of stuff that
you've been getting in the press lately
is because SCADA systems tell me about
those and and tell me about like you
know as opposed to the small business
owner say dams and France yeah so SCADA
is an abbreviation for supervisory
control and data acquisition systems
really long fancy abbreviation was
actually means all the power plants
traffic lights heating in you know air
conditioning systems like everything
that you see around you that you
probably don't expect to actually be
powered by a computer or have a web
server on at least turns out they've
actually over the past decade slowly
added web service to them so businesses
can remotely manage them but they
didn't think about security when they
add web servers and people on the
security industry have been complaining
for decades about the lack of security
in these SCADA systems and now since
they're becoming online those
vulnerabilities are actually becoming
relevant because all of a sudden you
know before you have to be physically
there to actually plug in a bowl and
really whatever but now they're on the
internet and so people are very shocked
and surprised by that and that's why I
like big outlets like CNN and slowly
I've slowly started to pick up on and
also Congress lets you know mind you
this is the critical infrastructure that
our nation is so concerned about with
you know there's been a couple of Acts
trying to go through Congress as far as
you know securing our nation's critical
infrastructure than some you know about
what was it subsidizing like IIT
penetration test instantly things of
that nature for these companies that are
well critical to keeping on you know our
water and our power and everything going
that makes this nation you know work
yeah exactly people are very frustrated
that why our business is putting these
things online in the first place like I
mean it makes no real sense and the
reason they do it is usability right and
so it's cost exact actually yeah saving
money that's that's what it really means
instead of hiring 20 people you hire a
few people that can manage everything
remotely so that's why they want to
create these policies are some people
are advocating for policies so the
Congress can create business incentives
so they if you don't probably secure
this you know either you're not going to
get some tax incentives or you're not
going to like you get fined or other
regulatory you know things can come down
upon you if you don't do these things
properly it's like PCI in HIPAA will
make its way to infrastructure yeah
funny you mentioned HIPAA because there
is nothing like that okay hipa protects
patient privacy right but it doesn't
protect the medical devices well why
should I be concerned about medical
devices who would put a heart monitor on
the internet right who does anything
ever like that yeah no surprise yeah
obviously there are hundred monitors and
what's really shocking is actually many
devices they weren't telling it wait
tell tell Matt like like te l NE t like
423 yeah telnet the ancient service that
most people consider to be dead decades
ago like just use SSH I mean anything
it's an unencrypted service you can see
all traffic that goes through it it's
notoriously insecure but it's really
easy to use
and it really is a deploy of say I'm
making a device a medical device where
I've got a serial port and I need a
nurse to be able to plug into it get
some data off that's a different thing
that's a serial port yeah but if you
need to have it in the connected manner
than the analog to a serial connection
for most people's telling it so people
are surprised there are more telnet
servers on show dan don't know HTTPS
then HTTPS there's more of that the most
insecure protocol there's more of the
most insecure than there is of well
sadly the most secure thing that's
ubiquitous yeah exactly so it's it's
completely shocking people don't realize
how common tell it still is and it's not
dying out the baby is it because of the
the life cycle of these scattered
devices because like say I'm in IT I'm
gonna deploy a web server and I expect
to upgrade that every three years or so
because you know I get faster cheaper
better whatever have you I'm not gonna
stay on I is five right but do you don't
have that same mindset in SCADA yes get
it you can't easily just like reform at
a power plant you can't just you know
take it offline for a few days and be
like don't worry about you know nobody
look care we're just gonna do a cold
here people exactly so the same things
don't apply you don't have the same
infrastructure for patch management and
all like in a framework upgrades because
these were deployed like 20 years ago or
something that they old systems and
companies just buy a small module the
serial to tcp/ip whatever and then you
can put them on internet so with some of
the crazy stuff that you've seen on the
internet so obviously there's a huge dam
and France that was discovered like a
year ago now and even after a year I
haven't checked recently but last I
checked it was still insecure and this
is a huge hydroelectric dam in France
and it had actually a history of people
complaining that it flooded and it was
wasn't properly maintained so this is
the damn that was like on internet and
the information was sent to the DHS the
DHS was like holy like this should
not be online so they call it a French
cert and a French third contacted is a
huge chain of things it has to happen
they eventually contacted the people who
own the damn and the people home they
were like we don't care how is this a
problem like nobody's gonna find this
why should we care it's littering the
issue if they don't realize the
technology or understand the technology
they're using this is kind of like a
reoccurring
thing in infosec is it doesn't matter
how awesome your policy or your
technology is when people just don't
care is a lot of it comes down to
societal issues yes the human factor
right I mean that's why social
engineering as like picked off
tremendously to pass like a few years
and everything like that the human
factor is the limiting factor in many
ways so what does show Dan do for a
penetration tester coming back to the
service because okay so how did we get
from you know where we are now where
you've got a database of millions and
billions of you know insecure devices
and telnet to you know scattered devices
through your website and the one day
where you woke up and decided you were
going to port scan the internet so my
initial idea was show Dan was not for it
to be security-related at all I thought
it'd be used for market research like
you know your Microsoft means like well
who's using apache which data center is
not kind of stuff or like like netcraft
exactly I actually modeled a bit ly
after netcraft but I have thought well
netcraft only looks at web servers I
could look at ftp as a sage I can look
at all these other things and provide
the same information so like Cisco can
be like well where r jr pro-rata is
deployed and just I thought it'd be used
for market research competitive analysis
that kind of stuff yeah well turns out
it's been used for something very
different and much more interesting and
and so how do I get started using
showdown right now so it's actually very
easy to get started because a lot of
people have already saved searches like
example search as you go showing a
website people have saved searches to
find you know routers with default
passwords anonymous FTP s power plants
wind farms so even if you don't have any
specific knowledge you can get started
by just browsing the search directory
that's on show them and otherwise just
type in whatever device you see around
you know type in pineapple you might see
something first just type in whatever
you find you can type in like futurama a
lot of banners they have you know funny
messages like it / / to slashdot does
that with their HTTP POST is there's a
futurama quote in all of the HTTP
headers yeah exactly and like reddit has
like a sequel injection in the header so
they're all these things like hidden
gems WordPress has a job advertisement
so like if you see like you know X
hacker if you see this message send them
an email to jobs at WordPress so yeah a
lot of these companies have like you
Nick banners so it's kind of cool and so
how often do you keep it fresh because
the Internet's constantly a moving
target what do you do to keep the
database updated yeah so obviously day
is only as good as fresh as it is you
know whatever that's being very new so
on average I scan all the ports like you
know once a month so i would say on
average once a month is when I you know
how many how many nodes do you have just
scanning the internet all day not that
many like only a few dozen and I yeah
only if you did did you ever win you
were this was a proof of concept before
it became the commercial success that is
show Dan did you ever have any problems
were like getting kicked off of ISPs for
doing this on servers or virtual private
house or whatever have you yeah all the
times when i first started should and i
ran it on like really really gbps is
because you always pay a print for those
things and if the shut you down and you
lose your money so but over the years
since i've been mentioned in some news
outlets it's become easier like for
examine lieberman he mentioned
metasploit and showed in in like in New
York Times op-ed and if I can refer to
those sort of things the people like the
VPS providers and now I use dedicated
service mostly that's why I fewer than
before when at VPS SI like 60 Plus you
know VPS around the world because they
kept on getting shut down due to abuse
emails and stuff like that but now
everything's been more stable I have
some partners I collaborate with and
they kind understand what I do so it's
become easier do you find that certain
devices respond differently depending on
the geoip you mentioned that you had you
know you had like 60 VPS is around the
world when you scan are you able to
filter by what is shown to me say if I'm
coming out of egypt vs if i'm coming out
of the US so you can filter by that but
obviously there are different results
that's why I do have service in
different countries I have service in
the US Iceland Russia and some other
countries as well because I want to be
geographically diverse because obviously
you know for example a lot of people in
the US they might just categorically
block China like just categorically and
the same thing happens with other
countries of the US were just some
things you know they might not be
friendly to that so yeah you search for
these things but I try to include all
the data on internet as best as possible
well and so what's next for sure dan are
you are you gonna ip6 uh not anytime
soon you're not gonna scan a trillion
trillion gazillion yeah well no problem
well to be fair you know people thought
ipv4 you know decade ago was like it's
like four billion oh my god no you're
never getting me to look at that right
so okay I'm not gonna pretend like ipv6
is the same magnitude but there are
tricks you can do so you'll probably not
brute force there are some dns things
you can do and you know you can
translate from you know using dns from
ipv4 to ipv6 and stuff like that but
yeah i'm looking forward to adding ipv6
they'll be interesting so thanks so much
