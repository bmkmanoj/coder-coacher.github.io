you by gazelle the fastest and easiest
way to sell and recycle your gadgets
with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse coming to
you from CES 2011 and i'm here with jack
from smart fish technologies now you
have some pretty cool looking keyboards
and mouses here can you tell me about
these a little bit yeah when we started
this about five years ago we decided to
take technology in a new direction
instead of building peripherals and
technology that helped him benefited the
programs we wanted actually actively
help the users using them and in
something really hadn't been done it was
an incredible amount of white space
around it now these keyboards look kind
of interesting can you tell me a little
about about those but when I got started
what hit my head is I want i was
thinking very Jetsons his old cartoon
where all the technology sort of came to
you you know yeah I'm used to the Jetson
right I love it so i said it's really
interesting that no technologies really
done that for us I mean ever and when I
went to look in Dallas we could develop
it I mean there was literally nothing in
the space so I went very simple with the
keyboard which is essentially a robot
and what it does is every our cells
worth the work it changes position on
its own so this is really good for your
like i.t giroux's the guys who are in
front of the computers for eight hours a
day amazing for them amazing their white
papers who studies been done on these
things and the efficacy is off the
charts that's awesome now tell me a
little bit about the mouse the mouse was
a little bit of an accident i'm sorry
the mouse is a little bit of an accident
we were going to put a motor in here but
we didn't we just put a pivoted to show
how it would work with the motor and we
gave it to people they said such as most
comfortable Mouse we ever got to try and
we're trying to figure out why we
learned is with a rigid mouse your wrist
and elbow and shoulder are forced into
an infinite amount of subtle position
changes throughout the day and it's
tiring so when you put us the simple 35
Center 50 said pivot in a mouse and a
half of a mouse and your movie had it
accommodate you it actively works for
you my devices worked for you and this
does an amazing job we actually had one
of the head designers of call of duty
send us a love letter and said he was an
incredible pain and he started to use
this border on amazon and it's amazing
it just changed what he does and he's
pain-free that's awesome no would you
say this would be good for a gamer
amazing for a gamer it is and we have
new technology for gamers that even
more just before I do that we have a
laptop version and this will be
available in apple we're going to make a
bluetooth version of it this is our f
o2micro dongle these are 4999 the bill
go to our website it gets smart fish com
but they can be available soon an apple
com in a bluetooth version and
eventually hopefully the apple store as
well this is just an apple a version of
this oh the mice roll cross compatible
right now pc apple but apple likes to
have nothing hanging off their laptops
that's we did of course of course now
what is this guy well my
sixteen-year-old Jared plays a lot of
games and I watch him and you know I
realized that the difference between
winning and losing liking these you know
call of duty games is how fast you can
hit the buttons and you know the thumb
itself is a very small muscle fiber in
there so it's very slow and it's a
really tough limiting factor so what I
did was is we put a pivot with my you
know partners LP 9 design we put a pivot
into the handles so now we get to attack
the button with the entire arm rather
than just the thumb we took away the
limiting factor just being the thumb and
the scoring is off the charts it's
amazing what gamers come here and there
just loving it yeah that's really really
cool for me because I got tiny hands and
it is so hard to reach up and hit the Y
button and these will be off for
christmas 2011 the mice and keyboards
the keyboard is 149 99 the mice of 49 99
except for the bluetooth which is 59 99
and is all available at get smart fish
calm and this will available in about
six months excellent well thank you so
much i really like these and i can't
wait to play with one of these when they
come out thank you so much jack i
