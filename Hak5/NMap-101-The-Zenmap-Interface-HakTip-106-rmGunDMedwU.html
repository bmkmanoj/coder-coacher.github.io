welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas
I'm Shannon Morrison today we are
checking out Zen map yay Zen map is the
graphical user interface version of nmap
and that's available for Mac Windows and
Linux so you can get in anywhere it is
free and it basically just takes all of
those different commands that we've
learned up till now and sticks them in a
really easy to use front-end that anyone
can learn cuz it's super super simple
so installations for Zen map and
walkthroughs can be found over at nmap
org today I'll just walk you through
some of the simple steps to get Zen map
working on your Linux computer so first
off if it's not installed yet go ahead
and use sudo apt-get install Zen map to
install it and then once it's installed
you just type sudo Zen map to open up
the GUI so I'll do that
pseudos and map I'll put in my password
which is super hard and complicated for
everyone to remember hahaha and I'll
move this into frame for you guys you
can make it look all pretty there we go
ok so this is what Zen map looks like
kind of simple looks super super easy to
use so up at the top you're going to see
a line for the target this is the line
that you're going to put in your targets
IP address such as mine which will be a
my usual ten dot 7330 1.74 and you'll
also see a drop down for any of the
other ones that are similar that you've
used in the past in Zen mat because
it'll save them all now as you type your
target you'll also see the command
underneath there will change so this is
the command that you would use in your
terminal if you were just using regular
nmap and it should look awful familiar
at this point because we've gone over
every single one of those options now
under profile you can also choose your
type of scan that you want to use
because a whole bunch of built in so
some of the options would be there's an
intense scan intense skin with UDP
there's a regular scan down here which
does just the default scan through and
map the ping scans listed right here
this is going to scan discover which
hosts are up and running and then
there's several versions of that intense
scan up here which is going to quickly
scan give version detection give you a
verbose output and also does an ICMP
echo ping so every time you change one
of the things in the target or the
profile section so for example I could
choose the ping scan you'll notice that
the command line also changes so it
changes to SP ping scan pe PA with a
whole bunch of different ports and then
the IP address of my target it's very
very simple to use and then once you hit
scan your skin is going to commence and
you'll get an output that's very similar
similar to what you will see in the
terminal so I'm gonna choose to do I'll
just do a regular skin because that
one's pretty quick so nmap 10 dot 73 31
74 hit scan over in the corner and
you'll notice this little button right
here starts moving so that tells you
that it's currently working once it
stops you'll be able to hit details over
in the section over there and you'll
have all the information that you would
normally get in your output so it looks
just like what you would get in the
terminal now this is just breaking the
ice with Zen maps so I'll be right back
with more after a word from our sponsor
the hack shop is hack 5s premier store
for all of your pen testing needs
including one of my favorites the USB
rubber ducky it looks like a flash drive
edit types like a keyboard you guys know
that because I've mentioned it before
and it's awesome
type scripts into a computer crazy crazy
fast like this week's favorite from null
zero it'll skip scheduled a daily FTP
upload of your favorite files saving you
lots and lots of time that's pretty cool
and of course we couldn't do this show
without your support so we would like to
thank you with something special you can
use the coupon code snubz with any order
from the hack shop for your very own
signed hacked tip stickers thank you so
much for supporting the show
we are back with Zen map so let's go
ahead and get straight into customizing
so you want to do a scan that isn't
found under the profile list that we
mentioned before
you didn't want to just do a regular
scan or the ping scan or a quick scan or
something like that you want to do
something completely different
well it's super easy you can actually
customize your own you just go up to
profile and click new profile or command
you can also edit selected profiles if
you've created some in the past so I can
click on new profile and then this pops
up so a lot of these different options
that you'll see throughout these
different menus are going to look
familiar as well so you can click
through the different tabs and you can
choose your different options and then
Zen map will automatically create a
command for you and then when you hit
save it'll be available in the profile
list so for example i'm gonna choose
let's see let's do a tcp skin with
student knoll scan and then I will do
version detection why not and I can also
add things like scripting targets source
other timing all sorts of different
examples and you can also add in
specifics so if I wanted to do a max
time to scan a target before it times
out I could add in I could make it do
two minutes before it actually times out
on a specific target now luckily all of
the options listed also have help info
on the right side so if you get confused
or you forgot what something means you
don't have to go back to my previous
hack tips you can just check right there
because they're all very
self-explanatory now you can run that
new command that you just made so I'll
turn that off because that would take
forever and I'm gonna name this one
let's see what am i doing version
detection okay so i'll call it version
detection and then I can also add a
description
this is snubs ooz version detected and
why not and then hit save so now when i
go up here i can go all the way down to
version detection it's going to change
to the targeted the target for this
specific one it's going to change it to
SN as
we for version detection and map and
then I just hit scan and it'll go ahead
and run my new one it'll scan just like
normal you'll end up with the same
output that you normally would if you
were running this in the terminal and
you'll get an output just like you
normally would so everything works
exactly like you would expect it to it's
super super cool and very easy to use
and now that you know how to create your
own profiles and do a little bit of
customization your mission I'm giving
you a mission is to have some fun with
Zen map discover all what all of the
fuss is about because next week I'll
take a look at Zen mats output options
and all the different tabs involved
there and some feedback from you guys
