Netflix welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus in IT
ninjas I'm your host Shannon Morse and
today we're checking out an alternative
cloud storage service now a while back I
was looking for cloud backups and online
storage and there has been a lot of talk
lately about things living up in the
cloud aka accessible anywhere where you
have internet but it's so expensive that
I haven't found it worth the time and
research to find one so I've always
stuck with my external Western Digital
two terabyte hard drive but what if
there's like an earthquake and my entire
apartment explodes and disappears it's
that one time when cloud storage would
actually come in handy or of course when
you need to access your files anytime
anywhere
I guess it would be kind of handy to
have it then huh anyway enter a drive
yet another free online storage solution
found over at a drive dot-com a drive
has several storage plans starting from
their basic plan which has 50 gigs for
free all the way up to their HUD D
premium plan that can do anything from
100 gigabytes to 10 terabytes yeah it's
a lot and the costs are a little bit on
the pricey side starting at 69 fifty
annually and going to 695 monthly and
increasing from there but luckily they
all come with 14-day trials if you're
curious about those features from one
plan to another and a drive comes with a
lot of features each plan includes
folders and directory uploads and
downloads an easy search tool remote
file transfers and file sharing the
pricey plans have FTP access file
histories a desktop client for Windows
Mac and Linux yeah SSL encryption oh
yeah
support and no ads but for me 50 gigs is
just fine and dandy so I went ahead and
signed up for the basic plan now the
fact that the basic plan has 50 free
gigabytes of storage means pretty much
diddly squat when you consider the fact
that there's no SSL
or security you can't even upload to a
secure FTP connection I mean like WTF
mate but luckily there is a way to
safely keep your files in a drive
without needing to pate I'll let you
know a while back I had done a tutorial
on TrueCrypt which will encrypt your
entire hard disk or just a little select
volume but this tool is another way to
encrypt your important documents second
is lock note can be found over at sega
knows calm or sourceforge.net slash
project slash lock note and it's another
way to encrypt all those important
documents it'll encrypt your text notes
for free and it enables you to give your
file password protection and I'll show
you how right after this quick break
with more than 20 million members
Netflix is the world's largest

monthly price there are no late fees or
due dates as a new member and a hack tip
viewer you can get a free trial
membership go over to netflix.com slash
hak5 and sign up now be sure to use this
URL so that they know we sent you I'm
back with Locke note and a drive now all
you have to do to download this is go
over and download the program extract it
and open the executable file and I
should mention you can also use this as
a portable app which is super super cool
erase the text and copy in your own so
I'm going to copy in let's say that my
3ds friend code if I could spell is too
six six five seven eight nine or
something like that and I don't want to
share it with the world but I do want to
share it with my friends and I want to
make sure I have it on hand if I ever
need to give it to anybody all you have
to do is copy in your own text and then
choose to save it and enter your new
password so I'll go to file save as and
I'll put this on my desktop ts code and
hit save and I'll ask me to enter in a
brand new password so I'll make it game
what she just lost and it's ready to go
and now I can exit also if you ever want
to change your information or if you
want to change the knee of the text or
erase it or whatever you'll also have to
put in your password again okay now I'm
done any time you make changes to lock
note it makes you save with the password
as well I can now save all the attacks
information that I had in a secure a es
256-bit encrypted file and I can use a
drive 350 gags gigs even though they
don't give you any SSL encryption yeah
so now that we have Windows SkyDrive a
drive plus all the others out there that
I haven't checked out I think if I
organized it well enough I could put all
of my files in the cloud in a way that I
would never have to pay for storage just
a thought
plus the fact that I can securely
encrypt my text documents in a
password-protected file makes it even
better and I could even encrypt an
entire volume and TrueCrypt to make it
even more secure awesome twice the
security I want to hear what you guys
think of cloud storage let me know which
ones are your favorite especially once I
mean of course
