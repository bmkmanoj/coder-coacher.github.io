by domain.com hello love about my use
different kitchens is your weekly this
is technol assess Shannon Morse another
one and she might have had some sugar
everybody will get a hack fun yeah it
does tangle this we're having what sorry
cool sorry we're really really excited I
don't know if you guys saw the
announcement last week about the thing
but this Saturday like the 12th so if
you're watching this before the 12th
it's about to happen if you're watching
after what you already know but uh oh my
gosh yes if you're in the San Francisco
Bay or you can get there somehow get
there everyone can get there by the
plane there's hey there's free beer
really yes I like we should probably
explain what we're talking about there's
a new pineapple as you guys know and so
on out to the Baltic at 135 park place
in richmond california to the cute
little point richmond shaking in the
back totally and we're gonna have it to
open for all eight years inside free
beer only for the people 21 and over
obviously they check ids yeah so if
you're under age you'll have to pay
you'll have to not drink i'm gonna sing
that's right i'm dale chase is gonna be
there i'm gonna have karaoke singing
with you as well as dual core there's
gonna be no karaoke that's gonna keep it
flowing and anyway it's i'm super
excited about this is we've been working
on this particular thing for a very long
time and finally we can talk about it
and finally we can bring all of this to
fruition and then everybody can come out
and get one of these and it's going to
be a lot of fun so come and do that
what's that someone is yes the tears
there you go boom you have been
pineapple patched i have been patched
there you go haha i was patched hey
we've got a great show it's a little bit
of shorter show obviously because we're
all kind of like crazy trying to make
this awesome event happen but we're
talking about file synchronization and a
little sniffy sniffy tonnelle action for
some some cookie not even cookie it's
just like session hijacking love cookies
most ridiculous way what kind of cookies
well okay so you know how you talked
about firesheep in the past yes well
imagine being able to do that but not
just for web cookies but basically any
authentication token and do a
hijacking attack and here's the
beautiful thing typically when we talk
about these to talk about like doing a
man-in-the-middle attack where we bring
the client to us and then we sniffing
and then we go out pretending to be them
yeah mudge talk too much from you know
Armitage from Kobol strike over a derby
con and she should uh off is awesome huh
don't give it away anyway yes it tunnels
the other way it's good it's a really
really cool thing yes Oh guess what I
went to a run fest and I sing a song
with Dale this weekend and it was really
fun cool that has nothing to do with my
sex animal video but it's a total
tangent okay there might be there is
their photos of you in a her Miami
costume um no might be not yet okay well
then stay tuned for that as well as
you're talking to yes Andrew I'm talking
to my buddy andrew he's from code 42
those guys that mean crashplan right
which is so so nice for backing up
everything in case you have earthquakes
like we do out here which hopefully
doesn't happen anytime soon but in case
it does all your stuff gets backed up
well they made this new thing called
share plan and it basically lets you
sync stuff okay so I'm not just to be
clear this isn't a sponsored segment or
anything like that but they are friends
of ours because they do the crashplan
stuff and they just announced the new
stuff and in talking to them it sounds
like they are really targeting the
enterprise yeah and i must say based on
some of the things i was so much of a
fan of crashplan and i'm kind of less of
a fan of share plan now because it
doesn't support Blowfish and it's not
it's not using the open source good news
it's well their API is I'm the
encryption you can't be y 0 and I
understand when you've got to play with
the government and those are your
customers and they want you to register
with NI you know u Zen is T frameworks
and stuff for encryption but you know
however if you are looking for like a
sinking and sharing plan and you're just
necessarily like trust Dropbox for your
enterprise sure then it must be no worse
than a dropbox it's another option that
you have sure yeah that's one way to put
it cool alright well and you know with
that you always know just to rely on
your own stuff anyway and put it on top
layer at all oh yeah in car we're gonna
have some cake but when we get back we
have cake more awesome Sophia
all right be right back cheers good
rough yo what's up man it's so good to
see you what is new oh dude I think gang
signs every time I see you know so I'm
working on something really cool called
browser pivoting and what browser
pivoting is take a turn your attention
here yes yeah browser pivot it's a proxy
server that inject into a targets
browser okay and this proxy server
fulfills requests using the browser's
communication API called win on that and
every request I push through this proxy
server comes out authenticated as the
user think of it as a post exploitation
firesheep for everything like everything
being what like web down like s okay so
cookies I get cookies like an HP
authentication client ssl certs so you
can go to like facebook yahoo mail some
sort of outlook internal thing
sharepoint whatever you want you can go
to any websites that the user logged
into nice and what you're seeing here
like in the South video is the users
being prompted we're watching their
desktop to log into yahoo mail i'm going
to speed it up a little bit they're
putting in their pin during yahoo mail i
come up to my browser which is going
through theirs oh my god need to type in
yeah yes I'll because so it did like the
cookie hijacking for you it's an
everything hi hold on my dad yes so how
is it that you're able to set this proxy
up on on the the victim machine here
okay so the assumption of this tool is
that I the attacker am on the box so
I've compromised them somehow and this
is a risk demonstration to a way to show
what's possible an attacker lands on a
place because a lot of people say I have
two factor authentication I'm safe yeah
okay the attacker can't get there but
this is not true if it occurs on an
endpoint on a system you have to assume
they can do anything the user can and
this just proves it even in the face of
two factor authentication I love that so
here are you actually watching their
traffic through another server or are
you just doing it locally I'm not
changing anything in their browser I the
attacker and proxying through them
I'm proxying through their browser this
is an application-level pinner wait wait
you're not making them come to you and
then you go out you're going through
them it looks like they did it so it's
like a reverse oh my gosh you're right
it's an application-level pivot wow the
forensics on that is wicked because it's
coming from now it's even uglier than
that the forensic evidence left on desk
is their browser did it the cookies
update the history is updated okay how
do I get my hands on this how do I use
is this built into cobalt stride in the
cobalt strike yes just drop two days ago
haha dude you're always coming up with
doing wicked stuff okay working people
that have been living under a rock find
out about coal strike because this is
like walking through the hole like the
community edition in covel strike and
how the interfaces with the good stuff
so cobalt strike cobalt strike is a set
of red teaming tools for thread
emulation built on top of armed kitch
Armitage is like the free thing you can
get that at fast easy hacking calm but
if you want browser pivoting go to WWE
vance pentest calm just get a trial it's
21 day trial includes everything nice
dude I'm so stoked about this
congratulations thank you like a wicked
tool I can't wait to start playing with
that cheers my boy Dave what's new bro
hey what's going on man we're here at
Derby concert I though and it's so far
it's been going good it's till Saturday
but I mean it's been an awesome con so
far a lot of great talks what's new this
year you know this year we had two
parties so Friday night we had a party
with dual core who rocked the house and
tonight we have the crystal method which
really looking forward to but really I
think this year has been one of the best
personally for me the talks themselves
have just been absolutely outstanding we
had 127 speakers and it just went really
really well in fact John copia gave a
talk I was in John Povey urge FOP I just
gave the second Jeff Pope yeah I gave a
talk just a few minutes ago and the
stable talks around basically breaking
into almost any safety could possibly
imagine it was so simple in fact the
safe that he had on there was the one
that I use for my gun safe in my house
so you watch on stays and open it up and
everything but there's been a lot of
cool stuff on hacking airplanes you know
basically getting Christian keys off of
Android devices and just a lot of
Awesome qualities Hawks this year that
is probably better than 0
any other year combined and not to
discredit any other talks we've had
priors it's always been good but you
know this year has been just an amazing
experience all together and a great
family feel nice well I love that you
guys are really fostering that here at
Derby con so what's new with you and
your projects well I'm working on the
social engineering toolkit obviously so
I just didn't major release recently but
I'm actually working on a project right
now and I actually haven't announced it
so this I'll be the first to talk about
it here so basically you know as a pen
tester I find that I'm meaning more and
more customized distributions and
frameworks so I've actually built an
entire framework around building your
own pen test platform that can be used
on ubuntu debian fedora everything else
and it's all modular based and so
basically you can start to deploy your
entire pen testing framework pen testing
tools everything automatically built for
you in your own pilot distro and it
keeps them up to date all the time real
time so it makes it's a framework
builder the framework builder so
basically what's on it is like you don't
even have to know how to code to add
different tools or different modules
into is it like when you would install
like an ubuntu server and you check the
boxes like oh I want lamp and 001 send
mail and oh I wait for your hacker to
nice it's all it's all basically
metasploit syntax so it looks just like
metasploit inside and out just to keep
the familiarity with the with the
toolset so you do show modules and it
shows all your modules there it's got
all your tools listed there and it'll
automatically keep it up to date you can
add new modules in and it's literally
it's only like six or seven different
things that you have to build an order
to build a module super simple and makes
it easy for us to spend testers to be
able to build its ok that's brilliant
that it keeps it all up to date what is
it you've got your own repos and stuff
running it actually hooks into the repos
that we develop the tools for so we'll
actually continuously monitor tools that
are coming out whether it's get or
debian repositories or whatever and it
automatically go and pull those based on
deviants and changes based on database
checks and things like that we've put 44
checksum so it works out really well
it's really scalable superfast allows
you to deploy a system really quick and
you know for me personally when i'm
doing pen tests you know i love
backtrack i love cali it's amazing
framework and i'd always continue to use
it but you know if I want to get my own
flavor of my own things my own tools
especially working you know inside with
my own custom frameworks and tools it
works out so well it makes things a lot
easier and it's gonna be really
community driven so
yeah cool nice little corporate
wallpaper and everything exactly with
all customized yeah I love it my steers
yeah cool man well Dave I really
appreciate it thanks for having us I
hear he's pleasure he makes for coming
