the Ben Heck show so check this out last
night I ran into John McCoy who has
these ridiculous laser hands yes that's
right laser gloves and there are lasers
that are controlled on each individual
finger yes and so where did this come
about this was just kind of a fun
project back in the day when we were
going to college me and my friend were
kicking around the ideas it was his
passion and he just kept running with it
and now laser your hands and so what
what exactly are these these laser guys
here these are 5 million layers and
they're driven off of a battery pack on
your arm and tried to make it feel as
natural as possible to have lasers on
your fingers and they come in multiple
colors blue and red are also really good
and custom built and heading towards
production so I'm not really familiar
with with lasers all that much as far as
like the wattage and whatnot so it's 5
milliwatt really high 5 milliwatts is
still in that legal range and there's a
legal range and if there wasn't a legal
range the note wouldn't be high but
compared to like a laser pointer you
would find a store it's fairly high and
these are a little higher quality than
you would find at a normal store and
their infrared cut off and so you can
cut the laser off in the infrared and
then have only the pure spectrum and
have 5 milliwatts peer spectrum coming
out so they're higher than 5 million out
because it's cut off so explain it to me
so you're saying that there's an
infrared spectrum that comes out of here
as well yeah yeah and that that infrared
spectrum we don't see and appreciate and
and it also hurts the eyes and that's
why there's a 5 mil away so you're
saying you can shine this in someone's
eyes and it's not gonna kill them
yeah it'll annoy them after the fourth
time I'm sure well I mean and this is
perfect for like raves and deejaying and
everything but I can totally see like
how you know dangerous it could
potentially be and also like how
fantastically bright they were you could
see the beams in the sky too for like
you know 50 feet up and that's insane
yeah yeah and yeah we were looking at it
yeah it was it was a little foggy here
and like it was like having a lightsaber
for like five six hundred feet like
Street yeah and it was kind of like
seeing cats like have lasers and now
it's like people have lasers okay so
explain to me does the does the color of
them have anything to do with the the
brightness or how does that work yeah
the the perception of it like purple is
higher on the spectrum and so it doesn't
seem as bright but blue and red are more
easily seen so the perception yeah okay
cool what about the glove so this is
these are your friends over at trinary
products calm and their this is like
just a proof-of-concept build it started
out that way and more and more sales
kept happening so it's de-facto
production model nice and so this is how
is this all powered and how do you
recharge this what kind of like battery
life you get out of it on your arm is a
custom battery pack you plug it in 3-4
hours charge it up and then battery
packs in between usually I would five
four or five hours and throw a couple of
battery packs on there and you can just
swap it out real quick and keep going
all night long yeah yeah that is that is
also what's your mobility like with
these on there excellent like after the
first I would say like ten seconds it
pretty much feels normal like
yeah yeah yeah it's just like motorcycle
clubs they said yeah they are like
motorcycle gloves and there's actually
like a wire under the glove yeah and
that takes the power up your yeah it
doesn't feel that weird right yeah no
not at all
yeah then plug that and which way does
it go so right on the red side there we
go cool I'm getting cyborg okay so how
do I turn it how do we control turning
them on and off there's an neodymium
battery here and then there's another
one that completes a circuit up on the
top of your finger here so so I just
touched them yeah little yeah there it
is oh so this is temporary holding them
off and then I let go and it goes back
to the on position and see if you like
it takes a little bit to get your brain
to map to you're controlling something
way out there yeah I feel like I feel
like I am Locutus of Borg
we will assimilate you I don't know why
this is just very very enjoyable hang on
it yeah no it hurts too yeah thanks so
much John this is ridiculous where we
can people find this stuff and and also
where can people find your dotnet
security research these are at trinary
product comm green is $600 and yeah
custom high-quality lasers yeah yeah and
my security research over at digital
bodyguard comm and upcoming Metasploit
comm upcoming dotnet exploit whoo I like
that we're gonna have to talk about that
later I will be in your workshop sounds
fantastic man really appreciate out oh
yeah there we go
cyborg meets human or high-five there we
go
