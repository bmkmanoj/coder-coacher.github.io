lab with open source Linux friendly
alternatives to Zen Center plus
vulnerability disclosures all that and
more this time on hack 5 this episode of
hack 5 is brought to you by domain.com
hello welcome back 5 my name is darren
kitchen
hey my name's Shannon Morris welcome
your weekly dose of techno last I'm
super excited I had some mutton highly
caffeinated how are you oh my gosh can I
just start with saying I just sat in my
PJs all day yesterday I paid in my nails
and watched anime it was amazing this is
why you tuned in to act 5 to find out
what color Shannon's nails are this week
Shannon what color your nails this week
they're red white and blue cuz July 4th
is this look at it look at that guy's
psycho be like a few marker mirco so
patriotic um I want to give a huge
thanks to everybody who has supported us
being and launching our first pen test
with hack 5 yeah we got to test on like
34 students Oh grab my soda here and
just Cheers
yes awesome um this was an epic
experience and I emphasize the word
experience because that's exactly what
we were trying to provide here is an
alternative to the typical being taught
at in a room there it's quiet and boring
and monotone but instead we got people
together and did exactly what I love to
do which is build community and so I'll
show you a couple of photos here but
basically the event was our first ever
where we did pen test training we did it
in the warehouse in the warehouse and we
taught USB rubber ducky we taught turtle
we taught Wi-Fi pineapple Moo because
they're teaching Metasploit we all had
about eleven students each and it was so
much fun to just go through all of the
stuff that we're so passionate about and
have that one-on-one time with the
students and developers of these tools
getting epic feedback and teaching all
the ins and outs and a lot of the bits
that may not be as obvious and then
second day was so much fun being able to
go out into the park yeah so we had a
lot of field exercises Tom Merritt was a
what was
that I don't know what that what it was
that was so weird
Tom Merritt Dez did some epic videos for
it was very story based it was really
cool thank you for participating and
actors in any time yes it had nothing to
do with that picture you might have just
seen but except that it actually some of
the students were like oh well you know
we could just point the gun at Shannon
that's it happen a social engineer her
the think that really social engineering
challenge limiting the scope no rubber
hoses I'm just putting that out there
that's amazing
all right yeah anyway Penn test with
hak5 comm is where you can find out more
about that we're going to be having more
dates here soon and we're just really
thankful that we were able to get an
epic group together and they were our
guinea pigs
yes they were we were pen testing on
them yes wait actually that's re we're
pen testers I click ha ha
tell me about threat where's Ben in epic
week yeah it has so we did this pen test
with hack 5 over the weekend and then we
come back on Monday and it's just like
whoa the world's blown up again so
threat wire is another show that we do
here in the hack 5 warehouse it's over a
threat wire dotnet so we talked about
internet security privacy internet
freedom basically this week Patrick
Norton just reported on this today
apparently MAC address privacy just
turns out might be a thing coming up
pretty soon
also Cisco security appliances just
happen to be vulnerable due to default
SSH keys that surprise never get changed
or anything so yeah that's a big boo-boo
and you might have heard about this
thing called the OPM hack big government
lots of people and that have like 40
million or something yeah so it looks
like China just might be the ones that
hacked OPM but we're gonna continue
reporting on that as the News threads
out and as we actually find out who is
behind it so check out threat wire over
on the hack 5 YouTube channel hack 5
it's a youtube.com slash hack 5 and of
course that's your source for security
privacy and Internet freedom yeah I got
my money on evil server I bet it wasn't
full server yeah it's not just illegal
server yes I'm gonna talk about some
proxmox because we had a lot of people
in the comments being like dude loving
the XenServer stuff but
yo dog what about proxmox yo dog heard
you like yours in servers but I have as
inserter for your press right right
right so if you've been following along
the last couple weeks we're building out
a little mini cluster of I love it's
like if you find cute hardware the first
thing you should do build a Beowulf
cluster of it so we've been doing kind
of that with with Xen server it's an
open source virtualization hypervisor if
you will it's a free and open source
piece of software you can put on here
and then load this bad boy up with lots
of virtual machines so we can do all
sorts of cool tests things we used a lot
of these in our labs at the pen test
with hack 5 and it's great for that kind
of stuff but this is not the first time
in fact there's probably the third
virtualization series that we've done on
hack 5 the first wet with VMware's ESXi
or sxe if you ask me as well as in
season 10 or 11 we did promise cycle
that old PC and build a proxmox virtual
server Oh what was wrong with that set I
think that's Dave's garage it is Dave's
garage okay well yeah so we did a
proxmox episode as well yeah and I guess
we could just go through some of the
differences proxmox ve it's an open
source hypervisor it works on bare metal
it allows you to install Windows and
Linux servers using KVM a VM which is
epic
KVM virtualization is really cool stuff
which supports like not just Linux hosts
but like windows and other weird
operating systems that you want to play
around with it also supports openvz
which allows you to do a lot of Linux
hosts on the same machine and it does
that very efficiently
XenServer very similar open source it's
bare-metal hypervisor it works with
Windows works with Linux it's based on
the Xen project hypervisor and they both
share a single admin interface we're
going to talk about some of the
differences in some of the workarounds
because I know last week we showed the
Zen Center which is a Windows centric
front end for it but it turns out there
are alternatives being that it's open
source
I think proxmox ve I think some of its
strengths is just that it's so quick to
spin up and I love the both the openvz
community and the k vm community yeah so
it's a great
and virtualization neutral yes we are so
you could some of the stuff from that
season 10 episode actually all of it is
still relevant today so you can go ahead
and spin up a server using you know
off-the-shelf hardware that way pretty
easily I will say that Zen Center is not
that great when it comes to the
clustering oh and my availability in
that you have to have more than 50% of
your nodes on at any given time to move
stuff around I see I just like how
simple XenServer is for you know live
migration clustering XenServer is good
for clustering proxmox is not that's
been my experience and I of course
anybody's gonna argue that but there you
go
XenServer versus proxmox basically when
it comes to Linux hosts they both both
run Linux houses n uses pair of
virtualization or PV proxmox uses openvz
what are your para virtualization it
basically does it all in CPU where there
is you have a single Linux kernel right
so because under the hood both both
practice proxmox and XenServer both run
on Linux and they have modified Linux
kernels that allow their guest operating
systems so in this case either proxmox
or Zen server is the host operating
system and then any subsequent virtual
machine that you install on top of that
is your guest and so if you're
installing a Linux guest on Zen server
it's going to use para virtualization
and on proxmox it's going to use openvz
the similarity there is that they both
use the hosts kernel so the host is
running kernel 3.8 point whatever then
so is the guest so it's a guess gotcha
it's a pretty efficient system they both
work very similarly okay it really the
differences really come to when they do
bare when they actually do full
virtualization in that case
virtualization which is what you're
going to need when you're running a
guest that is very different from your
host right because I can't get Windows
to use the say Linux kernel that I'm
using on my host that's just not gonna
work yeah that makes sense
so in that case for Windows guest which
of course are important for us when we
spin up all these you know vulnerable
Windows machines that were gonna pop in
the class
XenServer uses basically hardware
virtualization I think that's what they
call hvn something like that hvm oh yeah
yep whereas proxmox uses KVM the cool
thing about those is these are different
components that are easy to switch out
and swap out and if you wanted to you
wouldn't have to go with either of these
you can just install KVM on your machine
I do know that that Zen servers version
of their full virtualization suite right
uses a modified version of QEMU again
another component that you can install
separately so it really just comes down
to the in the end they both do the same
thing I think for me when it comes down
to is that since we did that series on
hack 5 in season 10 or 11 on proxmox
they now charge about 5 euros a month
per CPU or a subscription to their
stable software updates now again it is
all open source it's GPL and you can
grab those it's just a little bit more
difficult to get yourself updated and
yeah I not yeah so if you're getting
paid to do this maybe this is you know
like 5 euros a month is fine forget what
that comes out to in the US probably
about $50 or something like that but
anyway they're still in school and
you're building out your own like home
personal use virtualization server then
maybe Zen is the best for you right and
as we did last week in a 24 minute
episode with all of that we were able to
spin up a machine like that so you know
so easy is it is really easy so I've got
to hand them a lot of credit when it
comes to that okay so today we are also
checking out a alternative to Zen Center
correct yeah so that was some of the
biggest feedback is that people are like
wow that's cool and all but Zen Center
is window specific right I think some of
them what do you do for the Linux guys
right so in that case we're going to go
ahead and use an open source Linux
friendly alternative to Zen Center and
it is called open Zen manager yay
simply sudo apt-get install opens n
manager and I don't have to go through
this because I've already done that and
it's already installed and that's it
that's like the one line command really
yeah
that was boring it's actually based on
Python so you could literally just you
know download a tar.gz of the Python
program and run Python space open Xen
manager and pop up the GUI once you've
done that you can just run open Xen
manager and I'm going to do an ampersand
to fork that process and there we go and
so the purpose of the project here is
actually to try to do a one-to-one
replacement in Python so this it should
look it looks really similar it's
basically the same thing we hit this and
we can go ahead and connect to that
server and there we are and here's you
know we have all of our templates right
so all the tempers for different
operating systems and we can see the
local storage and hey there's tar the
Ubuntu virtual machine that we created
last week and I can go ahead and hit
start just as we did before I can check
on memory and storage and network and
all of those other things and even
switch over to the LAN soul and start my
installation of Ubuntu server just like
we did before
so nice and easy to use and perfect for
Linux there you go
and actually perfect for Windows as well
all you need is Python so if you don't
want to install the Zen Center the only
major difference really is that you
can't activate licenses with this which
if you're using the open source stuff
you don't necessarily need to it's
really only if you're paying the
subscription for support and you know
both openvz and you know citrix
xenserver
have like an a support subscription
model it's open source I got to pay for
it some way so I think that's fine but
just keep that in mind that if you're
looking to activate a subscription you
would still need to do that on Zen
Center and then the only other thing
that I can't do and this is kind of a
big one is from what I understand it
does not push updates over a manager so
you'd have to do those manually which it
isn't really that big of a deal we can
get into that later but remember when we
were showing the console that you get
you could do it through that or you can
just SSH in it's not that big of a deal
if you're comfortable setting up a
python-based front end you should be
comfortable setting up updates and you
should update regularly so so of the
major virtualization options that you
have out there which one is the one that
you've used the most oh that's a really
interesting question because I feel like
at this point I've actually used all
three of them in the in the sense of
here at hack five in the lab as it were
for fun and for you know testing I've
used them all pretty equally on the
desktop I've used probably VirtualBox
which is a desktop virtualization system
probably the most but that's not really
for deployment servers and then in a IT
environment definitely VMware ESXi yeah
and that probably still would recommend
if we're talking about like enterprise
deployment just because they are like
the big name in-house and you know ain't
no one got fired for buying VMware
well you're not the only person in the
world that thinks that hey what do you
think let us know in the comments below
let's go ahead and just like kick off
the virtualization flame war I will be
down there with my flame-retardant suit
looking for Godwin's law to invoke
itself otherwise feedback at hak5 org is
the place we will be back in just a bit
but first we're going to take a quick
little break a break if you've been
watching act 5 for a while you know how
much we love domain.com we use whatever
we register domains and I wanted to tell
you about some epic new projects coming
to hack 5 in the warehouse this summer
it's all about bringing people together
we're going to be dealing open source
projects and drone racing and all sorts
of good stuff which is why I'm so hooked
on this new TLD that domain.com told me
about called dot Club I have so many
crazy awesome ideas for dot Club this
summer so I want to tell you about it
because it really is the perfect TLD
it's globally understood if you say Club
not just in the United States but
anywhere people know you're talking
about bringing people together and isn't
that what the internet is all about
anyway so if you're thinking about
naming your startup coming up with a new
business I think you should definitely
consider a dot Club it's the perfect
social domain name so this one we get
ready for a bunch of awesome hack 5 and
dot Club stuff and in the meantime if
you're considering get a new website
head over to domain.com slash club and
register your club domain they start at
$9.99 a year and there's still a
bajillion available and when you do
make use of the coupon code hak5 that
saves you 15% off and lets the domain
calm guys know that we sent you over
there so thank you so much for your
support and of course when you think
domain names think domain.com you guys
know that we value your feedback and we
actually got a really interesting email
to feedback at hak5 org that I wanted to
check out with you guys and maybe talk
about a little bit with you Darrin
Robert asks hak5 team so I've been
playing around with my SDR listening to
various different repeater systems both
ham and commercial while doing so I
stumbled upon a towing company while
listening to the towing company they
proceeded to run a credit card
what happened next shot the crap out of
me they read the credit card information
over the radio obviously I would like to
get this policy changed but my question
to you is what is the best way to do
this
thanks love the show from Robert well
Robert that is scary also yeah I think
text I guess it would be considered
plain text if it's over the plain voice
should we go with that and you yes like
yeah that's really sad that I can
understand why a towing company would be
doing that because they have to talk via
the radio to get their job done but
credit card information on an open radio
I don't think that's PCI compliant I
also don't know the laws in your areas
of regards to listening to open signals
now how do i personally feel i feel if
it's in the air its public and then open
for you to listen to but some may argue
otherwise i would love to hear if
there's some comments that could defend
the towing company in this case yes of
course would say that they should
probably find an alternative system in
fact square on an ipad an iphone or
android or whatever this is this whole
email brings up the discussion of full
disclosure versus responsible disclosure
which we've even had some personal
connections with as well but there's
been a ton of this kind of stuff going
on so yeah i thought we should just yeah
actually we just talked about this on
threat wire last week there was a
zero-day for iOS and apple reported and
this was because security researchers
notice that there was a bug in the
system and actually went to Apple they
said hey Apple you got a bug you should
probably fix this because it kind of
deal and then Apple was like cool give
us six months and we'll fix it well six
months go by they didn't fix it so then
the researchers actually published the
paper later on when they you know
decided they weren't going to fix it
yeah which lights a fire under Apple's
asked to actually get it done which is
good uh so not so kind of sad yeah we've
actually experienced both ways that this
has gone down is yeah we have so last
year at Def Con I hunt pineapples owned
these brand-new pineapples that we had
there they had been patched but devices
burned with outdated firmware at the
factory in that case it was full
disclosure because he basically just
released that information to the public
then just really said you actually
attacked pineapples at Def Con when new
users were setting them up and that was
a perfect example of you know full
disclosure because we found out when
everybody else found out now of course
that since lit a fire under ass to fix a
bunch of stuff and since then we've
added a bunch of security features that
prevent the attack right uh
interestingly just a pen test with hack
five and I love this is a great example
of this a security researcher that was
in the class demonstrated to us a
vulnerability that took advantage of
some of the security features that we
put in place uh and that's an example of
responsible disclosure so now you know
Sebastian's working on fixing that and
we even encouraged him then to go and
give a talk at Def Con the wireless
village to ha talk about it cuz it was
actually a really interesting exploit so
that's really cool I like that he was
able to come to you as like you know the
company and the security researcher and
like join hands to come up with a
solution to fix the issue before making
it into a bigger deal right and I don't
want to sweep it under the rug either I
want to actually emphasize that it was a
really cool hack because it could
technically self prosecuted I don't want
to give it away I really hope he does
give a talk because it was cool code
yeah um but I think that it's like you
know it's a personal decision how you're
going to go about this personally given
kind of the severity of it I would
really like just let them know you might
want to consider doing it anonymously
it's not like they have a bug bounty
program or something like that
so you're probably best off because I I
just know from experience too many
people who report bugs who report like
hey you're doing something over the
all right and then the company freaks
out and calls the cops instead of
looking at it and saying oh let me call
a security researcher instead or maybe
hire you to actually fix it for them
yeah and then you're the bad guy like
you don't want to get in that situation
I know this is some people that have
gotten in trouble with their schools for
doing this
please don't hack your high school or if
you do so don't tell the do not the
authority of a person that tells you I
would say anonymous responsible
disclosure is probably your best bet in
some of those regards I mean they own
people who have gotten in trouble for
the Pentagon showing them
vulnerabilities which is kind of crazy
you would think that the US government
would be like oh thank you for letting
us know work and we would like to fix it
not hey you're fired anyway the other
hearing over there oh so bad yes
although I would like to hear from the
ham guys in the comments if it is in
fact if he then committed a felony or
something of that because it's not
wiretapping it's not wire fraud but I'm
just wondering what the legality is
there if you accidentally overhear
something right oh you you peeping tom
you well this is just a question of if
somebody's walking by me and having a
conversation on a public street and I
just happen to hear something that I
shouldn't have heard when I'm passing
them going to like my local coffee shop
what if I hear them say something
illegal am I not supposed to say
anything to them about it like are they
going to report me for hearing them
because if you look at it from a
real-world scenario it's kind of the
same thing
mmm this is where flood kicks in and
then ya see something say something
kicks in and then we end up in a police
state so of course feedback a hack five
org or I will see you guys in the
comments below up and really love and
diving into it with you guys cuz we get
the best YouTube comments especially on
the red wire and i-5 you guys are the
best we love you you know what we love
you so much that we want invite you here
I don't know but it is at the top of the
show but basically we are very excited
to be announcing our very first open
house with hack 5 that's right we are
having ok no we're doing this Saturday
July 11th starting at 11 a.m. we're
gonna be like Saturday yeah next
Saturday you said this Saturday the this
this next Saturday Shannon okay didn't
you hear me I said July 11th July 11th
starting at 11 July 11th out of
we're gonna barbecue we're gonna
barbecue the snausages yes we have my
micro quad Racing we're gonna do some
server builds we're gonna show up some
Wi-Fi hacks we're gonna allow you to get
first hands on the turtle turtle yeah
turtle you mean the turtle that
pentesters get to use yes I like turtles
hack 5 org slash open house is where you
can sign up and get all the infos we
would love to see you here it's a
family-friendly event so you know bring
bring the kids fly some drones have some
fun mayhem will ensue bring things for
kids to do cuz I don't have anything for
yesterday sorry
no we've got we've got quad copters with
spinning blades of death I call our
insurance company after this hack 5
episode but I do value your feedback let
us know if you think it's a terrible now
I'm joking we hope to see you all there
we're gonna be building out the labs
we've gotten a lot of feedback for labs
at hack 5 dead org for people who want
to build servers and deploy stuff on
this Vinnie night 5 Network now that
I've got all that bandwidth so that will
be kicking off at the at the open house
cool gonna be setting up those wiki's
and all of that it should be a lot of
fun feedback at had 5 or you can email
us let us know what you're interested in
checking out on the show or off the show
or wherever even in the warehouse and
hack shop calm a check a shop calm
that's where you can go to support us
directly via our online merchandise
store yeah it's a really cool place with
all of that I'm Darrin kitchen
my name is Shannon marsh trust your
techno lost Joshua take test your pens
sorry you a pen tester now nope are you
legit pen pal sir you're legit fan fest
or now congratulations you just got your
certificate for being a pen tester what
else you got my challenge going huh
it's got a the wind chilling here you go
which number did you get nice I want to
challenge one I was a teacher assistant
server I don't look for evil server yeah
you have a flame-retardant suit yeah
totally Damian I've been on IRC since
the 90s oh yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
