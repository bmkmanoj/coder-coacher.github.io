by go daddy
Netflix Squarespace and Goose
hello and welcome to hack five this is
your weekly dose of technology I am
Darrin kitchen I'm metal eStock and I'm
snugs
snugs Shannon Morse I thought so too I
think we're just giving up on the whole
I must you guys don't call me by my real
name anymore I've pretty much given up
what you tune back to like the first
three episodes and it was Shannon
Morrison and now and you watch it aside
from the fact that a standard def and
looks like it was a composite cable
dragged under a truck um well it was
Shannon Morse and it was Shannon and now
it's nubs yeah so soon it's just gonna
be yeah all right hey anyway we have an
awesome guest in studio with us it is
well he's not in the studio from the
great white north in Studio insinuates
that he's here present is this
television not here I'm not gonna get
into this with you right now
anyway it's Peter Gorillaz from the
Academy procom Peter how are you man I'm
doing great man how you guys do it oh
not bad how's that Rodgers action
treating you up there
oh it's crabbed is there a better
bandwidth uh you know what not for the
not for home not really no you got bail
and sabbatical and all that good stuff
but they all pretty much do the same
thing yeah I I can never say so padico
symbiotic Oh some Patsy I learned it at
cfh because in the control room like
it's all they ever said because they did
MSN webcam stuff
yeah fundus so um so yeah it Peter man
you are the founder of the creator of
the the Academy procom right yes I've
found her yes lots of help on the
creation bird so would so for those that
aren't familiar with it would it be
proper for me to say it's kind of like
the YouTube of security videos oh yeah
kind of although we don't let people
just upload stuff on the fly that's
pretty much the only difference so it's
like YouTube but without not getting
kicked in the nuts pretty much yeah well
it's YouTube with moderation how did
this come about about a couple years ago
I've been a consultant for about a
little over a decade
and a couple of years ago you know I
thought of a way you know a better way
of thought of a better way of actually
giving out information to people for
free to better configure their security
technologies be it their firewalls IPS
systems you know ideas whatever it may
be in yeah that's how it was pretty much
born we kind of started with a cracking
little Joomla template with a bunch of
plugins and launched a website with 50
60 videos on it and it's grown from
there to I think about 300 now so I take
it you are you still in Joomla No yeah I
thought it looked a little WordPress II
to me a little WordPress there you go
being in the security field you really
probably don't want to run Jolla when
that that's not this isn't that this is
just like you dissing the the Ubuntu
crowd I told you about these no no no no
no open source hold on a second hold on
let me clarify this when your web host
and you see somebody that does not
update their Joomla installation that's
a difference and completely routes your
box you could say the same thing about
about WordPress because I had a
wordpress 1.1 blog that well anyway so
atomy man what kind of videos what kind
of subjects to you guys cover anything
from commercial products like you know
checkpoint firewall source fire to you
know open source technology penetration
testing you know with car Whisperer
Nessus and all you know all the great
tools out there just a little bit of
everything and you guys release like
daily videos and tutorials and stuff how
do you keep up with that basically what
we're doing this weekend is what we
typically do every six to seven weeks is
five or six guys that together
all weekend and you know basically
create over a hundred videos which alas
that's about two three months and we add
the voice of them later on and kind of
just put them out daily that's pretty
much it and Wow can you imagine do it
and say whoa hold on how long are they
summer three four minutes some are 50 it
all depends yeah different episodes and
and that's just that he's got the MU mix
waiting at Pearson for you to pick him
up right now right yeah actually he just
estimates me right now okay so he's on
the tarmac that's good you're in good
hands if no leaks is coming down let me
tell
yeah oh yeah so but there's got to be
like a hundred other places to go and
get kind of like this this would you
consider security training uh what we
Darin what we try to do at the videos is
a lot of the times vendors tend to
release hour or two hour-long webinars
that bore the crap out of everybody no
one wants to sit on those anymore and
they're not very technical they're sales
marketing information what we wanted to
do is basically take you know what you
want in a specific video for example if
you want to know how to configure you
know network address translation on a
checkpoint firewall we'll make a two
minute video on how to do that you know
if you want to know how to install a
checkpoint firewall on ten different
platforms we'll make that if it takes 12
minutes that's fine so we kind of hone
in on specific topics yeah so what would
you consider like the special sauce that
makes the academy unique oh the special
sauce we can go to youtube and just
Google for whatever security thing it is
and there's a 14 year old that's gonna
teach you how to web crack well you know
what the problem is is I'm all into
those sexy web cracking videos right
they're all nice and stuff the problem
is there's not enough vendor focus for
example you know we all like snort as is
a great you know open source ideas tool
and so on but not everybody can run
those in their environments because
they're not commercial tools you know
it's it's unfortunate but that's just
that's just the way it is right so the
thing is we're bringing commercial tools
to pretty much everybody for free from
the from a training perspective very
cool well we will be keeping an eye on
it the it's the website is the Academy
Pro coming you also have a new site the
Academy home
yeah the Academy home comm we launched
it a couple weeks ago it's for all the
pretty much that's why you came out of I
don't want my relatives calling me
anymore for support you guys all know
what I'm talking about that site pretty
much said go over there we'll teach you
how to do that so you know and hopefully
that one grows a little a little bigger
as well so it's been going good for the
first couple of weeks awesome well Peter
thanks so much for joining us this
evening and I gotta say we are looking
for will hit you up next time we're up
in Toronto cuz you know you can buy us a
records read right I'll buy you a case
of Records man yes
to drive because man last time every
time we go to Canada man it's like cases
of records in the trunk that in Sleeman
alright thanks so much theater man take
care and good luck over videos this
weekend with Robin everybody thanks a
lot guys
we pretty much I think we're running a
little long so let's move some stuff to
the d-block and kick it over to Shannon
now see what's going on this week in our
land party sure actually this week we're
not having a game but this month we are
little lead time I forgot about that
it's the whole time warp syndrome what
are we playing snubs
we are playing two zombie games for you
zombie panic and left for dead I know
I'm so excited it's on February 28th
that's a Saturday and you can play at
either two of our servers you can play
at l4d hack 5 org which is the left 4
dead 1 or zp hack 5 org for the zombie
panic 1 we know that only 4 or 8 players
can actually get into left the dead at
one time so we're playing two games for
you and I also have to thank our sponsor

membership check it out at netflix.com
slash hack 5 and please don't forget the
www
next up I think Chris has got something
to talk about some a USB device tracking
Chris you're back finally USB device
tracking does that mean you're gonna
like stick a little device tracker
inside of my USB as I'm stealing your
data and I run away in my car no not
really it already kind of does that for
me
yeah there's no device there's no homing
device in there but it leaves a
fingerprint on your system it leaves a
fingerprint yeah okay it's actually a
fingerprint it kind of leaves like hey
this is who I am
this is when I was here this is what
drive letter I use and everything like
that so information yes so you have the
registry pulled up I do I have just
ragged I mean there's a lot of that you
know there's better registrated goes out
there but I just use reading when I'm
you know quick and dirty so what we what
we mainly do is I got the stuff from a
Harlan Carvey's book was a really big
help as I had to learn all of this stuff
for my job so one of the places that you
can go to to start the tech and I okay
you know where's the where do I start
here what do I need to know well you
want to know the serial number you know
and then you want to use that serial
number to find out all kinds of other
information so do all of these different
USB devices have different serial
numbers even if they're like from the
same model brand most most of USB keys
have a unique serial number um sometimes
I don't and if they don't the
plug-and-play manager will assign a
unique number to it okay so in here
we're in the local machine entry if you
go to H key local machine okay we scroll
down under software and we'll have this
in the shown it's the whole all the
different key pass because it's kind of
it's gets a little maddening when you're
scrolling around sometimes I start with
current version underneath there under
windows currentversion and this is this
will tell you kind of where your actual
device path INF is which has all of the
different driver IDs for all the
different generic USB you know whatever
window ships with all the drivers it has
okay so this is a good place to start
you can go in there and start writing
down numbers and you know and looking
for those numbers in here one good one
of the better places to start looking
though to actually find out what was
plugged in is under USB store under EMU
and I'll have the full path button
probably it'll probably scroll down
right here so underneath here we can see
that there's a patriot device and then a
USB flash memory more generic which yeah
a treat one blue one and the other one
is a one yep that's the one that I
plugged into the VM here's the classic
GU ID and the the driver see how they're
they're the same number yeah this is
what it pulls from that INF it says okay
says we know this is what you're gonna
use for a driver because it's just a USB
device and that being shared has a
hardware ID Patriot memory there's a
parent ID prefix and if you if you go
back over here as opposed back over this
is the actual serial number that we're
gonna use to track everything through
the registry okay so that's what I would
write down this is what you'd write down
and here's the other one we would write
this down too and if we go now and once
we have these we can go to another part
and once we have these written down
because you can't just search you can
search it but it's a it's a little
easier to do it this way we go under
system currentcontrolset control and
then device classes now this has every
single you know kind of plug-and-play
everything that has ever been plugged
into your computer you know so we just
kind of rent I actually went and just
opened them all up until I found which
ones had because there's about six or
seven of them that have different
information about USB keys these these
two right here are just what happened to
have the serial numbers in them so say
somebody gets into my computer and I see
this random USB device listed in here is
there a way that I can see if they like
took data off my computer cuz my day job
we're all about like security mmm-hmm
that was very big breach it would be
there in the in the registry there is a
way to actually determine when the last
right time was to that device now here's
our Patriot device right here we open
this up we click on it and if we if I
scroll this over you can see there's our
serial number
right yeah now we know that this entry
right here has to do with that Patriot
device so if I right-click on this and I
export it right as a text file which I
already did there we have it open right
here so if we look in here this exports
data and right in here you can see last
right time and it's in there twice but
it just has a lot of its extra data
7:32 p.m. earlier today yeah it was when
I actually plug this thing into did
before I came down here shows you and
you can actually use this to corroborate
when you go into your recent documents
folder under the documents and settings
you can see Drive letters that are
mapped to files that were recently
opened and you can you can go back in
here and under mounted devices right
here
I'll have this thing down at the bottom
too and you can say okay you can go in
and figure out what Drive letter was
used with that recent Docs that's a
little bit more advanced but that's one
of the uses forensically that you can
you can do you see okay it was Drive
letter F the last right time was 7:33
p.m. and we know that our schematics for
you know some top-secret missile was was
taken so most likely it was that USB
Drive with that serial number
if you don't do forensics there's a lot
of other things that use this data for
instance if you've ever heard of I think
it's called I hound
it's a phoning home kind of software you
install it on yeah I bought iPhone USB
drives and it actually pulls information
out of the same places and I'll actually
a lot more places too because it
identifies for you you know your actual
computer or the installation it kind of
you know yeah and it takes all this data
and uses that so that it can identify
that device phone home hey this was
plugged in from a low you know an IP
address in you know wherever Russia or
something you know so now you know that
you know somebody in Russia has your
iPhone that's cool well I'm definitely
gonna check this out on my own computer
make sure nobody is stealing my data
exactly so where can I find more
information like this what did you learn
it I actually learned it
from this book right here by heartland
car via its windows forensic analysis
and like to sell it or anything but that
just uh exactly my bosses book and it's
been a very great help I'm gonna I'm
actually gonna get a copy for myself
because I'm starting to do more of this
stuff just in general and I also there
was also a paper that I had written by a
couple students at the Edith Cowan
University and they they used a lot of
the same they used this book as a
reference and they were they put it in a
very easily digestible easy to enter
yeah so that's why I learned and you
know it's great thank you very much
Chris and I think we're gonna shoot it
over to Darren now for trivia that's
right last week's trivia question was in
PHP which is faster and why echo hello
world or Britain hello world
that was correctly answered by zoltÃ¡n
who wrote that echo is faster because it
doesn't return a value and we've gone
ahead and hooked him up with pro Nobu's
it was awesome electronica album zero
equals one equals everything you've
heard the music throughout the show and
their bumpers and whatnot so you guys
are interested in it check it out at pro
no bozo calm now for this week's trivia
you can go ahead and just find all the
clues you see him popping up here and
there and everywhere and you put them
together and that is a password that you
go ahead and enter over at hak5 org
slash trivia go ahead and enter in to
win your chance to win uh this week's
trivia next week with the week's in the
trivia so of course I've got to thank
our amazing sponsor for the whole trivia
thing and that would be GoDaddy if you'd
like to make an impact online go
daddy.com has what you need calm names
as low as a dollar 99 plus world class
hosting that's an easy website builders
and much more plus as a viewer a pack
five and you get five dollars off an
order of $30 or more when you checkout
with code hack - so anyway some
restrictions apply to the site for
details and get your piece of the
Internet at godaddy.com I'm gonna kick
it over to Matt now and see what's going
on with a router of doom
back in I believe was it season to
correct me if I'm wrong season season
two that we did smooth wall and our
smooth vault has been going flawlessly
for the last two years I came across a
basically smooth wall on crack product
that you guys might like
it's called pfsense and basically it's
built on freebsd and it's a fork of the
mono wall project now some of you use
mount a wall some of you don't you can
find out more about that I believe at
mono wall org you can go to pfSense com
to actually download a live live CD
installer or an embedded installer what
we're gonna do is I'm gonna show you
guys how easy it is to setup pfSense
that's gonna be this episode what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna then go on and
show you how some of the more advanced
stuff like openvpn and you know VPN site
two sites so on and so forth in future
episodes so let's dive in what we're
gonna do is we're gonna start our
computer with the live CD that we've
burned yes I'm aware that I need to
install the VMware tools and what we're
gonna do is it's gonna start up and we
have the option to install or just run
pfSense from the live CD installation
now the nice thing about that is before
you went make any changes to an existing
installation of say our smooth wall you
can actually verify that the setup is
gonna work with your hardware that it's
going to work with you know your network
infrastructure bla bla bla bla bla bla
so what it's doing now is it's actually
loading the live CD and it's gonna start
up here and there's there's a two-step
process first we're gonna set up in the
Michelle and then we're actually going
to login to pfsense from a another
computer to set up the wizard so right
now it's going to ask us if we want to
set up VLANs we have absolutely no
purpose for VLANs here in our
infrastructure so we're going to go
ahead and say no now what we're gonna do
is because I am in a VM I actually have
to disconnect our network adapters
because what it's gonna do is it's
actually going to auto detect for those
of you who don't know your network
interface names I do but for the sake of
showing you let's go ahead and do that
now so we're gonna go ahead and select a
and it's gonna ask us to connect the LAN
interface so we're gonna go ahead and
we're gonna connect the LAN interface
which on ours is a virtual machine
interface so we're going to come on back
over here to pfsense hit enter and EMG
row is changed to link state up so
that's our land interface we're gonna
come back and say eh now it's going to
ask us for the LAN interface so we're
gonna connect the LAN interface come
back in a PF sense and hit enter and
e-m1 link state changed to up so now you
have the option to set an orange
interface we don't need an orange
interface so we're gonna hit enter and
it's gonna ask you to confirm your
interface selection em0 being the land
and em1 being your LAN yes
we would like to proceed so now it's
actually done with its initial
configuration and it's gonna actually
start pfSense to the point where we can
actually log in to the web interface
come on come on there we go so now what
we're gonna do is we're to come over and
in another machine we're gonna open the
internet now for the sake of testing and
showing you guys I've already set up a
static IP the address for the local
interface is defaulted to a 192 168 1
Network so I've already got I think if I
come down here did I get another address
no okay so right here we're gonna go to
192.168.1.1 and we're gonna enter in the
password admin and or the username admin
and the password is pfsense by default
so here it's gonna launch the setup
wizard for PF sense yes you're gonna
guide me through the process you set
your hostname your domain your primary
DNS server I myself when I'm testing
things like to use a DNS
external of my local DNS server just so
that I know I have connectivity so we're
gonna enter 4.2.2 - very easy to
remember 4.2.2 that - if you ever need
to ping anything that's what I suggest
you use because it's always up so we're
gonna select our timezone and our server
for time we're gonna set a static here
because we're actually plugged into our
existing internal network so we're gonna
set a static address and it's gonna be
ten dot 10.0 dot 134 now you guys would
probably use your cable modems static or
dhcp information our subnet is a 24 and
our Gateway is 1001 we've come down here
now these two settings down here block
Boggan networks and block RFC 1918
networks it's key if you're going to use
PF sense in a router behind a router
configuration because you need to
uncheck the 1918 because otherwise it
won't route correctly let's click Next
and we're good with our land IP being
192 168 1 we're gonna enter a password
of hack 5 because we're very insecure
like that and we're gonna reload the
interface admin with a new password of
hack 5 you come over here and we are
going to verify via the pfSense
interface to see if we actually have
connectivity or not so let's go ahead
and see that ping host is option number
7 and Google comm and would you look at
that we've actually got connectivity
within was that five minutes it's very
simple to set up what I'm going to go
into later are some of the more advanced
options of IPSec VPN Open VPN a lot of
the services virtual IP support things
of that nature it's a very very powerful
platform for running
router if you're you know using a
Linksys now and you've got a machine
laying around your house I highly
suggest you guys to check out pfSense
it's got some great graphing with our
deep tools or our Rd graphs and just
some really nice applications and
platforms that really aren't available
to you Linksys users unless you're
running something like open wrt but
that's the segment go ahead and check it
out pfsense dot-com and right now we're
going to end the show finally I know you
guys it's been a long time but we're
gonna end the show we're gonna bring
Darren back like only hack 5 can you
ready mystical magical clickety doo-dah
jicama do well thank you dude I'm glad I
taught you that trick man Wow you know I
just wish that you could kind of learn
the whole like knows to what you do I
can't do the whole bewitched action
uh-huh
we said I drink a G you know it was
foolish amantha yeah yeah cuz i guarante
i know about this stuff but i can bring
you back with my ears nah yeah really
mmm hold that thought all right we have
a whole bunch of fun stuff that we need
to entertain you with and enlighten you
about death but first I got to give mad
props and thanks to one of our sponsors
so let me tell you guys about
Squarespace
I know I've told you in the past
Squarespace is an excellent content
management system that has a very unique
front-end back-end system they are a web
host their plan started like $8.00
around that at ww-where space.com slash
just go there and if we check out with
coupon code hak5 you get 10% off the
life of your order so we're hooking you
up but let me show you one of the cool
things you can do with Squarespace what
are we doing here so you can create
blogs blogs use a lot of the big stuff
that you can do it but you can create
forums and lots of you know really rich
websites but one of the neat things is
when you want to change the look of your
thing I don't have you've ever tried to
install themes and different kind of we
were talking Drupal earlier this is real
simple right so we're in just the
regular mode this is how you see your
website right but since I've logged in
here I get the SPECIAL toolbar at the
top I clipped this button right here and
now now in this style switching area now
we've got this custom hak5 theme for our
land party that looks awesome right and
it's all done with like you know just
and dropping stuff doing some custom CSS
but they've also got a whole ton of
built-in themes and you can just cycle
through them by clicking any of these
and they've got a ton of them we can
actually switch templates here and find
a different one I'm you are having some
real you're not very good okay yeah yeah
but but you can see there like that one
or the news room looks pretty good and
you can actually add live see you know
as you're picking them out see what you
like get a feel for it and the cool
thing is once you've created one you can
clone it you can dig deep you can do the
CSS I'm showing you how easy it is to
create forums and and file drops and all
sorts of stuff with it it's just it's
pretty drag-and-drop it's really it's
probably one of the most powerful
platforms than I've seen in ten years of
hosting and developing websites yeah
planning with the trial of cs4 stuff
that we've got right now looking at
Dreamweaver I don't know that I'm a code
guy myself but for a lot of people for
95% of the people on the internet mm-hmm
that just want a website and whatever to
show off their jicama do thingamabobs
square skipped base is the perfect
actually using it for my i've been
playing around with the you know i'm
doing a web redesign for you know the
system and job that have yeah yeah well
I just go to the Squarespace so that it
would just be easier cuz I'm the time to
exactly I mean and time is so critical
in so valuable nowadays it's like if you
have play with open source stuff and
then learn some cool stuff that's cool
that's all mean right but if you just
want to get something out there right
now check out Squarespace calm use
coupon code hak5 it supports the show
and we love that exactly you want to
talk about some code I recently did a
little coding on the show someplace
horrible hey listen all right I don't
said I was a beautiful coder I was just
humbly could have done it better with an
array and that was so beautifully
pointed out to me as I'm sure the rest
of the errors in my code thank you I
didn't realize that Kroll was built into
PHP with a module that's cool yeah so
but I still believe that the
fundamentals of what I was showing like
the the integration of like PHP and
something like VLC with the HTTP an
