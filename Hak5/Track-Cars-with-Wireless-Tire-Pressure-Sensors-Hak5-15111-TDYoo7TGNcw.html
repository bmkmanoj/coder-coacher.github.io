domain.com hello welcome to act 5 my
name is Darren kitchen
this is a weekly dose of techno lost yep
we're just gonna go with that we've got
great stuff from torque on and I'm
feeling silly so stay tuned because
stuff and things so it's very explain to
me why are we sitting in the middle of
intersection in the middle of San Diego
well we're torque on 15 right now and I
just gave a talk on tire pressure
monitors all these newer cars driving by
there's a lot of them in San Diego
they've got Wireless tire pressure
monitors that are transmitting pressure
temperature and usually some other
random bits of data relating to safety
why do our cars have tire pressure
monitors can we just get out of the
vehicle and use a gauge like a normal
person
absolutely but let's face it even I who
I grew up in a car family I'm a little
lazy and I don't actually get around and
checking my tires all that often so a
high five for being lazy guy I'm there
with you bet so the idea was there were
some tire recalls in the late 90s and
the US government legislated these tire
pressure monitors to be installed on all
new cars it would tell you that your
tires a little bit flat maybe it's
leaking
maybe it's in imminent danger of flying
apart but you're saying that Congress
like passed a law that what mandates
that there must be tire pressure sensors
in all of our cars that's correct yeah
as a 2008 all cars sold in the US and
there's some particular details like I
think the cars any cars under 10,000
pounds have to have these tire pressure
monitors on all four tires and they have
to have a safety system that reports to
the driver that there's a problem with
your tire it also you know it's great
for safety and if people do inflate
their tires when they're low they're
also going to save gas which is good for
the environment yeah you're absolutely
right that's cool and I love it when the
government you know mandates that I
carry around you know a thing with
you know RFID or other things of that
nature so you know why not I've gotten
used to it at this point so why should I
in the hacker minded world be concerned
about my car having higher pressure
monitors how do those things work well
the they transmit a unique identifier so
as you're driving along and maybe your
left front tire is a little flat you'll
want to know what your left front tire
you also want to know that it's your
left front tire and not the left front
tire of the car next to you at the
stoplight so as you might imagine all of
these devices have unique IDs so that
you know that you're getting only your
tire pressure watches kind of like a
like a MAC address it's not quite as
nicely sorted out as a MAC address but
it's close enough that there's really
some creepy privacy concerns and and so
when you say transmit you're saying
obviously it's like it's radio because
otherwise how would you wire it into the
wheel I don't see how it's on top or
something right yeah so you can't really
mechanically run power and data lines to
the wheel because it's going to spin so
yeah they solve the problem wirelessly
and it's really cheap to implement
wireless technology as we've seen any
number of other products on the market
like a garage door opener yep really
they're not all that different than a
garage door over it's very simple
similar technology transmits you know
315 433 megahertz and uses the same
kinds of modulation frequency shift
keying amplitude shift keying it's also
very similar to the remote keyless entry
so that you get they're all using very
similar technologies and if they're very
core they're really simple so where is
this is this in my tire is to send the
wheel where do I find it they're
typically part of a valve stem so you
have a rim the metal part of your tire
and then you'll have a valve stem we
have the tire pressure monitor attached
to it installed into a hole in the rim
and then tire goes around all of that is
really not attached
to the rim or the tire pressure monitor
sensor itself at all so even if I change
out my tires I'm still going to have
this in my car
exactly yeah if you get different rims
or you have a separate set of snow tires
then it's a different story but as long
as you have the same set of rims and the
tire pressure monitors are installed in
them you'll be driving around with these
TPM devices so I take it you wanted to
monitor the monitors yeah yeah so I was
kind of curious about what privacy
implications there might be in these
devices it was it seemed clear to me
that they would have to have some sort
of unique ID in order to tell whether it
was your tire pressure monitor or
somebody else's and I started to look at
it and sure enough there are almost
invariably 32-bit identifiers that are
unique per monitor so each car is going
to have four wheels four monitors with
four unique IDs if you spend enough time
observing and maybe correlating the
photographs or a license plate reader
and maybe you have I've been to tire
pressure monitor ID lookout the
manufacturer of the car you get into
some serious privacy problems where you
can actually track people as they move
throughout a city if you have enough
receivers they can receive the
information from these high pressure
monitors as they drive by what the
manufacturers of these systems must be
you know aware that there's privacy
concerns at they made any statements
about this they have their 2010 there
was a paper published by Rutgers and I
believe University of South Carolina
that looked at all these privacy
implications and how the TPMS devices
worked and they came to a fairly stark
conclusion that yeah these are there's
privacy problems there's also potential
attack vectors so the industry or at
least one manufacturer of tire pressure
monitors responded to this and they said
oh yeah it's it's essentially impossible
to track somebody as they drive around
because there's 147 different protocol
varieties and it requires thousands of
dollars worth
and Wow okay so so if they're a weak
signal and it's really expensive to do
it and there's all of these proprietary
protocols there's there's no way we're
going to be able to as hackers be able
to tell some of these people are there
driving around here right yeah
absolutely no way is impossible oh yeah
yeah sorry
well I have a $20 rtl-sdr dongle and a
little $5 intent I got from digi-key I
have a laptop and I have a new radio
that's all I need that's all you need
anything no no well and the software I
published on github today
what is the github github.com /j boon
Julia Bravo Oscar Oscar November Eko
slash TPMS tire-pressure-monitoring
system said that means pause the video
go run you know clone it come back yeah
yeah the only you can do right either
the there's a readme that tells you
everything you need I probably forgot a
thing or two but let me know I'll get it
up there dependency equals brain yes
okay so I take it we just do the thing
we always do as actors we step some
package we analyze them we figure out
how the package structure works so tell
me about your process when you first
started hacking into this well the first
first thing you got to do is collect
some signals and have a look at them
especially if you've got no real detail
about how the system works so I did a
little bit of research I went on eBay I
found people selling tighter pressure
monitors online and they had some really
great photos of the tire pressure
monitors completing the serial numbers
FCC IDs so I went over to the FCC
website now that it's open again and I
will tank your government yeah I looked
up these IP these uh FCC sort of
authorization IDs
and I found tons of documentation and it
turned out to be only a few variants you
have devices that transmit on 315 433
they always transmitted a few tens of
kill Abad modulations a ska at this K
it's all pretty consistent and from the
photos on eBay I observe that almost all
the tire pressure monitors use a 32-bit
identifier so I started collecting
transmissions from cars near my house as
they drove by and saw sure enough on 315
I get some ASX packets and get some FSK
packets and I started to pick into the
individual packets and saw there were in
fact 32-bit items just like what was
printed on the tire pressure model spend
some time doing some statistical
analysis on particular cars I got in the
car with a friend wrote around and began
to figure out where the IDS lived at
least for his make and model of car how
did you figure out where they lived if
you if you look at the unique values
across a certain range of 32 bits in the
package you receive you'll suddenly go
from having a really wide distribution
maybe hundreds of different values over
hundreds of different packets to a point
where you've got four five six seven
different packets and only four of them
have significant numbers of packets
we should wait for these others to go
