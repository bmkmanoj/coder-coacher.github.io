made it to shmoocon 2010 up in
Washington DC at the Marriott Wardman
luckily we made it here from
Williamsburg Virginia going 25 miles per
hour on i-95 north and it took us five
hours anyway we're going to be talking
about and checking out some of the
coolest computer security professionals
speaking about our favorite information
let's go check it out
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by Gamefly go to assist express in
domain.com got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain so
exile air drop ng what is it air drop ng
is a rule based wireless death on
occasion tool so for anybody that's not
familiar with kind of the authentication
what does that mean as far as Wireless
is concerned um the authentication is
packet spoofing and basically you
confuse the client and you confuse the
access point into stopping talking to
each other you just causing them to drop
you know just man all their connections
and from there you can do a lot of
really fun nasty things like
man-in-the-middle attacks or just
generally cause havoc okay so why would
we want to do this in the first place um
there are there are a lot of reasons you
want to do it the biggest one
man-in-the-middle attacks you can
encourage a client to disassociate from
a valid access point and over to your
access point and once they are in your
access point you control the network you
can route their packets you can send a
memory where you want to go you can
spoof DNS now you say encourage what is
it about D authenticating them from
their access point that encourages them
to join another network basic client
behavior on a wireless access point or
sorryi wireless client is to look for
the SSID which is the name of the
network with the strongest signal so if
we have our access point over here and
our client here and they're happily
talking and I set up my rogue access
point here I'm gonna be closer to the
client so when I break the connection
between these two it's going to
immediately start talking to me and
airdrop allows you to facilitate that by
writing rule sets so that if it doesn't
my chance try to talk to me and tries to
talk back to the original one it gets
kicked again now we are big fans of
rogue access point here I mean we are
huge proponents of jhaza guy or the
pineapple if you will and so I feel you
there but don't we already have tools
for D authenticating clients you do have
tools for D within Akkadian clients the
problem is is that they're very focused
on destruction we're going to kick
everyone or maybe we can limit it to one
network but the problem is is that
they're not smart enough to know when to
send a broadcast packet which kicks
everyone off the access point or when to
send just a very targeted let's kick a
single
off the access point so you can't do
things like allow yourself to talk to
the real one and possibly get the
Internet and not allow the client to
talk to the real right because you want
kind of whitelist yourself so by
allowing to whitelist yourself you can
route them to eat them do you do all
your nasty things about yourself back to
the internet and to the client it's
really kind of transparent nothing's
really changed their pages are still
loading and meanwhile we're downloading
all their passwords all right I'm sold
what do I need to get started to get it
started you need lorkhan the older
version we're not currently supporting
the new one that's in a later release
you need pyloric on which is the Python
extensions you need Python at least two
six two five may work you need the
airdrop ng install files and you need
aro dump which handles all of the
sniffing okay so this actually just
makes calls back to aro dunk to do it it
actually it parses the CSV file and
there's a bunch of reasons for that one
of those is mainly that I'm too lazy to
write my own sniffer right if one exists
that works it normalizes all the packets
makes it nice and easy but you have to
use the CSV yes you do have to use the
CSV is that something that you have to
manually go ahead and set up ahead of
time yes you doing it you need to set up
arrow dump ahead of time have it right
out to a CSV file and then the dash F
option in airdrop you just point it to
the the CSV file and it'll go ahead and
parse it later you've got that
documented or in a script there there's
documentation um one of the nice
features is it reverses the rule file in
the CSV file on every second okay so you
can actually update rules as you're
going well let's get into the rule is
the real quick that's what I need
software wise what about the hardware is
that where do I need any sort of packet
injecting yes you do need an interface
that supports back in Junction either a
throws some of the some of the real text
yeah there's the real checks to it the
the alphas will do it love the alphas
quite a lot of cards out there that'll
do it
but mostly you need monitor Mon in
injection you can do it with one card it
does work better with two and why would
you use two um when you're sniffing you
want one card to be able to do channel
hopping and you want your injection
interface to be able to stay on a
particular channel so that you can
inject packets if you put them both on
the same interface it's gonna be hopping
around it's gonna be fighting over
control of the channel hopping
because people aren't aware you can't be
on every what is it 13 Wi-Fi channels
all at the same time 14 overall in 2.4
gigahertz and there are 12 legally
allowed in or sorry 11 legally allowed
in the United States it's yeah you can
use 12 and 13 but that's kind of a great
area yeah we don't encourage little gray
area snow now okay so hardware boys cool
so I've got airdrop ends you set up how
do I configure you we're talking about
these rules and I think that's the
special sauce that puts this apart what
really sets it apart is that rule files
and there's quite a bit of documentation
on this there's three fields you can
either allow or deny in the AP field you
can make your decision based on the ESS
ID the bssid we allow oh you I lookups
what's the no you I look up Oh UI is the
first three bytes of a MAC address which
map that device back to the vendor that
produced it right so I know I can always
tell if it's like a three connect on the
network or something one of my favorite
things to do is to look at Apple devices
this works really well with proprietary
hardware like that so if you go ahead
write a role you can do in the a access
point field you can do any so if we were
to write a rule that says deny any Apple
so any Apple device talking any access
point it's gonna get a kick nobody else
is gonna get one there you go lots and
lots of fun so you so when you're at the
you know the terminal they're waiting
for your layover and you've got you know
two hours to kill and you notice the guy
on you know the Toshiba over there you
can set it right for that particular
notebook if you were you can you're
gonna have to GC Bazaar a little bit
harder they typically use apples in l01
apples a much easier one yeah i
proprietary hard well there you go now
we own the software and anyway so so so
what is some of the other tools that you
can package this up with because it
facilitates a man-in-the-middle so
easily you can package it up with the
Metasploit you can package it up with us
a cell strip you can package it up with
IP tables for all your routing it'll
pretty much play nice with anything once
you control the network packets you can
do whatever you want
this is nice now we you know these are
all technologies that we've talked about
individually here on the show but it's
it's very refreshing to see
how seamless you guys have put it
together with the scripts to just just
make it easy you were saying that this
could also be used as a wireless IPs can
come a bit about that yeah really kind
of the same way that we control what
access point of client is allowed to
talk to it's very easy to take your
group of clients and whitelist them to a
particular access point or a group of
access points and then deny them access
to anyone else
so you either talk to the access points
in the office where you have your
expensive monitoring software or
anything else like that or you don't
like that idea so excellent it's like a
you know it's very much like a scalpel
instead of a hammer when it comes to do
exactly and that was the goal yeah tools
like MDK three are really great but
they're just way too blunt for this kind
of work suite so where can we find it
where can you get her
currently I'm not sure when this is
gonna air but today Wednesday so two
weeks it'll be up on later today I'll be
putting it up on the i hack charities
Informer so it'll set up there for two
weeks and then on the aircrack-ng site
there'll be some sort of news release
where you can go download it for the
fold public routes excellent looking
forward to it I'm sure you are as well
yeah it'll be nice to actually see it
get out get used and see what people do
with it awesome well in just a bit we're
gonna find out from from tuna some
devious things that we can do with it
but I just want to thank you so much for
thank you very much Judy I'd love to
drive the three hours to Annapolis but I
think we can fix your kitten screensaver
from here I just need you to open port
5900 on your firewall firewall that
little boxy thing the internet goes
through look at me just a year ago what
a noob trying to do tech support the
hard way little did I know go to assist
Express is the easiest way to control
another person's computer online provide
instant support to your friends family
members and clients and amaze them by
getting it all done over the internet
you lower your support coffee if you
lower your travel time and you can even
provide support remotely even when your
client isn't physically at their
computer brought to you by Citrix all go
to assist Express sessions are encrypted
128-bit
and to end and you get 24/7 support so
try go to assist Express free for 30
days and you go to go to assist calm /
hack 5 don't be a noob like me this
month LAN party powered by the varsity
sports league is Team Fortress 2 we're
gonna be playing on Saturday February 27
at game hack 5 org and I got to give a
shout-out to the vessel thank you for
your service support you can find the
vessel and all of his information at to
vessel.com/nerdist i'll see you in the
game so chris is hacking gsm the new
hacking Wi-Fi I'd say so and it's it's
even better than hacking Wi-Fi because
at least 802 11 was designed in a
reasonably modern environment with you
know some some understanding of security
GSM dates back to the in a couple of
decades before security was mainstream
and and it makes some very bad
assumptions that we now know to be
completely invalid so what was holding
us back from this the entire time the
the lack of hardware like this this is
the the USRP this is a software radio
system this is essentially the hardware
device that makes it all possible and
and without things like this the the gsm
protocol it's it's very difficult to to
talk the the gsm protocol is very
complicated there's lots of channel
hopping and the hardware just didn't
exist
well i was here two years ago where
hikari was demonstrating some gsm hacks
where he was using a USRP and the USRP
one and his hardware he was saying that
if only he had you know dozens of these
- you know to map the entire spectrum
they have better chance but he was still
demonstrating some stuff where in fact
GS and was using plaintext for SMS
messages and i so what's the difference
between the research that you're doing
and and what was it what hikari has been
doing Hikaru's research is is focused
quite heavily on the the cryptographic
side of gsm my research is is much more
broad spectrum I look at the the
protocol in general I'm looking
you know things like MZ catchers
necessarily cryptographic weaknesses but
functional weaknesses of the system so
things like the ability for the base
station to tell you that you're not
going to get ciphering plaintext
communication between the phone and the
SIM card and then the implications of
that to the system as a whole much more
much more broad spectrum than than
hickories kind of narrow focus on the
crypto okay I'm sure a lot of us are
familiar with at least on the Wi-Fi side
of things when it comes to wireless
security we've got our WEP and our WPA
and wpa2 and tkip and you know eat and
those different protocols when it comes
GSM I'm sure a lot of us are very new to
this can you give this kind of like an
overview of how GSM security works so
the the quick overview is that the the
core of the the core of the the security
in GSM is based around a secret key in
your SIM card called ki and what happens
when you you connect to a base station
the the base station sends you a random
number just a 128 bits of entropy your
SIM card takes that random number
concatenates it with the secret key and
then hashes the result that hash then
gets split into half of it gets sent
back to the base station as proof that
you know that secret key and the other
half is used as a secret key for the the
cipher a5 and that's your handshake
that's the handshake and then you say a5
what is it what what is 85 so a five is
it's not a specific function it's it's
actually a family of functions there's
at least three variants of a5 a5 one is
the the original GSM ciphering algorithm
that's always been in use it's it's been
broken academically again and again and
again and it's it's only recently that
the practical attacks against that have
started emerging then there's a 5-2
which is a deliberately weakened export
grade version of a5 one that's actually
been broken so badly that you can
recover the the session key that was
used from just a few seconds of sniffed
conversation and then there's a 5/3
which is the the 3G
encryption algorithm there's a strong
movement to backport that into GSM just
because it's less broken than the other
GSM ciphers well let's talk about the
practical attacks you're demonstrating
man-in-the-middle passive attacks active
attacks what what are these this there's
actually a whole range of attacks
against GSM depending on on what you
want and what capabilities you have your
proximity to your victim there's there's
all kinds of possibilities ranging from
active attacks where I pretend to be a
GSM base station and entice you to
connect to me so kind of like a rogue
access point similar yes so like karma
or years ago where you well I don't know
how you would d'art them from their
current base station but you encourage
them to connect to you and pass through
and you've become the man in the middle
right it's you actually don't need to
make them do anything all you need to do
is provide a stronger signal than really
legitimate base station there are no
deals involved none at all so if so
we'll just connect if the handset sees a
stronger signal than the tower is
currently on it will just handoff and
then in terms of authentication it
identifies the network that is going to
connect to by using two three-digit
numbers
okay Charlie available there documented
on Wikipedia know which one's the
t-mobile one which one's the AT&amp;amp;T one
and you can see this as a t-mobile base
station if you wanted absolutely all you
got to do is set these two two values in
the open BTS config and then all of the
handsets in the area will just direct
you and send you their traffic say I
were to get myself the US RP which you
can get for like what 500 bucks now
they're a little more than that there
are fifteen hundred dollars okay well
it's still 1,500 for a lot of GSM phone
is I mean you're on what benefit and
well yeah
so I grab one of those and I become the
stronger signal and I'm posing as you
know the three-digit key for for
t-mobile kind of like you know the MAC
address the beginning of the MAC address
identifying the different vendors what
is going to allow me to actually
terminate calls and and how do i bridge
that with the rest of the network and
and more importantly how do I even
indicate them because aren't they
expecting to authenticate with t-mobile
well here's the thing the I'll take that
step by set that's got a lot of
questions to answer there so in terms of
them expecting to see t-mobile the phone
as far as the phone is concerned it is
connected to t-mobile it sees that the
the mobile network code of the mobile
country code corresponds to t-mobile and
it has no way of authenticating t-mobile
beyond that it doesn't ask any questions
it just takes it for face value
absolutely beautiful and then obviously
I don't necessarily know the the secret
key in your SIM card so I won't
necessarily be able to set up ciphering
fortunately if I if I my base station
says to your phone I don't want a cipher
I just want to use plain text for
everything or drop down to that it
absolutely will so it's like just taking
it's like SSL stripper it's just like
we're just not gonna do we're gonna do
at HTTP unencrypted right and and that
the particularly fun thing about it is
that the the GSM specification there's
actually a section in there that
requires the phone to display an alert
to the user if you're on a connection or
if your connection becomes uninsured so
it's like when you you know see the the
you know thing in your browser like hey
the SSL is gone or or we're not exactly
it's not valid so that's good at least I
get a warning that I'm getting owned not
necessarily because there's a
configuration bit in your SIM card but
if your operator sets that bit it
disables the warning message why would
they do that because it's simpler for
them if you get a message on your phone
saying that your connections on in
ciphered the first thing that you're
gonna do is call your operator and try
and figure out what's going on so
security or less tech support calls
absolutely okay I'm done down with that
now they really have done their the GSM
equivalent of checking the box that says
yes except every browser warning that
you'll ever see beautiful I love it I
love that that's already done for us and
as far as the authentication is
concerned like so you've got them on the
on the unencrypted authentication now
how do we terminate the call that's
that's the easy part actually really um
yeah so the the software that I'm using
is called open BTS and it actually hooks
directly into asterisk oh well there you
go you've got your open source voice
over IP I can really just go ahead and
get a voice over IP like a sip provider
yeah I'll get that into my asterisk box
hook it up to my
my my USRP and then you know two grand
later I'm a base station really yeah it
really is that simple and and even
better than that the the capabilities
that it gives you in terms of you know
authentication and everything else it's
it's a fully qualified gsm network it's
it's not just the base station it's all
of the the hardware location registry
and all of the authentication databases
and it just it just worked so if I
wanted to I could get a bunch of these
and become my own local telco yeah
absolutely
I don't know what the FCC would think of
that they probably wouldn't be too
impressed okay
and one of the good things about GSM
hacking at least in the states is that
the u.s. uses 850 megahertz for GSM in
Europe they use 900 megahertz for GSM
which over here there's a chunk of the
900 megahertz GSM spectrum that overlaps
the is M band in the u.s. so you can be
on a GSM frequency and an unlock well
ahem frequency at the same time so as
far as the handsets concerned it just
sees a European GSM network and connect
so you could create that on the unnie is
and band and be completely free to do
they well more or less I mean it's it's
still subject to the the new rate you
have regular usuals ham radio
regulations there's probably also some
complication because you're enticing the
handset to transmit on frequencies that
are probably outside I think that's the
handsets fault and if it wants to
connect to my base station well then
that's just its fault
absolutely well so you're terminating
the calls are you are you I mean I'm
assuming the whole fun in this it's the
whole reason you would do a man of
middle attack is to do some sniffing but
the capabilities of the or at least the
USRP one doesn't have the bandwidth to
sniff everything you might need - am I
getting this wrong or you're sniffing on
the other end so if you're connected to
my base station then and I'm telling
your handset what frequencies to use and
what channel hopping algorithm to use so
I don't need to sniff anything on the
radio side you're connected to my
asterisk server and I can just put a
copy of Wireshark on Ethernet connection
and I can just sniff it all as it comes
out as
as a set conversation so what do you do
that we do to replay the call or what
have you you know practically what kind
of fun mischievous stuff have you gotten
into with that anything that anything
that asterisk is capable of you could
put in a sip proxy with some kind of
voice changer you could you know target
a specific individual and root all of
their calls to 91 one so you could you
know just like like a DNS poisoning
attack you could reroute their phone
calls so they think they're dialing one
is they think they're calling their mom
but you're actually you know sending
them off to somewhere else I mean at
this point you are that JM network they
think they're calling their bank but
really they're calling your phishing
scam absolutely you you can do anything
you own the network at this point Wow
that is incredible now can you since
you've authenticated them and you've got
these keys or at least half of it can
you is there any chance now that you can
reverse this and rather than being the
base station that's listening and
providing a gateway to the the voice
over IP network can you turn that around
and then connect to a legitimate
t-mobile base station and pretend hey
I'm now Darren's phone yes and no so the
assuming I can negotiate a 5-2 with you
I can I can recover the session key that
was used for for that particular
conversation that doesn't reveal the
secret key that's stored in your SIM
card which was used to generate that
session key so I don't necessarily know
your your secret key in your SIM card
which means that I can't necessarily
clone your sin on the flip side of that
though if I can connect to a legitimate
GSM network that doesn't require
ciphering that doesn't require me to
prove much that I know your secret key
then I can just play back your MZ which
is the kind of the GSM equivalent of
your username and if if I don't if I
don't ever get asked to establish
ciphering then I don't ever have to
prove that I know your secret key and
this and it effectively authenticates me
based on the GSM equivalent of your
username of just username no no password
effectively yeah do these towers exist
come on in the United States I mean
maybe in a third world nation where they
didn't set up security because whatever
but it's it's a good question actually
because I mean with with no way to
from from the handset whether you're
using a cipher connection or not it's
it's entirely conceivable that a
relatively innocent configuration
mistake on a base station or even on a
specific tower could result in a nun
cipher connection but on top of that
there's there's entire countries where
GSM encryption is illegal in India there
is no encryption whatsoever on GSM it's
it's illegal so is that due to the
export of the cryptography it's it's
just due to the the local laws on crypto
I'm not sure if it's export or import or
what it is it may even just be due to
supporting law enforcement intercept
capability but but yeah it's it's
entirely feasible that I could replay
your MZ and charge you lots of roaming
fees okay
or even maybe even forget physical
access to my phone for a bit could you
just go ahead and close my sim from
there it depends on what network
operator you're you're you're using the
the original hash function that was
implemented in SIM cards
it's called comp one to eight this was
broken about twelve years ago such that
if I can get your SIM card for about
eight hours I can recover the secret
Keillor stored in it now comp one to
eight obviously it was broken so it was
upgraded but despite being very publicly
broken there's a number of operators
that still use it so Tom point two eight
is is very broken and very much still in
use version 2 and version three have
come one to eight have never been
publicly disco like disclosed there are
no they're not an open not at all
they've never never been publicly crypt
analyzed them and we all know how well
proprietary crypto withstands the light
of day absolutely I mean for us yeah so
so there's a very good chance that that
version 2 and version 3 suffer from very
similar vulnerabilities to version 1 and
the moment that they get disclosed
they'll be broken in it on top of that
there's a lot of mobile network
operators that have lost faith in the
whole family of comp one to eight
functions so they just roll their own
hash functions yeah that's beautiful
exactly so again it's it's security
through obscurity that they're entirely
dependent on the
that you can't extract that hash
function from your SIM card this is the
new frontier of wireless hacking just
because of how you know like you're
saying how ancient it is and how you
know broken it is essentially with like
different proprietary protocols so how
do i I just want to go out tomorrow and
grab myself one of these from Ed asserts
the the USRP for you know fifteen
hundred bucks whatever you know throw
that on a laptop and how do I get going
with this though I really want to build
myself a little man in the middle GSM
pineapple what do I do
so the the easy way to do it is is with
the software that I released a schmuck
on yesterday it's called open boot TS
okay and it's a live CD that you boot
your machine off it with an Ethernet
connection plug in your US RP and you
are a base station it's got all of open
BTS it's got asterisks and I have to set
it so it has asterisk built in there and
everything you need literally all you
need to do is plug it into Ethernet tell
it off in an SS config to tell it where
your sit provider lives and run the base
station that's that's all you need to do
and where can I get this it's up on
SourceForge it's open boot TS it's it's
actually a set of scripts to produce the
live CD so you run the initial script
and it'll it'll deploy the environment
for building the CD and then you can
drop your asterisk configures your open
BTS configs all of it you can you can
drop everything that you like and
completely tailor it to your own
requirements and then master the image
to you know a bootable ISO bootable USB
key you can even master a pixie boot
image so you can you can have a machine
with with no I hope orts at all beyond
the Ethernet I love that booted over the
network plug it into the u.s. RP and
you've got a base station so where can
people find your other work we've we
published a lot of research we've been
doing a lot on GSM recently and before
that we were doing a lot of work on RFID
I actually own a consulting company
called Hardware held with with fours
instead of AIDS because we're obviously
lead yeah and yeah hardware comm Chris

so Jason Scott this year we're talking
about splendiferous old school what's
was today okay the name of the talk was
the splendiferous story of archive team
and the rapidly disappearing digital
heritage ok what's archive team ok
archive team was a group of rogue
archivists that I helped found rogue
archive is so we're not talking like
archive.org official you know
archive.org follows robots.txt that if a
place says we don't want to be
duplicated they don't go in there and so
as a result a lot of places that may
have limitations on what you can
download could go down
would just disappear a lot of people
think of our kind that org is like just
the internet for backup service the free
backup service and they're good and they
get a lot done we work with them but but
they have to kind of follow the rules
and there's a lot of stuff going on
right now where there's all these
corporate websites and like for instance
AOL hometown geo cities that have gone
down yeah and nobody they wouldn't give
the stuff anywhere because it's legally
I mean couldn't geo cities just back it
up to a zip disk and mail it to someone
I mean how much was it yesterday this is
two Meg's a website when we pulled
together do cities it was 2 terabytes
which is worth about $200 and discs
right yeah right you know let's let's be
careful it's do 400 and get 200 fees so
so yeah basically what happened there
was that it was legally easier to shut
the whole thing down drop it all off act
like it had never existed so we said
okay let's yeah let's back it up and
then start the conversation and maybe
did you guys get my old geo city's
website if your geocities website still
existed which is a big deal yeah I said
then we probably got it if it was in the
neighborhood we definitely got it okay
yeah it was an old-school one really
old-school yeah all the neighborhood's
we pulled down in about a week it was
easy to find the harder ones were the
weird you know whatever fairytales
underscore yeah yeah whatever you can't
find those as easily but we did our best
and took us about good we're using brute
forcing URLs or is it easy list or
something you were we were doing so well
we went to yahoo part of us went to
yahoo and that nice little business to
do a and said can we please get the
information and I said no we said could
you at least tell us how big it is and
they were like no we're like oh that's a
shame and so we basically did a
combination of Google searches and
Wikipedia searches and anything that
linked to Geocities we collected all of
those URLs and then we started to spider
out from those nice we had about 6
million we gave that to archive.org
because they didn't have an access it
turned out archive.org had stopped
backing it up some for some reason a few
years ago we got them to start up and
and then we all shared the data and it
turned out I was very pleased about this
there were two other projects who didn't
know about us who were doing it
excellent so there's replicates of do
city that is there's now Rio city's comm
geo cities WSU go there and instead of
Julie there it is that's thanks so
they're doing it and we're very pleased
and I have a site was it text files comm
slash under construction where I
collected one thousand under
construction gifs all those animated
gifs wreaking havoc avoid an
under-construction slash in Netscape now
and it's one thousand Netscape now
buttons with the end rotating and I'm
like that's a hit you know we lost that
that's the fact that there was a time
when you had to advocate your browser
cuz you were up against the monolith yes
the man thank you so much Jason thank
you once again they're reserving our
digital heritage thank you so I want to
tell you that Gamefly because if you

shmoop on is way more than just
technical talks and parties oh don't get
me wrong there's tons of parties but
there are also great activities going on
you can grab some swag from the vendors
and hug your favorite nerdcore rapper
mine just happens to be the lovely dual
core hone your lock-picking skills at
the tool lock-picking village compete in
a Team Fortress 2 land party or play
some video games at the hacker arcade
this year the 757 labs geeks put
together an entrapment
esque laser maze good times there was
even a new event this year at the shmoo
ball launcher competition where homebrew
launchers were pitted against each other
in there
speed badassness and accuracy of hitting
targets of which our own Darren kitchens
profile pic was one of and well let's
not forget the customary shmoop all
fights of course
simply put shmoocon is epic fun and we
hope to see you here next year
Tom you give a very interesting talk on
social media security and and what does
that really mean what how is security
different when it comes to social media
what is social media well social media
is any interactive web technology so
example Facebook Twitter MySpace the
social networks but also YouTube because
of the videos and the ability to share
those videos and the comment comments
you should never read right right cuz
they're all spam anyway right well that
I guess that comes down to it is they're
all they're all spam are they are they
even real people or they bots are they
fake accounts most of them are bots so
why is that is it just the ease of you
know the barrier to entry to creating a
web - Oh bot now or what a little bit of
that but you know we're you know hackers
are lazy we like to automate things so
you know let's automate this process as
much as we can and hopefully exploit as
many users as we can by literally
clicking a button writing a quick script
nice well you had a very interesting
stat there in your slides about Jessica
Biel
share that with me because I thought
that was just crazy yeah Jessica Biel
McAfee did a study last year where they
discovered that one in five Google
searches for Jessica Biel leads to
malware so okay so I had decided to
create a Jessica Biel Twitter accounts
to kind of reenact that because you know
most people trust celebrities so if you
say you're a celebrity on a social
network most likely they're going to
believe you but one of the things I did
was to make it more of a parody account
and not the real Jessica Biel because
you know I don't want to get in trouble
right
I changed the last letter of her her
last name from an L to an i oh if you
look at the font on that Twitter uses it
looks like an L right go to the fact it
was an i/o and I did that on LinkedIn I
did that on all their couples what do
you achieve when you do you know the
fake accounts or the the vulnerability
testing on these or they're really just
web applications so they
while victim to the same kinds of bugs
at any other web application whatwhat do
you achieve and what's the difference
there because it's a social network now
well the difference is that more people
are using them first of all and then
secondly you're giving information that
you may not even realize it's you these
social networks so Facebook for example
an application developer by default can
access all of your information that you
may not even be aware that you're giving
away yeah okay well what about the okay
so these applications you can use these
applications to exploit the user right
right so we took the example the harmony
guy did a month of Facebook bugs where
he found vulnerabilities in all kinds of
applications including farmville and
causes which are actually in the top six
list of most popular Facebook
applications they ended up we ended up
totaling that all the vulnerabilities we
found could have affected about over 200
million Facebook users Wow and there's a
lot of Facebook applications are you
saying that they're all inherently
insecure or what well it depends it
depends on the developer right if the
developer codes the application and
securely like any other web app and
leaves them open to cross-site scripting
or sequel injection and doesn't do the
proper validation checks then of course
the next thing you know so you could
come up with your own application ID in
with little little fun payloads right
that's like for like Kanye West if I the
application that Kevin Johnson did where
it'll actually take your facebook status
update and Kanye West if I it for you
where behalf what do you achieve on the
back end there you know as the hacker
well on the hacker side I'm going to
harvest all the information out of your
profile and I'm gonna store that in a
database and I could start correlating
that and I could start you know I could
take that information I could sell it I
could market it I could use it for
really whatever I want to stage another
attack against you or your friends or at
that point you can probably even I mean
if you've got you know their browsers
attention you could probably force them
to use like a framework like beef or
something to get Metasploit going on
right which is what I did with one
vulnerability I I found in a facebook
application it was a persistent
cross-site scripting vulnerability I
injected some beef code into that so
whenever somebody viewed that page of
that profile it would actually launch
beef and then it would launch Metasploit
Auto own
on that system so so what's broken here
is it the API is on like Facebook and
Twitter in myspace is it the is that the
user is it the the programming what whoa
what do we do
I would yeah I would say it's a
combination of all of those so so
Facebook inherently is going to allow as
much access as they can to their API
because why is that well that's our
business model is they want people to
interact with Facebook they want people
to share information because in the end
that's how they make money
and that's what it comes down to as
social networks have to make money
somehow and it's based off of the
information you share excellent okay
well as a user what do I do as a user
you need to educate yourself you need to
be aware that everything that you post
on social network is public information
even a Facebook or Twitter whoever says
it's private it's not going anywhere
somebody can get accessed that
information whether it be an application
developer whether there's a bug in the
app and it's exploited and it gets
released somewhere all of the
information is eventually public so
privacy is dead
well Zuckerberg says it's dead yeah and
many many before them as well yeah yeah
it's it's nearly dead but I think as a
user I think of these social networks
you can educate yourself and be aware of
things like privacy settings well you've
got a new project that talks all about
this can you tell me about your new site
sure sure social media security comm is
a open source community that I started
which brings in bloggers security
researchers and people together to start
talking about these security issues and
so on social networks and so some of the
things that we've done is we put
together videos walking you through for
example the new Facebook privacy
settings what the recommended settings
would be also some PDF guides that you
can print out and you can give out to
people at work your friends and family
and really just educate themselves on
where these settings are and how to
properly set them excellent well thank
you so much tom you're a real pleasure I
think I need to get over to Facebook and
start taking some pictures off so I
found all these guys walking around with
these I hacked charity shirts which
sounds a little
no I don't really want to attack a
charity but you're a part of this right
yes I've been a volunteer for extra
charity for a couple of years now and
people get the heebie-jeebies but what
we do is we try to take a tradition a
non-traditional approach hacking
charities we're trying to support
charities and try to get a community
security professionals that are trying
to just help out a lot of stuff so what
kind of stuff do you do for this charity
okay
personally what I do is I've been
mending a booth I've been doing
fundraisers to a couple of things that
I've been doing a apartment
apart from hackers for charity so it's
essentially a bunch of volunteers trying
to raise money to build classrooms in
Africa another thing we're doing is
we're trying to fund AIDS orphans like a
food food program where like five bucks
so feed a family in Uganda for a month
this pot bucks so that's another thing
we got to put we're trying to raise some
money for people to to eat or smoke on
week we have a booth we sell the
t-shirts detritus they try to promotes
awareness of the mission we have a
silent auction and I have to really
thank all the vendors and all the people
in the community from that club that
supports the effort because it gets
still wearing us up and we just try to
promote promote raise money through
donations and just get the word this up
about what the organization is all about
so is there anything new
this year compared to their like last
year as well we're in hackers for
charity in general well in general or
one of the things that that's going on
right now if you go to hackers for
charity org you can see that Johnny is
building an internet cafe and in Africa
and that's a big that's a big deal well
he's been he's been gone for a while
he's building classrooms over there he
has the internet cafe thing that he's
doing but what's cool about it is you
can go to hackers for charity and you
can check all out what's going on with
organization yep you can donate over the
Internet at hackers for charity org and
justice coder you can you can donate you
can actually participate in forums and
you can find out how you can actually
help without giving donations you can
help with your skills and that's one of
the main things we want to get hackers
that maybe didn't have jobs or something
people that are tech people to work on
projects to support nonprofits so they
can get like resume credentials and
stuff like that so it's to help that
packers and to help the needy
thank you so much
really happy that we have this kind of
things to help out all right thank you
very much
another shmoocon is over and despite the
snowpocalypse we all survived and we had
in awesome time I have to thank all the
fans for coming by and saying hello to
us and also thank you so much MOOC on
for having us we'll be back next week
for season seven of pack five stay tuned
for the most exciting season yet and
until then trust your tech no less I'm
gonna go crash and watch the Super Bowl
