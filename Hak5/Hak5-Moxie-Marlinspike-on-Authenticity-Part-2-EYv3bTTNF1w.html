by go to assist express if any of them
gets out it's it's it could have you
know been any domain right I mean every
every certificate authority has the
ability to issue a certificate for every
domain on the Internet so is that what
that protocol tries to address well the
I mean so you know in particular I feel
like the problem that we're looking at
right now is that you know web browsers
or users if you know for web browser
users if something like this happens
with comodo it couldn't have been worse
couldn't be more embarrassing it
couldn't have been you know more
disastrous and nothing happened to them
in why well it's because there's there's
no way to untrust them you know at some
point we made a decision to trust them
and now we're pretty much locked into
trusting them forever because if we
remove them from the the web browsers
than just a quarter of the internet
breaks they certify somewhere between a
quarter and a fifth of the secure sites
on the internet I've used them for
certificates yeah but it's cheap yeah
fast and you know and so those sites
will no longer work and basically the
you know if a web browser does that
they're gonna be breaking a quarter the
internet for all of their users so they
can't really do that and so you know
basically i feel like the problems that
we look at today are because we have
this missing property that i call trust
agility as the ability to remove trust
exactly make you know at any moment make
a decision about who you trust in who
you don't trust me and then what then
the burden is just on the purchaser of
that certificate to say wait white we
purchased a certificate from this
authority they gave a certificate to
some black hat so now we can't trust
them like i have to move somewhere else
is it does it not just push the problem
on to you know say amazon.com buys their
certificate from Komodo Komodo get tax
now they have to go through another
registrar well so I've really some
software called convergence and
convergence is a system for you know
that provides trust agility and it
basically inverts the trust relationship
where right now the trust relationship
is initiated by a site amazon says i
would like a certificate or facebook
says i would like a certificate and what
we're doing is inverting it so instead
of the site talking to the authority the
user or the client initiates the
relationship of the authority and says
hello authority would you please
certified
site for me right now and it happens you
know and the powerful thing about that
like DNS exactly and the powerful thing
about that is that this means that it's
the client who can choose what authority
they would like to talk to so you know
if so you wouldn't have just an implicit
yes it's trusted no it's not you would
get some sort of it would be like a
barometer of trust well you you get an
implicit yes or no response from we call
them notaries these notaries that you
talk to these authorities but it's you
know you can decide who you trust right
you know maybe then if the notary is
lying but you know I can identify a set
of organizations that I trust today to
make these kind of decisions and they're
not companies like Farah scienter Komodo
you know it probably looks pretty
different but what I don't want is to
identify a set of organizations that I'm
going to trust forever because I that
seems insane to me to think that you
know we can pick some organizations
we're gonna trust forever without any
incentives to continue warranting our
dress which is how it works right now
komodo knows that they can do whatever
they want and that you know there's
really nothing that we can do so what
are the hurdles that we face to moving
towards some sort of architecture like
that well okay so I've released some
software called convergence it's a
firefox add-on and it also has a server
component so now at this point anybody
can run their own trust notary and if
you know if there are people that trust
you they can use that to certify the
communication along with any other
number of notaries for themselves and
you know at this point I'm releasing
this as an add-on and hopefully this
technology will get baked into the web
browsers themselves so is this open
source it's open source and they don't
release like the server part of it or is
it just like that release the add-on
part of it and the server part of it so
anybody can run their own notary and
anybody can run convergence on the
client side ok so then anybody can
decide who's trustworthy and who's not
but it's who subscribes to them exactly
so then if somebody you know says that
somebody's trustworthy that they aren't
then it's only just a matter of time
before you know you can see people just
kind of switch over to this but that
that's a lot of burden on users too well
I'm sure that this would require a lot
of Education well you can also think
about it just pushing that down into the
client right the browser's could be
making those decisions right you get a
web browser and you comes with same
defaults and if somebody does something
egregious the web browser just removes
them
from the default settings which is kind
of how it works now with the web
browsers choose certificate authorities
the problem is that now once the web
browser puts a certificate authority in
fig is good take it actually Mozilla had
talked about this when the Komodo
Hackett went down they're like yeah
these are bogus we then they
contemplating actually just removing the
keys out of order did they at some point
remove the specifically those keys from
the virus the specific specific service
not by CIA exactly and this is because
certificate revocation does not work on
the internet you know and that actually
I published this in 2009 I gave a talk
about defeating ocsp which is the
certificate revocation protocol and
nobody ever fixed it and so now they
were in this problem you know they had
this problem where they couldn't use the
relocation mechanism since they had
actually explicitly bacon revoked certs
into the binaries and then distribute
only web browsers we've seen a lot of
this you know changes and you know
massive protocol changes the move to ip6
DNS SEC in a lot of the the older
protocols getting replaced this sounds
like a great idea what what though say
we are all IP 6 dns sack with this
what's the ssl strip equivalent to that
how would you now okay now that you've
you know devised this how would you get
around that I mean right well I mean
they're probably a number of attacks
lurking and I've tried to think about it
very carefully and you know develop
things so that you know it's as secure
as possible one thing that I would point
out though is that you when you look at
things like ipv6 and a DNS SEC right
those are a little bit different from
convergence in that they require you to
really migrate the Internet yeah
everybody get off the internet you know
adult swim every other pool yeah which
is what the thing about convergence is
that servers don't have to do anything
differently like if you have an SSL site
you don't do anything differently but it
all happens on the client side right so
i can right now just go and see like an
i can ping hak5 Gorgons see what
different people are saying about the
trust of my sight sure you're supposed
to like mcafee or whatever which Flags
us as terrorists cuz you know we are
uh-huh obviously yeah so yeah exactly
and so you know really what this means
is that if you make this change in the
four major web browsers you're done you
know that this the certificate authority
system okay so you've released it for
or for Firefox okay and I'm sure we'll
see the community getting on that and
we'll see the chrome extensions and that
little opera and all that where can
people get in on this from the website
convergence I Oh awesome thank you so
much marks do you think lazy to speak to
you thank you all right we're gonna have
continued coverage of Def Con 19 and
just a bit but first we're gonna take a
quick break there are two things IT
professionals and their clients have in
common that they want the job done right
and they want it done fast and that's
