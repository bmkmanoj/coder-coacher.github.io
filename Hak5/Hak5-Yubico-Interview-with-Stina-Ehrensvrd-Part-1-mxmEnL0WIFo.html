authentication enough no of course it
isn't that's why the CEO and founder of
you bucko is here to talk about the
future of authentication + linux
terminal tips USB Ethernet adapters and
more all that this time on hak5 the
segment of fact I've is brought to you
by go to assist express hello welcome to
hack five my name is Darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse of course you with the
dose of technol us hello Gooden tog big
is the slowest men how's it going hey
guess what we got a gift from a fan yeah
yes we do all right let's kick it off
this is from Travis Thank You Travis 548
mark Streit number 39 3712 francisc I
don't know if there's a note with that
yet is there a note I don't know let's
play doubt it this is smart com who haze
you know what guys it looks like it's
never been opened who didn't love typing
a TD T or a TA or atl 0 atl 0 was really
good because then you wouldn't wake your
parents up when you were dialing up a
BBS oh my gosh why always got in trouble
for that when I was like well for
something yeah did you ever do something
time you put the pillow over the game
yes you did that too oh yeah all the
malice of you did that too because I
think we've all been there until you
learn dude it heals your I never knew
that you know I wasn't like huge geek at
the time I was always into like you know
HTTP HTML building my own websites but I
didn't know anything about a family or
anything like that yeah few cities below
well thank you so much for the haze
goodies check this out we got smarts com
for Windows now I actually think we
could probably put together we did this
awhile ago we did a kind of a retro
April first episode you guys haven't
seen you need to go back here hak5 that
was fun we could probably I mean we're
in the midst of doing some BBS related
stuff and I think maybe actually being
really authentic and running it off of
the windows well
windows blue box I don't know how we
would network it to telnet hack well
anyway I'm just saying if you're really
cool to do it like super authentic
except with modern Hitler cuz come on
why not Thank You Travis uh speaking of
modern harder well I'll save that to the
to the end of the show we got some
questions for you guys as well as some
answers to your question about some some
interesting fun hardware stuff I wanted
to also say we got a lot of great
response from the USB rubber ducky
segment a lot of questions if you guys
haven't seen it go check out USB rubber
ducky calm because that is your resource
for all of the development all where you
can get the open source software and
firmware Zand the encoder downloads and
all eight loads we have real
documentation yeah a lot of duck what
yeah yeah there's lots of good stuff
coming out of this project i'm super
happy with it and so many questions that
you know we've been answering on the
forms and whatnot and i also wanted to
point out there the number one question
is not door okay so the one year's
nearest my heart kind of easiest is
what's up with the the actual rubber
duckies in the things and you'll notice
this rubber ducky is way cooler because
he's got some cool guy rubber ducky
glasses and this guy he's cool too he
doesn't know there is probably about a
woman what would you say like a one in
ten chance of ending up with some some
sunglasses on your rubber ducky just
wanted to point that out for some people
are alike you know how come there are
some that road to have sunglasses and
some that don't i'm shanley someone cool
uh huh well there were the ones who had
kind of people yeah and if you were in
an item he knew about the things that
we're my god so anyway I kind of wanted
to just go ahead and answer that we've
got some great stuff this week stina is
here the the founder and CEO of yumiko
to talk to us about you baqi and some of
their other hardware stuff and and
really just an interesting conversation
about the future of authentication I
think you guys are really going to find
this fascinating we're of course at
Derby con right now so expect next week
us to be back with a whole bunch of good
stuff from
all of the you know wonderful speakers
at that conference is going to be huge
oh hey guess what yeah I'm on scam
school this week oh nice can we check
out scam school because Brian brushwood
and he's there and he's all like you
know what though Brian brushwood why you
trying to knock off our our our kit and
backpack haircut hahaha no I told Brian
that he has to have me on a show and if
he didn't I was gonna throw myself in
front of a parked car and he was like we
can't have that so he was like all right
come on bring it down now I know I was
like no I want to is that he he
basically I basically like threatened
him into letting me on the show much
work yep the word okay cool so anyway
all that more but we will see you on the
other side you guys know I've been
fascinated with human interface devices
shannon has been all about the
two-factor authentication open ID we're
here to put it all together stina you
because it is so great to have you
gotten studio I'm really excited about
the key I know that a lot of people have
been emailing us about the key but you
should probably give us like a back of
the book for those that aren't familiar
okay so this is a you Becky it's also a
keyboard with one button the president
he put in your computer in the USB port
and you press the button and it sends
your identity and a one-time passcode
through the keyboard interface in that
way it doesn't require any client
software it works in all computer or
platforms or browsers and and the code
your identity is sent to a server that
we provide as open source and verifies
your key and you're logged in really
securely I mean it's it's it's at a
level of a smart card or other hard well
how does this token how does this
differentiate from some of the other
products out there where they're like
the physical Hardware tokens where you
get a number from them the idea of
having more than just just a password
that you know in your head but also you
know it's something you have something
generated something random and unique
that's going to change how does this
differ I'm in the difference a way that
is automatic you plug it in your press
the button that you don't have to we
have blind people using it with it most
of the tokens available today there
these are six or eight digits that you
have to retype and they have batteries
which fail and they're a little clunky
this is really small yeah i gotta say
the design is quite nice because there's
not actually a USB standard type a plug
or something it's kind of all built into
the design all molded it's beautiful
it's two and a half gram and it's all
solid waterproof and and and it fits
really nice on a keychain so the form
factor is nice the simplicity and the
overall simplistic just pressing the
button is there instead of having to
what it doesn't just type your password
because it's not for my password so long
and complex I don't want to remember it
I'm going to put it on the Yubikey it's
for having multiple factors of
authentication and also verification of
your identity so yeah tell me about bit
about how that works so it sends out an
identity a 12-digit identity that's
always the same and then a 32 one-time
passcode that changes every time you
press the button oh it's so it changes
every time you press the button not like
is there a clock inside of it nobody
uses the clock when you put it into the
computer I there's no clock in there so
it's a time base no I'm an event-based
but there is actually a clock in the
computer that you can use so with a time
variant cold you can press the button
you can perform a transaction you can
press again and there that you can you
know make sure the time between the two
presses okay so get higher level
security so I mean aside from you know
doing like a static password you get the
the two factor of authentication there
what kind of other like do challenging
response Oh auth what what kind of
authentication are we talking here I
mean we launched this three years ago
and we put out the code is open source
and we built that viral open source
community around it who came up with
will great feedback the first feedback
was we wanted to use to be used with a
static password to work with truecrypt
and we were a little hesitant because
static password is what we're trying to
educate people to not use but with a
long password you're better off with
them a short easy one so we've actually
enabled the Yubikey
configure it to be used as a static
password generator up to 64 charters and
then the the community came back and
said we also wanted to work with oath
which is an open authentication standard
that verisign has been driving and we
were also hesitant because it is not as
good because it's only limited to six or
eight digits oh really and it doesn't
identify the users yes so it's actually
less security but you know we are very
open to our community so when eventually
too many people had asked for it we at
least we said okay now you be key works
you can reconfigure it to work with us
and then open idea of course which is
supported on a lot of different websites
for you to be able to login with you
know one set of credentials right yes I
mean the Yubikey is now supported by
hundreds of open-source platforms around
the world and open at ease one sam'l it
works with sam'l which is another open
identity standard enable one key all
kind of you know all kind of websites
now as far as like the consumer is
concerned so you like you know if you've
been in an enterprise and you're
familiar with having to have like a fob
or a token that gives you a random
number to log into you know you're
ridiculously complex VPN setup and
whatnot if you're just looking to do you
know lick on the consumer side of things
what were the consumer use to use this
for like web services that they sign
into the most common used consumer
application today is password managers
and there are a convention three there
are more coming one is LastPass another
one is past pack and there is an open
source version called save password safe
okay and we talked about last pass on
the show before and we're he proposed of
having different passwords for every
website and that's one of the things
that those services make easy yeah so if
you want to use your consumer you want
to use the D LastPass you can go to web
LastPass a website and you
can click on a special link they have
their you can come to our store you can
buy Yubikey that works with their
software or you can you know you can buy
it's sort of integrated they are
supporting our hosted service so any
Yubikey you buy from us will actually
work with LastPass so tell me about your
hosting service because you had a pilot
server and then that changed what give
me the story because it's so great yeah
only we put up a pal a service just when
we launched just facilitate for our
customers to start testing our open
source server before they had to
download and you know this it is more
work to actually integrate a full server
and then we said very clearly this is a
pilot survey don't use it for production
don't use it for protection and then you
work this we realize because we had one
server it went down yes and hundreds of
customers came back to say hey we can't
login to our work we're using your
server and we say okay we have to
duplicate it so we put Mouse five
servers in different locations but I
didn't feel good about this because the
Yubikey is dependent the security of the
UK's dependent on one another thing the
encryption keys that goes to the server
has to be secured or will you know what
recently happened with RSA there was a
server that was breached and millions of
tokens were compromised so I had really
universe no matter how secure the
mechanism is very well when I felt you
know we have these five servers out
there and and someone can hacking we try
to do all kind of measures we knew that
the only the only really good measure
was to buy hardware security models but
they're 15,000 or 20,000 dollars each
yes with recurring fees well and and
then I asked my technical team which is
they're very smart people and I said we
just need to secure the encryption keys
we don't need to secure the whole server
couldn't we make something some easier
and and what came up was our second
product it's okay little dongle you can
plug into any server to just encrypted
secrets so this helps you create the
encryption keys and keeps them secure
yeah I mean it
moves out the encryption keys from the
server so someone had tried to hack into
the server you know the encryptions keys
are no longer there so that's any we
sell it for five hundred dollars instead
of 15,000 so it's a you know wigs which
compliments what what is this one called
it's cool that you be HSM HSM is a it's
the industry word for hardware security
model okay and you and your HSM is on a
USB key yeah so we had this is actually
our own products we were to hardware and
the rest is open source and we have this
free hosted validation I love open
source and I love the idea that you know
this is you know something where
consumers can get and and you know login
with confidence knowing that they're
there using unique passwords when they
couple it with services like you said
the last pass in the password safe and
and then the open source idea that you
can roll your own and then they were
working with a open ID and oh aw that's
so great in just a bit here I want to
find out about the enterprise stuff
we're going to take a quick break when
we get back more with stina and finding
out about how you can secure your
enterprise there are two things IT
professionals and their clients have in
common they want the job done right and
they want it done fast and that's why I
highly recommend go to assist expressed
