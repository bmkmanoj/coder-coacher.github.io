program against internet encryption so
did we lose the crypto Wars is PGP
secure what can you trust that more this
segment of hack five this segment of
hack five is brought to you by po do
bull run it's the NSA program that
everybody has been talking about I was
just recently on tekzilla talking about
this personally I love the NSA they have
the shiniest shoes on tech news today I
agree with sniper to quoting directly
says the US has proved to be an
unethical steward of the Internet UK's
know better we're going to be doing a
episode of threat wire about this and
I'm not here to tell you a bunch of fear
uncertainty a doubt about you know
speculations of whether the NSA has you
know modified encryption programs to
make them more exploitable or work in
you know backdoors with industry
partners or otherwise you know do
nefarious things with standards bodies
interesting stuff about random number
generators from Intel named bull
mountain sounds kind of familiar anyway
we're not gonna do that speculating what
we're all rather gonna do is focus on
properly implementing strong crypto
because that was the takeaway the
important takeaway here is that into
quote Edward Snowden directly encryption
works properly implemented strong crypto
systems are one of the few things that
you can rely on
unfortunately endpoint security is so
terrifically weak the NSA can frequently
find ways around it
now that's the thing is why bother
spending millions of dollars in
supercomputers they're trying to bright
and bright a break Braca to break a
private key when you can simply bypass
it you guys know how I feel about
encryption it's like encrypt all the
things you should be doing it whether
it's your cat photos or your plans for
world domination I wish this whole world
that we all use PGP for everything and
everybody should be using it it's it's
not necessarily usually convenient but
then again security and convenience have
been odds with each other for forever so
with that said let's take a look back at
some of the stuff that we've talked
about previously about
PGP and encryption of course we're
talking about email encryption here
pretty good privacy way back in the
early 90s the original crypto Wars and
we won and were allowed to use this
really cool technology that really does
a damn good job of keeping our emails
safe and properly implemented now back
in the 90s the scene was totally
different okay we used a pine an element
Eudora and Pegasus and outlook
I guess people still use outlook but the
norm was that you would have an email
client and even through a protocol like
pop3 or IMAP or whatever have you it
would pull your email down from the
server and it would live on your machine
and when you properly implement cool
stuff like you know PGP with I don't
know an IgG mail and Thunderbird stuff
is really cool but that's not the world
that most of us live in now see because
we're in such a culture of convenience
webmail has taken over and for that
reason obviously it's great for folks
like the NSA that that want to target
the big four either Facebook Yahoo
Google is the other one
Oh outlook calm slow uh hotmail
Microsoft they even built a back door
right in for the NSA aren't those guys
so sweet anyway so you can imagine why
you know it's such a great thing for
those kinds of people that we all just
go ahead and rely on the cloud which is
okay you know ultimately all of this
discussion is about trust and so you
know that's why we're going to kind of
dive into where is the trust so in a
segment on season 14 episode 10 Shannon
and I talked about may elope because it
integrates with these solutions and to
be honest it is the easiest solution for
me to recommend for people to get
started with the whole concept of public
private key encryption to get started
with PGP because it is at least as
convenient as I've ever seen it and mind
you convenience and security right so
you know I've been using it for a while
it integrates really well it does have a
couple of problems I will say you know
and I'm sure since the beautiful thing
is it's open source it's built on open
standards like open PGP using awesome
like you know JavaScript implementations
it's really only a matter of time before
some of these caveats get solved some of
which are the inability to do signing of
messages which would be really cool in
fact we're gonna get into message
signing here real soon
it also doesn't support revocation
certificates so say you're you were to
lose your laptop with your private key
you can't trust it anymore
but you had already put it up on a key
server I think we talked about using the
MIT key server with big fans of that you
don't have a good way to generate a
revocation certificate so that you can
pull that down and as moob exploited out
on this very show millville open doesn't
take advantage of all of the
opportunities for encryption and for
security that it really could and that's
the thing about the game of you know
encryption the game of like hey let's
actually maintain our privacy through
technology and that is use everything at
your disposal
well mam does a really good job of
bringing this kind of stuff to the
masses it doesn't take advantage of as
mu exploited out the ability of the
browser of the chromic
and actually use a an encrypted storage
volume rather it keeps your private key
in plain text in a sequel database which
many would say is the same as every
other program under the Sun but that's
no reason not to implement you know
everything in your disposal not Thomas
Oh on YouTube actually made a really
intelligent comment to this effect he
says this shows a local attack what is
not shown in the episode is that the
same attack would also be possible with
other PGP implementations take GPG if
you have local access you can simply do
a GPG tactic export tax secret tech key
tech a and get the private key in
clear-text this is a good encouragement
to further improve my level up but it
would have been fair to see the ex play
in a wider perspective if your machine
gets owned there's no encryption that
can help you anyway and that's really
important because it's really about
talking about where our trust is right
if your machine gets owned nothing's
gonna save you right and you yes do
still need the passphrase to use that
private key however it's not to say that
we don't need to immediately revoke it
because we've been owned if we even knew
that we got owned the example here is to
show that hey you know even you know
even though the attacker may have
compromised the machine and pulled off
the the plaintext private key he still
does need to crack it and so your first
thought would be like oh great let's
fire up a copy of John the Ripper and
try an offline brute-force attack on the
passphrase which kind of leads into a
rattled discussion about why really good
pass phrases are important but rather I
should even mention that you know the
thing about this isn't the thing that
Snowden was saying about endpoint
security is it doesn't matter how secure
that passphrase is if we've already
owned the machine well then why are we
trying to crack a key when we could just
implement keystroke recording you're
going to type the password in at some
point and at that point we've got it so
that's why this is really you know not
just the but there's no solution I can't
just say you should trust this it works
right because it's really about deciding
where your trust is and there's measures
that we can take and actually that the
NSA
themselves to make this better bode 972
also pointed out you know no big deal if
someone has access to your computer you
have a bigger problem
oh absolutely he says use whole disk
encryption
well absolutely that's a great point you
should use full disk encryption but
again it won't save you in this scenario
because you know as soon as the attacker
implements a keystroke recorder they've
got the passphrase when you type it in
and Bob's your uncle so let's take a few
steps back okay
PGP is really good at a lot of things
okay first of all it implements awesome
crypto algorithms that are publicly
known that's not the private thing the
probably the thing is your private key
you know you can give your public key
out to everyone you can use you know
whatever cipher you choose what makes it
secure is that the private secure is
private key is kept secure you know with
your passphrase with that symmetric
encryption and the pass in as long as
you're using a good passphrase it should
be good but again why break those keys
when you can steal the keystrokes you
know do you trust every single aspect of
your machine you know as this discussion
gets into the mainstream with things
like bull run and you know people talk
about the fact that well yeah actually
the Microsoft has worked directly with
the NSA in both operating systems and
outlook.com the the mail provider to
provide unencrypted copies of messages
woohoo and and things of that nature you
you have to ask yourself well what do
you trust and this is not me saying okay
everyone must compile gen 2 from source
and line by line go through every line
of code and you know and vet you know
install you know GPG from source and all
of those things right there there has to
be you know like convenience it's
literally at odds with security in this
case but consider this
the NSA actually operates on the
assumption that is it has in fact been
compromised and then it works from there
so yeah you know mind you it takes a lot
of effort to maintain privacy and I'm
not telling you that this method we're
about to talk about is the
you should trust in fact I'm not telling
you I mean honestly Trust is something
that you need to decide nobody can tell
you to trust it you have to figure that
out for yourself
but we're going to talk about one method
but I believe could add a lot of
security to any PGP implementation and
we're going to get into that real soon
here on this brand-new machine as soon
as we get back I'm so stoked I'm getting
ready to head over to Minneapolis and
the next round of hack across America
and I'm doing some upgrades on the van
actually to be honest some of the things
kind of fell apart
I wouldn't say fell apart but I'm not so
happy with this thing so this is
actually the thing that goes on the roof
and this would be a perfect opportunity
just got the replacement in to show you
the thing that I'm using to keep track
of my entire hack across America project
because you guys know that the fine
folks over at Citrix hooked me up with
all the tools I knew would need
including Poe do check this out so I
built an app here in Podio that I used
to maintain all of the different parts
that I purchased when I did the price I
got um the vendor that I got in front
from so I can go in here and actually
see like everything that it took to make
the van in its current state and do a
little searching searching action here
on the vent and find out there's my
fantastic vent and I can go ahead and
you know find myself a nifty little
replacement over here or whatever else
it is I may need this is the coolest
stuff I haven't just been using it even
for hack across America because so many
workspaces in here we're using it for
development on the Wi-Fi pineapple for
the hack shop for so many different
things it's really amazing collaboration
stuff I wish that we had this years ago
because I remember as a Systems
Administrator being
asked by one of her you know I one of
her higher-ups to like put together
basically an internal corporate intranet
style like social network and this this
uses a lot of context that people are
already used to using with like you know
the feeds and stuff like that so I just
thought that this would be the greatest
opportunity to show you how I'm using it
I'm so stoked that I have everything
here in a database all the people that
have signed up on hack across America so
I can plot them on a map and sort them
and things like that and figure out
where we're going next and yeah so if
you're looking for some project
management software you know software
that you can bring into your
organization all cloud-hosted and stuff
like that where you know you can just
create apps like on the fly like I just
built this one no problem this is the
coolest stuff you should check it out at
Podio dot-com and of course thank you
guys for sponsoring act Across America
this week's tech molest photo the week
comes from the silver moonshine which
sounds kind of delicious or maybe not
had probably the big bang yeah in
regards to I caught this on the forums
and I had to send this by cuz I think
this is fantastic and I have so much
sympathy because I've been there man he
says maybe huge error I was trying to
hook up a battery pack to my pineapple
so I went out got a 12 volt lead acid
and then he made the mistake he thinks
he switched the positive and the
negative and this right here that my
friend is what it looks like when you
let out the magic smoke so the original
button yes right there teeny tiny this
is actually careful this is the very
first pineapple dev board I'm being
careful serial number one so this is the
very first little button yeah well look
just be careful when you take out the
big lead acid guys that the red is the
positive like is the negative and we
want it to be Center positive so sorry
about that dude we actually sound silver
moonshine another board so yes so silver
if you're selling forum's let us know if
you were able to if you were bold enough
to unsolder the voltage regulator and
all the other parts that let out their
lab magic smoke and solder on new ones
we just switched over to the new board
but it's white uppie listen you can send
your photos over to feedback at hack 5
org make sure to include technolo in the
subject line
maybe little free cheers on the show
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
