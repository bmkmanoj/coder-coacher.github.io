by audible Darren yeah I want to watch
coupling on the BBC in England right now
we're considering this stop playing
coupling back in the name okay well I
want to watch Doctor Who we're a good
show like Top Gear actually doctor he's
pretty good too oh yeah do just that
because if we go over to n degree
Brittany will do that will get you into
the British Isles our uh we're going to
do a little VPN tunneling f we've done
at the top of the show we set up
backtrack 5 with a little bit of network
manager here and now we can just go
ahead and configure our VPN because
right now as it stands if I go ahead and
look at my website I'm like I'm at the
BBC iplayer no Zoe's not available in
your area honestly yeah that's no fun
losers yeah because if I do something
like links tech dump and then i say i
don't know www-what is my IP com and i'm
just going to grep your IP address is
because i don't want a whole bunch of
crap and it's gonna say hey there's my
IP address ah well that's not that's not
the IP address i want because you know
one being great britain right so for
that we've been playing with this
service that Jen recommended called we
topia and it's pretty inexpensive
they're not a sponsor anything but I'm
like having fun with it like 40 bucks a
year so why not right it's not bad and
they've got all these us servers they
have they haven't but everywhere from
Atlanta Georgia I don't know why anybody
want to go Georgia but you know they've
got us minor jarek i'm saying that
because jason op alums man look you
gotta be Sarah San Francisco pretty cool
place but they also have them in toronto
and vancouver and in buenos aires and in
you know you're up they have mall over
brussels and dublin and london and men
dude Manchester's pretty cool then but
then again so is chef field so i'm just
gonna throw that out there anyway so
what we're going to do is we are going
to tunnel to London and then check our
IP address and we'll be able to play the
BBC iplayer okay okay so I've already
set up an account there and I'm not
going to walk you through that but this
is really the same process that it would
be for any pptp VPN here now that we
have network manager installed it's real
simple all we do is come over to our
little icon over here for the network
man
we go to VPN connections and configure
VPN we want to click Add here over the
VPN tab and by default is already set to
pee-pee teepee or the point point
telling protocol we're going to go ahead
and click create and it's going to ask
us for our gateway and in this case it's
going to be pptp LOM we topia net but
this will be whatever it is for you okay
and my username hak5 Deron and my super
secret password alright and then I'm
going to go into advanced hear what I
want to do is make sure I check use
point to point encryption and hit OK and
then I'm just going to go ahead and
apply that I'm going to name it
something good I'm going to name it
london pride because that's really cool
beer people mmm yeah really good anyway
ok so now all we have to do to go over
to the bridge Giles has come over here
to our little icon go to VPN connections
and choose london pride it's going to
swirl around for just a minute and as
soon as it's done connecting and we
could like grep the log if we really
wanted to or tail it and now when i run
this command again to see my IP address
ah there we go I've got a completely
deprived p address so now when i refresh
the page over at the BBC iplayer you're
gonna be able to play stuff yeah that's
the idea oh gosh give it just money I
mean it's going through a VPN so it's
gonna be slightly slower so I may take a
little bit more time to buffer but dude
the overhead is something as I read it I
had a misery so yeah five Dale and I
think there we go and now we're watching
BBC 10 and so cool let's watch dr. Lu
busy too Orwell this right now is a live
one there will also be a pop-up that
says hey you know you can't you know you
have to click here to agree and say yes
I do have a TV licence which of course I
have a TV licence in Britain to be doing
this or else I wouldn't be able to tell
you this so make sure you do have that
before you start watching BBC one two
three or four
well so they have Parliament and news
exciting so anyways there's your answer
and I hope that helps you guys that are
on the next side and you know setting up
a pptp connection and windows super
simple so I'm gonna go to Canada without
going to Canada and watch all just all
the delicious Canada shows like pure
ownage which is on Canada television

awesome show yes okay we'll stay tuned
