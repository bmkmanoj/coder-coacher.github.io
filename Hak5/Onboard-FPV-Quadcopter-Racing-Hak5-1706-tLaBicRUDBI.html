by domain.com this place is a mess I
don't know if we're gonna do a regular
episode I was figuring why don't we just
take this opportunity as we're in the
transition to the warehouse to go have a
little fun oh yeah and the little guy
let Sarah happy how shopping did one of
the things that I love about these
there's just like loops and stuff
everywhere they call it the molle system
and I'm constantly carabiner cara cara
boner Encana kara I'm Kara boning things
to other things I gotta say Paul just
can't wait to get into the warehouse
we've needed this space for so long
although things don't go so well I may
be building mini quads just so that I
can fly in the warehouse this is one of
the turns in the course that I set up
this morning just thinking where we
where can we yeah this is nice and shady
enough yeah just make sure to go around
us this isn't a chair since I'm going to
want to tune the other one out here in
the industrial wilderness of Point
Richmond I at first was kind of not
impressed with this frame I was like
really eager because this is a Bay Area
hell a nemesis and like the whole
selling factor on is that it supports
5-inch and 6-inch props and can fold up
and I like the idea of just being able
to like grab a bag and go and have
everything super compact but in the
six-inch configuration it doesn't really
fold up so well and I've had to make
some modifications to the rigidity
section in whatever is so the thing is
though I've got it tuned it's flying
great right now so this is my happy
place this is what I do when I'm not
doing the hak5 thing and it keeps me
sane and I figure for that reason it's
it's worth the effort take some time out
this one is just kind of threw together
in fact it's just running whatever spare
parts i had lying around I've got a naza
and here with a merging RC six hundred
mellow wat video transmitter transmits
analog video at what is it 600
milliwatts on 528 gigahertz I got these
little 12am pscs oh
sorry there 20 amp es sees these afros
with the Simon k from where they're like
the really mini guys I like them and
otherwise I'm just running a spectrum
system and I'll be recording with a
Mobius there is this theory of the
Mobius where time becomes a loop that's
my michael dorn to the one there
you know what's fun about this is it
kind of leads into a lot of other areas
of math and science so through the need
to have better reception in my fpv or
first person view quadcopter flight
experience I've learned a lot about you
know the radio horizon or what afrin
elzo niz and you know of course these
are things that we cover in the hak5 as
they relate to Wi-Fi but it's all the
same stuff oh and right now I am a bird
there's nothing in this world they could
tell me otherwise I don't do drugs
despite living in the San Francisco Bay
Area so for me this is kind of this is
my jam this is my out-of-body experience
which is actually the weirdest thing
because when you come up on yourself
flying the quad that is and you're
looking through the goggles all of your
sensory like it doesn't take much if
anybody's flown around or flown around
played with the oculus rift would agree
it doesn't take much to hack the human
brain into believing and so if you see
it oh yeah you're gonna believe it and
that just becomes your new reality and
so one of the weirdest things when i
first started flying if TV was that i
would come up on myself and I would see
myself and I'm not you know I'm used to
seeing myself in a mirror but this
wasn't like a mirror like I would see
myself from behind and it's a totally
eerie experience and kind of awesome in
fact just recently it was out at the
park and it's having a really great
flight and it had been like 10 or 15
minutes of just you know cruising around
along the bay and they had come up over
the bay onto the land and I caught a
glimpse of my shadow and of course it's
the shadow of the quadcopter and for
some reason it took me off guard because
I'm I don't know why I wasn't expecting
to see you know the quadcopter or what I
was expecting to see like my own figure
like me like whoa I'm a bird but yeah it
totally freaks me out it's kind of great
that way yeah it's like I don't know
what it is it's not a video game
although i will say that having
you know played first-person shooters
and things of that nature like if you
ever played descent as a kid this will
just be completely natural this little
subset of the hobby has really become
popular in the last year they're calling
it the 250 class it's really from like
200 to 300 millimeter that is rotor to
rotor kind of dimensions there so you're
really limited to five and six inch
props but yeah this little subset of the
hoppy has really taken off the idea is
you get a really nimble very versatile
you know quad that's super tiny they
kind of like hugs the ground and zips
around trees and such and there's even
people building entire like you know
race tracks or whatever in in the woods
with different trails and stuff it looks
like a lot of fun and I've been having
fun with it with these two guys there's
something about this that reminds me of
the good old days of building computers
oh yeah I've crashed this guy a few
times you took a little bit to figure
out exactly how he wants to fly a little
quirks and that's that's what I love
about it I mean like I said it's like
building a computer you know every
computer has its little quirk and you
just got to figure out what it is the
reason I'm out here doing this Paul is
actually because this part of the hobby
is kind of a danger right now I'm not
even sure if it's going to be able to
last or at least not in the United
States the FAA updated a policy saying
that restating the way that what a model
aircraft is and I guess you should
probably understand that previous to
this update of this policy the FAA has
never actually been any way in any way
involved in model aircraft because well
it's just not there not there bag you
know they're really about civil and
commercial aviation you know things with
people on it but as the world changes if
is now vying for unmanned aircraft
regulations and while no official
regulation has passed you know something
that would actually require people to
vote
and you know pass it into law they have
Ghana had an updated a policy statement
that defines what a model aircraft is
and the most notable change for me at
least is that it says that a model
aircraft is one which is flown with
visual line of sight that is to say I
must have the aircraft in my sights at
all times and the goggles being over my
eyes obviously prevent that you know one
could imagine that with a video tracking
system and picture and picture you could
kind of do a technical work around but
they actually mean with the naked eye no
binoculars nothing like that so it kind
of just destroys a multi-million dollar
industry that is fpv flying in fact as
it's just beginning to take off as it
were and so it's a really a damn shame
because you know while this is up for
people to comment on it's the comment
period is about to be over in fact by
the time you're watching this it's only
day or two left so I'm hoping that
everybody can kind of just get a sense
of what this is what before this hobby
is completely gone and hopefully it
won't be people get an idea of just the
fun that is flying fpv flying model
aircraft and if they still wish to go to
regulations gov type in fpv and leave a
comment I mean it's made my life
personally so much better yeah it's so
strange to think too that the FAA would
consider what I'm doing right now flying
through the woods threat to the national
airspace I mean I don't know about you
but I don't see any Boeing 747s passing
through here so previously they had a
nice arrangement with the what is it
called the AMA or it's the amateur
modeling association
here in the United States and had a nice
relationship with the fááá whereby
they would put forth voluntary
guidelines and they're really good ones
they're there safe and sound guidelines
like you know fly with a buddy like Paul
right here is my spotter or you know
stay under 400 feet because of course
you know general aviation could be as
low as 500 feet so it gives a nice
buffer zone so it's just a shame to see
the FA just completely ignoring a
relationship that I did forged for you
know generations and to see something
that brings people together and bring so
much enjoyment it's not hurting anyone
to be under threat because well because
of an update to a policy statement I
wouldn't mind if there's a law passed
that actually states what this is and
what can and can't be done with this
technology but to just blanket throw it
out it just seems like you know the baby
in the bath water I mean I wouldn't mind
even a chance to participate in some
sort of lawmaking process involving this
but just to update a policy it just
seems so I don't know there we go
you know it's crazy look it look at this
this is the way that I've got the motors
actually mounted on to the frame I'm
just using zip ties which I felt like
was totally cheating but no it's
actually a thing and it was great
because earlier today I had a pretty
good crash and nothing happened to this
carbon fiber frame the only thing that
happened was that the it snapped on
impact which is exactly what I wanted
the little love zip tie broke off and I
just had to put it back on it was good
to go kind of epic I know I'm pretty
much pretty much as wrecking quadcopter
gear but yeah let's not forget this much
like geocaching we want to leave the
place better than we found it well
that's just about it i figured that in
the midst of the craziness that is the
move to the warehouse i would take a
moment to kind of share with you a
little bit of this hobby that's under
regulatory fire right now and if it's
something that you're interested in you
can go to regulations gov and type in
fpv in the search and in fact you can
even check out flight tests so another
great youtube channel that covers a lot
of this stuff as well and if you're in
the bay area and want to fly hit me up
on twitter otherwise that's kind of it
for this week i just want to get out
there and show you something that i
really enjoy and of course value your
feedback so hit us up feedback at hak5
dot org otherwise we'll be back with
more regular episodes uh hopefully soon
mmm you smell that I need to make lemon
flavored mustaches this is the case this
is totally fact how it works is now
available on the broad bands for which
you too can have a brilliant ideas
because when you get that idea you have
to search for it fast and what's awesome
is that domain.com they've got this
quick domain discovery system making
their checkout process and everything
super simple to get you set up in no
time at all fire up that web server
because we're about to get creative
that's a brilliant idea told you guys
before I love domain com because they're
reliable they're affordable the easy
news but most of all you'll realize that
it is super fun place to do business as
we have realized as we tweet them at
domain.com and realize wow these people
are just crazy enough to do business
with us they like lemon flavored
mustaches like brand new from the minds
of the domain place where they dig up
the domains it's so great but you know
what else is crazy the savings if you
used the coupon code hak5 at checkout
you're going to get an extra fifteen
percent off from your mind into the web
domain name website you're up and
running so when you think two main names
think domain.com I should probably also
add to the international viewers that
this while specific to the United States
with our federal aviation administration
kind of has some bearings on the rest of
the world in that many other nations
look to the United States for policies
to implement and kind of follow that
lead and so I just wish that the United
States would kind of like get on board
with some of the more sensible stuff
that for instance the United Kingdom is
even you know they've got laws on the
books that make it you know just plain
and simple it's I forget exactly what
the specifics are but it's something
about staying away from buildings and
you're good so I just hope that this
isn't one of those things where we can
look back on to see what a hobby was
that I hope that it's something where we
can continue the conversation continue
to fight and yeah so I think this is
this only encourages people to get into
math and science and stuff of that
nature
that's this pretty much hip-hop
well the sad thing is we're not getting
the forklift they told me they're
they're not going to leave the forklift
for us which on the one hand means we
don't have to get certified to a driver
work forklift but on the other hand
means that there's so much hijinks that
we're going to miss out on don't worry
we have plenty of roller care yeah yeah
I'm thinking zip line huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
