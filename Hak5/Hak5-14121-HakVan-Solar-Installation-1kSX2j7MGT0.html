that go on to the rail which the rack
will sit on and then the solar panels
will sit on the rack so it's what is it
panel rack mount rail van this segment
of hak5 is brought to you by domain.com
so what I'm hoping to be able to do is
just take this little piece here so our
positive is going to go this is going to
the second panel okay so this is the
last panel the first panel is just going
to have this coming out of it we're
going to be wired in series instead of
parallel these are well their panels
rated at anywhere between 16 and 17 and
a half volts so we'll have somewhere
around 32 volts going down and then that
goes into the charge controller and then
the charge controller is going to take
that 32 volts and allow it to most
efficiently charge that bank of
batteries that are in parallel the
reason to do that is because i'm not
going to always get 17 and a half or 16
volts out of these panels it depends on
you know how cloudy it is or whatever
the conditions are of the Sun so so that
doesn't move and these are these are
really nice because there's a piece of
foam in here that makes sure that we
don't get any rain or anything in that
and then this when it screws down it
tightens these little teeth up on there
so that so this is not moving
how it's awesome there we go this now
needs to run to the second panel which
will be sitting side by side with this
so I don't know give myself enough slack
I'm sure there's a more proper way to do
this positive meet your new friend
positive so what we're going to do to
make this fit we're going to stick to
nuts on the end here of this long bolt
this channel the way that it is here
kind of made to slip things in
unfortunately the only way that we can
really make this work is to put two nuts
on the end of this thing as otherwise
won't be able to get a grip on it I'm
just going to finger tighten all of
these down and then come through and
really tighten them but i'll be able to
grab on to the bottom of this so it
doesn't spin and so now we just do the
same thing to all of these today's
lesson mathematics is how many hackers
can you fit on a roof what's going to be
really fun is it when we've got both
panels here and I can't really straddle
the roof cool I don't know I like dance
my way up here somehow
we're just gonna make it work no matter
what it's just gonna work huzzah no
voltage whatsoever oh wait what am i
doing it's not gonna report anything
until I plug in the other panel i'm only
getting a negative office I'm like so
Thanks hey uh yeah that's what I need
now expired tickets to the fail bus
panel number two welcome once again to
Darren tries not to fall off the roof of
a van 2013 nope locking washes where
have you gone come on well we got two
panels on the roof in series so I'm
getting 40 volts out of that take these
guys and run them in line with well
actually I'll just do it on the charge
solar charge controller common- and if I
do it right here boom that's the 50 amp
so that's the battery 12 point 7 volts
right there that's what I expect to see
out of a single AGM I'm going to plug
the other AGMs got total of four of them
in parallel so i'll still get twelve
point seven volts out of four of them
it's just instead of 108 amp so i'll end
up with four hundred and forty some odd
amps and out of the solar panels I'm
getting forty point forty 1.2 volts
right now and so that's pretty good
considering they are I think I think
they're both rated at 22 volts so that's
a maximum of 40 4 volts I'm only losing
you know almost 3 volts through cable
loss that's that's pretty efficient the
way that it works is the panel's soak up
the rays there's excite electrons they
go down this wire into this little baby
circuit breaker that goes into the
charge controller then the charge
controller takes that energy manipulates
it in such a way that it can
optimally charged the battery bank has a
bunch of different sensors for
temperature and voltage so that it can
you know figuring out how happy these
batteries are and what they want you
know there's different charging soul
cycles based on their capacity and then
it just sends it back down through this
through the circuit breaker again a 50
amp and then into the battery bank and
what I'm going to do now is plug in my
controller unit it's got a little rj11
and then I should be able to just go
ahead and fire this guy up battery bank
first and then solar after that and the
LEDs should fire on and then it should
start telling me all sorts of good stuff
so let's let's do it you got hardware
and software versions there we go 12.8
volts and it says zero watts and it's
night time so that's not right oh right
it says it's night time because it's not
getting any power from the solar array
it's getting 12.8 volts from my battery
which is what I expect to get the zero
watts power from the solar array it's
night time because I haven't thrown the
circuit breaker for the panel so as soon
as I do this there we go no longer night
time so they are 130 watt panels so I
should have a maximum of 260 watts
coming from them and I'm getting 250
watts so I'm losing 10 watts to cable or
whatever have you but that's not bad 250
watts think about that that would run
small computer except we're not doing
anything stupid like that because we're
using energy efficient stuff like you
know about 1 amp our refrigerator off DC
power and all of these other small
devices off DC power this is so exciting
seems to be working it's the magic smoke
did not come out
I want to take a minute to thank our
good friends over at domain.com and let
you guys know that when you're thinking
about that domain name you're looking
out all the options i want you to
consider yourself a dotnet in fact it's

calm i just find them great the first
five TLD is of course org edu mill gov
the other one dotnet was in there too
and let me tell you it is the third most
popular TLD in existence so when you're
looking to get your calm your net get
them both you know protect your brand
and when you're looking to get one of
those do what Shannon and I do we love
domain.com because one they've been
supporting us and this awesome adventure
and two there's so much fun to work with
you can tweet them at domain.com they're
awesome customer service you know its
domain registration without all the BS
so you can go over to domain com right
now they're hooking you guys up because
there's such a fan of hak5 and you that
you can get fifteen percent off their
already affordable domain names and
hosting all you have to do is use a
coupon code hak5 so when you think
domain names think domain.com
last week's trivia question was what is
tkip and how does it make wpa2 a better
security choice for your wireless
network and the answer was obviously
temporal key integrity protocol and it
forces a key to change every 10,000
packets or so now this week's question
is what is the true statement regarding
WEP cracking initialization vectors are
small or are they large they get reused
frequently and they are sent in clear
text or is it encrypted during
transmission instead of clear text hmm
you can answer that over at hak5 org
slash trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hak5 swag
