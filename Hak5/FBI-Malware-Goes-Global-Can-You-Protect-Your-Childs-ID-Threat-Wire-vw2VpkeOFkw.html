child's ID the future of the internet
and more all coming up now on threat
wire greetings I'm Patrick Norton this
is threat wire for january twenty seven
twenty sixteen your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
internet freedom and a big thanks to
everybody that supports threat wire at
patreon.com / threat wire interesting
story up on recode peter kafka reports
that quote twitter has stopped showing
ads to some of its most valuable users
so essentially for some of the most high
profile and active users on twitter it's
an ad-free or nearly ad free experience
mr. Kafka says which frankly has me
thinking a lot about net neutrality
companies like Netflix being forced to
pay for carriage while companies that
happen to be ISPs like Comcast structure
their isp so that their content is
hosted on a separate network from the
rest of the internet that you pay for in
a monthly basis the Internet has always
been complicated and messy and I think
it's getting a lot more complicated and
Messier and profit motivated and while I
doubt somebody with a half million
followers ever notices ads on Twitter I
want to remind everybody that say think
about it new online services needing to
drop piles of cash to get through your
ISP and onto your phone VR glasses or
desktop is a major barrier to entry that
will change how or if new technologies
much less new companies can flourish
online this is going to be a big
continuing issue through 2016 although a
lot of people are arguing that net
neutrality is dead and major ISPs are
going to force everybody to pay as much
as they can to get to your eyeballs the
FBI is 2015 child pornography sting
which involves seeding malware or as the
FBI puts it employing network
investigative techniques on to at least
a thousand computers is truly global in
scale that's the word for motherboard
and child porn sting goes global FBI
hack computers in Denmark and Greece and
Chile it's estimated that somewhere
between 13 and 15 hundred IP addresses
were identified from the 200,000 plus
users of a site that was first seized by
the FBI then run off of FBI servers for
13 days the director of Europol
described the operation as this is a
motherboard quote a successful
infiltration and technical investigation
of a tool
or hidden service IE the dark webs I got
to be honest with you I am torn between
a personal desire to see all child
pornographers eliminated probably with
extreme prejudice and my concerns about
eight or being vulnerable and be a
warrant that gave the FBI says
motherboard pretty much an unlimited
number of searches and is unidentified
targets anywhere in the world this is an
interesting question how far can you go
to take out child pornographers I think
most of us as a society would say all
the way and this is certainly an example
where the FBI did that because the FBI
is still dealing with court cases that
are well based on the brought by people
that are incredibly upset that the FBI
ran this website for any number of days
even to stop child pornography nursing
home workers cost-sharing nude patient
images on snapchat is the title of an
article on social security blog which is
M named naked security unfortunately
look people there is no pass for human
stupidity or frankly for cruelty there
is however the possibility that the
accused nursing assistant will get up to
18 months and two years of supervised
release you'd think you wouldn't have to
educate nursing home employees that they
should not take pictures of patients
without consent especially naked
pictures and hey remind your post
pubescent children that snapchat photos
don't really go away ever okay meanwhile
we're told that a credit freeze is still
way more useful in stopping identity
theft and credit monitoring shame that
nobody told the OPM lab before they
pissed money down a hole on credit
monitoring for everybody breached last
year on a less snarky note Krebs on
security has a great article the lowdown
on freezing your kids credit which is a
great idea to keep identity thieves from
using your child's social security
number and information to open credit
cards bank accounts or start government
benefits sounds silly check this out
Krebs quotes at Carnegie Mellon study
that look at 40,000 children and found
that ten percent more victims of ID
theft and I guarantee you that number or
percentage will grow unfortunately only
23 states currently have some kind of
mechanism for parents or guardians to
protect their child's ID links in the
show notes to learn more on how to
protect your child from you have another
growth opportunity free digital thievery
