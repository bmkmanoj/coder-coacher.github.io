showed you how to pipe your independent
media into your TV system all around
using coax and RF modulator
well Darren promised how to show you how
to remote control all of that using a
cell phone and that's what we're doing
right now
so hey Darren hey now you've got this
hack worked out for us
yes as they are turning a internet-ready
cell phone or basically any device if
you've got a PSP or you know Pocket PC
laptops what I'm asking that can connect
to your homeland if you were to the web
we've got a Linux toaster with a web
browser on your land that could control
your media nice so this is basically a
way to control your home theater PC
which we have done now with fire and
democracy and your modulator hack and
what I want to talk about is ways to
customize my favorite media player VLC
okay course I love VLC because it starts
with a V you know VPNs VPN video ZL c
and v MC yeah okay anyway so what are
the requirements for this particular
well obviously we're going to need VLC
0.8 X and we'll also need Apache you can
either used 1.3 point X build or the two
point X build okay and then we'll also
need PHP hmm okay it's lamp well except
without the Linux we're doing no PHP and
Apache yeah all right it works they work
well together this is the great it's the
dynamic duo they get stuff done it's my
favorite hacking tools
next same bad station same bad time yes
something like you know so what we need
to do is once we've got all of those
installed we need to do some
customizations we need to create a HTML
file a PHP file and then do some
customizations feels a little absurd
we're gonna write a little PHP code a
little HTML yeah what's that gonna be
well let's head over here I've got the
this is our Apache HTTP 4 and I'm gonna
go into the index file alright and
basically all this is is a starting page
which you know you'll you'll hit the
button on your cell phone it'll take you
to this page and it's got two links my
first link will start VLC on your
computer ok and this is this one right
here that's this one right here so it's
gonna open up VLC dot PHP so let's take
a quick look at that
here's VLC PHP really simple all
one command it's the system command and
it will start VLC and then give it a
directory that's where our media is
being stored from fire and democracy
items and that's going to act as like a
playlist I'm assuming that exactly we
hit this it'll start playing that
playlist okay next one is this command
right here which will start VLC's
built-in web server VLC has a web server
to allow you to to to control VLC but
we're gonna have to make some
customizations right and of course the
next thing being full green so I set it
to full screen so back to our HTML and
so once we've clicked on the start VLC
link right I'll start playing now we
need to control it so that's what this
link is here and the reason for these
two links is because it could be done in
one link with JavaScript but I want this
to work cross-platform any device my
phone supports JavaScript but mine does
not yeah so this will pretty much run on
any cell phone that has an HTML browser
okay okay so this will take us to our IP
address with the port 8080 that's VLC's
web servers let's head over here much
like you're using the dying DNS I'm
using the designed DNS address to rather
than give the IP address out on the show
we're gonna do the dined DNS yeah mix
things easier yeah and plus it always
redirects your ISPs IP for you yeah to
you so if your IP address changes at
home on your cable no DSL your cheque -
we'll take giant DNS com sweet so let's
head over to the indexed HTML this is
over in the VLC so this on right and the
nifty thing about this is here in the
head we've got all of these VLC tags and
these are custom to VLC and it will
interpret these when it when it runs
okay so here's the form that decides the
the stop the pause previous/next you
know all the buttons to do your stuff
like plus minute - minute and you've had
to actually customize all these to work
on yeah I've just customers I've trimmed
down the the file so that it will look
nice on a phone on a PSP on a iPAQ
Pocket PC or whatever just made it real
clean real simple yes also and of course
that code will be in the show notes so
let's you want to take a look yeah yeah
while we get a demo obviously you've got
the hack working okay we wouldn't be
doing the sec so here's the cell phone I
gotta go and we're on our start
Paige and I'll just click on VLC or
start VLC okay it takes just a second
yeah because we're going out to the
Internet and coming back oh there goes
and it's playing our favorite vidcast so
now I'll click on the remote button
alright just remote and here we go we've
got stop pause previous/next - minute
plus a minute so let's go ahead and just
you know we'll click Next some pure
ownage oh look there's gonna enjoy some
asking ninja that's good stuff alright
then what else we got here next again oh
there's some command n some geek
entertainment television okay so
basically the idea is you walk in your
house you you know after a long day of
work ya like it you know like for me I
have a long day at work and so if I want
to sit down and veg out definitely gone
you know to some good content rather
than the spoon-fed crap we find on cable
television
yeah really yeah if I just want to bed
you out to the boob tube with some
quality entertainment I can fire it off
on my cell phone when I hit you know hit
the driveway and by the time I walk in
and turn on your TV to channel 2 channel
2 is now the core for free oh yeah I
guess it would be three or four it's
three or four okay if you tuned in and
then now you've got your spiffy remote
and it's why spiffier than you than I I
mean we could use like like that right
there yeah something like this right
here the HEI all and wander remote and
you know I have an all-in wonder machine
I've got an all-in-one der video card as
well yeah I love getting in remote
battles with you because it's a one flaw
I found about these and we're not gonna
get well I guess we could get remote
battles over this because you could get
into yeah so I guess maybe the next step
to the attack is doing some htaccess
stuff but I think I want to talk about
that next month with with some security
through obscurity its tune in next month
for that sweet so I'm gonna go ahead and
shut this down there's a little exit
button or actually I want to talk about
at the bottom of this oh yeah this is
our actual playlist right here that
shows like a hypertext so I wanted to go
straight to the pure ownage and the
playlist I can hit that and it would
skip to any of the files in the playlist
Auto generates that so based on the
contents of our media clip yes so great
ways to just get your media with any of
those applications pipe it to your TV
and now control it with this
awesome awesome fantastic so as always
all the code will be in the show notes
and one little change to the segment
normally when we do PHP and Apache and
all that fun stuff we throw on an Easter
egg with either our IP address or a dine
DNS and you guys had a lot of fun in
episode one playing with our lights
turning on and off yeah so we're not
doing that this time not that we don't
trust you with our television but we
don't trust you with our television</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
