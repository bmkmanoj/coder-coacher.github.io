your tunes of boxey's fqa and wireless
for your virtual machines
this week of hak5 is brought to you by
domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain calm
GoToMeeting and the national fight
against drunk driving over the limit
under arrest who wants to spend Labor
Day in jail hello and welcome to hack 5
my name is Darren kitchen and this is of
course your weekly dose of techno us we
have a great show for you guys this week
Shannon is joining us to talk about some
wireless in virtual machines we're
getting a little roundtable going on
with Jason Jason is actually back
talking about you know just some answers
to some of your questions about boxy
development and I'm actually working on
a couple of projects right now but one
thing that I wanted to just dive in
since the other things are kind of like
in the middle you know different various
states of the progress was some of the
feedback that I've gotten on the segment
where we used Edna the Python scripts as
well as a virtual machine here to go
ahead and stream our music remotely to
our to our Android based phone and I got
so much great response from one of the
one packages that somebody sent in I
thought I would highlight for you guys
today because it kind of illustrates the
difference between using a Python script
whether it's yours some guys whatever
versus you know a commercial
off-the-shelf product like warband then
that thing in the middle that beautiful
open source collaboration that is well a
couple of different packages the one
that I'm looking at today is called an
pachi so I thought we would go ahead and
give it a shot so I've got it pulled up
here in our PHP a VirtualBox our mp3
server is running and let's go ahead and
RDP over to that yes I'm back in Linux
whoo so I just pull up a little RDP
session and I could see here that it's
on port 33 90 set it to RDP five and I
think one of the other things I've been
having problems with is it doesn't want
to play sound so I just say do not play
and I got the screen size set so we
should just be able to go ahead and
connect to our server here excellent and
you can go ahead and grab yourself a
copy of an pachi over at an Patchi org
it's kind of a play on the epic media
player winamp
and apache which is an excellent web
server it's actually a bunch of PHP so
and stuff that runs on top of Apache it
also requires my sequel so this is a lot
more involved than just a single Python
script but it's so much more versatile
and there's also applications for
several different operating systems
including Android that make it really
really slick so let's go ahead and check
this out
now on Ubuntu it's actually a lot easier
to install especially since Hardy then
it ever has been before but we are going
to need to go ahead and set up a couple
of prerequisites at first of all being
that we're going to need my sequel
server I think will being one of my
favorite databases simply a matter of
sudo apt-get install my sequel server
and of course we'll need to set a root
password for my sequel and next as we
might imagine as a sudo apt-get install
apache and were greeted by little end
curses action saying that we got to
restart apache so with the apache newly
installed let's go ahead and look in
slash user share and pachi
ww and this is really where it all lives
in as I said it's a bunch of PHP scripts
so to go ahead and configure it with our
database it's really just a matter of
pop and open our browser and heading
over to localhost / am pachi now we can
see here that our PHP version and all of
these other prerequisites are listed as
okay so we can go ahead and click start
configuration now this is where we're
going to have to go ahead and give it
information for our database now it
wants our root password for our my
sequel database but we're going to say
go ahead and create a new user for the
database because we don't want to use
root and we'll create a new user called
an Apache and we'll go ahead and insert
the database now we'll see here that we
actually get these errors and this is to
be expected actually what we need to do
here is create a new amp achi config dot
PHP so
to do that we'll go ahead and give it
the same username and password that we
gave it before and we'll click write
config what that's gonna do is give us
that file I know this is kind of strange
but we're gonna save this file out and
by default that's just gonna go to my
downloads folder so let's pop back over
to our shell pop another one open here
CD to return to our home directory and
CD over to downloads and we can see
there's our iam patchy config.php so
what we want to do is move that to slash
user share and patchy
ww config oh and you need to be root to
do that so sudo bangbang to do the same
thing you just did but as root this time
and it goes ahead and completes so now
we can come down here and click continue
to step three and it I was like the
trickiest part of the whole install I
believe so now we can go ahead and
create a admin account to actually log
into the backend and this is where it
gets really sweet because amp a she's
pretty powerful it's set up for not just
like you and your media at home it's
actually so that you could you know
potentially create user accounts for
different people with different roles
there's actually access control lists
there's a sequel database on the backend
it's pretty fast and you navigate it not
just using a web front-end I mean you
can but there's also you know plugins
and applications for all sorts of
different devices so let's create our
admin account with a really lame
password and here we go we can login so
admin
so let's go ahead and go over to config
I know these are really small icons here
but but up here we can see we've got
home we've got our playback we've got
the Preferences and I think it's right
over here
and the little server icon admin we can
come down to under access control list
there it is user tools we'll want to add
a user we're going to name this user
music and give them the name music I
don't know music hak5 org that doesn't
go anywhere and a really lame password
and instead of being a guest we're going
to set this person up as a user now we
could also set them up as a catalog
manager or a Content Manager you can see
how this could actually be really
powerful if say like you were doing some
sort of a shot cache streaming server
and you had a whole bunch of people
collaborating on you know what music
might be playing in your station I could
see this being a good fit for something
like that as a single user that just
wants access to my mp3 is it can
sometimes seem a little bit like
overkill which is why I liked Edna but
this is pretty sweet too once you've got
it all set up and going so we'll add
that user and continue now I also need
to go over to the catalog and actually
set up our music so we'll add a catalog
we're going to call it music and the
path for that and I believe it's let's
see
PWD show me where I am music okay so
it's in slash home slash music server
slash music I do a little LS action I
can see I've got two toten hosen and all
the other actually and when we put in a
couple of tracks but as an example this
this will work so slash home slash music
server slash music with capital M if you
wanted to you could actually set this up
to hit music off of another and Pachi
server so say like you've got your an
Apache server set up and a friend of
yours has another you can exchange your
XML RPC keys and then you can actually
pull music from his collection that's
pretty neat and then also come down here
we can actually set up what we expect
the file names to
and like what kind of you know if it's
artists and then track an album or
however the format is it's gonna go with
fault here and click Add catalog now
it's found 140 songs that scrub through
those added them to the database so now
we can actually configure our device to
connect to here and start playing our
music now in order for us to connect to
it we've already set up in the previous
episodes talked about port forwarding
and how we can set that up with like
dine DNS or another dynamic DNS service
with our untangle router and it's much
the same here
before we were using port 8080 this is
running on Apache on this new machine
which is running on 80 but I've pretty
much mapped external 8080 to internal 80
and it doesn't know the wiser so from
our phone I've gone ahead and downloaded
an awesome application here called
lullaby it's an Android app specifically
made to interface with an patchy and
this is where it gets really slick so
what I need to do is go over to settings
and set up my in patchy server URL and
you can see I've already given it the IP
address or the host name here colon 8080
slash and patchy that's where we're
expecting to connect we've set up our
username as music and let me go ahead
and re enter that password
and it says connected to an Apache
excellent so we'll come back here and if
I go to artists there we go I can
actually see the toten hosen is in here
and you know there's my album and check
that out or we can go over to Dale chase
and check out something off of Limit
Break like one of my favorite songs
WordPress featuring dual core yeah and
what it's actually done there is it's
cute it so I can go ahead and set up a
playlist here I'm like you don't wanna
limit ji-ho nosin and some d'art stuff
and then some dale chase and i can see
down here that we are playing and if i
skip track to the next a little dale
chase action going on and this is a
media player specifically built for the
Android there's plenty of other ones for
Windows for Mac for Linux for different
devices and I highly recommend you to
check this out if you're looking for
something a little bit more robust than
Edna and I got to thank everybody for
sending in their feedback with their
favorites this is just one of many that
we received and I might be checking out
a couple more of them later but this is
pretty slick so if you've got you know a
virtual machine server going on this is
an excellent thing to just go ahead and
throw on it it's a fun little way to
start tinkering with some Apache stuff
and yeah that's that's what I got so as
you might imagine if you have questions
hit us up at feedback at hack 5 org and
at this point I'm just going to go ahead
and throw it over to you know who for
you know what
sanim trivia this week's trivia is who
narrated the American documentary can
you hack it visit hat 5 org slash trivia
for your chance to win some awesome
brand-new hack 5 stickers we'll be right
back after a brief word with our
sponsors far too many people don't
understand that alcohol drugs and
driving do not mix the message is simple
guys drinking and driving over the limit
under arrest don't put yourself or
others in danger now law enforcement
officials will be out in force all over
the country from August 25th and
September 6 cracking down on drunk
drivers beyond just putting your life at
risk
you could cost yourself a bundle of time
and money jail time the law Sears
driver's license higher insurance rates
and dozens of other unanticipated
expenses from attorneys fees and other
fines to court costs car towing repairs
lots of time at work and the best are
worst part of drinking and driving is
that it can be so easily avoided you can
still go out and have a fun time just
plan ahead if you're gonna drink
designated driver call a taxi use mass
transit or find some other sort of ride
sober program so this week I thought I'd
take some time out and answer some
viewer feedback you know I've gotten a
lot of feedback from this segment you
guys really like boxy and I've gotten a
couple development questions but mainly
it focuses around what I'm doing you
know what this board is and questions of
that made nature so let's go jump jump
straight into the question Sam asks I
know the hak5 crew or PC gays haters but
what would be a good case for the Boxee
Box I've got to match my media stuff
well I'm not a PC case hater and in fact
I have a pretty good one here notice
this case does not have a power supply
and it's kind of fits real it would fit
really nice in a home theater setup and
it is the super case MD - 100 horrible
name it's a little bit larger than I
like but like I said doesn't have a
power supply because the motherboard has
one and Sebastian writes Jason I've got
a question about your last boxy segment
what OS you have running and in case
you're running a bun - I've got another
question about how do you tie in running
boxy and an HTTP server at the
same time because uh the box is gonna be
up running 24/7 and I'm not gonna be
running box you know 24/7
great question no you don't have to run
Boxey 24/7 I do run a bunt you and I do
run Boxey 24/7 that's just the setup I
have the that's actually a pretty good
idea what I would do is write two
scripts I would write a boot up script
that may run in priority to the other so
that actually runs on startup so if you
exit box II will just go back to a - and
you could then exit out to the command
prompt from there so you can exit out of
everything that's a higher level process
and then still have your HDB server
running and the second script I would
use is for starting your HTTP servers so
you could macro out both of those so if
you wanted you could start to a blank
desktop and then macro to one or macro
to the other that's that would be
probably weren't the best solution to
that so let's go ahead next question
James writes what kind of software setup
are you using on Boxey and what kind of
board are you using covered it running a
bun to you with Boxey we're setting up
running on startup and the board I'm
using is the Asus 83 IO and RI on T - I
that that's the board amazin I love the
board the board has got like I said the
built-in power supply the Bluetooth
comes with a pretty decent remote I wish
it had more expansion slots but then
again as an ITX with built-in power and
it has HDMI so it's perfect for this
situation yeah I love the wart and then
I've got to do a call out to Ryan who
actually sent in his Boxey app right
there lower third has the has the
repository you can add to your boxy
software library so check it out if you
guys have any more questions keep them
coming
Jason at hack five dot org and you know
I really appreciate the feedback and
hope to do another segment just like
this answering more questions if you
have a question about anything else you
saw on today's show hit the show notes
at hack five dot org so let me get this
straight you hide
my fries pop diet.com domain open a
factory in Vancouver and now you want me
to choose the logo for your viral
marketing campaign which looks like a
more delicious way to lose up to 17
pounds a month freeze pops so what are

got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain com
all right once again we have the
pleasure of being joined by goto meeting
with our friends Shannon how are you
Shannon are you doing good how are you
doing not that how is it in Missouri
it's hot I envy you and over there on
the East Coast in Northern Virginia
Jason Applebaum how are you Jason I'm
doing pretty good but it's rainy here
not sunny well I thought it was apt to
get you on because we're talking I phone
stuff we're talking jailbreak stuff and
you being a I'm so excited
yeah we've got a Android yeah we've got
an Android developer and an avid iPhone
fan girl so have you guys seen the news
about this about Apple's recent patent
about the jailbreaking II absolutely
it's a it's kind of blown out of
proportion right okay well yeah when I
first read about it on Twitter I was
like what they're gonna make a kill
switch for my iPhone and they're gonna
find out it's jailbroken and Wow they're
gonna blow up my phone but yeah and
they're gonna track your position and
know what you're looking at and tell
your mother right so essentially what
this is what we're talking about here is
that you know evidence emerged about a
patent that Apple filed for back in
February that allows them to identify
unauthorized users of electronic devices
using different methods of detecting
whether or not the operating system has
been changed as well as other weird
things like you know what compromised
compromised compromised not changed and
Apple wants to do a clear distinction
between you know changed and compromised
so what do you think about this you know
what was your gut reaction here my
action was I kind of freaked out of it I
was like hold up what are they gonna do
to my phone if they find out it's
jailbroken cuz I'm the owner of the
phone and it's it's legal to have a
jailbroken phone so why would they even
want to do anything with this but then I
actually read the articles about how
they put in this patent to basically
find out if your phone is lost or stolen
they're looking for suspicious behavior
such as entering an incorrect path
password
jailbreaking room
the phone SIM card things like that
they're not actually going to put a kill
switch on their phone they're just
trying to trying to put some security on
it and I'm all for that right well we've
got to keep in mind here and that is
this is just a patent and I think what
we'll probably see from this is some
sort of a product where Apple does for
enterprises kind of similar things that
RIM does for their blackberry enterprise
users where they can you know not only
remote wipe the phone but also you know
other fun stuff in case it's stolen I
guess we'll see how it goes good for the
users now um we did have a viewer
question that I wanted to bring up Alex
and he wrote in about he asked how how
do you set up Wi-Fi in virtual machines
or is that even possible thanks Shannon
that is a frequent question that we get
here and that is like okay great so I've
got a virtual machine it's running on my
desktop I can run Linux inside of
Windows hooray start playing around with
stuff but how am I supposed to get it on
my Wi-Fi network or another use case is
hey I want to start playing with
backtrack and I want to do some like
packet injection but I can't use my
laptop's internal Wi-Fi radio because my
host operating system is doing that and
time and time again we say the best way
to go about that is actually to use a
USB wireless adapter my favorite being
one of the Alpha wireless here these are
great little this is a 500 milliwatts
een - what which I totally called BS on
but but these little guys they little
USB guys are awesome and same thing with
this this on core this is a rolling
chipset one this is good stuff or even
not even just Wireless but like a USB
Ethernet this right here is a TRENDnet
USB Ethernet so if you had to for
instance plug it into a physical network
and you couldn't just do it with
bindings on your Ethernet then that that
would be a great way to go especially
being you know physical access to other
machines it's it's a really useful
solution but yeah USB is really neat
because in virtual machines and I've got
pulled up here my VM my Oracle
VirtualBox and I can go ahead and show
you how you would set that up right now
so I'm going to go ahead and plug in
this
encore 802 that 11n guy all right so my
host operating system sees that now and
what I can do is on my bunch of machine
I come over to settings and to USB what
we need to do is create a new filter so
I'll click this plus button here and
choose my raw link and hit OK and so
what's going to happen now is whenever I
power up this machine and I plug in that
USB it's going to completely bypass my
host operating system and go straight
over to my virtual system so you know if
this was a backtrack for system in my
alpha i plug in my alpha I boot up my
virtual machine I plug in my alpha and
then it sees it and the reason why I
like that encore in this alpha and this
trend net device and I'll have the links
to the particular models in the show
notes is that they are just supported
right out of the box in Linux so that's
hope that answers your question Alex and
of course you guys know if you have
other questions you can send those over
to feedback at hak5 org we'll do our
best to kind of take those on air and I
got to thank Shannon and Jason for
