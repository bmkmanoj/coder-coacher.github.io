loses five million dollars wordpress
gets owned and then patch and over three
hundred and fifty Wi-Fi routers
potentially vulnerable to a wicked new
exploit all that coming up now on threat
wire i'm darren kitchen this is threat
wire for Friday May 1st 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and I'd
like to start with a huge thanks to
everyone who has supported the relaunch
of this show we are so proud of this
awesome community and if you're new to
threat wire on the hack 5 channel that's
because we did this for a year on tech
feed and now we're bringing it back and
we are just so excited so let's get
started got yourself a router from the
likes of d-link or TRENDnet asus or some
300 others using real tech chipsets yea
if so you might find this story pretty
interesting I know I did there's a new
vulnerability that's been discovered in
the software development kit for real
tech semiconductor chips that could if
made use of make a ton of routers
vulnerable to code execution there's
nearly half a million of these devices
potentially running the vulnerable
Realtek software as found through a
search of showed an if you haven't seen
it it's the search engine for internet
devices and basically what it comes down
to is this component called mini Gd it's
part of the realtek software development
kit for their RTL 81 series of chips and
the problem is that it doesn't properly
sanitize user data and if exploited
would allow an attacker to actually run
code on the system on the Wi-Fi router
with root privileges the highest the
most administrative report villages
furthermore the exploit doesn't require
authentication
yikes the vulnerability was discovered
by researchers from HP's tipping point
and the team claims that they tried
several times to report the bug
privately to real tech for like months
before finally giving up and just making
this public and there are over 350
devices listed on wiki Devi using the
potentially affected chipsets the
vulnerability is known to exist in
version 1.3 of the SDK and older
versions may suffer from the same bug
short of a firmware update I guess from
real tech there really isn't a you know
they haven't made a statement and there
isn't
like a permanent fix but one mitigation
might be to disable UPnP and restrict
which machines might have access to the
vulnerable device you could also disable
the ability to manage the router from
the web if that's an option on your
device or if you have one of the
potentially vulnerable devices from the
likes of d-link and TRENDnet you might
kind of consider putting on some
alternate firmware I like dd-wrt and of
course open wrt the dire trojan just got
an upgrade this is some malware that has
been extremely effective in online
banking phishing stealing millions of
dollars and even circumventing
two-factor authentication since 2014 and
this new variant that's been discovered
is possible to thwart anti-malware
techniques known as sandboxing that's
basically when you run code in some sort
of virtual machine so that you can see
what it does before letting it wreak
havoc on your actual machine now the new
variant detects these sandboxes by
checking to see how many processor cores
it has and if there's only one then it's
gonna quit and actually not do its
attack see most modern machines have
like two four or even more cores well
sandbox is typically I have just one so
cat meat Mouse Irish airline Ryanair
recently suffered a cyber attack with
hacker stealing some five million
dollars the money which apparently came
from the funds that the company uses to
buy parts and fuel was transferred to a
bank in China officials are mama on how
the hack was perpetrated but it sounds
like wire fraud given the fact that
Dublin's crime asset bureau is assisting
and recovering the money from its
counterpart agencies in asia just in
case you're curious five million dollars
is only enough to fill up 200 Boeing
737s Ryanair has like 400 of those birds
the lot of jet fuel WordPress operators
can breathe easy once again because a
critical vulnerability was patched in
the recently released version four to
one you see a cross-site scripting
vulnerability would have allowed
attackers to compromised your WordPress
site if a maliciously crafted comment
was left on your page security
researchers who uncovered this exploit
had previously documented an interesting
vulnerability in which an attacker could
use a google analytics plug-in to do
server-side execution that's some pretty
bad stuff where that would allow an
attacker to own your site in short order
but since version 3.7 WordPress has
featured automatic background updates
which will apply security patches
without
any use or intervention so if you are
running a wordpress site you should
probably make sure that you have
automatic background updates enabled I
put some helpful links in the
description our featured comment of the
day comes from Dennis G who in response
to the notion that phishing may be a
sign of Internet literacy or perhaps a
generational thing that will grow out of
and Dennis writes quote I don't think
it's the ignorance but the arrogance of
the end-user thinking that they are
smart enough to spot an attack but
phishing is crafty and often hits people
with high levels of access so true I
know you guys at home watching are
smarter than the average bear
in fact most commenters posted that they
were within the top 10 percent of the
phishing quizzes that we linked to but
let's not let those skills lead to
arrogance because nothing online is
static and you got to be ever vigilant
so thanks again Danis for your comment
if you have any thoughts on today's
stories please leave them below before I
go I want to give a huge thanks to
everyone who has supported the show so
far on our patreon if you find some
value from the show and you can spare a
few cents in episode please consider
becoming a patron at patreon.com slash
threat wire we are hoping to reach our
three time a week milestone goal with
the rotating cast of myself as well as
Patrick Norton and Shannon Morse so
throughout the month of May we're going
to be bringing you a taste of just that
and I hope you will contribute to help
us keep bringing this out two completely
independent in AB free so if you can't
donate though it's totally cool because
they subscribe a like a share that goes
a long way to and so you can find all of
the episodes links or social networks
and all of the other ways to contribute
