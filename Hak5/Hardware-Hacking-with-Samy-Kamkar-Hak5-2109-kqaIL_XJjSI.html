spoofing magnetic stripes on credit
cards we're having a conversation with
Samy Kamkar hello and welcome to hack 5
this is your weekly dose of Tecna list
i'm darren kitchen shannon Morrises out
in Denver this week and I just got back
from San Diego at torque on I love this
conference we have a fantastic show as I
was there speaking to none other than
Samy Kamkar who you may know from ki
sweeper and roll jam and mag spoof and
all of these other awesome tools so
without further ado let's just take it
away one it's hack five look at the clap
yeah yeah it's our new slogan actually
Oh Simone she does the Queen of robots
she makes like she made this Siri this
Arduino based serial robot where it
grabs the spoon and it gets cereal and
it pours milk but like it's not a great
robot so the milk spills and just spills
all over the table and the cereal misses
her mouth but she makes these amazing
hilarious robots I just feel like you
should hook up with her have her make a
clapper where you press the button and
like two hands protrude and then clap
but they've got a like flail and miss
slowly absolutely yeah she's great
that's it is it is that like a piece of
hardware you're gonna try to do next
yeah yeah but it has to be it you know
all my stuff I try to have a really
creating stuff but I also like breaking
stuff so with my projects I try to I try
to combine them right can i hack or like
break something or mess with something
while actually still having to create or
make you know do some effort put put in
some effort to have something that's out
put some tangible software hardware
right so I like your stuff always comes
out around DEFCON and it's always you
know for like big impact kind of like
proof it always seems like this just
wicked proof of concept but it's like
not just code it's just like hardware
pock and it's like what what what what
inspired you to start doing that uh
here's the I guess I've always um I've
done software my entire life so I've
always been on the soft
side in the past few years I've always
wanted to get into hardware because I'm
like people are doing such cool things
they're creating you know just like ever
since air crack and actually since
Hikari or David Holden created BSD air
tools that's one was like oh man
first up this guy's all david Haldeman's
awesome runs torque on and um I just
wanted to be more in the hardware and
I've always been really afraid of it and
then the last few years a friend of mine
handed me an Arduino one day and said
you can make LEDs like this was like
yeah ok and I looked into it I tried it
and it worked it's so easy and from
there I just I want to learn more about
hardware so ever since then I just been
trying to mess more you know continuing
to do software and security but also
playing with hardware and then radio as
well is it that's the funny thing is I
find that's a common theme in InfoSec
right now is you know is looking back
and I was talking to Michael Osman maybe
like five years ago at shmoocon and he
had just created the uber tooth and I
was like how did you make that he's like
I've never built anything hardware in my
entire life this is my first Hardware
project and I'm like what and but that
that's like the thing it's like ah you
know whatever how hard could it be
yeah that guy's awesome but you know how
hard could it be compared to what Ostman
does like I really look up to him and
all the stuff he creates so yeah that's
there's a reason his last name sounds
like awesome yeah but yeah I'm always
trying to you know I used a lot a ton of
his tools so I love the yardstick one
recently I've been using that a lot for
sub gigahertz stuff and I've created a
couple of my own simpler simpler sort of
more portable like most of my attacks I
want to be portable so I don't like
having to lug a laptop around if I could
have a small device that I can stake on
something that's that's really exciting
to me so some of your stuff looks like
it came out of like a would be NSA ant
catalog what would you say is your
favorite right now um my favorite tool
that I've created I have some software
that I think I like more than the
hardware but I'd say that on the
hardware side my favorite tool uh I have
a tool that I haven't released yet I've
been working on it
essentially it's a it's two subjects
transceivers and a microcontroller and
Bluetooth Low Energy and essentially
allows you to take this small device
keeping your back pocket and then use
your phone to automatically detect
wireless signals around you but then to
sniff and
modify and replay them so you can go
around let's say sniffing garage doors
or cars the rolling codes of cars
intercept them jam them replay them open
doors of cars starting missions of cars
go into you know restaurants with the
pager systems and then page all of the
page pages so they all turn on at once I
like to call that one the denial of
sandwich attack awesome so that's like
oh that's a fun thing I'm working on now
my favorite thing that I've created a
hardware-wise I don't know it sounds
like you're talking about like basically
a yardstick one with a Bluetooth serial
line right it's like two yardstick ones
umm portable so doesn't require a
computer because your phone does a lot
of both the combination of the phone
does your processing and also extra
microcontroller that comes on board and
y2 y2 yard sticks good question because
you can do some cool things for one you
can constantly scan with one while
you're actually listening on a frequency
with the other additionally it allows I
created an attack called roll jam
exactly where I was gonna go with this
because that's what people are like
totally after hit me up with that
okay so roll jam is a device and attack
I've created that essentially uses two
sub gigahertz transceivers similar to
the ones on yardstick 1 and what it's
portable I use a looking and battery and
a teensy microcontroller and what it
does is it will constantly scan certain
frequencies that cars use for the keys
for the rolling code key fobs so you can
unlock lock and when you press it roll
jam does two things it has actually one
transceiver that's trans that's actually
as soon as it sees detects a preamble of
someone unlocking their vehicle it
starts jamming and it only needs to jam
one bit of the entire key stream and
once it's done that it's simultaneously
listening on the other one so it's
jamming on one and listening on the
other on the other radio this allows it
a prevents the car from hearing the
signal but on the second radio the
second radio is tuned much and a much
tighter frequency in the vehicle so I
can hear the car essentially password
from the key even though the car can't
because the car has a much wider
frequency range
of listening so once you do that once
you capture that it then every time you
press on lock on your key the code roll
so it's like a new password every time
and whenever you put when you press on
lock roll jam intercepts jams it steals
the code and then you're like my unlock
doesn't work so what does anyone do they
just press it again the second time I do
the same exact thing but then I replay
the first one and so you've actually
played the first code which to unlock
the car but you now have the second code
which is good for later
exactly so to the car any previous codes
are invalidated so by playing replaying
the first one I now have a code that
looks like it was great in the future
and that allows me to go back to that
vehicle in the future unlock it and you
know six something in the can bus or you
know kind of do whatever from there so
the first time I saw this and it was
just like this brilliant the thing that
I don't understand though is if you are
simultaneously jamming on the same
frequency that you're also trying to
listen to are you not also jamming your
listener good question so what I'm doing
is I'm offset so let's say what I found
is most vehicles will have listened for
about one megahertz like that's what
their filter allows so if you're
listening on let's say 315 megahertz
you're actually listening between three
fourteen point five and three fifteen
point five megahertz so anywhere in that
if you're sending the transmission the
car will hear it so what I do is I jam
on the higher end so I'll jam around
three fifteen point four and then on the
lower end I'm listening around 3 15 and
I only listen for maybe two hundred
fifty kilohertz or 500 kilohertz
so the jimmies outside right I'm only
listening for half a megahertz while the
car listens for the full megahertz so as
long as I'm jamming outside of my
tighter listening range and I good
hardware for that uh the car will see
both the signal of the fob and my
jamming which together just looks like
garbage but my my device only sees the
really tight range which is only your
key fob because I'm pushing the jamming
on the outside of the edge of what the
car hears but not what I hear so
essentially I'm controlling the channel
bandwidth of my device to prevent me
from getting jammed so what's been your
experience with these where you've got
this awesome ID you do the proof of
concept you build the hardware you
launch it at Sammy dot PL dot dot dot
you're on to the next project what's the
in-between there from your perspective
would it mean the in between well
you know what happens like you know it
blows up in the media and then suddenly
you've got what nation-states asking you
to build them boxes or what I get along
I get a lot of asks you know I don't I
don't really build or sell anything
usually make one proof of concept maybe
two and yeah I'm usually kind of on to
the next project I want to work on new
things I'm really interested in in
learning new new things that I just
don't know and yeah kind of moving on
and then yeah you know I'll send the
tweet and some of my projects get picked
up and people think it's cool stuff and
I'm happy about that because I work
really hard to have some cool projects
and some interesting attacks
the thing that that it harkens back for
me is when reading your details on the
different like you know tools that
you've developed it reminds me of like
the phone freak days when it was all
about the box plans and the text files
and the schematics and it's like cool
solder this you know megahertz crystal
to a Radio Shack tone dial or whatever
have you so I just love to see that
continuing in in InfoSec as this you
know as the community and the whole
industry matures where do you see it
going um I mean I guess just to add to
that yeah that's how I learned I learned
from like reading frack right so it was
like frack was where I learned like oh
oh my god I can't believe this is
possible and I can't believe there's
instructions on it so where the industry
is going I don't know I'm like the worst
person ask when it comes to industry
because I'm not in the industry at all
I'm just on the outside kind of playing
around I'm just playing with the the
stuff that I think is really cool
when it comes to industry yeah I I think
the industry will you know nowadays I'm
just trying to bring in some new attacks
in some new areas so I'm trying to
hopefully I'll be able to push the
envelope pretty soon here with some new
attacks and I want to show the industry
there's some other crazy stuff that can
happen that I don't think we have any
protection for today so I'm excited
about that stuff and when it comes to
like the hardware stuff because you
figure you know okay you come out with a
software vulnerability and there's
already a process there's an exact
workflow for you know how you're
supposed to report it and how it's
supposed to be mitigated and how patches
get to customers but you start talking
about things like for instance so I was
joking around earlier about like the
hotel room door keys and how you know
with the right Arduino and at a
and a DC barrel plug you can you know
roll the codes and unlock the doors and
it's like that's the kind of thing where
now you need to replace a bunch of
hardware and it becomes much more hard
to swallow from a business perspective
as far as like the impact and how
expensive it is to mitigate and then you
wonder if anybody is even going to
bother you know if it's going to get
swept under the rug so that that's one
of the fun things that I'm seeing with
Hardware hacks it at least yeah I think
I think you nailed it on the head and I
think I think you just kind of pointed
out what I think will happen to the
industry as people realize OMG we need
to update this hardware how do we do
that and people start thinking about
that I love how like Tesla does that
right they have over there updates
look that's the right way to do it you
know people can argue that that by
itself is it could have a security hole
but as long as you make that solid then
you can go and you can update whatever
you need you know with with more secure
software firmware right that's that's
the way to do it so people aren't going
to update their doors alright and now
when there's hundreds of thousands of
that out there at hotels across the
country it needs it needs to be
automated and that's a scary thing but
that needs to happen and that's that's
where I think the you know the industry
not of security but of actual devices
will have to go so tell me about your
most recent one when it comes to
magnetic stripes because this was just
kind of chilling because it was such an
out-of-band at I don't even now know how
to describe how would you describe the
technique that you're using is there
already an existing like intelligence
name for what you're doing and then also
to preface that the audience understands
what we're talking about kind of like
build on what exactly that attack is ok
cool actually you know I think this is
my favorite hip project today this is my
max project and essentially what this is
is very very simple device very simple
it's a right now it's like an 80 tiny
microcontroller any microcontroller will
do it's a motor drivers like in l293d
but you need any motor driver will do in
a coil that I just wrapped with enamel
wire I mean it's literally those three
components and capacitor and a battery
and then MacGyver just showed up for
some reason with a with a paperclip
right right and yeah if you look at my
soldering skills that's what it looks
like like a paper clipped together
so essentially what maximum does is
allows you to program the 80 tiny the
microcontroller with credit cards and it
does a couple of the things that are
pretty pretty fun so I can go up to a
credit card reader a traditional mag
stripe reader not NFC not RFID something
we have to physically swipe your card
and you can be inches away with my
device press a button and it will
transmit the credit card to the device
wirelessly even though the device
supports no wireless and I was playing
around I had gotten a new Amex and I
realized a lot of the numbers look the
same so I started looking at my old Amex
as I'd replaced several times and but
ultimately discovered an algorithm of
the way Amex cards worked enough from
then I was like how do that's really
cool can I make my own credit card and
that's right the first several digits
are typically like the bank and then you
know your last four may stay the same
and correct yeah so uh yeah it most of
the most well what on it on Amex a lot
of them will stay the same a couple will
change some you know ones like a CRC
check and then I realized I could also
determine the expiration you know the
name and everything else stays the same
so if I were to let's say take an Amex
and I said let's say I stole it or found
it I start using it you call your bank
and you change it as soon as you change
it I know what the next number is I know
what your next right expiration is so
I've built that into Max poof so like
I'm using my own Amex and then I had it
lost and they sent me a new one and
before I received it I was making new
purchases on the new one that I had me
received so so that was one cool attack
and then another was I want to see what
uh just understand how magnetic stripes
work like are they actually magnetic
because I have no idea right I just saw
the black stripe on a credit card it's a
one-way street that kind of a device
it's like it's not like there's a
handshake with USB or something else
where you need to now wait for some
signal back and then hit back with the
right sequence number or something like
that you're literally just it's it's
just giving it a sequence of digits and
it's not like the card has to
authenticate anything there's no smarts
on it that's exactly right
yeah there's no smarts on it so and once
I learned that it actually is magnets
this actually is like a you know
magnetic polarity I was like well can't
I can't I emulate that with
electromagnetism right an electromagnet
all you need is wire and power so you
can take a
y're turn into a coil put on a battery
created electromagnet if you turn that
on and off you can essentially send the
bits that it would appear as if you're
swiping a magstripe because that's just
sending ones and zeros essentially so
your motor is actually spinning with the
coil to make the electromagnetic field
the motor driver is just changing the
phase of you know positive and negative
so it's if you connect in a motor it
would physically turn you know back and
forth but instead it's just sending
energy through the coil and that coils
in producing the electromagnetic force
which is just magnetism now so the
reader sees a magnet turning on and off
which appears like it's swiping a card
because when you swipe the card that's
what it sees it sees magnet no magnet
magnet no magnet or positive and
negative north of South Pole but the
from what I understand a predator says
typically three tracks on it though how
do you deal with that if you've got
multiple you know polarities on top of
each other it's a good question so
typically credit cards only have two
tracks my credit card any mag stripe can
have up to three tracks but credit cards
of two and and sometimes they'll look at
one sometimes they look at the other and
sometimes they'll look at both so that
was one of the hurdles I had to get
through because how do I send two tracks
at the same time and you can't because
there are different sections of the car
and I can't physically send those I'd
have to create two very small coils so
instead what I did was I pretend to
swipe back and forth so I swipe one way
and the other way so I'm actually
sending all of the track to data one way
and then I reverse the whole thing I
literally reverse the data and send it
again so now I'm just sending I just
have one coil and I send all the data in
an in reverse it what's really
interesting about that is it's because
these things are so the readers are so
cheap and terrible and that we've all
become accustomed to doing that that the
readers are like expecting that data and
like oh they'll make sense of it it's
resiliency right there yeah they
implemented this resiliency so that you
don't have to swipe twice or like do it
the same way and it can go right in
Reverse right so all this resiliency
that we've been planted which is great
it allows me to exploit that fact and
then I was like well you know I started
making purchases using my device and and
I made a button so I could just switch
MX's I found out mine was cancelled and
I was like I went to a place and said Oh
chip required so I need to insert the
chip and I couldn't hack the chip the
chip like like a European like chip and
pin system or something yeah so now you
know now in the u.s. we have chip more
and more so she have to target breach
yeah yeah finally we have chip not even
pin but now if you try to use a Mac
stripe or a card with the chip and you
use the Mac stripe it'll say insert chip
so I was like I wonder how that works
and I found it sorry I'm just imagining
you just don't pass the bit that says I
have a chip on me ask for the chip so
you just don't pass that right question
mark exactly you know yeah exactly so
so the security is in the parity is in
like they've updated all these readers
to say oh but if they if they have a
chip required but we want to so the
password field at the end of it you as
the user specify whether or not to ask
for the second factor of authentication
so use the attacker just don't ask for
the second factor of authentication
correct so I say oh no I'm an old credit
card even though the legit credit card
is is not old and has a chip I say oh
you know what I don't have a chip so
they go up backwards-compatible right
and fail gracefully and accept it so at
that point why did the industry even
implement the additional security anyway
if it wasn't ever it was so easy to
ignore that the answer to that obviously
being well there are you know hundreds
of thousands and millions of card
readers out there and it gets really
expensive when you come out with a
vulnerability that needs to be patched
that requires physical hardware to
replace then we've got landfills full of
old stuff whereas code you don't have
landfills full of code yeah yeah yeah
and I'd say at some point we'll all have
chip right and then at that point they
can probably say you know what don't
just just phase it out entirely I don't
know when that will happen though okay
going back to the question that is
previously I said like okay so you know
you do the proof of concept you release
the code you know it gets on all the the
major tax sites and such dot dot dot
you're on to the next project I'm
assuming this one regarding you like I
don't know guessing what your next
numbers are going to be on your Amex and
then charging purchases to them before
the bank even sends it to you that one's
got a couple more interesting dots yeah
there's some cool stuff you know I
release the algorithm for that just so
it wouldn't get abused because I don't
really see any good good from that and I
don't know if Amex is going to change
that I'm not sure but I'm excited about
that project too just because some cool
stuff came out of it someone else
Salvador Mendoza I believe took the max
boof project and then work improved it
and he actually took it and made it work
on samsung has loops called MST where
they have this like rolling credit card
and he figured out how that worked and
implemented on max boof so now he has a
version of Max boof that can if you ever
used the Samsung pay I believe it can it
has a much more secure credit card that
changes and he found out how that works
and implemented in max booth and then
someone else uh I believe Westen hacker
took max boof and then did it on hotel
hotel rooms so hotel rooms that use
magnetic stripe key cards he found ways
to exploit and brute force using max
boof so he's taken max boof and applied
it to hotel rooms now I can open a bunch
of hotel rooms he just did a Def Con
talk salvadore also just did leave a Def
Con in black hat talk on using the same
technology to do the wireless
transmission yeah yeah using the max bye
max booth device so using the same tool
to exploit other things in a way I I won
one just so that all of my credit cards
are on one device that I can just tap
and be like see you know even cooler
than Android pay or whatever have you
yeah yeah so I'm working on a couple new
versions of max spoof they're just
smaller and sleeker and trying to see if
I can maybe implement some other cool
stuff because that's just that's a fun
project and it's kind of I don't know it
looks it looks like magic when you can
when you can use it no I did and it's I
love the idea that those devices were
not made for wireless and so many other
solutions using NFC and such have like
come out but require hardware to
implement on the on the retailer side so
you know people that take Apple pay and
people that take Google pay and Samsung
and everything else and all of the NFC
is in between and yet here you are
saying like hey I can keep using your
legacy stuff you know and to an industry
that loves that backwards compatibility
I'm surprised that this wasn't developed
sooner just as a stopgap measure to
provide Wireless payment systems I mean
the again I can't imagine that that's
something that would be easy to get FCC
certified it's not quite a spark-gap
transmitter but it's not
I mean I don't know what the the RF
coming off that thing is but that's
interesting that's good question I have
no idea
so check but yeah that's a good point
and I think in Samsung MST is doing
something cool where they're essentially
saying the same thing and then they're
also using like rotating credit cards so
that you know now that the everything's
in our side on client side and you don't
need to update all all all the companies
out there that you can have security by
like updating credit card each time like
a rolling code for example so you can do
some cool stuff there you actually have
you know one-time pads and you can have
like all sorts of like actual you know
PKI as opposed to the symmetric key that
is the you know sixteen digits on the
front of the card and oh we'll make it
more secure by putting three on the back
because that's more digits yeah what
would you call that technique of
wirelessly transmitting that stuff to
the magnetic readers is there their term
for that I I mean as far as I know
electromagnetism I mean that's the only
that's only all I know how to call it
yeah it seems that more and more we're
living in a world where like hacker
tools are becoming what we had grown up
with seeing like alias and and terrible
spy shows like that where you know you
pop the little box on some numbers
rotating the door unlocks and you're
like that's not an hour so do you think
we're emulating that or was that always
a thing and finally hackers are getting
to the point where we're making our own
ant catalogs um I I try to emulate like
cool TV shows or you know James Bond
style like if I can critten James Bond
style device but I haven't yet but if I
could do that that's kind of like my
goal alright I want to have the cool
toys that he has had and I think you
know I think a lot of people you know
who create movies and TV shows are super
creative so being able to take some of
their creativity and then merge it into
real life I think it's super fun yeah
it's fun to play q so what's next with
that for you then
so you know I mentioned earlier I'm
working on some cool like I'm working on
some side channel attack stuff which I'm
really excited about kind of exploiting
air-gap machines I have a project I've
been working on for a long time in that
area I've a new USB attack coming out so
I should get the wraps on that and
document that
the hardest part documenting but I want
to provide good documentation because
that's how I learned right as a kid is
just like reading fact right and reading
you know online just people online on
IRC seeing the open source tools that
people release so this is I want you
know I want other people younger people
to go and look at the stuff I made and
then make better stuff all right I mean
you're keeping the spirit alive in that
sense it really is like fracking and
you've actually done such a good job of
documenting this anybody can go to
Sammie de piel right now and start
building some of these ridiculously cool
like like key sweeper for instance you
know that is just a that is a cue device
if you ask me awesome yeah kisi Bertha
yeah it's pretty cool I mean it's just
like a very simple couple I mean
literally 10 to 20 dollars in parts and
you can sniff any unencrypted well
pseudo encrypted Microsoft Wireless
Keyboard and yeah 10 out of 11 of their
wireless keyboards could be sniffed with
this they since they've since updated
their keyboards to hold now have AES but
you know who knows that there's some
issues there right right okay cool well
everybody should subscribe everybody
should head over to Sam and FPL and you
do youtube videos as well so tell us
about your channel yeah so my channel is
called applied hacking or search Samy
Kamkar and yeah basically it's a taking
a lot of projects I started making
videos and I kind of go step by step I
you know I demonstrate whatever I've
created it's anywhere from like hardware
to software to 3d printing like a 3d
printed motorized Arduino based
combination lock cracker where you can
put a combo lock in under 30 seconds
they'll crack it for you and get people
to make stuff right and get people
actually produce stuff especially if you
are in the security or hacker mindset I
feel like there's a lot of breaking
going on but I think you get so much
more power and so much more
it feels really good it's really
intoxicating to then create something
that can do something else right rather
than just breaking it which is by itself
super fun it's a really cool puzzle
that's like the gateway drug that's like
the red box where it's like I don't know
how it works but I just soldered a thing
onto a thing and I got free phone calls
and it's like great that instant
gratification now you're hooked and then
the next thing that obviously leads to
is well how did that work and how do we
protect against that and what are the
mitigation factors and how do I automate
this battle make it better yeah yeah so
I'm so people get excited about that
stuff
that that excites me and it's really fun
to share that stuff and and then see
people come out with cooler stuff so
that always makes me really happy
because I want other people to make
really like take my stuff make better
stuff and then I can use that say me do
I can't tell you how excited I am to
finally meet you in person it seems like
the longest time coming because like all
of our like act 5 videos are always like
recommending your stuff and such so it's
