Equifax getting hacked an Android toast
notification vulnerability affects
almost all Android phones and that Linux
shell built into Windows 10 could hide
malware all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings I am Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for September 12
2017 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom if
you have not checked out our patreon yet
please do so we have lots that we want
to do for this show but we can't do it
without your support check out the page
over at patreon.com slash threat wire
that's the place to support the show
onto the news first off Equifax is one
of the three largest consumer credit
reporting firms in the United States
last week they publicly disclosed a
breach of data that affected 143 million
people which equates to 44 percent of
the u.s. population data exposed
includes names Social Security numbers
birth dates addresses along with some
credit card numbers 209,000 to be exact
and driver's licenses for some along
with dispute documents for around 100
82,000 people this breach also includes
data on some UK and Canadian residents
as well the hack occurred from mid-may
to July of 2017 with it being discovered
on July 29th and then them going public
about it on September 7th which was
Thursday the exploit used was via a u.s.
website application vulnerability but no
other information was given via Equifax
as postings about the incident and how
it happened technically Equifax has
offered free credit monitoring through
their product which is called trust ID
for one year for affected customers and
advised signing up on their third-party
domain to find out if you were affected
or not unfortunately though the
third-party site called Equifax security
2017 dot-com it was not entirely
forthcoming on whether or not you were
included and has tons of its own
complications so for starters when the
news originally dropped on Thursday some
customers who visited the site were not
able to determine if they were affected
or not the site would either say
you weren't affected or it would give
you this vague message that said thank
you your enrollment date is with a date
it did not clarify if you were actually
a part of the hack or not
second Equifax has terms a service
included wording that made it sound like
you had no right to a class-action
lawsuit if signing up this has been
clarified in writing since and now says
that it doesn't apply to the
cybersecurity incident also Equifax
security said 2017 dot-com was being
flagged on some browsers early on as a
phishing threat some customers were
seeing random results they would be told
that they were not affected only to
check on another browser and see that
they were affected
according to ZDNet writer Zach Whitaker
using tests and 1-2-3-4-5-6 as your last
name and the last six of your social
security number on the site the page
would say that you were affected this is
not necessarily surprising if they use
that information and testing the site
before it went live and they simply left
it there in the code for example other
folks tried random names with real
actual social security numbers and they
got varying results some said they were
affected some did not unfortunately
though if it is randomly telling people
to sign up they could mean that they are
trying to churn out a profit through
trust ID even if you weren't affected
another security researcher posits that
when creating a credit freeze on Equifax
the ten digit code a pin distributed
upon signing up is just a timestamp of
when you made the freeze Equifax has
stated on their site that the numbers
are randomly generated but in an article
for ARS technica they also said and I
quote we are engaged in a process that
will provide consumers a randomly
generated PIN we expect this change to
be effective within 24 hours a consumer
has an option and will continue to have
an option to change an existing pin the
requested new PIN is sent to the
consumer via u.s. mail to their address
of record and that was on September 11th
furthermore and a slight tangent
bloomberg reported on Thursday that
three senior executives sold shares
worth one point eight million dollars
total just days after the company stated
they discovered the phone
ability according to Equifax the
executives were not aware of the
incident at the time if the date of
discovery is July 29th and the selling
dates were August first in August 2nd it
definitely is very very suspicious
timing even if coincidence according to
the Securities and Exchange Commission
trading wall in possession of material
information not yet public is a huge
no-no Krebs on security has also
reported that sites were registered days
before the announcement such as one
called equi hacks calm by an employee at
mandiant security potentially to swipe
up any sites that could be used to fish
victims in the coming days
the company has stopped the hack but is
working with authorities to find out who
was behind it alleged hackers did create
a dark web site claiming to have the
info and stating that they would post it
on September 15th
unless Equifax paid them 600 Bitcoin
which equates to 2.5 million u.s.
dollars but this site also seems to be
just a scam Equifax is facing a
class-action lawsuit are ready for the
hack in a federal court in Portland
Oregon for seventy billion dollars in
damages how much is that per person
after legal fees it turns out it's a
little less than five hundred bucks yes
so that basically means your social
security number and all that personal
identifying information is worth around
$480 or so what really so what can you
do now that your data if you are a US
citizen was potentially in this hack or
even if you were in the UK or Canada you
can't enroll in trust ID through Equifax
a site which is free whether or not the
site says that you were actually
affected this will give you access to
copies of your credit report it lets you
lock your report it provides credit
reports from Experian and TransUnion as
well it also provides online scanning
for your social security number and
includes identity theft insurance
whether or not you were totally ticked
about the way that they are handling
this hack Equifax is free monitoring
it's it's a good deal
Equifax has also said that they don't
require auto pay for re enrollment at
the end of that one year but you could
always do so if you felt inclined to
purchase it at that time the next thing
you can do is check all of those credit
reports for any kind of fishy activity
and then freeze your credit with all
three major bureaus
we actually talked about how to freeze
your credit reports on my show tech
thing which I do with Patrick Norton
over at youtube.com slash tech thing
make sure to subscribe if you haven't
already we do tons of geeky tech reviews
over there as well as talk about some
security to for consumers it's super fun
the link is down over in the show notes
to that episode specifically as well as
the timestamp lastly you can also set up
a fraud alert and the FTC website has
info on how to do that so that is linked
below to also use good internet hygiene
that means don't click on weird links
even if they look legit use different
passwords for all your different
websites use different security
questions and answers makeup answers for
I mean that's what I do
use two-factor authentication and file
your taxes early next year so somebody
else doesn't get to them when you should
be filing them lastly if you are a
victim of identity theft go over to
identity theft gov slash assistant to
report it and get help linked to all of
that is also in the show notes
technically if you were a victim of
identity theft you can also change your
social security number but it's still
tied to the original and it's very tough
to do you have to go in person to the
office yada yada yada so I don't know if
you would do that or not
so what do you think that we should do
about social security numbers yourself
they have been used to verify identities
for decades now but given that they are
basically leaked by one hacker another
should they continue to be used in this
matter I have read the history as social
security numbers don't worry you don't
need to tell me about it in the comments
I already know about it I'm not going to
go into details here but you can look up
the history for yourselves I am asking
about the future so what are your
thoughts tell them below in the comments
researchers at Palo Alto Networks posted
on Thursday about a vulnerability that
affects all Android phones up to Android
Oreo which is the newest form of the
Android operating system that was
released just weeks ago patches are
available via this September 2017
Android Security Bulletin an attack
could use what is called an overlay
attack to gain control of the phone lock
it or steal information from it
explained in the blog post this attack
can occur when an application draws a
window over other apps on the device
which could trick a user into clicking
on something
when they think they're actually
clicking on something entirely else now
you could then download malware and you
could end up getting owned overly
attacks are not new they definitely
aren't we've seen them before but being
able to circumvent all the mitigation
techniques is definitely new this
specific overlay attack uses the toast
notification pop-up and it doesn't
require permissions to run it just
automatically runs on most Android
operating systems it will simply work if
a malware ridden application is
installed on the device researchers say
that it has not been used in the wild
unfortunately though unless you have a
phone directly from Google you will have
to wait for your carrier to push a patch
for the vulnerability Microsoft
announced a while back that you can now
use Linux applications in Windows 10
without the need for virtualization yay
this is great for developers and it has
come in handy for us given that we use
Windows for editing in Adobe Premiere
Pro and we often work as well in the
linux shell to test products and stuff
like that while researchers from
checkpoint Software Technologies
discovered that they could create
malware that was undetectable on Windows
10 by working inside the Linux CLI using
bash and of course they named it bash
where the malware bypass leading into
virus software Suites and it runs in the
windows subsystem for Linux or WSL for
short it tricks varying Linux apps into
thinking that they are communicating
with the Linux kernel instead of
communicating with the WSL which works
with the Windows kernel now to work a
user would need to have their computer
in development mode and wsl would need
to be enabled bash where could
automatically enable wsl though and then
download the programs needed
unfortunately no antivirus currently
checks these Linux processes though
through wsl through their programming
interface which is named Piko api to
coincide with the Piko processes that
these run on that those Linux ones are
running on according to Microsoft the
problem is low risk since it requires
the user to enable development mode bash
where could also be used if an attacker
was able to change a few registry keys
on a Windows 10 machine which could also
turn on dev mode so yeah there's a lot
of workarounds here the malware would
not need to be Linux only using wine it
could
also be a Windows malware that's already
been used in the wild and it could still
be hitting because the antivirus does
not check Piko api's luckily you are
probably ok if you use that good
internet hygiene I spoke of and you
don't have dev mode turned on as it
would require some previous attack that
already hacked your machine to work
