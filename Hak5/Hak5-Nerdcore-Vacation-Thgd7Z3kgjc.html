do I begin
so Darren got an automatic voice-message
system from US airways say that our
flight this morning begins homers last
night so he immediately calls US airways
and they say oh we're so sorry about
that because of weather and they direct
us onto a plane that only has two stocks
which would be like right sweet or just
one stop so we would have a two planes
you know that's awesome so we get all
the page and we are looking at the seats
this is after guaranteed haha we've got
to choose seats so we called him back
and we said hey there's no seats
available takes this works well he was
on the phone with them the site
refreshed as of somebody chose the seats
are ready for us so they got us all
together so that was good hung up the
phone printed off the e tickets my
tickets at flight coupon required I
don't have a coupon I have no flight
coupon nothing to staple to my e-ticket
WTF you know so we called him back and
they said oh actually those are just
vouchers that say that you might have a
seat on a plane if you get there maybe
we don't know for sure think pada
because apparently our tickets were fake
do you get big tickets that say you take
it other than mine does that flat apart
from US airways be calm don't understand
that so he calls them bag gets real
tickets this time you get to the airport
this morning our flight is delayed we
would be late for the second flight so
we have to get transferred over to a new
flight which has two stops and now we
are in Phoenix Arizona waiting for our
last flight to San Francisco actually
