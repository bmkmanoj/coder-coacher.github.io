midphase welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down the concepts tools
and techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Darren kitchen and
today today we're playing with Wi-Fi
everything you ever wanted to know about
channels and having a little bit of fun
with the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum analyzer
backtrack 5 Linux and a microwave first
it's time for the terms now in terms of
Wi-Fi a channel is merely a band of
spectrum I mean whether it's a B G RN
the basic idea is that it's a range of
frequencies that are allocated to a
channel and then separated from their
neighbor channels with just a bit to
typically just a few megahertz of what
we consider whitespace now so for
example in the case of 802 11 protocols
using the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum the
channel width is 22 megahertz wide and
then each of these channels or bands
with the exception of channel 14 are
separated by five megahertz of unused
spectrum so for instance channel 1 which
is centered at 2.4 1 2 gigahertz is you
know since it's 22 megahertz wide it
begins at exactly 2 point 4 0 0
gigahertz and then it ends at 2.4 to 2
gigahertz then channel 2 is at 2.4 1/7
gigahertz so it begins just 5 megahertz
passed with channel 1 started and then
this continues every 5 megahertz with
channel 3 centered at 2.4 to 2 gigahertz
and so on and so on until while channel
14 that is which has a 12 megahertz
spacing we'll get into that a little bit
more anyway as you can see there's quite
a bit of overlap so the general
recommendation is to use channels 1 6 11
and 14 as they're discrete that is to
say that they don't overlap each other
now channel availability is actually
regulated by country so here in North
America we're supposed to use channels 1
through 11 while the rest of the world
channels 1 through 13 and the Japan is
special because well their Japan so they
get all 14 channels now in just a bit
we're going to be breaking out an uber
tooth one backtrack 5 pop in into our
spectrum analyzer mode and then we'll be
able to see the channels in action but
first let's take a quick break
mid phase has been providing simple
smart and reliable web hosting since
2003
it features unlimited disk space and
bandwidth with an exclusive discount 6
months free for hack 5 viewers mid phase
provides 24 by 7 premium support by

free website builders and simple
installs of WordPress Drupal and Joomla
get $100 worth of search engine credits
from Google and Yahoo visit WWE das comm
/ hack 5 to get 6 months free of web
hosting through this exclusive hack 5
offer now I figured as a way to
illustrate the actual channels of our 8o
2.11 friends here and be fun to go ahead
and use what's called a spectrum
analyzer and we actually have just that
here at hack 5 this right here is the
uber tooth one it's a device built by
Mike Osman that we actually carry here
in our very own hack shop and it is a
development board used for all sorts of
fun in the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum this
is specifically for blue tooth analysis
and maybe even a little bit of fuzzing a
little bit of injection and stuff like
that but we can see the entire 2.4
gigahertz spectrum with one of these so
really in our case with Wi-Fi it's going
to show us the same kind of thing here
and thankfully mike has actually gone
ahead and put together a program just
for that which will visually represent
exactly what I'm talking about here so
I'm in backtrack Linux and I'm in my
uber tooth stuff and I've already gotten
it all set up and I see I've got this
Python script here that is spec scan UI
so if I actually do Python specs can you
i py and like we talked about here
there's actually a blank area at the end
of that and that right there those are
channels 12 13 and 14 which you aren't
supposed to be using here in the United
States in fact you can actually see
where they dip down and those are unused
channels from left to right it's
channels 1 through 14
if we were say deploying a new Wi-Fi
network here we might want to take a
look at something like this first they
kind of get an idea of what's in the air
and where we want to put our access
points now I've got the microwave here
or a fun little demonstration because
you I know you've been there you've had
that moment where you're like getting
your frag on or you're transferring
files and all of a sudden the bandwidth
goes to crap and like we talked about
the is M band and how it was for
industrial science and medical well
devices like microwave are designated
for those spectrum as well so while 2.4
gigahertz is great because it's
unlicensed and we get to youtube for
Wi-Fi we have to share it with this guy
an FCC part 15 says that we're not
allowed to interfere with it but we got
to accept any interference it makes to
us I'll back there anyway I know I know
I digress let's go ahead and start the
demo so I've got it here and you can see
the peaks and valleys of the different
channels that are being used and aren't
now if I just go ahead and make a
burrito yeah no good if I were actually
do like a packet or like a ping over and
over and over right now you'll actually
see like the pings will be like really
low and then suddenly like spike up
really high maybe even drop packets so
it's just a fun little example of what
happens here in the spectrum and if you
guys are interested in uber tooth so you
can find those over at hack shop calm
okay but before I get going it's time
for the giveaway you guys know that last
week I asked what 802 11 B channel is
only allowed in Japan an YouTube
commenter Mike pine gar answer to
channel 14 is the 802 11 B channel that
can only be used in Japan but only in
direct sequence spread spectrum or dsss
which is kind of hard to say mode and
the complementary code keying or C CK
modes so thanks so much for answering
look out for a direct message so we can
send you our favorite USB radio now this
week what I'd like to know is what 802
11 standard enables high powered Wi-Fi
equipment to operate with license in the
United States on the 3.6 gigahertz
spectrum answer in the comments in the
Arif
randomly selected to receive the radio I
use here on active and as always we
value your feedback and suggestions if
you have a tip to share with us email
may tips at hak5 org and be sure to
check out our sister show hack five more
great stuff just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your technolo
