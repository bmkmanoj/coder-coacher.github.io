CrashPlan I'm here at Def Con 2013 with
Jordan here from Rackspace who's looking
for everyone to come by and hack hack
him you want to get hacked well the ring
not me specifically I don't know well
that would go so we probably have to set
this up because we were both very lucky
to be to be wearing prototypes of the
ring
indeed the ring which on you I see if
it's a normal finger on me it's my
little sausage finger pinky so I'm not
wearing it on my pinky because I'm a
douchebag it's just the only finger it
fits on but I love this because I threw
it out on the show like last year I was
like hey you know be awesome if when
you're holding your phone and you've got
a ring right there it changes the
authentication mechanism maybe oh I now
trust that it's my owners hand so I only
want to swipe instead of a pin code or
things of that nature and lo and behold
and a meet-up in London guy comes up to
me he's like dude here's the prototype
so thank you because this is awesome
alright so tell me about the ring so far
I mean it's been really quite
interesting it's one of the first
implementations I've seen that actually
has some semblance of security on it
since it has both tags that are on the
same frequency like a long range read
you big it both bits and when we say
tags we're talking about this is NFC so
near field communications we're talking
with 16 megahertz I want to say it's
really low power and this is passive so
there's no battery inside of my ring
exactly which makes it really
interesting it gives there like a one to
two millimeter Reed range which is much
smaller than most cards things like that
because it's a special tag II designed
specifically for the ring so because
it's so small and so low powered and
makes stealing it basically be a contact
operation one of the hacks somebody
actually tried earlier was a little bit
of a relay which work great for cards
they could actually get it about six
inches but they weren't even able to do
it with contact with the ring because
there is so little power used in it so
so I guess the idea of the security here
is that you know you you need to wear
the ring it's your second factor of
authentication right exactly I would
never want to make something like your
primary factor of authentication but it
is definitely something that used to be
you know much more secure and then add
it with some lesser authentication
because you can store 144 bytes on it so
you can kind of play with
like one thing I'm playing with is
actually using the ring plus a one-time
pad on the phone - then like display and
encoded QR so you'd actually have to
factors through your ring and phone and
then be able to do visual login stuff
like that I think some things like
that'll be really interesting once you
see the Rings on the market because
right now you don't see a lot of that
because there really is no wearable NFC
stuff that is you know it all secured so
once that comes out and really
interested to see how that market goes
and now how is this more secure though
because it is readwrite somebody
actually came up to me at a party and
was like oh and started trying to
overwrite my ring so because right now
the way that it is is I can go up to
somebody's phone and if I hold it it'll
take them to you know Twitter comm so I
have five Garan and then on the other
side of the ring you just rotate that
guy there I can take them to say the
pineapple web interface or other fun
parlor tricks like that but the way that
I'm able to program the ring is with the
NFC ring app on Android and just touch
it to my phone and it programs to do
that so I'm at a party and some hackers
like oh and he reads it he comes back to
me and like thankfully my friend
Sebastian like no pulling my hand aside
because he's trying to put goatse on my
hand so it's because it's a physical
interaction right he had to been
basically holding your hand at that
point so caressing yeah sorry sorry
lovingly gently so because you have the
public in private side the public side
somebody which is what I basically
termed it but the public side somebody
could like sort of come swipe up against
you right but when you're using private
sites on the inside of your hand so
getting access to that is is not gonna
be something that's easily done I've
actually had somebody try to to slip a
little reader up inside of my hand while
I was just standing there but because
your hands sort of naturally curves it
touches your finger and your finger
jerks away so they have to have your
ring within a millimeter of their reader
or writer for about a second which at
that point you're basically if they
wanted it that bad they could just steal
your ring right but that's really
interesting that you mentioned that by
the way would you like a Red Bull oh
that's pretty close to your ring yeah so
but look at look at where it is so if
you actually see this it's when I hold
it when and maybe it's just me but it's
on the bottom you actually wouldn't be
able to get a read right there because
the tag is in the middle and I could
show you with my phone but mine's on my
index finger right so it's still really
specific they'd have to know exactly
where you were gonna hold it you're
right because when you even
you're just trying to do this on a phone
you have to know where the g-spot is
yeah exactly like on Maya
on my note it's literally it literally
has to be on the X which is a pro K so
that's the note 1 I have the note 2
where it's at the top yours is on the
battery it's right at the exit fits
within like even a quarter of an inch
outside of that I get no read so which
is in this case is actually a feature
exactly exactly and then anybody that's
tried to do any long range stuff they
haven't been able to get either the
other side through my thick little
fingers or because they're they're
getting both tags back so there is some
noise reduction that can be done but
it's one those things that it's a new
tack in a new market and I think this
will help sort of push that forward and
something I'm really interested to see
so I would love to see this bundled with
other kind of products as part of their
you know just as part of the norm
because once you start accepting like
second factor is you know I think this
is actually gonna do a lot for a second
factor if it can be sold in such a way
that this is such a fashionable hacker
accessory if you can start making like
Oh buy this phone and it comes with the
ring that unlocks it that could just
start opening people's minds to like oh
wait there's something other than me
entering in my password that I use on
everything right yeah it's it's a whole
new realm of wearable security
essentially which I don't really think
exists beyond like clunky RSA tokens
right stuff like that so it's it's an
entirely new market and hopefully he's
gonna service the Akram Ark with a
little bit I asked them to produce the
Rings with clear inlays so you can kind
of like show off your geek some stuff
like that so I'm actually really kind of
excited for both of those things
together I'm waiting for the NFC
Underpants because those are gonna be
huge yeah I don't know how much I'll get
to use them but you know I mean you just
got to rub your phone and anyway well
we'll leave that at that
and also times and with all of that I
want to thank you so much and hey you
know props to Rackspace for for ponying
up some cash for people to pone you I
mean you know not many big companies
would be willing to do something like
that on a whim right so it was really
cool all right we will see you more from
Def Con 2013 stay tuned
because I can't tell you how jazz I am
about our latest sponsors are now
passionate I am about backups that's
right I said backups are your backups it
should be private no like really private
none of this bogus like we store your
private key in the cloud you know we're
none of that you know we work with the
FBI to develop our cloud service kind of
nonsense I'm really sorry guys but no
privacy should be number one we're
talking about sound crimped crypto when
we talk about backups all the time and
this is why I'm so jazzed about
CrashPlan because get this they do it
right not only do they have a free
client that works on Windows Mac and
Linux and Solaris yeah I know right but
you can use your very own Blowfish key
you know that's that's the open source
cipher from Bruce Schneier so this way
nothing ever touches the network without
first being encrypted and not only can
you use the free client to back up to
your own external hard drive for free
but their secure off-site storage is
truly unlimited I know because I've got
like terabytes up there so as hackers as
geeks as IT pros we know the importance
of off-site backups and as hak5 viewers
get this we have a very special hook up
we're gonna huge discount on their
one-year unlimited plans they're
normally $59.99 a year but if you use
the special page over at CrashPlan comm
slash hack it up you're gonna get 20%
off that's unlimited backups for less
than four bucks a month it is never too
soon to back it up so I highly encourage
you guys to take advantage of this and
head over to CrashPlan comm slash hack
it up
that just about wraps up this week's
episode of hack 5 and nearly the season
in fact this right here and the you know
wraps up eight years of an amazing eight
years I can't even begin to describe to
you what's in my heart with all of that
I'm so glad that we were able to bring
to you a fun episode last week we got
such great feedback on that as of course
if you have feedback you've got some
stuff you'd like to see or want to let
us know what you think feedback at hak5
org is the address we hope you enjoy the
DEF CON coverage we had so much fun at
Def Con this year got big ideas for next
year and we're also looking forward to
wrapping up the season next week with
some fun stuff from hack Across America
also stay tuned for the dates on that
I'm heading out again and look how Boise
lookout Helena Elena Montana lookout
Colorado Denver where else going all
throughout New Mexico there's gonna be
back-to-back meetups in Houston Dallas
and in Austin maybe San Antonio as well
so you know look out Texas and yeah
thank you guys for making hak5 such a
huge success
thank you to revision3 for sending by a
gift basket of cookies for our eighth
year and with all of that reminding you
that next week Shannon will be back in
in studio we've got some cool stuff
going on at hack shop hhk shop comm
that's where you can support us directly
but with all of that I'm Darrin kitchen
I'll see you next week I'm gonna make
this thing go up ready here it goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
