and iOS sandboxes SI p installs get
popped with default grads and so my god
600 million vulnerable samsung devices
oh yeah and did I mention free
encryption keys for everyone it's coming
in a few weeks all that and more right
now I'm threat wire I'm Darren kitchen
and this is threat wire for Friday jun
19 2015 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom and pretty cool info SEC
research coming out of a slew of
universities titled unauthorized cross
app resource access on Mac OS X and iOS
others are reporting it as a zero-day
against the Apple operating systems the
researchers technology they're calling
at Zarah it's for the cross app resource
stuff that I just spoke about basically
it breaks out of the sand boxes that iOS
and OS 10 use that make sure that each
app can only read and write files of its
own so for instance if I'm like an angry
birds app I'm not allowed by the OS to
see I don't know some files you've got
in your Dropbox app it's really cool
it's great for security when it works
well with zero the team was able to
actually steal say for instance banking
credentials from chrome on OS 10 or even
the system keychain and all of the
iCloud tokens yeah what's more the
researchers were able to get get this a
proof-of-concept app actually approved
by apple in the App Store despite the
supposed scrutiny by Apple security
engineers the team actually contacted
Apple in October of last year and then
finally in February of this year Apple
asked for a six-month mum period well
times up there still no fixed good stuff
coming out of black hat in the
Netherlands gotta love the hackers in
the Netherlands this week security firm
ERP scan disclosed well a pretty common
practice that all IT administrators
should be fairly familiar with that's
right it seems that the vast majority of
installs of the essay p relational
database hannah they use all the same
master encryption key so if you're
wondering what the key is no it's not
password one with the capital p but it's
just as terrible to quote erp skin
according to our consulting services one
hundred percent of the customers we
analyzed still use the default master
encryption key using the staticky an
attacker could pull the credentials from
the hbd user store table and decrypt
them with ease ouch this epic gem of a
story is making massive headlines this
week and it's the sort of fail that I
really thought the industry had gotten
past so it turns out Samsung which
integrates the swiftkey keyboard uses
HTTP to update language settings over
the air what does that mean and how does
it make all of these devices vulnerable
well quite simply say if for instance
I'm the man in the middle between your
phone and the internet and I see that
your phone is looking to update its
keyboard settings and pull down new
language files I can pretend to be that
server and then send you malicious code
of my own instead of the legitimate
update why does that able to even happen
well because Samsung delivers the update
over HTTP not https so I don't even need
like a stolen key like in the kaprisky
hack from earlier in this week which by
the way like getting yourself a stolen
certificate authority and things like
that not so easy those are pretty much
like nation state level hacks not like
I'm gonna mess with your Samsung so it's
just making it really easy and what's
actually most worse here most worse
what's most wars here is that this
system update gets run as root it's its
system permissions so I could inject
some malicious code and then it would
run as is what Samsung just white white
sure run everything is root Samsung
finally I wanted to point out that the
let's encrypt project has a go live date
of sep tember 14th the project aims to
make https encryption keys free for
everyone so there's no excuse in using
the plain text HTTP you hear that
Samsung the service which is backed by
the likes of Mozilla Cisco and the eff
will issue its first certificate key in
late July as a test and they've
developed a pretty slick set up so I'm
sure we're going to be talking about
this even more as we get closer to the
launch now before I get going I want to
give a huge thanks everybody supported
the relaunch of this show patreon calm
the right wire that's the place where
you can kick us some change if you're
feeling generous and there you can find
out about the adorable pups that are
being featured here maybe even get your
own up there and we're going to go ahead
and continue this three times a week
rotation with patrick norton Shannon
Morse myself and as we try to ramp up
production so thank you for your support
I hope that you will continue to help us
keep this completely independent in ad
free I can't begin to tell you how
heartwarming it is to do this again if
you can't donate a like a share a
subscribe all that goes a long way too
and you can find all of our past
episodes links who are social networks
and all that other good stuff over at
threat wire net with that I'm Darren
kitchen and I'll see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
