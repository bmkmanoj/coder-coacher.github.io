farming
hey everybody welcome to this episode of
hack 5 I'm your host Matt let's knock
i'm darren kitchen for those of you who
haven't seen the show before we are a
show focused on everything from systems
administration to white hat and black
hat hacking and all the way on the other
side of the spectrum we also cover
hardcore gaming if you've got a gig
you're gaming on when you're hacking a
little break there well you know you
goes hand in hand some fun time dude
first episode fourth season who stoked
about that i can't believe we've been
doing like almost four years four years
in our first show on a revision3 want to
thank everybody at red 3 for having us
rep 3 is awesome they've been so great
to us yeah and it kind of reminds me of
like ok so we've got a show coming out
this Monday that hopefully you're
watching on the Showtime on September
8th we're also have a show on September
10th that Wednesday so you know yeah two
days and then you're more technical and
then we will be coming to you guys every
Wednesday at hack 5 dot org or
revision3.com and it's kind of like that
old joke in the freighter I think it was
like a third fourth episode of the first
season we're like you know yeah you know
for 10 bucks we'll come to you every
Wednesday yeah not so much when the 10
bucks but here we are finally you know
every week every week so what Darren
what do we got going on this well monix
has joined us and he's gonna be talking
about an open-source tool that you can
use to do a little bit of forensics and
a lot of intelligence gathering that's
gonna be really fun and Shannon you're
doing some gaming yeah I'm gonna tell
you guys all about this game call to
audiosurf it's awesome you can put your
own music into the game I'll tell you
all about it later yeah here's some Pro
no bodø coming up box the CDs under
that desk need to giveaway definitely
awesome and I'm gonna be having fun with
pineapple yeah that's a monstrosity it's
actually a double decker pineapple and
I'm gonna show you how we can go down to
the coffee shop just like the good old
days and own some noobs on the wireless
with a pineapple all right well without
further ado guys thanks for checking out
hack 5 and hope you enjoy the show hey
what's up guys I'm down in Colonial
Williamsburg in front of my favorite
coffee shop with a laptop and a
pineapple and I'm totally owning the
wireless network so let me tell you
about this right last time we were down
here is with Harrison in the first
season and
we're doing some art cache poisoning and
some man-in-the-middle attacks on the
wireless victims if you will I mean any
time you put coffee and Wi-Fi together
it becomes a target-rich environment but
the problem with that is we were owning
noobs on an individual basis and it's
kind of a chore so what's happened is in
conjunction with mobic sand this guy
named Robin wood we've put together an
awesome tool that allows us to call the
herd and make them come to us
so who were owning in in totally a
different aspect now what we did was is
I mentioned you know this idea to to
move because he has the same idea put
something very similar together and he
says that it's totally possible and you
can do it with this thing called Karma
the thing is Karma's a bitch right so
getting it on the Fond not so easy
that's where Robin comes into place I
met this guy Robin wood at shmoocon last
year
totally elite hacker and I'm not being
sarcastic
so I shipped him out of fawn over in the
UK and he's gotten bad Wi-Fi on the
thing running and it's beautiful so what
we've done is taking this pineapple here
and if I show you what we have here is
we have a battery pack and we have a
fawn router and we have some fun packets
okay
so what this thing does is basically
exploits the way that typical Mac or
Windows PCs work with their wireless
access so let's put an example together
say like you've got a Windows laptop and
at home you have like a netgear wireless
access point and say you work from micro
shop so at your office you have
Microsoft corporate Wireless right well
the thing is when you turn your computer
on at a cafe like this the first thing
it's gonna do is say Oh am i at home is
my net here here so it sends out a probe
request right well this guy's picks that
up and says oh yeah yeah that's me
are you looking for the Microsoft
corporate network that to me as well and
it just lets some join this network and
of course we're in the middle of this
whole time and the beautiful thing about
this that's that's the Karma part the
beautiful thing about this gasps occur
that's the code name for the project is
jasker it's German it means a yes-man
because that's what this guy does it
just says yes all day is that
it's got this ajaxy interface so I can
log in here with my laptop and see the
noobs as they join and see the MAC
addresses and I get a little drop-down
that lets me do any cool thing to them
okay so right now you know it's pretty
basic you know just DHCP get them
associated with the access point all fun
and games and then maybe I just sit in
between and fire up Wireshark or maybe I
want to take a step further so that's
the fun thing about this hack is that we
can build on it completely so we can
take it to the next level maybe we can
use upside down turn it and turn every
graphic on a webpage upside down for all
the noobs on the coffee shop or maybe we
want to be able malicious and not you
know fire up Metasploit and see if maybe
they don't have all the latest windows
patches that would really be a shame
because you never know I mean these
could be corporate laptops here and
they've all said yes yes that's my
access point I'd like to join it so so
you know big thanks to Robin wood for
helping put this together and Moe bik's
definitely and we will actually be
breaking this guy apart next week we're
gonna open up the pineapple and show you
how to put together your own Fon router
with this code and hopefully you know
releases so that we can extend it some
more make it do much more cooler things
then later this month we're going to be
at torque on and hopefully speak with
Robin wood about the development of this
thing I'm really excited about all the
possibilities with this pineapple and I
hope you guys will stick around for next
week when we open it up and talk about
the Wi-Fi pineapple part to installing
yeah cigar okay a pineapple
it sounds great you know I'm really
excited about torque on in San Diego
what are the dates for that Darren we're
gonna be there September 26 through the
28th in San Diego at torque on it's
gonna be a lot of fun yeah so since
we're gonna be there why don't you guys
follow us on Twitter we'll give out some
hak5 schwag will tell you guys where
we're at during the tour tour con and
I'm definitely really excited to meet
this Robin what guy who is this guy
Darren well I met Amit shmoocon last
year and we've just been conversing over
email and like I said I sent him a Fon
router and this guy's like seriously
elite hacker
he's mad Wi-Fi well yeah I mean he's
he's down with the Linux kernel we could
say okay yeah very cool stuff totally
stoked about that
so trivia this month this week

trivia is what is the name of the
graffiti established in 2002 and
typically drawn in chalk in public
places that signifies the presence of
Wi-Fi instead of doing our usual email
answers like we used to do and why did
we stop that Darren okay so basically
we've still got people emailing us from
like season one and season two trivia
questions and that means you Brian come
on let's just put it on the forums I
must have like at least 500 different
it's a great pause machine okay yeah
enough is enough
so be the first one on the forums and
then everybody will know it's already
been answered exactly so you'll get some
free stuff and you get props in public
yeah yes that's exactly what we're doing
well actually put out a brand new thread
it's going to be the trivia thread so
the first person that answers the
question correctly for that week we'll
send you a PM asking for your address
and for your name and we'll send you
some hack 5 swag possibly some stickers
something else who knows it might change
up we'll figure that out next we're
gonna go to move except multigo it's the
source intelligence open source
intelligence and forensics tool but
first we're going to give you a quick

hey what's up Rob how's it going doing
awesome thanks for coming down for the
first shoot no problem I'm excited so
we're gonna talk about melty go yeah
last time we talked about melty go it
wasn't even named melty go know is
evolution before now so okay so for the
people that are new to this completely
what smell - yo
so multigo is an information gathering
tool basically and what it does is
correlate that data just like it's it's
nothing more than really Google searches
at this point but it's a lot more
powerful than that okay so it's like
google searching on crack
but what what do you really use it for I
mean this isn't just ego searching no
this is information gathering - every
level - - military Intel okay so if
you're like on a penetration test or if
you're just trying to find out weird
stuff you never knew about your
girlfriend or your social security
number online okay do some other
examples like checking out like possible
employees you know if you're an employer
and you're like who's this guy right you
take his email address and throw it in
while Tegan and it go so you tell me
that there's there's new versions of
melty go since we last talked about
right we're a 2.0 right now okay
there's different editions right so you
got the full-blown Edition and then you
have the Community Edition Community
Edition has a lot of constraints to it
where it has a 15-second wait time on a
splash screen and a couple other things
that kind of constrict how you use it
but it's still quite usable and very
nice to have and three great well what
are we are we in the pre version right
here no we're in the full-blown version
okay full blown version and you can find
this built into what backtrack now the
community vision is built in to
backtrack sweet so what are the really
nifty new features that are in this so
I'm sorry going good so some of the
nifty new features is the transforms are
now no longer just built into the
application itself they can add
transforms there's a whole framework so
you can add that right but out what is a
transform for the people that are like
transfer that thing so a transform is
basically an API call and it's it can be
an in-depth API call so something that
goes
from nine different api's on nine
different sites like the social
networking one okay so uh so okay an API
an application programming interface
right so for example the way I'm
understanding this is that the social
network transform queries different
social networking sites so like Facebook
MySpace LinkedIn all of which have open
API is that you can use to do searching
and this integrates those api's into the
transform so you can type in someone's
name and then do a transform of social
networks and find out where they exist
all around the different internet tubes
and their different social networks so
say say I want to look up your email
address and see what other social
networks you're on let's take a look
alright okay so we started with a group
and a lot of people just put one thing
in but when you're doing Intel gathering
you want to put as much information as
you already know in there okay so we're
looking we're trying to do some
reconnaissance on me right on hack $5
1/2 I've got org so let's take a look
what do we have here so we have let's
start with the email addresses that we
know and here's some of the email just
as we know we have new bik's at hack 500
or dare and a hack five dot where's Paul
Matt all all these at hack five door
right okay we're all there and so we've
got mall selection so we all select them
and this is one thing that the community
version does not have is where you can
select them all and do it the transforms
all you have to do one end to do it okay
so the pay-for version you can do as
many transforms under many nodes as you
want but when it comes to the community
edition it's one thing at a time right
so even if I had 15,000 entities on a
lot more legwork right so we go in and
so these are all email addresses so
we're gonna say do transform from email
social networks to social networks cool
okay this is actually using wrap leaf
which is a social networking search and
now what we found is that you and I have
web presences so let's look in here and
we got Darren a heckfire org Darren
kitchen on Facebook to see the FB
okay and then Flickr sure and then also
on LinkedIn LinkedIn it kind of sorted
them incorrectly and we also have your
name which comes with app as a person as
entity as a person and then you can
continue on from there
it also has me on flickr linkedin
myspace and as well as my name so now
that we have these what other kind of
queries can we do with these so you told
me a little bit about pH I'm sana PHP
PGP queries right what is that so we
know what PGP keys are signing emails
right and we all have like public keys
like host my public PGP key on Darrin
kitchenette how does that as as you the
spy the super sleuth the penetration
tester here that's trying to hack into
hack five org how is that going to help
you so say I wanna I'm trying to
enumerate your users or people that are
part of that organization I want to go
and see if you signed any other keys so
if I didn't initially yeah my email
search on the domain didn't find or
Google search and whatever other until
I'm doing find other email addresses I
can use your PGP keys to find out who
you signed as well so if I find that
Darrin signed Matz key and I never had
Matz then you know that we must be
either professional sciences or fine
because you know there's the proof and
then it says that hak5 don't work great
right now what about metadata you're
doing some searches on the hak5 website
and you found some things where you
could do metadata search what's that
also metadata is things that are stored
in the additional to file like exif data
and user name and user names and host
names for word documents it's really
good for especially what like Word
documents and no pad okay I'm sorry
Excel doctrine so I see so I save a Word
document just a standard Microsoft
Office Word or PowerPoint document I put
it up on my website I'm like hey guys
take a look at this stuff
what's that metadata that you can find
within that so using multi goes
transform you'll find the specific
metadata that's looking for is user
names so now I have my words log on here
you were in this log on you use name and
sometimes it's even you can take it even
further and go okay this is their naming
convention so you can think and use your
mind to say this is probably his
username this is probably his region and
continuing on from there okay and that
would maybe help you with it like you've
already know what the person's kids
names are you know what their name is
their home address their phone number
you've got all this wealth of
information and then you find that word
document now you have their username so
then you call it by t department you're
like you've got write down need to do
some real social networks and social
engineering and with Facebook they have
your birthday kind of public now or they
used to within the exploit have your
birthday so now you have their birthday
as well so now you can call it credit
card information saying this is my
birthday
what about DNS you showed me a DNS brute
force which looked awesome right so DNS
brute-forcing is nothing new what it is
is basically guessing at your DNS names
or what other weather sites within or
subdomains you have okay so I've got
WWII FTP Dec 504 UM's Dayak battery or
wiki BBS noob whatever right and that
will give you other other sites to
attack basically or other information on
that and so you can continue on down
those roads as well mmm-hmm and also
with this you said that you could find
an IP address and then from just that IP
address find out like maybe it's a
shared web hosting service yeah what
other you know like I'm on dream host
for deer and kitchenette but there's
also a bunch of others that are all
right that does sound like an IP address
I can find out who they are so maybe if
you couldn't hack into Darin kitchenette
you baby how can a neighbor's and then
just continue on from there okay cool so
what are some of the new things that are
coming in melty go to point one so two
point one is coming out in the near
future hopefully that's still in
development but local transforms and now
right now you're all the transforms that
you're doing are through the API keys
that
well the Technorati ones are are your
own but all the other transforms use
khakis that pateros okay because it
takes a while to register as a developer
and all these other things to get an API
key first but it's not as easy as
getting like a Google Maps API key where
you just sign up with a valid email
address and you wait some time and you
have it right so in two point one you'll
have local transforms which means you
can be completely off the internet and
use these transforms so some of the ones
I've used before our Active Directory
and SharePoint so do you so Active
Directory if I'm doing a penetration
test and I'm inside the network somehow
and I do a actor Berkeley calls with new
authentication you crawl somebody's
sharepoint server and their Active
Directory and you know I got all
goldmine of right information there
especially considering data all the
metadata yeah I hear ya wow this is a
great piece of software for anybody
that's looking to do you know and not
just penetration testing but I mean if
you want to take it the social aspect
it's just you know a treasure trove of
information for anybody that's trying to
use some social networking definitely
now how can you use this maybe you know
to step up the paranoia about yourself a
little bit and and I'm a little
concerned about my privacy maybe I'm a
little concerned that my puttan my cell
phone number might get you know leaked
or something how do I you know use this
tool to protect myself rather than you
know go bracelet all your systems so my
system let me know I would never turn
move it come on what do I look like III
know that I could never get in through
sis I wouldn't never alright so a friend
of mine just for an example a friend of
mine
I showed him revolution when it was
still called evolution and we looked up
his email addresses and stuff like that
and he came across some interesting data
on Craigslist
he's never posted a fake six doesn't
even have an account but he found that a
friend of his has used his him as a
reference with his social security net
full social security number and and his
date of birth and email address in his
craigslist post to get a job Wow
so I you know obviously contact
Craigslist on today exists got it
removed yeah that's scary stuff so I
think I never know who so if I wanted
your friends list information yeah yeah
my friends right what great friends you
have both my social yeah so where can I
go
download this so I can search for my
phone number and my social and all that
other stuff so backtrack 3 actually has
the community version built into it and
you can just remote exploit right organ
Mona explained org so you can if you
already have backtrack just find it it's
in the information gathering menu
options and then if you want it on
Windows Linux or Mac OS you just
downloaded it off of Patera org tariffs
dorg and of course you have an excellent
article at your own website that talks
about a lot of the more in-depth stuff
that we couldn't drill down into this is
something that you are very interested
in definitely check out mobic site room
360 studio comm room 362 comm and this
is something that you guys are really
interested in let us know we can drill
deeper into this and and take just
little chunks of it and go into that for
a full length segment in the future one
thing I forgot to mention was there's a
new there's a new set of transforms
coming out called pts and pts is the
penetration side of it ok tuning so one
of these coming out those are coming
also in development for 2.1 great we're
gonna have it there in the full version
gonna have two you have you come back
and show us this penetration test and
transform definite two-point move this
thanks so much for coming on and I think
we're gonna check in with Shannon now
and see what's going on the land party
Shannon Thank You Darren so this month
we're having a LAN party and it's
getting sponsored by Netflix and Netflix
is awesome so I suggest it to anybody
Netflix is sponsoring our show as most
of you know Netflix add Netflix you can
rent over 90,000 titles online including
lots and lots of blu-ray titles with
free shipping both ways to your home and
back they have over 40 shipping centers
so almost all deliveries happen in one
business day the Netflix plans start at
just $4.99 and as a new member and a
hak5 fan you can get a no-risk
two week free trial membership so check
it out at WWF flexkom slash hack five
and please don't forget the www so this
month's LAN party is counter-strike
source and I am super excited I don't
know about you guys but I kind of own
and counterstrikes so I'll probably be
making a noob out of Darren are you
kidding me my p90 I'm just gonna walk
right through you holding the trigger
290 and 4p nineties what do you do would
you do silence um what are you wrong
hello a k47
oh all over the place come on pray and
pray anyway whatever oh please my so
what we won't judge we won't judge yeah
so what are the dates on that that's
gonna be September 20th and we're
filming the next episodes all that day
so we'll probably be streaming this
online at hak5 org and you can join up
at our server at game dot hak5 org as
well so i'm going to be doing this
really cool gaming segment about
audiosurf but first first I'm gonna have
Darren do this really cool utility for
you yeah I wanted to talk to you guys
about this really neat utility that I
found recently when I was having to fix
one of my users pcs and it's one of the
Bane's of having people run as
administrator' and then they got crap
and then I'm trying to you know clean up
a PC I'm Clint trying to clean up a
spare really from some other user that
turned it in anyway long story short I
got like a laundry list of all these
things I need to do and aside from the
regulars like CC cleaner they should be
using there's this neat utility that I
found called glarey utilities and as you
can see here it's really simple to set
up you just install it and and then you
you know good to go some of the
utilities in here the one that I find
that the most useful is this batch
uninstall utility so here we go it's
just like add/remove programs except you
can just go ahead and check all these
little punks that you don't want to ever
see again and it'll be gone so that is
my pick for the week that should save
you some time you can find that in the
show notes a hack five dead org all
right Shannon hey what's that what am I
talking about anything that needed to
thank you Darren and you need to what
walk over there or we're gonna just be
over there just just just be over there
just so what do we got today Shannon we
have audiosurf it's basically this
musical game where you're running down
the frets of a guitar hero guitar okay
that's pretty much what it is thats
collecting blocks easy stuff I like that
yeah it's very easy it's a
really really casual game for like if
you're coming home from school and then
you're going to work in a couple of
minutes you want to sit down and play a
game for a few minutes
you have audiosurf I think the best
thing about this game is that you can
upload your own songs from your own
collection whether it's you know iTunes
whether it's an mp3 whatever you want
and it creates the track but yeah than
that yeah exactly it creates the track
to the rhythm of that song okay all the
beats go along they correlate correlate
with the different bricks mhm and you
have to pick up the bricks that are the
same color in the song that gives you a
bonus and if you run into the wrong
color brick like a grey brick in this
version right then you get negative
points and that's no good we don't want
that no great breaks are bad
yes so we can import our music the
gameplay is really simplistic it's very
like that and is there a demo or
anything that we can download yes there
is I actually don't downloaded the demo
from steam steam of course everybody
uses it already this game is distributed
by valve right now and this the demo
version you can only play about five
different songs until it tells you that
you need to buy the full version but
since the full version is only ten
dollars why not
I mean it's addictive enough you're
gonna play it enough ten dollars you
can't beat that where can we go ahead
and get the game you can find this at
audio - surf comm or you can download it
straight from Steam alright well I will
let you get back to your game because
you seem obviously obsessed with yes I
need those bonus points and I'm gonna
head over and talk to Derek all right
have fun
thanks alright so that just about wraps
up this episode of hack 5 but before we
get going there's a couple other things
we need to talk about first of all got
to thank mu bik's / a room 362 comm for
coming down and talking to us about all
that the fun forensics and investigation
software we need to remind you guys that
we will be airing again this Wednesday
September 10th so if you're watching on
the monday two days later you get some
more technological in here talking about
some some fun stuff reverse engineering
thank you no problem it's you know it's
written in front of me but whatever
exactly

good base to number yeah Beck's
is the number one german export beer no
there's this this key here this is
symbolic some way yeah it's a and I kind
of graphic basically it's from the coat
of arms of the founding city Bremen
Germany and it says it right on the
label so that's actually helping me a
lot but the one great thing is Beck's is
launching a new campaign is called the
Becks Key Club that it's open to all
Beck's drinkers and you can go there the
access to special events exclusive

Bex and to Shannon her very first day on
the show a big round of y'alls
thank you thank you yeah it's great and
look forward to more segments there's
one thing one more thing that we want to
mention yet is hak5 stickers and other
swag
so go to hack 5 dot org slash stickers
we're also going to be putting together
a bunch of different packages the
ultimate hack 5 swag bag okay so
basically everybody that's donated for
the stickers between like when the house
flooded and now has really helped us
rebuild and build the season for studio
so we want to thank you all and we want
to put together a big swag bag for like
a limited thing like maybe like a
hundred of them that will you know sign
and sell and hopefully get us to the
next level which is I don't know if
you've noticed the quality of
standard-def not so much anymore we're
gonna show you get we're gonna put
together a special DVD that's got like a
behind-the-scenes of how this crazy
rat's nest works it's it's mainly just
splitters and adapters and composite
cables and then so so help us help you
basically when we go ahead and sell
through the hundred ultimate swag bags
what we can actually do is we can
actually purchase our mixer so all the
donations that go to the stickers into
the swag bag go directly toward the
purchase of our HD I've already
purchased our cameras there were some
awesome inexpensive Panasonic
consumer-grade stuff that got component
out I mean we're doing this on the
hacker level but it turns out that HD
mixer still in this day and age it's
super expensive but we need to get there
because the screen captures need to be a
lot better we know that we want it to be
and you know I'm gonna go ahead and toss
in and let you guys know that if you get
us there we'll have like a little little
meter showing you how our progress is

makeup so you can watch him on the show
