sail university alright guys let's talk
about some wireless routers specifically
the 802 11 AC new wireless routers that
are just coming out to consumers this is
an updated wireless protocol for 5
gigahertz frequency bands it can offer
throughput of one gigabit per second and
it offers 80 megahertz channel
bandwidths on the low end and that's
just the low end yeah it can get really
really fast now it enhances your
wireless speeds around your home from
multiple HD streaming for online rapid
backup so for example if your friends
watching Netflix and you want to watch
Netflix to on your computer both of you
guys can stream some nice HD without
having any problems with streaming or
buffering and online backups can be much
much faster than n ng routers now an AC
router is going to give you much faster
speeds for both n and AC clients on 5
gigahertz AC is backwards compatible
with n so you can replace your n router
right now with an AC router and you're
not going to see big difference unless
you have support for 5 gigahertz
frequency now this one the esis RT AC 66
you I believe it is called let's see
attitude 11ac gigabit router AC 66 you
oh yeah that's correct alright so this
one is the upgrade from the n 66 you
asus router and it offers or osos and it
offers about a thousand seven hundred 50
megabits per second speeds or about 1.3
gigabits per second and that's a nice
little boost of speed it's got all your
different ports on the back of course a
couple of USB ports power and you got
your little directional antennas little
got a 5 about 5 DB I think it is yeah
it's not too huge but you know you can
always upgrade it whatever so this one
costs about one hundred and eighty
dollars kind of pricey but in my mind
it's totally worth it now a 22 to 11g
uses 20 megahertz per channel or a 54
megabits per second 802 11 n uses 40
megahertz per channel and AC adds a lot
more spectrum it can take it up from 40
to 80 216 megahertz
channel that's a really big difference
from 40 and current generation Wi-Fi
these use close to the theoretical
maximum that you can transmit over radio
so AC just uses more of the channels at
the same time so it's kind of like Bruce
forcing its way through to get a ton of
faster speeds so to test this I ran a
couple of HD video streaming playbacks
on a couple of different laptops with
and without the adapters and I'm also
going to transfer a couple of files from
Paul's Mac to my Windows 8 laptop using
both my interior inferior Qualcomm
chipset it's a little bee gene and 802
dot11 Wi-Fi adapter as well as this
outside one which is a netgear a 6 200
Wi-Fi USB adapter for AC dual band it's
very very nice now let's check this out
so I'm on my little windows 8 laptop in
for anybody who's interested in this
it's a x202e hot pink thing I don't know
it's just something I've been testing
and so I'm going to go in here and you
can see i'm currently using the qualcomm
atheros chipset which is inside of my
computer and my outside one the netgear
a 6 200 is disabled so we already set
this up to be able to get into Paul's
machine I believe these videos are under
transfer yes so he already set it up
with a couple of different videos we got
a little one over here much larger one
that's like two gigs in size and then a
whole whole bunch of secrets I hope
these secrets are ok to give out Paul is
that alright alright they're fine so I'm
going to try transferring this large
file right now just with my interior one
just going to copy it onto the desktop
don't you love using the GUI interface
it's awesome nice thing about Windows 8
I will say is it gives you this nice
little graph tells you how many minutes
you got everything's right there for you
and this is going really slow 13 minutes
and who knows it might drop it might not
that's really bad and I know this it's
going to speed up a little bit during
the
middle of this and it might slow down
actually and then speed up a little bit
more at the end but overall it's going
to take about 13 minutes from my testing
so I'm going to close this that's going
to take way too long let's see about all
of these together actually I'll just do
the I'll just do this and peace all
right so that doesn't takes you too long
that's not bad at all 15 seconds big
deal alright cool and all three together
how does this do yes delete it's all
three together calculating about 14
minutes all right we got a good idea of
how long it takes to transfer over
regular BG and end speeds so I'm
transferring to point 0 less than 2
megabytes per second that's not good at
all close that all right and let's go
ahead and delete that extra file there
now I'm going to switch over from this
one to our new AC router and the little
netgear adapter that i have installed
previously on this little laptop all
right it should be automatically
connected yes ok alright great so we're
automatically connected to Morse code
which is the name of the router that I
made Morse code haha get it so I'm going
to go ahead and close that and close
this and on this new router I actually
have to use
his IP address for his mac which is
already right there I'm gonna go ahead
and connect to that log in alright so
first we did the large video file I'm
going to go ahead and paste that so now
we're getting speeds of Wow seven-point
about okay about six or seven megabytes
per second and it's only going to take
four minutes so that's less than half of
the time it would have taken with the BG
and a compatible adapter on the inside
of this machine that's awesome i love it
so that's not gonna take any time at all
that's great okay I like this already
all right now I'm gonna close that let's
do I'm gonna just do the pictures this
is probably just gonna be immediate
let's see okay yeah it's pretty much me
it all right that's awesome i love how
fast this thing is i need to get one of
these for everything all the things all
right now let's copy these and do all of
them at once still about four minutes
that's excellent okay now i'm going to
test out something else with this we
discovered with this little adapter it
can be kind of a pain in the butt
because you have it turned one way and
you'll notice the speeds averaging about
5.7 or so 5.7 megabytes per second now
if i turn it around which is closer to
the router sitting over there it's
pointing straight at it so we get nine
nine megabytes per second just about
definite change in the speed that's
crazy so it's it's really directional
from what we've noticed but overall
pretty good speeds very happy with that
I'm totally okay with upgrading and I
think it's worth the money to do so and
i think i'm going to buy one of these
for my home now tell me what you think
because i want to know if you guys have
already upgraded to AC and what your
plans are with all of this because they
can do plenty
a of nice little features and upgrades
stay tuned because in just a bit we'll
be getting into your feedback and some
trivia but first let's take a quick
