by hack 5 and viewers like you
support us directly at H a k shop comm
hello and welcome to pineapple
university i'm darren kitchen and in
today's video we're going to talk about
infusions and specifically updating them
up until now we've been getting our
pineapples started hardware-wise getting
our firmware flashed connecting our
clients to the internet through our
Windows or Linux machines and now I'd
like to take a moment to actually dive
into this web interface and start
talking about the different infusions
that we have so for us an infusion is
really a module that brings some of the
functionality that under the hood mind
you this is a very powerful embedded
Linux machine brings that to the
forefront through the web interface that
allows us to quickly and easily do some
pretty advanced attacks so here we see
our our 8 main infusions these are
system infusions and these are some of
the most underlying ones that kind of
run the stuff we can see our resources
we can get into the networking but
there's also an entire you can think of
it as a marketplace of infusions that
you can go ahead and download
over-the-air to add more functionality
to your Wi-Fi pineapple and the first
thing that we ever want to do when we
set up our pineapple is to actually
check for any updates just like you
would update your software on your
desktop you want to update the infusions
that you have on your pineapple so this
icon right here is going to check for
updates and I can see that there are
updates for these infusions here and if
I click into the pineapple bar and go to
available I can see I have updates for
these infusions so it's simply a matter
of clicking update infusion for all of
the updates available and that's it at
this point all of our system infusions
have been updated and if I go back into
the bar I can actually see it's not just
system infusions but I can add
additional functionality through these
community-developed infusions I just
scrolled down here we can see there's
lots of really good stuff and I think
I'm going to go ahead and download one
of these let's go with TCP dump this
right here is a web interface for TCP
dump I click install it's going to ask
if I want to install this to internal
storage or the SD card I'll choose the
internal storage as the free space
required is only seven kilobytes and I
have plenty available so choose internal
storage and it will download
over-the-air and now down here at the
bottom I have a new tile for TCP dump
and I can open up that there and
everything right here is ready to go as
far as going ahead and sniffing my
packets and saving them to a different
location and we can get more into usage
on that here soon but that's it for now
so head over to uni Wi-Fi pineapple comm
to find more lessons and videos like
these and of course I invite you to join
the community that's where we'll be and
until next time class dismissed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
