consumers 32 million total yahoo
accounts were hacked with that cookie
problem a few months ago and cloud pets
is really digging themselves into a
grave with this toy hack are they coming
up now on threat wire greetings welcome
to the show
I'm Shannon Morrison this is threat wire
for Tuesday March 7th 2017 your summary
of the threats to our security privacy
and Internet freedom this show is now on
iTunes as well as your favorite
podcasting app thanks to our patrons
over at patreon.com slash threat wire
make sure to subscribe and now on to the
news and of course we couldn't forget
about the FCC back in October of 2016
the FCC adopted broadband consumer
privacy rules that allowed consumers to
decide how data is used and shared by
ISPs the rule required ISPs to protect
the privacy of consumers and offer
transparency and security protection for
personal data because if you didn't know
ISPs basically know what you're doing on
the Internet
unless of course you take your own
precautions but that's a whole nother
segment in itself we reported on this
back in November 1st of 2016 on a threat
wire episode titled our hacker
counter-attacks legal at the time Pied
assented to the ruling now with the FCC
Chairman being a jet PI a temporary stay
has been made on data security
regulations the reason the FCC does not
want to impose different privacy
regulatory rules on ISPs then the FTC
does on companies like Google and
Facebook because the FTC basically makes
the rulings for companies like that the
state will remain in place until the FCC
comes up with new rules that better
mirror what the FTC has in place in the
meantime though there is no regulatory
guideline that consumer protection gap
that this stay creates when the FCC will
come up with new rules is yet to be
announced
now also in a speech at the end of
February payaso spoke about the FCC's
approach to zero-rating
which is basically a fancy term for free
data offerings for mobile carriers even
if you are on a limited data plan you
can still have access to certain sites
without them counting towards your data
if that
pays the mobile carrier some kind of
hefty cash according to PI's FCC it's
consumer friendly as even folks on low
income can access streaming and
entertainment on the other hand net
neutrality advocates disagree because it
is unfair to companies that can't afford
to pay for zero-rating on what looks
like a positive note though the FCC will
be voting on new rules allowing mobile
carriers to take a more aggressive
approach to scammers now in 2015 the FCC
allowed carriers to offer call blocking
services to customers and the vote on
March 23rd will further that action to
solve problems having to do with
scammers spoofing caller ID numbers
which can lead to cases of identity
theft or stolen funds so for example if
a scammer was to say spoof the IRS phone
number and then they say that you owe
money you could get your money stolen by
the scammer because you think that it's
the IRS go figure
now since 2.4 billion robo calls happen
per month according to a blog post by
agita
looks like this would be a good thing
but should we be worried about giving
mobile providers too much control over
which numbers can call you hmm I guess
it's yet to be determined in an annual
filing - the Securities and Exchange
Commission
Yahoo disclosed that 32 million total
user accounts were accessed since 2015
by hackers who were able to forge
cookies for these accounts to log in
without a password the company suspects
that this cookie hack which was first
reported back in December is tied to the
attack in 2014 of 500 million accounts
both are suspected of being
state-sponsored attackers in the report
Yahoo disclosed that 26 specific
accounts were targeted by attackers and
they were consulting law enforcement and
by the way that's on page 47 if you
really want to read through the entire
thing I'll be honest it's really boring
but that parts on page 47 no information
was actually given about what 26
accounts were targeted or why okay let's
talk about something a little creepy
more than 2 million voice recordings
along with 800,000 email addresses and
passwords were exposed by cloud pets
which is owned by spiral toys connected
stuffed animals that allow parents and
kids to make cute little voice recording
Steve
other so they can record their voice
with the pet saying I love you to their
parents and of course the parents can
reply we have heard of this kind of
problem before it actually turns out
that it was a public-facing MongoDB
database that stored all of this data
for anybody to find worse the database
required absolutely no authentication to
access it
Troy hunt of have I been pwned and
that's owned with a P comm with cents
Andina with the publicly facing database
and confirmed that it was the real deal
no one knows how many people had
actually accessed the information the
anonymous person who sent the data to
hunt did attempt to contact cloud pets
first three times with no responses
worse yet after some recon work against
the cloud pets mobile app hunt
determined that the profile photos and
voice recordings of these toys were
easily found via their Amazon s3 storage
links that's scary so cloud pets also
had no password strength rules which
while their passwords were encrypted
with bcrypt
easy super easy passwords like the
letter A or a B C etc they could be
cracked in no time because they didn't
say you had to have them over eight
characters you could just put in an A
and that could be your password it's
terrible and the story doesn't end there
either yeah it turns out several parties
access the Mongo database and even
deleted the databases while demanding
ransoms to be paid in bitcoins since
January 13th the databases don't seem to
be publicly accessible anymore but
parents were never ever notified of the
breach in several quotes by spiral toys
CEO Mark Myers it appears that the
parent company is not owning up to its
mistakes they denied being contacted
they denied evidence of the hackers and
so on and so forth
since cloud pets is owned by a company
in California spiral toys in California
has mandatory data breach reporting laws
as stated by hunt by sweeping this
breach under the rug it appears that
ignoring it in lying about all of the
proof might be severely illegal before I
go I want to give a huge thanks and a
big hug to everybody who has supported
