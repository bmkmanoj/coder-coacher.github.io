carbonite
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down the concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and IT
ninjas I'm your host Aaron kitchen and
today we're continuing our Wi-Fi series
with the example of cracking at WPA pre
shared key now as you guys know we
started by diving into PSK brute-force
with John the Ripper and a previously
captured four way handshake but since
then we've dialed it back and covered
promiscuous mode monitor mode in terms
of packet sniffing and how MAC addresses
come into play here well what I'd like
to do now is cover the ingredients we'll
need for this recipe of passphrase
cracking delightfulness so let's begin
with the terms now as I've mentioned our
wireless Nick is in monitor mode I can
do that by issuing airmon-ng start wlan0
snick can operate in the other five our
master managed ad-hoc mesh and repeater
now a wireless NIC in master mode is
often referred to as an access point or
a base station typically it's an
embedded device with a proprietary OS or
maybe just a slimmed-down Linux
installation set up to provide network
access to clients for example my
wireless of my Wi-Fi pineapple here for
instance is set up as an access point
and I can see this by going ahead in
issuing iw config a th zero it says
right here mode master now if I come
back to my local host and issue LS USB I
can see that I have my trusty ol real
tech 81 87 l installed and if I check
air driver tak ng loaded I can see that
I've got the Mac 802 11 drivers now with
this I know that I can use the iw
command to check the cards capabilities
and I just need to know the physical ID
first so running Ehrmann tak ng I can
see that my real tech here W LAN one is
pH y1 so if running iw
a PHY PHY one info it'll show me all of
its supported nodes yeah of course
that's a lot of output now typically
I've been piping this output to more or
less but today I'm going to pipe it to
grep now grep is just going to show me
what I'm asking for and in this instance
what I'm looking for is the word modes
now if I issue IW p hy p h y1 info and
then pipe that to grep modes if you'll
dam a CH but as you can see it's you
know it's I'm going to need a few lines
past that so for that I will tack on a 8
to see 8 lines following so once again
grep tack capital a 8 modes there we go
now it shows me that my card only
supports managed and monitor modes so
that brings us to managed interfaces and
managed mode also known as
infrastructure mode are considered the
clients or stations that is to say the
device is connecting to access points so
your laptop your Nintendo DS your iPhone
now to connect to my open access point
here I can issue IW config WLAN one mode
managed then i can issue IW config WLAN
1e SSID pineapple and if i check it with
IW config at w lan 1 i can see it here
that i've actually associated with the
access point pineapple and i can see the
access point bssid there now in just a
bit we're going to find out about the
last three modes and our special
giveaway but first let's take a quick
break
computer disasters eventually happen to
everyone your computer crashes gets
infected the virus you drop it there's
fire theft in Li and abduction but we
get carbonite online backup before your
disaster then no need to worry because
your files when we backed up
automatically and safely off-site and
it's really easy to get them back plus
you can get to them anytime anywhere
just access your files from a computer
or on your smartphone or iPad with a
free Carbonite app with Carbonite
unlimited backups for your PC or Mac is
just $59 a year
less than $5 a month but when you use
the offer code hak5 to start your free
15 day trial you get two months free if
you decide to buy all the details or
over at carbonite.com and remember to
use the coupon code hak5 to get two
months free with purchase now ad-hoc
also known as peer-to-peer is a mode
where wireless devices can communicate
with each other without a need for a
centralized base station or access point
this can be really useful for small
groups of devices in close proximity but
of course the performance will decrease
as the number of devices increase now
for all of the devices on an ad-hoc
network to communicate with each other
they all must assume the same ESS ID now
to set up my interface all issue i'll
see i w config wlan0 channel 1 ESS ID my
ad-hoc network and then mode add - hoc
ok so if i issue IW config wlan0 here i
can actually see there we go my ESS ID
is my ad-hoc network my mode here is
ad-hoc you can see my frequency there we
go
now I can tell here that my cell is not
associated that's because my radio is
the only one on this ad-hoc network I
know how sad well I would tell W LAN 1
to actually join wlan0 so they could
both party together but as we discover
just a moment ago WN 1 this guy here
only supports managed and monitor mode I
know at least the support monitor mode
now the next wireless mode is mesh you
can think of a mesh is sort of a planned
ad hoc network mesh networks or mesh
clouds are comprised of radios acting as
routers gateways clients and in a mesh
network nodes can communicate as long as
they all have at least one common
connection for example node a can talk
to node C if they're both within range
of node B likewise if a node were to go
down a mesh can actually heal itself by
routing through the other nodes and the
network okay we could probably do an
entire series on mesh networking itself
but suffice it to say that's the jist
now our final mode is repeater a
wireless interface in repeater mode can
be configured to connect to a wireless
network and then repeat the signal the
practical application here is to extend
the range of a single access point all
right now before I get going I want to
pose a question here with an O UI of
zero zero zero four see who's the
manufacturer of this USB Wi-Fi adapter
be the first to answer in the comments
and we'll ship it to you all right and
as always we value your feedback and
your suggestions so if you have a tip to
share with me email tips at hack 5 org
and be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 for more great stuff just like
this I'll be there reminding you to
trust your techno lust Weldon the hat
tip you know actually let's not do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
