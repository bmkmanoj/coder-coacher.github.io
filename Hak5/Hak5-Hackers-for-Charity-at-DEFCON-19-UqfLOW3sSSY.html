by the ben heck show track 5 i'm darren
kitchen at def con 2011 with a man that
needs no introduction Jenny long how are
you my favorite xpad / charitable man of
all sorts of hacker goodness right good
to see you man yeah too long yeah so
what's what's been going on in in gonda
um lots of malaria good place to start
had my first bout of malaria that was
absolutely no joke Wow it was uh it's
like the was like the worst flu ever had
well I'm happy to see you here healthy
yeah yeah healthy as you can be in vegas
right yeah well they you know it's good
to see you back in states at the cons
promoting all the great stuff that
you're doing with i hack charities and
of course everybody that watches hak5
knows about the organization but there's
been some cool changes so i really want
to get an update on on all the new
developments sure sure yeah you guys
have been really cool supporters i mean
through the years so thanks for doing
that of course so this has been kind of
a year of learning we figured out a lot
of stuff we did a lot of things wrong
and learned from them we're doing a we
have an internet cafe and a restaurant
in Uganda which is called the keep yeah
and it's it's proven to be a really good
way to meet expats and meet tourists and
meet organizations that are doing really
cool work on the ground you know we
serve american food cheese burgers and
milkshakes stuff that you can't get
anywhere else and it's it's really
become like a hub of activity where we
get to plug into all these projects that
are coming through you're gone to find
ways that we can help them that's one of
the most important things we're doing
right now is coming alongside
organizations that are doing good work
giving them a hand you know you get you
get a team of volunteers that comes over
for two weeks they want to work with
kids or working in the villages they're
working in clinics they all come with
their your MacBooks in their eyes and
their iphones and everything they're all
hyped up plug it into crappy Ugandan
power and next thing you know you got no
laptop oh well suddenly it's like all
your work comes to a standstill you know
they're used to blogging every day and
talking their supporters
they're off the grid we help them out
you know we do hardware repairs we help
them with their internet stuff and it's
kind of its kind of menial work you know
it's not super high-tech but it's
absolutely critical to the work that
they're doing it's honorable stuff too
so what's what's your latest initiative
what are you doing with the hacker
community well one of the things that
we're going to launch tomorrow you guys
actually get an exclusive so yeah thank
you haven't talked about this yet it's a
it's an initiative called InfoSec
Without Borders it's kind of a play on
dr. ok you know how does it work the
idea is pretty straightforward we have
lots of volunteers that want to do cool
work we've had no way to do it what
we're doing is we're offering a way to
do it ok we've got some corporations
that have signed up that said hey we're
willing to pay for man-hours for our
employees to do work for charities so
what we're going to do is we're going to
use that as one piece of it but we also
have a mechanism for volunteers that
aren't working so that they can do
things like security scans we have their
work done through a proxy the logs are
actually going to be analyzed afterwards
to see if they did anything crazy ok so
if you're a pen tester for an
organization or if you're just a
freelancer and you've got down time you
want to donate your time get some gain
some experience and do something
charitable how do you get involved and
and how do you hook those people up with
organizations and what organizations
that that need that kind of pen testing
work there's so many we focus on the
small organizations the big
organizations have budgets they can they
can properly hire an organization come
in do the stuff we focus on smaller ones
and we really like the ones that are on
the ground then you gon dower can
actually see where the money is going
yeah if you work for a company and
you're doing work already in the infosec
field the way that you approach this is
you work with your company and say hey
we've there's a really cool organization
would you be willing to donate some of
my work hours to help out that's how you
approach if you're an individual and
you're not working you come to us as a
volunteer but either way the place that
you check it out is infosec Without
Borders org nice Johnny it's so great
sue I love getting the updates on all
the great stuff you guys have been doing
this tremendous work via charities for
coming on like five year
five years yeah good it's a pleasure
seeing you also grant yeah thnkx
