go further with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
from showstoppers at CES 2013 and I'm
here at the silver lit Toys booth with
Jessica and Jessica you have these
adorable little what are these alien
creatures they are rocking aliens we
call them the rock the rock lions they
each play music how do they play music
well I can turn them on and with my
hands when I wave on top it will trigger
its music and when I let go here it goes
into a little solo mode so you'll hear
him sing along that's cute so I'm
guessing because this guy is holding a
it looks like a guitar he plays guitar
correct he's are actually our main
character the lead guitarist here he's
very cute now how much do these cost by
themselves they will cost $9.99 each
okay and these also run with some kind
of application - yep
so we are developing an app and you're
developing this with creativity eat
correct creativity Inc correct so when I
put him on the app the app recognizes
that he's there and I can bring him into
the game and he'll interact with you and
comment along while you're playing now
does it do something different for each
character is it pretty much the same
storyline in the application well each
character has its own planet so we can
enter we can bring in to any character
into anybody's planet but each character
comes with its own special powerup oh
that's cool so it's kind of a different
level for each one correct show me a
little bit of this demo right here
alright so we'll go into the game here
and it's a music rhythm based game so as
I'm playing he's coming to me along on
how all I'm doing okay so your level
level goes up at the bottom depending on
like how many times you hit the donuts
and whatnot now is there any extra
things and oh you just got another what
did that do
so this activates this bonus minigame
that's only available if you have the
toy okay so it's definitely beneficial
for your
or whoever you're buying this for it to
definitely get the toys correct you get
so much more added gameplay and features
with the toy he unlocks special content
special minigames is just so much fun no
it's this just available for the iPad
and are there any other apps this app
will only be available on the iPad to
start but we do have another app that's
out now available free on all iOS
devices and that one is called broccoli
and stock-out oh that's so cute I'm
definitely looking forward to checking
these out I'm kind of an Angry Birds fan
myself so I could totally get into this
and play some games and just waste all
of my time instead of doing things like
conventions this is excellent thank you
so much now what is this going to be
released and where can I find it the
toys will be released in fall 2013 and
the apps will be available on Apple
excellent thank you so much I'm looking
forward to checking them out and you can

zinc is about helping keep you connected
while on the go one of the most useful
features of sync is its ability to
control what you listen to and sync app
link gives you the power to control apps
like Pandora and slacker radio with your
voice sometimes don't listen to your own
tunes well sync makes it so easy it
gives you hands-free control of your
music files for your digital music
player USB Drive or other compatible
devices and even better if you ask it to
play similar music sync even uses your
own tunes to make a playlist thanks
again to Ford for powering this hack 5
