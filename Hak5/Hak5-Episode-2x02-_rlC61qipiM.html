build your own network attached storage
box on a Windows box in a matter of
seconds with the USB key and build a
hacker cocktail cabinet the Westway all
that bolla excellent place this time on
hack point five
okay so we've got a power-packed episode
once again for you this is season 2
episode 2 so you're stuck with us for at
least another hour yes and of course I
am Darrin kitchen and this is my
wonderful co-host West Tobler and you're
watching hak5 the show where we void
warranties and encode some other code
and you know you get there you get the
idea back but know we've got some good
quality tech content I do but I'm
feeling really good about this episode
I'm jumped I mean we've got we've got
BSD and Nass we've got a little linux on
the iPod a password stealer I mean what
no and you can't go wrong when you have
brick walls oh yeah it's all about the
brick break-in time break-in time so
first up we're gonna check out when your
mobs that's right I'm going to show you
how to do some simple woodworking and
introduce more LEDs yes and he's not
gonna cut his fingers off with some
power tools so that's always a plus so
let's go see that all right now since
the new season started we've been
getting a lot of great feedback so
thanks so much for that that's awesome
but one of the things that we've been
seeing reoccurring has been kind of the
noticeable lack of methyl alcohol onset
and I assure you nothing has changed in
that department you know it's just
podcasters prog ative considering our
our demographic yes our the word younger
demographic and I promise you I'm not on
the methyl alcohol either right now I'm
just just got that surgery show must go
on and Wes has been getting it on with
the custom cocktail cabinet try saying
that three time that's Island what's up
with this this was just something we
thought of a long time ago and I finally
got around to doing it was a pretty much
inspired when you through the cold
cathodes behind the liquor bottles and
there's like oh that looks cool
and I that's when I got the idea to
build a cabinet to fit in that window
and do the same thing only using LEDs it
would be prettier mm-hmm and so what are
the materials real quick that we're
using here and how this all works well
we're using a pine for the wood we've
got a merlot stain polyurethane bunch of
screws LEDs some resistors switches
stuff like that you know basic basic
basic stuff to do an LED circuitry and
what would you say is the total cost of
a behemoth like this somewhere in the
neighborhoods of
100 $150 somewhere in that neighborhood
give or take you know local prices and
what you actually decide to build it out
of this we made it out of select pine
which is the cheapest of all the woods
you can get and that was like what 15
bucks a board right now why pine pine
it's cheap and it still looked halfway
decent you can make it out a white oak
red oak poplar but red oak was almost
$30 a board so we went with the pine
yeah and this is soft - yeah soft easy
work it easily work stuff like that and
it's not a whole lot of carpentry
involved it was just all butt joint so
you just nail it all together stain it
finish it sand it okay so the staining
that's what's really made this pop I
mean it's not like you know a I mean I
guess I really remembers the arcade
cabinet before we put the
well that was MDF and MDF just kind of
looks like garbage by itself MDF is
designed to be painted or covered in
some sort of way now with pine with real
wood grain like this you want to set it
off and that's when you'd use a stain
like this right here you know this is
Olympus Merlot colored stain olimpic
excuse me and that's what we decided to
use it of course it's all a matter of
personal preference mmm
now what are the steps involved if
somebody's new to the idea of staining
wood how does that work you just rub it
in with the grain
put it on fairly heavily and then 15
minutes to an hour later you come back
and wipe it all down and that'll smooth
it out and make it look really good and
if you decide you need to you can put
multiple coats of stain on to darken the
color
okay so sand wipe down new stain with
the grain correct and let that sit for a
little while now you're gonna more or
less sand it down again after that's dry
it's gonna take about 24 hours to be on
your eye and then you use not sandpaper
anymore but steel wool like this right
here and this is what's called four OTT
which means four zero gauge steel wool
which is ultra fine and all that's gonna
do is smooth it out and then you can go
on and put your polyurethane on which is
actually which which gives it this nice
shiny okay you know gives it a nice
glossy feeling and this is polyurethane
right gotta love the shine in fact my
coats feeling a little Brown right now
signee you get it on sale yeah I got it
on sale I'll bet you did but this is
polyurethane right here and this goes on
just like paint and or stain goes with
the grain and let it dry you want to rub
it down with the Faurot again and put
you could put at least two coats on so
what's the trick with applying the poly
you want to use something like this
sponge right here this sponge brush
because it's very very cheap it's a
couple of cents a brush and with that
once you're done you throw it away okay
once you use polish you can treat
artists ratchet awesome now the coolest
aspect and the geekiest aspect of course
is the fact that we've got these LED
glowy stuff at the bottom illuminating
our cocktail bottles or right large
bottles but yes tasty beverage bottles
tasty beverages and that is work on a
really simple two by six parallel
circuit okay so how does that work it
sounds more complicated than what it is
but I've got it set up on the breadboard
here assuming that there's a power
source coming here your positive would
go to the anode or the positive side of
an LED because LEDs or unidirectional
positive been a negative one's an anode
and the other being the cathode yes a
node positive cathode negative and you
just run from positive to anode cathode
to anode cathode to resistor back to
negative okay so why the resistor the
resistors there because we're using a
nine volt power supply and these are
three point two volts an LED with a
thirty milliamp usage okay so how do you
figure out what size this is a hundred
yes resistant resistor and how do you
figure out what ohm resistor per mm well
we found this really really good website
it's a great utility a great tool risa
resource that's what I was looking for
for doing any kind of led circuitry
because all you have to do is tell it
how many LEDs you're using the forward
voltage three point two volts and the
amount of electricity you through 30
milliamps and supply voltage and it'll
give you the best layout to do it which
that's where we got the six by two or
two by six excuse me one of the other
sure just like SIA kicked in
doesn't matter and resistor it'll tell
you all that it will tell you exactly
how to do it it will give you a
schematic or a diagram and leave them
pop it out Nancy if you so desired an
see for the win
sure whatever floats your boat but it's
really simple and all you have to do is
you do this circuit and then you lather
rinse and repeat to finish it now that's
not the motor domes is only for our
9-volt battery it ok yes and then we've
even added a little switch Macabre here
yes which a little rocker switch kinda
like that she's over here so we can turn
on and off yeah and everything's single
throw a single pole and what would you
say life expectancy is on these LEDs
about 1100 hours so assuming they might
run for four hours a night hmm you know
a for four hours for every night they're
actually assuming that we're using this
every night with the cocktails I don't
think that yeah I'm saying that you know
and we have our big party on the nights
on the night that's going to be awesome
Williamsburg Virginia hak5 kicks it off
no they'll be running for like what ten
hours mm-hmm something like that it'll
look good any other resources that you
want to mention for anybody that's
looking to do something similar for
anybody that's looking to do some really
good or get their hands on some really
good LED projects is this one gentlemen
that goes by Alan I can't pronounce his
last name he's based out of Canada he's
got amazing amazing LED projects and one
in particular is he actually installed
ultra-bright LEDs and his stairwell to
illuminate it when you're broken
infrared barrier why bomb is this
because it was a really dark hallway and
today he just it would be easy that's
awesome okay and of course anybody with
crazy mod ideas or wants to shoot stuff
by wesley's please email me let me know
I want to hear all about them hit up the
mods section it's the mod slash hack
slash code section on the forums right
because we was like you know you finish
your mod go ahead and uh put some pics
and tell us all about it there mm-hmm
so uh that's pretty much it here let's
uh head over Dalian see what's going on
that's nice it's so pretty
well anyway next up we have some iPod
Linux love if anyone's interested in
that sounds a little dirty but first
it's this month's trivia question which
was what is the commonly used crystal
that produces a mixture of seventy-two
hundred and twenty-two hundred Hertz
tones often used to defeat a cts that
was correctly answered by Stewart or how
old as he's more commonly known on the
forums and on IRC cheeks was cool enough
hook him up with a $25 gift certificate
for his very own hack point five trust
your checklist each t-shirt so that's uh
that's pretty cool and then this month's
trivia they won't hear this yeah we got
what are the ingredients from the
cocktail tux on a rampage from the
secret Easter Egg 311 episode
oh come on that's a great trivia
question oh yeah it is great because it
requires only a tune enough only 850
people saw that episode perjury most
arena I know it was reason yeah tux on
oh you know yeah
anyway so where do they gonna say in
their answers to wow you can send your
answers to trivia at hak5 org we look
forward to seeing you awesome so and
we'll be back after these quick messages

now what could possibly be better than
Linux on an iPod Linux on an iPod that
plays Doom of course and here to show us
just that is our very own paul tobias
thanks for coming on and get in front of
camera and so you're here to talk about
putting Linux on the ipod where'd you
hear about this man I first read it and
make magazine a while ago but I checked
it out back then and didn't really
support my generation iPod and there
weren't as many applications that you
can use it for but it was kind of
interesting but recently I checked it
out and they've done a lot more
development and goes all the way up to
the fifth generation iPods with video
suite so aside from the doom what else
can you do with iPod LAN um there's
other emulators for like the NES the
Gameboy there's MAME and there's plenty
of writing programs other means writing
layers how do you write on an iPod
you got a there's lots of different text
input methods but the main one is you
scroll through the letters and numbers
and you press select and you write one
letter at a time with just the one
button gotcha
so what about everybody at home that has
an iPod that's wondering what the
compatibility is you know by generation
of iPod um well the wiki on iPod Linux
org definitely helps explain it there's
a whole graph listening to generations
and what parts of the iPod it supports
okay but we're not gonna see it on a
shuffle anytime soon no definitely not
okay now if we put Linux on our iPod or
we're gonna lose any of the original
iPod functionality um absolutely no
because what you're doing is dual
booting and it'll let you either boot
the Apple firmware or the Linux firmware
so it's just a grub if you were to put
you know yep Linux on a Windows machine
or I guess on this case on a Mac spiffy
now how do you get to that bootloader
though if you're in the Apple OS or you
know you want to switch between yeah oh
well when you want to switch you have to
press the center button and the menu
button at the same time that allows you
your iPod to reboot and it will go into
the bootloader program can you walk us
through the steps of getting Linux
actually on your iPod all right first
thing they do is you have to put your
iPod into disk mode you do that through
the iTunes it's in the Preferences under
the iPod tab after
that you download the installer you
unpack it and start running it it will
find your iPod and it will give you a
list of all the modules and programs you
can install on so it's kind of like got
its own built in package management
system yes it's very Linux like ok so is
there any big difference between
installing it on Windows hi pod and a
Mac iPod yes because Windows has to
format it to the fat32 file structure it
doesn't really see the linux partition
too well so it's kind of quirky but on
the Mac it's a lot easier because it's
used to sing the different things like
the hfs+ okay so on the windows side it
actually puts a linux partition on there
yeah and windows obviously can't see
that just if you were to dual boot like
Gen 2 and Windows you would be able to
see your gentle file system unless you
had some additional software as there
any recommendations you have when we
were researching this problem
we came across L tools which was a neat
little application that kind of set it
up to view as in like of the Windows
File Explorer and you can see the whole
both the fat32 file structure and the
UNIX files Linux file structure suite so
what's the trick to getting doom on your
iPod the thing is since the iPod isn't
capable of running both the Linux OS and
do them at the same time you have to
launch it from like the BIOS and the way
you do that is you get a launcher we use
C launcher it took a little uh rewriting
some of the C out of your arse EPSRC
well starts up Linux you know rather
than going right into your GUI you get
the option to go into different things
definitely so that kind of sounds very
similar to back in the day if you
remember trying to play something like
Duke Nukem 3d and you would just you
know get a plot special floppy that
would you good off that and get you know
optimal system performance cuz when load
you know that other file off stuff or
kind of akin to maybe
exiting Windows 3.1 or going to us and
play all them and quake 2 there yeah
dude that's awesome now would you say
it's actually playable though oh yeah
you can have philosoph on just one round
blowing a little bad guys away and
opening up all little secret doors with
the controls like the controls a little
quirky you don't get the stray if you
don't get to walk backwards but
everything else is there you can't and
you can't change your gun unless you
want to have ammo that could be kind of
a pain but we've successfully beaten it
on the ipod the 5th gen and I gotta say
man this this is awesome
now if anybody is interested in trying
this out where would you say that they
had you the best resources resource is
iPod Linux wiki everything's there all
the things need to download even the
iPod firmware updater is there you go
there and it'll explain it it's a little
daunting at first but once you get you
see idea of way it works on the iPod you
can also figure out works on the wiki
suite well thanks for coming out and
showing us the Linux way for our iPods
now we're gonna head over to Ali and see
what's coming on next in the show so
next up we have a network attached
storage box that makes backing up your
system a breeze first this time for this
month's poll last month's question was
pirates ninjas or zombies it seems that
the landslide consensus is ninjas by
almost 70% ninjas you can't go wrong
with that dude I love ninjas I love a
good I love a good ninja and we were
right we're right it's all about the
ninja but then I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna slit your throat and I'll
leave if you want a good laugh check out
the forums under polls you get to have a
good laugh at famicom and it's a good
 if you wrote a four-page essay
oh yeah that guy knows awesome this
month pole is ps3 360 or the Wii which
one did you sell it for I'm gonna go
with Wii U at the way yeah I don't know
I'm like I'm in the chair because you
know I played the 360 at Matt's place
and that was a lot of fun I really
enjoyed it I think the 360 is a good
system but dude the week to be like well
I dude I know my roots
Darren should never have a Wii in his
hand that's because it's just ok so
we'll be back after these messages
okay alone get up wins come on lonely
okay so backing up your data it's
something all of us should do but most
of us rarely actually do it whether we
just don't have the correct solution for
it the space whatever no there are some
good solutions out there for network
attached storage to back your data up to
and Darren has found out a great way to
do that a great way to make a network
attached storage there's a network
attached storage and ass and ass if you
will yes what is it Darren well an ass
differs from other network attached
storage I'm sorry NASA differs from
other backup solutions like a external
USB or firewire hard drive or dat tapes
or CD ROMs or just you know spare hard
drives in your box because it's the the
focus is the network aspect okay it's on
a remote computer somewhere else
attached to the network so it doesn't
have to be physically attached to your
machine right and the beauty of that is
it's the same thing that you would
expect when it comes to like having a
printer that has its own print server on
the land it becomes a network resource
so now rather than just myself having
access to this backup medium I can give
access to West to Allie and we can all
keep our documents sane and secure okay
well and it's away from our machines in
case something happens like me we read
the hard drive dies and I lost a lot and
the magic smoke just poof yeah so now
we're using FreeNAS correct right now
what is FreeNAS well FreeNAS is a
network attached storage solution that's
based on the free
six operating system and it's licensed
under the bsd license and what's really
neat about it is it's got a very small
footprint and that has some unique
abilities for example it can be
installed onto a USB key or onto a
compact flash card or even onto the
drive that you'll be using for storage
it's also got it also has many services
built in like CIFS more you know windows
and unix also has NFS and even FTP
service nice now can we access that FTP
from the Internet if we wanted to or
would yeah we could set that up you know
with a router some port forwarding you
know set up the user lists and
authentication and you know you could
open it up so that you could backup from
work to your home machine you can even
set one of these up you know off-site so
that you would have a off-site backup
and I'd imagine its features like these
that really sets FreeNAS apart from the
other solutions exactly one of the other
network attached networking that mask
like I can't speak I'm on too many
painkillers the one of the things that
really sets this apart from one of the
others that I was using before was was
nast light and nasa lights really neat
but it's not a free solution whereas
this is it's free open source and the
small footprint allows you to little
just nifty stuff with it okay so now
that we've got know a pretty good idea
of you know what we're working with now
what goes into the box that is our
actual network attached storage well
that's a beauty you don't need a very
sophisticated machine whatsoever the
minimum system requirements excuse me
are something with 96 megabytes of RAM
mm-hmm obviously you need a network
interface of course and a C a bootable
CD ROM Drive to install the sounds like
we're in the ice right in our case we're
just using our spare box that we've got
sitting around the lab it's a half on XP
2200 with a with 256 Meg's of RAM we've
got a cd-rw and in our case we popped in
a nice 320 gigabyte Seagate drive that
we got inexpensively online
and I think it was even under about $100
so for three hundred you know that's
their deal
now didn't isn't that the one of their
side cool perpendicular drives right
it's the perpendicular drive technology
in fact I believe that that was recently
featured on lab rats and deal TV as well
so good stuff okay and so that's a bit
so long story short you need a basic box
right this will you just need a bare
bone this is our spare machine and then
we spent about another hundred and ten
dollars two hundred and twenty dollars
on parts the other part that we picked
up just for this was this really nifty
compact flash to IDE adapter now this is
a 32 megabyte compact flash drive that I
had a card that I had that came with my
digital camera I love when you get those
nice huge megapixel digital cameras and
then they give you a 32 yeah yeah so it
decided to give it some new life and
using the compact flash tidied that IDE
after the machine reads this as a
regular hard drive okay and this way
there's no moving parts it's got lower
power requirements area it should have a
much longer lifespan exactly okay that's
a really really neat solution okay so
we've got all our parts together so what
do we do about setting up freenas okay
so to set up FreeNAS first you need to
go over to freenas org download the
latest ISO and burn that to a CD it's a
really small lie so take that CD pop it
in your machine that you've designated
as your new network attached storage box
and when you boot off of that CD you'll
be given a screen similar to this that
will give you the installation options
now I believe it's it's option number
seven will start the setup procedure to
install it on your compact flash card on
a body or the USB USB key or the hard
drive right and then from there it's a
pretty simple procedure of just
following the on-screen directions
thanks next next finish as well the UNIX
world of next xx finish the equivalent
thereof and then once that's done you'll
pop out the CD reboot it'll boot off of
your installation medium and in our case
the compact flash drive and we end up on
this and wheeler console screen we end
up with the same exact console screen is
that's where you get all the work done
and the next step is to set up your
network inter
face and that's option number one and
that's where you assign it what network
card you're using and whether that's
eth0 or what it'll actually auto detect
those and give you a good list of it
makes life easier and then from there I
either get I guess we go to number two
which is setup LAN IP address we give it
a static IP address that will all that
machine will always have right now we've
given ours 192 168 1 that's 66 so okay
that's the IP address we will use to
administrate it and to access it over
the network for dumping our files ok so
now that it sees its network interface
and we've given it an IP address on the
network now where do we go well we can
run option number 6 which is to ping a
host to make sure that our IP our
interface is working and once that's all
good and done we can just unplug the
keyboard we can unplug the monitor we
can throw this in the closet or stick a
next to our cable modem and a router and
all that other fun blinky lights and
it'll just become like a permanent
fixture in our land ok so it just sits
there and hums where do we actually
access this functionality from your your
computer once you've got it hooked up
you don't really have an S yet you've
got an S server running but the hard
drive isn't formatted or added so what
we need to do is log into our FreeNAS
web interface and in our case that's
over here in Firefox we head over to one
92168 1.66 we'll be prompted for user
name and password the default for that
is admin for the username and FreeNAS
for the password and once we're into
here we'll go under
disks we'll go to management and from
here we can add a disk and then once
we've got our disk added we can go and
format our disk mm-hmm and that will
format it in I believe we've formatted
this with what is it
ext three okay where's the file system
that would this Drive has been formatted
in and if I head over here to the Status
page I can see that I've got you know I
can see the memory usage and I can see
the drives and everything and the
hardware that this is running on and
once we have our drive
it toured ass we can then start using it
but we need to enable some services so
that we can see it over the network yeah
because now it's been formatted with a
UNIX type operating system and we're
running Windows computers so now do we
have to use some kind of like samba or
something like that yeah I can put on
their head over to and this is the
easiest part we just click on CIFS and
then we just click enable ok we give it
a NetBIOS name that NetBIOS name FreeNAS
if we pull up start and run and go to
backslash backslash FreeNAS we'll pull
up our Nass wine that's our drive that
we've formatted and added to the the the
network attached storage system and we
go in here with you know we've got our
hack 5 masters we've got you know
episode files backed up so there's
everything backed up okay so now three
knives is up and running we have access
to it over the network so we have a
place to backup to but the worst part
about backing up is remembering to do so
right and that is where the automation
process comes in and if you're on a
Windows environment one of the best ways
to do that is with a couple of scripts
and my favorite command the at command
schedule it's and it's cron
yes and you know why reinvent the wheel
when one of our own community members
who goes by the name of go intern has
made an awesome tutorial on the hack 5
wiki that has a great batch file and
walks you through the steps involved and
setting that up so that you can specify
directories that you want to be backed
up and those will you know you can run
that nightly so that it only backs up
what's changed and you know I could walk
you through the whole thing but he's
done an even better job than I could of
explaining that on behind live wiki on
the hack point 5 wiki so now we've got
the automation scripts available we've
got free knives up and running so we
were set we're set and you know if we
wanted to go even you know many steps
further you can integrate this with
Active Directory I'm gonna radius you
can set up a software raid you can do so
many amazing things with this piece of
software so I really recommend you go
and check it out because backing up is
something we all need to do and this is
the perfect solution if you're in
you know Network environment where you
want to share it among multiple people
so if people want to find out even more
about freenas hat assume they go to the
website go to website FreeNAS org or
head over to our article on that and
that'll be on the AK 5 wiki under the
show notes ok so thank you so much that
is freaking awesome I'm glad we have
that running here in the hack 5 Studios
now so let's head over to Allie and see
what's coming up next in the show so
last month's LAN party was supposed to
be battlefield 2 but apparently there
was a hitch yeah the server saw the
magic smoke yeah that's ok but we're on
a dude we're on a new box on a new
network and it's zero and then you're a
data center guys in the playing like
Unreal Tournament classic yeah yeah game
of the year the original you teen that
was a lot of fun I had a lot of fun I
spent the most out of everybody Darren
kind of well I popped in wait I owned
whatever meant I came in I owned three
rounds and then I left dude I've got
screenshots to prove it ok
mm-hmm I owned and then I worked take
another shot at battlefield 2 this month
mm-hmm only 16th right on the 16th we
got to give some shoutouts to the Unreal
Tournament game of the year people and
those go to Skylar who was you know like
number 2 number 1
yes Kyle it's got all those tears out
dude turn it on point so is moonlit and
Blizz yeah yeah yeah I definitely
definitely and you know what I'm sayin
well when are we gonna be playing
battlefield 2 again well the guys we
played battlefield 2 on the 16th and
bound what time do you guys generally
stop us tea time yes so if you're in
Australia make sure you buy a lot of Red
Bull we need to face off in UT you think
we're talking about we talked about this
a few months ago last time we went to
Toronto mmm and Weiss has this crazy
idea in his head that he thinks he can
take me in ut and I can take you Newton
we all know that the very least I'll
give you
I could take y'all in wow wow 2006 what
do we need to make that happen
yeah well make it happen you want to see
a one-on-one high-five West versus
Darren maybe get some new bits on the
hak5 radio to do some commentary on them
or something yeah well we'll showdown
and then we'll have the Xiaolin Showdown
on Yugi and then we'll go on a
one-on-one counter-strike yeah okay I
know I own you and that no no I'm kind
of strict too as well sure okay
keep dreaming so you know hit us up on
the forums a lot of time if you'd like
to see that because maybe we'll set up a
special event okay we got anything else
out yeah next up we have this neat
little USB key that can still your
windows Password in seconds literally
I've seen it done and we've nicknamed
around the house the the USB switchblade
so here goes
nine out of ten evil servers recommend
hack five trustor techno las t-shirts
get yours today before they get you in
Soviet Russia teacher surveillance
mothership elects large some assembly
required for muumuu base not included
Inc ominous partners a novel server they
have servers there's not evil yet
everybody knows if you have physical
access to a network security all bets
off ya assumably sure the nice part yeah
but now what happens if your physical
access is limited to only a few seconds
Darrin's found a neat little software
thing that you can use on this to take
care of what you need to do Darrin what
is this well this is a USB thumb drive
or is it we've called it you know the
switchblade just because it's got this
sweet little slider right you know the
cruiser it's pretty cool and I got to
say that this was originally developed
by some community members on our forms
and they've done a really awesome job
putting together some interesting tools
to a compromised systems when you have
physical access okay now this USB thumb
drive is just a little bit different
than the normal ones that you may
already have and that was what what what
is that difference with it uses a piece
of technology called u3 technology again
what that basically does is puts a
separate partition on this on this
little USB key here that looks to
windows like a cd-rom which means it
will auto run because question without
question because normally when you plug
in a removable hard drive or a USB key
it you get a little pop-up that says hey
what do you want to do you play music or
photos or open the folder this is just
like popping in a CD like you know you'd
pop in your battlefield 2 CD and it pops
up the installation right okay so it's
gonna auto run what what's the time
what's the daughter running what where
where's this attack come in okay it auto
runs a special payload now when you
normally buy these from the store they
come with some software from Sandy
that this particular one has Skype on it
and a few other little applications so
when you pop it in you can run you know
your little applications right off the
drive just like we've talked about
before when Rob or Moo became down on
episode 9 or 10 to talk about little
applications for USB thumb drives right
and what we want to do is flash the you
know firmware or the little what would
you say a cd-rom pit cd-rom partition
sorry I'm a little loopy still but you
would flesh the cd-rom partition with
our own payload and that would then run
some scripts and some tools that are on
the flash partition of this and allow us
to get our black hat on so what happens
if you plug it into a Windows machine
well it will work on Windows 2000 and
above machines and the limitation on
that is that it needs to be a machine
that's logged in with administrative
privileges okay so it's definitely a
windows-based attack and you have to
have administrative privileges to get
anything done right and you may run into
some problems when it comes to
educational networks and corporate
networks with machines that are not
going to logged in by default as
administrators in our case you know I
run as admin on Windows I do as well and
you know it's very populist it's
different with Windows and UNIX because
in UNIX one runners root oh no you can't
get anything done in Windows unless your
administrator so a lot of times this
will come in handy and there are some
ways to escalate privileges to
administrative status when I don't have
a way to that's all that automated right
now right now maybe somebody in the
community will help develop that but
that's out of the scope of this right
okay so if you plug this in go ahead and
do that right now
all right now it's access the the
that's it that was it hacked it doesn't
hang right I get this little pay
removable disk right mm-hmm and now
that's the big partition that right the
actual USB thumb drive so what happened
what what did we just hack what did we
gain from this sure let's take a look at
the scripts okay so if I go into my
computer you can see that I have now the
e Drive which is the cd-rom partition
and I have the F Drive now when I opened
the cd-rom partition you see I have my
auto
INF file here and if I edit that you can
see all it does is run the cisco vbe
that's a visual basic script now this go
visual basic script is what allows us to
invisibly run our payload which is
located on the the readwrite partition
of our USAID the sudo cd-rom oh no no
that one the removable drive ok oh oh
yeah I'm sorry so if we go into here
what it runs is in our WIP directory
under CMD this CMD file or batch file
and that's what our payload is so if I
go ahead and open this up in notepad I
can see everything that this is doing
now what this is doing is it's doing
some PW dump to grab the LM hashes from
that machine it's also stealing product
keys it's getting our URL history from
Internet Explorer it's also getting it's
creating a backdoor which we're getting
to later it's doing all sorts of fun
stuff in fact in later versions and in
another version that somebody else
created Amish and one that even steals
your AI M and MSN has realized stuff
like that
yeah nice so we're gonna go ahead and
close this and it saves all of that to a
file on the on the the writable
partition under documents and log files
and if we go in here it names it based
on computer name deep blue being my
workstation in my room and art book
being this notebook right here mm-hmm
okay so we've got the information we
need what do we do with it now well all
we did was plug it in wait a few seconds
it created that log file we can eject it
we can head over to our machine back
home and now we can crack that hash
right now this is an LM hash this is an
LM hash and those have some certain
weaknesses which we'll talk about in a
moment so let's quickly take a look at
the log file that this is created now
I've got an IP config in here so I know
what the IP address is of that machine
so I can remotely access it later it
also gives me the LM hashes and gives me
product keys which I'll probably be
pointing out in posts as well as LS a
secret
which are other interesting things that
windows stores that it probably
shouldn't be doing right right okay so
let's go into our command prompt and
head over to the F Drive anything and
head over to documents and head over to
log files and I'm going to write I'm
sorry I'm going to type our book that
log and I'm going to find dude's key
okay so now I can see this user on my
system whose name is dude's key and I
have his LM hash so I'm going to add
that to a file in C colon backslash
Rainbow crack backslash PA sswd txt okay
ok so now we've written that hash to
password txt in my end the rainbowcrack
directory right right now rainbow crack
we've talked about this a little bit
before bramble crack is basically a tool
that allows us to use rainbow tables or
pre computed time memory trade-off
tables to crack passwords and it's very
efficient right we've talked about this
before and so let's just go ahead and
get into the attack so now that I have
that hash I can go ahead and run our
crack star dot RT and I'm using the
three gigabyte rainbow tables and I tell
dash F pass WD txt so now it's going to
go ahead and load up those three
gigabytes of rainbow tables and then
it's going to start computing those
against the hashes that it knows and say
we can get the clear text from it right
okay and so now what now what we're
talking about with the land manager hash
is it's an unsecure password and this is
general over your overview but it's an
unsecured password it's a hash that hash
on des right and it takes the password
and divides it into two seven character
hashes correct and then from there it's
just going to break down each half
mm-hmm well and it also one of the other
weaknesses is it converts everything to
uppercase so if you've got a lowercase
uppercase
it's a doesn't matter right which makes
it an insecure password now so I imagine
that the best way to defeat this kind of
cracking is to not let Windows
make an LMS exactly and there is a
registry edit that you can do so that
Windows will not store LM hashes and
those are for backwards compatibility
with 9895 and ME computers on your
network if you don't have any of those
you don't need LM hashes and it's
probably better to just turn them off
anyway
now just assuming that you needed to
keep those which at this point wouldn't
matter anyway nobody runs that anymore
so that's a nobody but but another
another option is is to use a password
that has 15 or more characters because
it can't divide that into two and then
it can't store the LM hashes so a good
idea would be to create a passphrase
such as rent is due on the fifth or my
first computer was a IBM pc/xt I mean
you're not gonna forget stuff like that
and it makes / pretty much a little lamb
and her fleece was white as SN 0w sure
why not whatever yeah that's that's a
whole other discussion is past phrases
but 15 characters are is what you need
to remember there and special characters
up or lowercase numbers also needs to
mention that another thing that we've
noticed in the lab testing this is that
does a another preventive or way up
measure to prevent against this attack
is that if you're running a an
anti-virus in our case we were running
Norton I'm sorry Symantec AntiVirus
corporate Edition and notice the PW dump
tool and was able to catch it before it
could run okay so it just it sold it in
the bud and right so I'm sure that
McAfee and other you know um big-name
antivirus software will probably you
know prevent that this key from you know
owning that machine as well okay but
let's talk about the backdoor first
okay well this still cracks yeah it's
it's crunching along here pretty well in
a way okay so if I pull up my computer
manager and I click that twice so it's
gonna take a second okay okay I'm a
computer manager up in here and I'm
looking at users there's this user here
called support underscore 389 blah blah
blah right that is the user that Windows
XP uses for remote administration now
this is Remote Administrator Remote
Assistance or excuse me
Remote Assistance kind of like how when
MOOCs
helping me with the Gentoo install and I
had something kind of quirky happen that
I couldn't figure out so he was able to
connect to my machine over the Internet
and exit and use the command line as if
he were there it's it's just like that
or it's the Windows equivalent it's just
like VLC which we've talked to talk
about lunch in the past it's like Remote
Desktop so that user is in there by
default but it's also locked so what
this does is creates another user with a
very similar name the only difference is
the one on the end here and if I open
this up and take a look at its
membership it's actually a member of the
administrators group so now you have
created a user with administrator
privileges on our target machine within
seconds and we have from end also for
that so we have remote we have the IP
address we have our own user that we've
created and that's with the password
that we've generated in our go dot CMD
file our payload in my case I made it
half for flakes because you can't go
wrong with that South Lakes course not
so how is our rainbow crack coming along
it's humming along nicely so we should
be done here momentarily I think it's
taking a little bit longer because we're
running the camstudio software to record
the screen right same time that it's
cracking okay so well why that hums away
let's go ahead and talk about where we
can find any kind of further information
with this sure a interesting thing about
this exploit was that two people came to
me with the same with it with very
similar exploits one of them's names max
damage and he's the one that created the
tool that reimage 'as the u3 partition
on this type of flash drive and allows
it to do it automatically with that
virtual cd-rom partition the other one
his name is Amish and he's come up with
one that'll work on USB drives without
the u3 technology using a little bit of
social engineering and we've got a
write-up on both of those in our show
notes on the wiki okay and so it looks
like right here the rainbow cracks done
rainbow crack is done and as we can see
down here the result is username dude's
key password one two lowercase Q W a s
capital Z capital X so he has numbers
he's got lowercase she's got uppercase
you would think that was big characters
by many corporate standards that
meet the criteria in fact by wit by all
standards you don't know by windows 2003
server standards and you need eight
characters at least to lowercase to
capitals and to numbers so that by
Windows 2003 would be a secure password
and as we can see with a three gigabyte
rainbow table in about two minutes of
work cracking about three seconds of
retrieving time we've been able to own
that machine Wow Wow so you know what
Darren I don't want to see that anywhere
near my box but you've got to sleep
sometime I keep my door locked and my
USB ports locked alright well I guess
that's pretty much all the time we have
for this episode of hack five I guess we
do need to slightly apologize for the
lack of the rerun of the skits kind of
ran into a little accident mid
production and yeah we're running a
little bit high eight ham we're running
a little behind on time because we have
to get our butts up to Toronto to do
some some call for help and yes greeting
I'm fun up there and drink all the
Canadian beer it would be good good
times as always so get a couple of
things to wrap up with sure first of all
we need to say thank you to our awesome
awesome ISP Dreamhouse has you know been
there for us whenever we need in them
and you know they can be there for you
as well if you excuse me if you sign up
for them with the coupon code hak5 you
can get $25 off and they've got some
great plans with a terabyte of transfer
100 gigabytes of storage 1-click
installs of a whole lot it you know I
just I just went through and use the
1-click installs to update our forms
update our wiki and you never seamless
you just log in and our wiki was out of
date and I clicked upgrade upgraded the
wiki is awesome okay so I'd like to
thank everybody for taking the survey on
the website that's gonna help us out so
much if you haven't done that please
that's a money free you know complete
way to help us out yeah we can
definitely use it feedback is always
welcome we really really appreciate any
feedback you might have towards how
we're doing things what you'd like to
see what you don't like to see me
personally I want to hear about your
mods what are you painting something
turning something into something
completely different
and we get a lot of great feedback on
the forums and there's a suggestions
area there's also a great section for
you know hacks and mods and code and
other fun stuff like that so you can
always hit us up on the forums yeah
forms the wiki that's always available
to you there's an e source can email me
i'm darren hack five org I'm Wes at hack
five org we've got Ally Paul hack five
org also our show notes have moved to
the wiki and a lot of people have been
asking where those are and so it's it's
really redone we've got some great
people that are taking care of the wiki
and it looks phenomenal
yeah another cool thing on the wiki is
the folding at home group yes folding at
home anybody that's not familiar with it
that's it's a shared processing project
for scientific research of how proteins
fold in the human body because when
sometimes when they don't fold correctly
then that's when you get like genetic
'it's yeah Bork's bits basically genetic
defects and stuff like that so if you've
got spare CPU cycles and one given to a
good cause there's a hak5 group and you
can find more information on the wiki
and you know got to give shout outs the
people that created that because they
just created it in our name and i think
that's really cool that is really really
cool them good looking out do we have
anything else Darren besides getting
fragged frags don't forget about the LAN
party LAN party on the six and I know I
challenged you earlier in the episode to
a Unreal Tournament classic match and
I'm a I will own you can we hold off
until my finger heals because I don't
think my uber micro just not where it
needs to be right now or do you know
what you just can go ahead and rock on
with you yeah yeah see now I just need
to break this one so busy you know
perma rocker don't break anything
bet ya anyway so until next time I'm Wes
I'm Darren trust your techno lust
on the move have you how do you wash a
giant baby how do you watch a giant baby
especially when it poops poop we have
good stuff we have some good good check
check
the tech stuff we do with the tank and
and we've got the thank you melodic and
TX because this is good stuff from UK if
you like the tea yeah so what are we
going into first first is I get to show
how to build something with power tools
where's the power tools you know it's
gonna be a dangerous night let's go
ahead and roll that there I thought I
was pretty sure yeah that's great
trust me I'm down I'm putting my finger
down saying we need to give Darren more
drugs okay
we're just must be really happy for some
reason I don't know why it's like I'm
just so excited about can't hear that
whoa that's
yeah that's not supposed to happen build
your own network - did she bother I said
bad Evan Evan built some Network stuff
and send some code to some other code
and make some stuff happen she's getting
really scary let's see yes the tea is
definitely affecting me I'm gonna tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
