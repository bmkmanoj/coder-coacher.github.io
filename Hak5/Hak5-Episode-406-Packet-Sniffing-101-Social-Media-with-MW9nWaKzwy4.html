by Beck's beer godaddy.com Netflix calm
and darren's kitchen it's like the
failed bus for cooking
what
everybody welcome this week's episode of
hack 5 i'm matt last dakin and I'm
Shannon Morse those are you haven't seen
hak5 before we're show focused on
everything from systems administration
to gaming to mods anything that we could
possibly throw under the IT umbrella
which is what we like to call technol us
and this week we have a whole bunch of
new stuff for you I'm going to be
talking about synergy which is this
half-life 2 mod that makes it
multiplayer Matt what are you talking
about I've got bak see which is a front
end for the XMBC system it's runs on
linux and mac and we're gonna get into
that and show you how awesome you can
harness the social power of media very
cool what about you Chris I'm going to
be starting a three-part series on Peggy
stiffing going over through the starting
from the fundamentals tools and finally
wrapping up with some advanced
techniques and Darren what are you
talking about today taking a look at one
of our community member creations and
that is a port of chron for windows so
anyway let's go ahead and kick it off
Matt let's see what's going on with
boxxy so you guys are probably really
aware of the xbox media center it's huge
right now it's all the rage and you can
use it on your Windows Mac Linux and
he's going to show us this new front end
called boxy for the xbox media center
yeah that's right Shannon boxy is
currently in an alpha stage you can't go
ahead and you can't download it yet but
we are working with a boxy team to try
and get invite codes for a select number
of viewers so watch the forums for that
info behind us here you could actually
see we've actually got something playing
now boxy is Boxxy is social media or
social networking with media okay so
you're a big social media person I love
social networking I'm crazy about it so
what we can do with boxxy is we can
actually apply the social networking
model to our own media so we can share
our media we can share like movies and
music and stuff like that exactly cool
will you show me how this works sure so
right now we're playing a song via
last.fm not our song it's a song that
one of our friends actually listen to
its do you want to buy the cooks okay
cool so what we can do is we can go
ahead
back out and escape and here you see the
main page of Bach see when boxy is like
I said is a front end for the xbox media
center up here we have our friends
activities so everything that they are
watching listening to or recommending is
actually listed in this first page right
here okay so so this list right here
this is all the movies and music all the
most recent stuff right that that Avner
who is one of our most frequent people
on boxee what he's watching what he's
listened to you actually watch the
movies that Abner's watching you can't
watch him but most of movies yeah you
can actually watch trailers for the
movies and you can actually you can
actually you know watch the trailer and
see if you like and you can go ahead and
download it other than that what you can
also do is you can go into a movie and
we can go into this movie that Abner
watched and it's apparently lifted
released in 2006 gives you all kind of
music information about the movie and we
can go ahead and we can rate and
recommend this to our other friends if
we've watched it okay so if we rate it
we say we love it great rating sent now
that's going to apply to all future
recommendations that box we will
actually send to us say hey you like
this well very nice you might like this
the other great thing about boxy is
because it's internet connected and its
internet focused what we can do is we
can actually watch and listen to
internet media so it's kind of like a
streaming radio for the music streaming
radio and streaming video just like
revision3 is and actually revision3 is a
preset inside of boxy so we can actually
go ahead and take a look at that now
video internet videos you can also do
just like xbox media center yeah you can
do your medium but we're going to go
ahead and focus on the internet media
side of things here pull up revision3
i'm going to do is we can go ahead and
we can go to revision3 and say we're
going to give oh geez I don't know let's
go ahead and watch the
first are the latest episode of
diggnation our buddies Kevin and Alex
okay so here there at the brewery and
we're actually going to go ahead and
play the video that is on the revision3
stream it's going to go ahead and cash
it and buffer and oh wow it doesn't take
long to pull it up no it does not so
here we've got the latest episode of
diggnation playing behind us and boxy is
like I said before it's an alpha its
social media social networking with your
media it's got a great front end and
great you know recommendation items for
you know you and your friends so where
can I go to get more information and
download it myself people can go to
Boxxy be 0 X etv the link should be
right here the lies I mentioned before
alpha can't download it yet but you can
sign up for the Alpha I'm like I said
we're gonna try and get some invite
codes for the very select peep to people
so you can go to the risen 3 forums or
the hak5 forums and look for that great
thanks Matt I'm definitely gonna check
that out once it's out of alpha and I
think sorry but first it's time for this
week's trivia now this week's trivia
question is in an optimal PPO II frame
how many bytes to the PPO II headers add
to the total frame size and what RFC
defines that and of course you can
submit your answer to the hak5 or
revisions in three forms to start a
thread called episode 406 trivia be the
first answer will PM you and hook you up
with a whole bunch of cool hak5 goodies
also got in remind you that this week's
trivia is sponsored by Bex it's the
number one german beer export their
different by choice and they invite you
to check out the Becks universe of
choice that's right got a relationship
issue a career dilemma who needs
professional advice when you've got
insightful perspective of local big back
string kurz at becks beer calm you'll
find the universe of choice a live
polling engine that lets you submit an
issue or a life dilemma to the community
of becks drinkers for real time voting
log on to vex beer calm for full details
and you'll leave a more enlightened
person so we're going to take a quick
break and when we get back it's chris
girling with packet sniffing
so as we may know our internet
communication is made up of packets
which are really just the puzzle pieces
of our network traffic and here to
explain to us how that all works and
packet sniffing Chris grilling secure
bit calm right that's the progeny calm
and a bunch of other yeah what I pass
that is a soccer UCF yes um so yeah we
we just talked about security about on
then you know leading into this so cool
well this is some of the stuff you talk
about to look I don't fundamental
overview of what packet sniffing is and
why would we want to do it alright
pakista thing is essentially
eavesdropping of the you know put it in
layman's terms i guess to see what's
going on on a network you know you see
the packets that are coming across and
you want to see what's going on what's
been information is very low level very
low level now why would we want to do
this you need the white hat give me the
black cat the white hat would basically
be like debugging testing you could do
like intrusion detection monitoring you
want to actually from and from a
defensive standpoint you know what's
going on and how do i you know see
what's going on defend against it from
the black hat grey hat standpoint you
know you're more concerned with breaking
things man in the middle type of tax you
know sure sure so like if for example
i'm doing a man in the middle and I'm
between you and the Internet gateway I
can watch across the wire and say like I
just interested in your AOL Instant
Messenger traffic or your HTTP traffic
for information gathering I would want
to do some packet sniffing so that I
could actually see you know what's going
through the wire exactly and then on the
white hat obviously if i'm a software
developer or a network administrator i'm
trying to tweak my network see what's
going on increased performance great
tool for saying what's actually going on
what's going on here yeah okay so what
are we going to need to know what are
these terms in these tools that we're
going to need to know alright well first
we need some knowledge so we need to
know about the OSI model ok and the OSI
model has its seven layers that you know
grid up to explain in a better way how
you know how a packet how information
travels up a network okay so this is
everything in between the copper and the
ground and your monitor so let's start
with a high level and break it down okay
we'll start at the monitor what we did
here is i'll just pull up the heck i
have the hak5 side up great alright so
this is layer 7 basically labor kind of
layers five six and seven mm-hmm this is
what you see on your monitor this is
what actually after the pack has been
built and everything you put
together so this is just what the normal
users are you sitting facing with it's
the applications it's your sessions and
so that's not as interesting for the
packet sniffing so what about the form
below okay form below me before and
we'll we're going to touch on the tools
and make but form below basically is a
your layer 4 has to do with the
transport how you know what what
protocol my using TCP or UDP am I on if
I'm on youtube i'm going to be UDP come
on just going to google it's going to be
you know a tcp your connection oriented
layer 3 is where your actual packet
resides that's the network layer that's
where you get into you know how the
packets put together the source you know
address destination dress you know a lot
of information telling you okay what's
going on here actual structure of these
little bits that are gonna go across the
wire and they get reassembled on the
other end to hopefully be what we we
think it's going to be hopefully yes and
then layer 2 &amp;amp; 1 you know you descend
down in the physical layer you get mac
addresses and you know you're on the
wire or the wireless and it's me or the
physical layer i mean we're talking
about like microwaves whether it's
whether it's ethernet cables whether
it's an understandable satellite okay
yeah I'm stuff that the internet
probably doesn't even realize definitely
you know is in a conceptual term like in
a snow crash term is even even there so
what about these tools we're gonna be
using here um some of the tools that you
can use our Wireshark TCP dump there's a
few other ones like H ping too we're
just going to talk about Wireshark right
now we're on yeah oh yeah sweet couple
it's here and now these tools allow us
to do something interesting with our
network card here and that is to put it
in monitor mode or promiscuous mode so
you want to explain to me what these
terms mean definitely uh with monitor
mode that's it's kind of like just
looking at the traffic that anybody can
do that you don't have to have
administrator privileges or anything you
can just monitor what's happening
between your machine and the network
promiscuous mode is where things get
interesting that's where you were able
to actually modify traffic you know with
with the protocol analyzer and insert
things so when you're doing your mad men
on the middle attack okay you change
your sequence number you know that's
when you can actually start to you know
do attack so monitor mode is really just
listeners listening and then the the
promiscuous mode great example would be
something like
air power air own exactly where i'm
actually listening for your HTTP traffic
over the wireless and then I decide that
instead of getting the the Google banner
image we'd rather give you a picture of
goatse mmhmm yeah definitely okay no
cool so so all of this has to do with
like especially with the promiscuous
modifying these packets you actually
have a paki here and I want to get a
high-level overview of what what is all
entails in a packet so that next time
when we look at this we can actually use
the tool more properly and understand it
a lot better how if we mentioned but
this is going to be part of a three
possibly four part series depending on
how advanced we want to go yeah so let's
get the fundamentals then next time
we're going to go so let's dissect the
packet a lot more and and start using
the tool and then we can do some
advanced techniques and filtering so
right here I have this is just a we went
to hack five and just capture the the
HTTP you know traffic and you can see
better in fact let me just zoom in
really quick I don't really want to
share to not to but we'll just move a
little bit all right and you can see
that we're doing a get request for
review no I guess you're linking
revision yeah images yeah save some
bandwidth link to the rivers in three
image hosting why not but yeah okay and
you know we're just grabbing a JPEG and
doing some other things so I'm gonna
zoom that one of the you know hundreds
of packets that are involved in actually
getting the hack bottles website so
what's the top level of care the top
level here is pretty much your layer one
this is your frame we're gonna open that
up and it's just it you know it tells
you how big the frame length is and all
that stuff this is this is information
that we're not too concerned with right
now but it lets us know like at what
time it was sent what time the peg it
came in and you know how what number the
frame is and we're so framing is really
important for the reassemble process
framing is very important framing a
sequence numbers because typically I
don't just say give me everything at
hak5 and it just gives me a giant
there's no such thing as a giant packet
of hak5 I mean they would be awesome it
would be great yeah but there's
limitations in how big packets can and
can be and how much data there is so we
split them up into multiple chunks and
that's where the framing gets involved
okay so that was that all right the
second one is just layer two and that's
where you have your mac addresses not
too interesting but this tells you this
is basically saying OK from the switch
to me some switch says network interface
is great so here we have layer three
sure this is where you say our source IP
address ipv4 your header length this is
where things getting a pretty
interesting where you can actually use
the fragmentation and things like that
well we're definitely going to get into
that more but ok then you have your
transmission control protocol this is
you're actually the TCP so the first one
the one we just looked at is IP here's
the TCP and tcp/ip yep and here's you
can see your flags that are set ok
you're pushing your ack you know and
different things we're going to
definitely get great more so we need to
know what so we'll get into that next
time what those flags mean and then
finally the actual payload of all this
so we've got all of that header stuff
just to let you know what I'm telling
you so before I can tell you anything I
gotta tell you what I'm telling you and
telling you what order it's going to
come in otherwise it might come in and
be corrupted that's what happens when
you download files and they're corrupted
ok it's came in out of order a lot of
times so finally we have the payload and
we actually see that it's sending us the
others are HTTP GET and we can tell a
user agent is Mozilla and our host is
bit gravity thank you for hosting the
images of hak5 awesome so I think we've
got a good base understanding of what
packet sniffing is why we would do it
and and what you know the anatomy of a
packet really is so next not next week
because you taking a break you gotta go
new house moving from Virginia Beach to
Richmond but once you guys get settled
in you're going to come back here show
us to great show us nice that packet
dissecting a packet and then checking
out some advanced techniques of packet
sniffing so stay tuned for that Chris
thank you as always awesome segment and
we're going to take a quick break and
when we come back we have some fun stuff
going on with with cron and synergy
bacon
it's now it's time for the land party
you guys have said a lot in the forums
about how you'd like to place an
open-source game so that's exactly what
we're doing now on October 18th we're
going to be playing war so it's
basically like well it's an open source
game based on the quake 3 engine it's
kind of similar to quake 3 it's a lot of
fun and I hope you guys will join us on
October 18th at game hak5 org and of
course the land party is sponsored by
Netflix we want to thank them with
Netflix you can rent over 90,000 titles
online with free shipping both ways to
your home they have over 40 shipping
centers so almost all deliveries happen
in just one business day the netflix
plans start at 499 and as a member of
hak5 you can get a no-risk two week free
trial membership check it out at WWF
flexkom / hak5 and remember the ww it's
very important ok so before we head over
to Shannon and Matt to check out the
synergy mod I want to tell you guys
about a creation from our very own
community member Tom be he's developed a
tool called kron4 windows that's exactly
that I mean if you're used to the unix
environment you know that chron is a
great way for scheduling tasks and this
will allow you to do just that in
Windows without having to use the kind
of archaic and not so feature full
windows at command or task scheduler so
here you can get at Tom Bell org and I
want to show you the really nifty
crontab that it has here based on XML so
you can see it's really easy to set up
an XML file that has your schedule of
how many minutes hours days of the month
lots of different ways to schedule and
it's real simple just a matter of
setting the our arguments here and our
program so we can see we've got defrag
see real simple easy-to-use great
documentation stalls as a Windows
service and i highly recommend it and if
you've got more great soft wave your
software developer and a member of the
hak5 community would love to hear from
you guys so hit us up on the forms now
I'm going to go ahead and kick it over
Shannon I think she's playing some
half-life 2 yeah it's actually this half
left to mod called synergy mod and it's
it basically lets you play any
multiplayer half-life 2 game either
half-life two episode 1 episode 2 any
three of those with multiplayer you can
play up to 32 characters
the same server or on a local land
whatever you want and so I think it
would be pretty cool to have 332 Gary
Freeman's Gordon free morning wood Gary
you know his close cousin you know he
yeah exactly garry's mod Gary Freeman
Gary Gordon anyway so yeah we what do we
need to actually go ahead and play
synergy with each other there's only
three things that you need and i guess i
should mention that this can only play
on either windows or linux so sorry guys
sorry Mac users I know met you're a Mac
user I'm sorry dude I know you need
steam first of all you also need source
sdk base and you need to have a half
left to do you need to actually buy the
game okay and you can buy it online it
doesn't matter you also need to have the
same version as your friends who are
playing the synergy mod with you so you
can just go to synergy mod dotnet and
download the newest version I definitely
suggest that one I have the beta right
now so most of my friends I probably
couldn't play with because they all have
the newest version so you're not even
gonna show up in there yes i'll try to
go to their server and they're not even
gonna see me show up i'm gonna be like
where are you guys i won't even be on
there okay i'll be on we've got Darren
running around back here yeah yeah a
crazed maniac yeah as you can see I'm
actually playing half-life 2 right now
I'm in the middle of the game playing
with Darren over here hak5 Darren and
dog so my favorite characters we're
actually in a part of half-life 2 that
most people have only experienced
getting single player so imagine looking
around here with 32 different people
playing the same game as you and going
through half-life half-life 2 in what
may be a couple hours now yeah we're
gonna have to wait it out no we're not
to have a challenge to see how fast we
can actually go ahead and complete you
know each of the half-life's and you
guys can follow us on twitter at hak5 or
you can follow us on the forums when
repost and let you guys know when we've
got you know exciting things coming up
with community and things of that nature
and what we're actually going to be
playing something also we want you guys
to always check out the forums and also
do we say synergy mod
yes and its energy mod dotnet okay
that's exactly where you can find it
alright so wrapping up this episode of
hack five guys we have a couple things
that we need to get out of the way and
one of those being torque on we just
recently went to torque on and we spoke
with tons of people we got lots of
interviews for you guys and we're going
to be showing those in the next couple
of episodes we're also going to daikon
this weekend in Dayton Ohio I know that
Matt's a big fan of Ohio a little fun of
Ohio being that it's my hometown so
definitely big ups on the Ohio so if you
just happen to be at daikon definitely
check us out follow us at twitter and
meet us meet up with us we love hanging
out with viewers it's tons of fun also
need to mention the community at forums
hak5 org or revision 3.com / forums guys
we check it daily and also you know we
looking for your wallpapers we're going
to be working on getting a place that
you guys can actually upload your
wallpapers instead of posting them to
the wiki but we'll go ahead and get that
information so watch the forums at
forums dot hack five dot org and every
week we'll be happy to show off a new
wallpaper up on our sets we have two
different sets two different wallpapers
and we love to show them off we also
really really enjoy it when you guys
give us questions give us comments at
feedback at hat 5 org we can't express
enough how much it means to us we love
your feedback good or bad exactly and we
also want to thank godaddy for
sponsoring the show as you guys know web

godaddy.com and next weeks we have some
brand new segments for you we're going
to be talking to Robin would we did that
interview up at to work on so we'll be
pulling him up and we also have
openfiler so you definitely want to
check that out yeah a lot of people have
been talking about freenas and Al Gore
free NASA's well I went out and I
actually found freenas on crack check
out I think that's it we've got ova
Fowler Robin wood and that's pretty much
it much much more so guys as we've kind
of neglected him this episode Darren why
don't you go ahead and tell us to what
trust to technology I'm on the corner
man what am i doing over here
it's very um can kicking off the show
and I got nothing those of you who
haven't seen the show act 5 is
completely full shot the book of the
XMBC project actually it's XBMC alright
so what is Boxxy I don't know what
you're here for is a port of XM via at
