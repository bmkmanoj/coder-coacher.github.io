by dice com the career hub for tech for
hack 5 i'm jen cutter on the floor at
CES 2011 i'm at the liquid image booth
and they have some very cool products
that melanie is going to tell us about
hi Melanie hi yeah what we have our
goggles and masks that have a camera
integrated into into the frame so what
is going to do is it's going to record
your line of sight while you're out
there enjoying an activity whether
snowboarding skiing motocross and we
even have them for scuba so we have HD
video the particular model that we're
announcing here is HD 1080p and also has
a high action mode that's 720p at 60
frames per second it's for snow and
motocross and both of those will be out
in the fall for four hundred dollars but
we have a model coming out this month
for both snow and for motocross that are
250 and they have HD 720p video so you
can get that line of sight action going
now even on this ski season and capture
some of those great jumps that you did
all right excellent now so let's say you
grab one of these it's completely
weatherproof and how much battery life
do we have um the battery lasts about an
hour and a half to two hours of HD video
but you can buy a couple spares and in
charge them ahead of time if you want to
be out there all day if you want to
record every single moment because you
don't want to miss something and and
really the limiting factor is the
battery because the micro SD goes up to
32 gigabytes so you can really get hours
of video to download and share online
with all your friends well it's great
that you support the the high-capacity
cards there now what's the weight like
compared to say a regular snowboarder
motocross welcome it's very minimal
difference people are surprised they
think it's going to be heavy our weight
issue has more to do with our underwater
products if you wear our heavy LED
lights but once you're underwater
they're buoyant so it's not an issue
it's just the camera components
themselves are extremely lightweight the
battery adds a minimal amount now
because when were you know is
snowboarding a moto crossing we're a
little busy how easy is this thing to
use on the go what you want to do most
the time is start your video when you're
starting your activity and so you'll
turn it on and we start in video mode on
these models and then just press the
upper button to which is your shutter
button and then that will let you start
recording so I suggest waiting till
you're stopped to stop the video and I
mean for scuba diving I typically will
take like a five-minute clip and stop or
even less or a little more depending on
what I'm looking at if you're really
racing down the hill we don't suggest
that you're pressing the button so
that's an important safety tip there so
let's take a look at the inside here how
complicated is it um you know we've made
it as simple as possible so first off
what you're going to do is you're going
to use the lower button and turn it on
and then when it's on you'll see the
blue light there and then this upper
button is your shutter so I'm going to
press it once and you'll see some
blinking in there to indicate that we're
recording see if I got it going and then
after you take in a you know a couple
minutes video if you want to stop it you
just press that upper button that
shutter button and then I can use the
lower button and switch to photo mode
and for the high action you can also go
through the high action 720p mode the
upper button your shutter so I just took
a photo yeah we have we have a lot of
lovely trade show pictures and then you
just press and hold to turn it off so we
want it to be simple it's to make
recording video really easy when you're
out there doing your sports now for the
photo mode like how many megapixels what
kind of size we're looking at here and
what kind of format yeah this particular
model is 12 megapixel interpolated some
of our cameras go as low as 3.1 it
depends on the model in the price point
because we have products there around
ninety nine dollars up to 400 so depends
on the model but
the video is really what we focus on on
all of our products because you're out
there performing your sport so we go for
HD and all the top lines all right now
so I'm assuming daytime no problem what
happens when you're you know skiing at
night Oh what we ok we have the lenses
that you can swap out so you can have
the clear lenses you could add extra
light yourself I know some I'm not
really a night's gear but I know some of
them have some you know decent lighting
there and you might want to experiment
your first time out try you know which
areas have the best lighting for your
video and you could always add on like a
helmet light or something like that all
right now I tend to wipe out I'm new at
this I snowboard but i'm learning US Ski
plays and skiing how durable say when
I'm riding the mountain on my face I'm
really about the same as another goggle
so hopefully you're not going to crash
too hard but you know and if you're for
the motocross you know if you have the
visor and things like that that helps to
protect so it's pretty much like your
other goggles pretty much any moment
motocross is wearing a daughter style
helmet and hopefully is taking care of
their face because we want you to be
safe and keep watching our videos all
