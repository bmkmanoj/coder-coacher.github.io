this time on Metasploit minute this
Metasploit minute is brought to you by
hack five and viewers like you
support us directly at h eh k shop calm
welcome to Metasploit minute they break
down on breaking in i'm rob fuller but
you can call me mu vixx this time we're
going to be going through a little bit
of a scenario where we've jumped into
and exploited one machine in the dmz of
this contoso comm site or whatever pen
test target you have or whatever
authorized target you have so we've also
sent a couple fishes in but nothing's
coming out like we we've talked to our
customer and they they said that people
have clicked on it but for some reason
they're not gonna get it a lot out well
this is the case and sometimes where
their proxy settings or some kind of
firewall settings is saying hey if this
is not a known domain or or the protocol
that's talking is kind of funny or if
it's doing something that is being
caught by hips or something like that
a lot of times it's not getting allowed
out well we've exploited a dmz where we
have w w data or www.hp.com PHP so we've
uploaded hop dot PHP as update dot PHP
up to this DMZ host and we're hoping
that in this scenario we have the client
machines going through to the DMZ
without their proxy settings and their
DMZ host being allowed to talk HTTP out
which makes sense and we're allowed to
talk to this HTTP server already we know
that so if we can talk to it and the
clients can talk to it we should have a
good Hotpoint into their network so what
we've done is set up another phishing
page the evil phishing page and we've
told them to download Bob calm because
that's how we roll so we've got Bob calm
on this host and they are going to run
it
that's going and they should start
seeing requests yet we see requests
coming in and now we are going to run
exploit - J on our multi handler we have
multi handler set up with the hop URL
and the reverse h hop HTTP from
Metasploit exploit - J and as soon as we
see another request from our exploited
system we see that we get one
meterpreter session pulled in and it
sets up it sets it up for the second one
to come in if we get another one so we
see the hop client coming in and it's
all completely loaded so that's it I
mean we it's a it's a complex scenario
where you're more and more going to see
this problem where the proxy settings or
the security settings on the perimeter
are much tighter but the dmz is still
allowed in and out on both sides of the
fence so what do you think - email me at
MSF at hack 5 org and stay tuned for
Metasploit minute comm for more shows
like these thanks again for supporting
the show and if you want to support the
show even more you can go to hae shop
com enter code move X and get free
Metasploit minute stickers until next
time I'll move extend I'll be hacking
til the cows come home
