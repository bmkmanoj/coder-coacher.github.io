is ruled illegal Skynet is real and
Microsoft Access Patch Tuesday all that
and more coming up now on threat wire
I'm Darrin kitchen and this is threat
wire for May 8th 2015
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
and I want to start out with a huge
thanks to everybody who supported the
show thus far in patreon oh my gosh we
could not do this without you it is such
an awesome community and let's get
started because oh yes that's right the
NSA program collecting American phone
records was deemed illegal by federal
appeals courts on Thursday hold your
applause they're giving an inch they're
keeping the mile the secret program came
to light in 2013 following Edward
Snowden's whistleblowing and a leaked
top-secret order the order was issued by
the FISA Court requesting Verizon to
provide the NSA with daily phone records
including that of domestic American
calls that's right the FISA Court
otherwise known as the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court it's
often called a secret court because it
holds its hearings enclosed and outside
the public and may many argue that this
lack of public oversight has led to it
becoming kind of a parallel secret US
Supreme Court I've been speaking just by
the numbers between 1979 and 2012 there
were nearly 34,000 warrant requests for
electronic surveillance only 12 are
denied okay but anyway back to the NSA
collecting American phone records that
was all supported by a portion of the
u.s. Patriot Act known as section 215
and the section permits the collection
of phone records deemed relevant to
counterterrorism investigations and
there have been three court cases on
this matter all of which have been
appealed and this is the first appeals
court verdict that we've seen so far and
it rejects the notion that bulk
collection of phone records can be
interpreted as relevant so the US Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled
unanimously declaring the program
illegal judge Jarrod Lynch stated quote
we do so comfortably in the full
understanding that if Congress chooses
to authorize such a far-reaching an
unprecedented program
it has every opportunity to do so and to
do so unambitious li the patriot act is
seeing opposition from congress in the
way of the proposed USA Freedom Act but
don't let the warm fuzzy name fool you
it is hardly going to nerf the NSA's
abilities in fact the very such reforms
such as the USA Freedom Act were
suggested to President Obama by none
other than general Keith Alexander then
director of the NSA you see it's a way
for the President and Senators to seem
like they're doing something about the
problem but it hardly addresses the
scope of the NSA's rampant
unconstitutional behavior at all there's
nothing in the bill addressing the most
hideous abuses to our freedom like the
mass internet surveillance or breaking
into cell networks hacking SIM cards
weakening encryption standards you know
all the really bad stuff but let's not
let's let the story become oh yeah that
word Snowden guy yeah wasn't he the one
that exposed the NSA was collecting
domestic metadata yeah that was totally
wack and illegal good thing Congress
passed the Freedom Act and we all live
happily ever after
please the interceptors reporting on an
NSA program dubbed Skynet which seems to
be a self-aware military computer system
designed to launch nuclear war to
exterminate the human race oh I'm
sorry the leaked document from
whistleblower Edward Snowden reveals a
Skynet is actually an NSA program to
analyze the location and communication
data from bulk call records in order to
catch terrorists the same metadata we
were just talking about being illegal
well how effective was the program if
you ask a mod as I didn't sorry for
butchering your name probably not so
much he's the bureau chief for the news
network al-jazeera and unfortunately for
him based on the leaked PowerPoint
presentation the NSA program identified
him as a member of al Qaeda terrorist
groups yay why well perhaps because he's
focused his career on reporting on the
Taliban and al Qaeda and the terrorist
group felt comfortable with dealing with
him as a journalist which led him to
being able to do interviews with senior
al-qaeda leaders such as Osama bin Laden
so Skynet program looks for terrorist
connections based on travel patterns
behavior analytics and other in
Richmond's PCMag reports Microsoft is
ending the monthly patch cycle known
lovingly as Patch Tuesday in favor of a
more immediate patching solution
beginning with Windows 10 IT departments
can use the newly announced Windows
Update for business which gives them a
little bit more flexibility over which
patches are applied and when it's free
for all Windows Pro and enterprise
businesses and may the blue screen of
death stay far from your servers our
featured comment today comes from none
other than me in response to the
aftermath and so many others who
questioned our support of Facebook's
internet.org initiative and I'll
paraphrase here but suffice it to say
what I'd really like about the efforts
from Facebook and Google is that they're
stirring the pot when it comes to
alternative Internet infrastructure you
see both Facebook and Google bought
drone companies in 2014 for the purposes
of delivering Internet access
and before that in 2013 Google
experimented with its own Project loon
to deliver network access from
high-altitude balloons and Facebook
launched this internet.org initiative
now I'm not saying that I'm looking
forward to a future where the access to
the Internet is controlled by the same
corporations that are providing some of
those popular websites on the internet
but I do love the fact that these big
companies with so much money to spare
are paving the way for a world where
we're not beholding to the likes of
Comcast and Time Warner for access and
as the technology matures and becomes
less expensive will hopefully find
ourselves in a place similar to
Johannesburg on the network's side and
other countries in South Africa where
some of the largest mesh Wi-Fi networks
are bringing people together with no
involvement whatsoever from corporations
or governments it's really a beautiful
thing I'm gonna leave some interesting
reading in the description and I look
forward to the ongoing discussion so if
you have some thoughts on today's
stories please leave a comment below and
before I go I want to give a huge thanks
