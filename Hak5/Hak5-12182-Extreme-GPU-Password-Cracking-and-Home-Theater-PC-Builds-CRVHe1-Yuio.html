by goto assist so does that mean that
you get to get away with buying a
cheaper card yes a $200 AMD card will
outperform a $500 to be apparent for
sure that's amazing and so for your
money might as well just get two or
three of them absolutely with hash Kat
your performance scales linearly so if
you have three cards it's gonna be
exactly three times as fast as at the
other one card so if you have eight
cards like I have in my rig I just
showed you there it is literally eight
times faster than if I had just one card
the performance scales absolutely
linearly the number of GPZ gap in the
system and then with VCO clustering what
we can do is we can say we have eight
GPUs in this box so we have eight GPS in
this box VCO provides an abstraction
layer that just tells hashcode hey we
have 16 GPUs use them however you want
and you asked earlier how those were
networked right now they're just
networked to be a private Giggy you know
local and they're not on the Internet
well they're on the internet but not
then clustering the parts on the
separate LAN but we're actually probably
going to move to an offender band for
the interconnect on those so that we can
get native PCI bus speeds to each GPU
nice yeah so to get PCI 2.0 speeds to
each GPU we need of that just like USB 3
the USB 3 like how does that work
so with InfiniBand infinite bands
proprietary cluster interconnect it's
used for things like it's not just used
for cluster and it's also used for
things like direct-attached storage it
just provides the physical medium you
know for high speed interconnects
InfiniBand goes up to something crazy
like 300 men 300 nigga second depending
on the spec and perfect not going very
far it shouldn't be too difficult to
implement exactly yeah everything is all
within the same cabinet and we're
probably gonna have to require a second
cabinet pretty soon so everything just
between two cabinets so yeah very short
cable runs there so Climie an idea of
the kind of performance of this
monstrosity you've built sure so right
now because we're only using Gigabit
Ethernet we're kind of network bound at
the moment when we move to InfiniBand
the goal is to dedicate 500 megabits of
bandwidth per GPU
so if we have you know and for the eight
GPU rig babies are gonna have four
gigabits of it's an era of InfiniBand
going to that node and that'll allow for
native 2.0 PCIT point o bus speeds and
that will allow the performance the
scale linearly just as it does in a
local system so if we have 16 GPUs it
will be literally exactly 16 times
faster than you can see what you can use
awesome and so can you give me kind of
like a an idea of performance as far as
like benchmarking is concerned throught
like any like hashes versus the key
space and what kind of time it would
take sure
so for ntlm using hash cat light with
1679 70s we can brute force that at a
rate of two hundred and eighty billion
hashes per second aka it doesn't matter
what your password is it might take at
the most three seconds sure the thing
with brute force is that you kind of
reach an upper limit to our no matter
how much power you throw at it it's
still gonna be hard to reach things like
leaf nine end but with Markov chains
what Adam has named brute force plus
plus and the new versions of hash cat we
can reduce that key space using a
threshold parameter to perform a
probabilistic brute force to where if
it's a user selected password because
users kind of think alike across the
board we can instead of exhausting the
entire ski space like let's say instead
of doing like length eight instead of
doing 95 to the eighth power we can
reduce that key space to say like let's
do 30 to the eighth and try only by the
top thirty most probable characters for
that key space and we can get results
insanely quick we don't have to exhaust
the entire 95th to the eighth we can sit
there and say we want this brute force
to run for exactly two hours let's do
thirty five to the eighth it just get
the top 35 characters for each position
and we can just obliterate a hash list
within a matter of minutes like that
yeah yeah I was just gonna
my last question was basically like
where can they find more of the stuff
that you're doing with
GIH richard consulting so we don't have
a website yet but i do occasionally post
on parish on blog which is security mr.
bannon blog spot.com
parish I'm is the organizer of the
password security conference in Oslo
Norway and he was also nominated for IT
security professional of the year it was
actually one of the four finalists for
IT security professional of the year in
Norway I think well yeah I'm a guest
blogger on this blog if you will so
security nirvana dot blog spot.com
awesome and bind shelled NL that's your
site yeah buying shell that NL is uh
that's more of like the password
cracking community site if you will
yeah otherwise if people are interested
in finding the stuff that you do day to
day should they just go ahead and
subscribe to on Twitter at JM Ghazni
yeah J I'm going on Twitter that
probably the best post you know find
up-to-date information the woman okay
awesome well thank you so much Jamie
absolutely Darren's been a pleasure
Cheers take care this time of the year
between holidays bad weather sick days
everyone is trying to spend some time
away from the office but taking personal
time is really challenging when you're
an IT I mean users always need to be
supported networks and systems always
need to be managed and that's why I'm
recommending go to assist from Citrix as
three essential support tools in one
easy-to-use integrated cloud-based
platform
there's go to assist remote support
which lets you provide live or
unattended support to any PC or Mac or
mobile device from anywhere even from
your iPad or it even in an Android
device with their free app so you can
take time away from the office to plus
with go to assist monitoring you can
proactively identify issues before they
become a massive headache no I used to
get those and you can easily keep track
of all of these things with go to assist
service desk when I was working IT and
DC go to assist products or a godsend
and let me tell you that they saved my
bacon a few times so check this out you
can sign up for a special 30-day free
trial today visit go to assist com
click on the try it free button
and use the promo code hak5 let's go to
assist comm from no code hak5 we have
the Roku the Google TV
there's the xbox360 the net gear neo TV
there's a Sony one I think there's a
Samsung one but you know what I say
don't buy any of them yeah was this make
your own of course why not I know right
so my problem was I really wanted to
have a browser on my television and for
the longest time I've just been using my
laptop but my laptop is kind of slow for
a video output so I was like oh maybe I
should just build my own home theater PC
it's interesting what you say and what I
love is that you say what you really
want is just a browser on your TV that's
all I want and surprisingly it is so
hard to find that because anything that
you buy you have to get these little
applications to run everything and you
have to go into different applications
to do every single little thing whether
it's Netflix or Hulu Plus or it's Amazon
Prime everything is different well you
know that again is just a really a
conversation of the difference between
like an app ecosystem versus using one
with cloud the web yeah and I prefer
things to just use the web browser
because I don't want an app if you've
already got it working in a web browser
now that said you've got a web browser
on you know Android you've got a web
browser on Google TV and both of those
you can get inexpensive boxes to plug
into your TV of course they have their
own app a co system for those I guess in
Chrome yeah the app is really just a web
page but you run into problems even then
like I remember just trying to use like
Hulu or Netflix I need a browser on any
of those until a oh hey dog we see that
you're using some other kind of computer
and so you crappy like interface
problems with your the stupid remotes
that come with them and the crappy
little keyboards on the remotes I think
the biggest problem for me is just the
the you know the way that the industry
treats different devices as if they are
not all just a general purpose computer
it's like computers how is your phone
any different how's the browser you
don't any different than the browser and
your desktop on my head cuz I don't pay
for Hulu Plus but I do watch a lot of
shows on Hulu
reason being was because a lot of the
shows that I want to watch on TV aren't
available as mobile applications you
know happens when you go to on on a
chrome box or not a chrome box on a
Google TV
it just says your dog not gonna happen
it says we don't we can't play this for
you because you're not a computer yeah
so I favor dislike you know what get
this Hulu I'm a computer actually my
favorite is trying to I recently try to
rent a movie off of YouTube and play it
on a chrome box and then YouTube their
message said yo dog we can't support
your browser on the YouTube movie
program maybe you want to update the
chrome and I'm all like yo YouTube I'm
as cruel me as they get I'm a chrome box
running chrome anyway I think that might
have been fixed sense but it's a
headache
yes so you're just gonna build a generic
PC yeah so you know I have plenty of
reasons for building it and I really
wanted to save some money so I decided
to build this one and keep it around the
three hundred dollar range so it's
pretty decently cheap not as cheap as an
Apple TV or any of those other little
streaming boxes that you can get
nowadays there's even a $500 Chrome
browser
yes there is chrome like I said yeah
exactly so I just want something that I
can you know leave booted on and so
literally get for 300 bucks all right so
first off you have the Mini ITX media
center HTPC case it's called like the
Japanese black case or something like
that and it's only about forty nine
forty nine ninety nine fifty bucks on a
new egg right now I bought all of these
products about like six months ago
look I just haven't gotten around to
actually building this thing sure oh
they have dropped in price a little bit
these two little guys eight gigs of ram
ha
yeah how much is that it was about I
want to say thirty to ninety nine I'm
just like amazed because I want to spend
a hundred dollars on 64 Meg's of PC 133
so it and this is probably overkill for
this motherboard but what's your mobile
so the motherboard is the Asus minimax
p45 m1l deluxe
in CPU combo so it has a CPU on it it's
a mini Mac yeah so this is the most
expensive part obviously it's 190 for
that but everything's integrated yeah
everything's already integrated this my
I think ports right there so okay
yeah house HDMI has a crapload of USB
ports which was super cool for me I love
that the Bluetooth module right here I
don't know if you can see this ball but
this is literally like a nubbin that is
like stuck in the USB port it's like
yeah you can kind of see it there anyway
it's it's kind of cute because it's
literally a bluetooth module that they
glued in that's I like that and then we
also have the Kingston 32 gigs
solid-state drive which I thought was
very interesting one with a solid-state
a spinning disk yeah you don't have to
this was kind of optional for me I also
got this Barracuda 2 terabyte Seagate
hard drive it's just an internal hard
drive and I was like that might be kind
of handy if I want to store some data on
it you know pirated movies or you know
podcasts I meant myself don't do where I
got just about hundred dollars and then
this one was $63 can you believe how
expensive solid-state drives are it's
crazy I've come down a lot man
so surprising so I want to put this
thing together so I can start using it
all right well as he just tosses things
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
