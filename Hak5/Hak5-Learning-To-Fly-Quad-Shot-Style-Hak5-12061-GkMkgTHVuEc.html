quadcopter from the pros Darren heads
down the Santa Cruz and meets with the
folks at quad shot plus frightening the
TSA out of spec cables and a whole lot
more this time on hak5 this segment is
brought to you by go to assist hello up
Mac by my name is Darren kitchen and
this is your weekly dose of technol us
and I am heading north on the california
pacific coast highway i'm on highway 1
this is so exciting to my right the miss
the one and only mr. Paul Tobias this
thing is so wide you can like totally
get a phone right oh yeah like probably
we're just doing fun experimental stuff
this episode kind of getting out of
studio as we like to do every now and
then because again and because we're
trying to do some innovative new stuff
for the next season and kind of like
beta testing some equipment here and
that figured hey what better reason than
to go down to santa cruz or you're just
outside of Santa Cruz to meet the folks
over at sea I just said folks that's how
you know I'm a hippie I said folks so
we're gonna meet the guys over at quad
shot because get this I finally took my
quad Shah out you know as you guys know
like we've been helping those guys out
with the their Kickstarter initially and
that we had them on the show and I'm
like fascinated with the whole like you
know
remote control and avionics and and
Arduino based auto pilot saw that cool
stuff so so I finally took mine out and
as the video proves I kind of suck as a
pilot well part of it I think has to do
with the fact I mean they've got good
directions on their wiki if you're like
a professional pilot of which I am not
so we can help each other out we're
going to do a little video with them on
how to fly so Darren's go into flight
school and so I get to learn to fly and
they get a cool video to show their
audience how to learn applying and it's
all fun so hope you guys enjoy this and
then of course we're back in studio for
some other bits and stuff but I just
wanted to throw it out there and see how
you guys are doing let us know in the
comments and it looks like we're coming
right up on them so see you real soon
cool I'm a walking camera tell me about
that what would I may even though so
basically the jobby energy they started
with with this rotary one so that we see
this hundred years then so this was
turning endeavor with a feather on it
yeah the very first very first ones is
this tiny one it's this green one yeah
one with the two red airplanes on poles
oh wow think of it as like a helicopter
without the body of the helicopter just
so you just got two helicopters opposing
each other on us this plan to remain
circles calling in a circle yeah and
then that generates lift and and all
that yeah so the wind would catch it and
make it spin my cool and it would and
then actual little electric motors on
the airplanes themselves would generate
villages because if you spin an electric
motor backwards to get power generator
yeah alright well look should we go see
the shop yeah sure sure let's go
yeah this is another part of the
incubator in the seventh of the gardens
north coast that is a like a politically
correct term for hippie farm or
something Wow
so this is where they're made well not
the you've already had the molds done
and what not but that's really the
assembled but this is really somebody
happens nice so we glue on the boxes
onto the sparse like that mm-hmm wings
gluons to make sure everything lines up
from be do the boxes and spars together
so what do you get from the factor just
just these plane just goes plain yeah
those plane in the boxes there's a box
there you can see this guy yeah it's
like that and then we had to awesome
yeah just are you like this guy screws
into that and the in the rails catch
there and then you put the bar it holds
its bar and so it holds the glue in
while its and holds it lined up wats ya
like hey how nice and so you know
everything fits right and it's yeah
right so i centered and everything like
that the markers yeah mine yeah yeah
like that
and you're you're good then their move
together like this uh-huh wow you guys
do like all of the nitty-gritty stuff
yeah I mean like I figured a figure that
you guys were having you know a shop of
assemble these and do the molds and
everything no original plan was to do
that but because the we spent so much
time getting them the wing molds done we
felt like it would be faster for us to
do this first batch so the next batch
that we do we'll will outsource the
assembly okay good Chris would kill us
because he's been ended up doing the
vast majority assembly and we wanted to
do that but he's gotten so awesome at it
yeah but uh yeah for now this is how we
go was the first run like a thousand
units or something knows a three or four
hundred yeah okay 500 sets of parts were
sewing on but but each one is made with
love yes so but yeah so the wings you
glued in the wires get on there's like
wire channels that hold all the wires on
the inside and he's just pushing them to
is a little hole in the box that they go
into oh wow and the motor controllers
are glued on
there then there's no like cheap acts
that you have to pull an assembly to
make a thing work everything came
together there's always two packs ya
figure out Muslim so then they yeah
Gavin this is kind of before the next
step so all the motor controllers are in
all them but all the wiring ends up in
the middle the LEDs are in and then on
the back of the covers are glued on or
glued in and this is what Bridget yaks
over the widget yeah and we call it dude
I doohickey the dude I do doohickey so
then from here we cut these two lengths
and soldering like the battery adapter
and then put in the put in the Lea brain
and plug everything in and solder the
LEDs this is just like the this takes
all four LEDs and puts them into one
spot so they can connect totally in one
spot in the power bottom Wow they have
this switch oh yeah because the idea is
controlling is turning out LEDs or not
huh and so what on a good day is your
kind of output or through plug let's say
a between 10 and turn your week yeah wow
it's uh it takes a little bit take some
time when we all in you can ask some of
the people that have kids and should
like after the first people got their
kids their comment was like I think I
now understand what your guys going
through you know they take a couple well
because the mocha comes all together but
which one's the one that comes as a kit
and a thorough espresso yeah yeah i mean
i was i actually started reading the
espresso wiki page not the mocha wiki
page so I'm like wait I have to and the
what and then I'm looking at mine I'm
like no that's already done I keep going
I'm like that's already done to so I'm
like I must be on the wrong page but I
was very thankful I was on the wrong
page how did you what you think the
manual that was another so yeah we also
writing the manuals were like moderating
the forums were
boxing and shipping out I just had the
hardest time finding I finally found the
secret sauce was like you know don't
touch it leave it with the everything
centered it was it was my trim actually
that was messing me up I kept on it was
just blinking it was like why is it
still blinking and then finally finds
like here are the four things that need
to come together before you can actually
take flight and for me it was the trim
so it's like as soon as I did that
everything that came together and then
it was like oh my you know yeah cool
that's what we hope I can cross this now
yeah we can clear that up today with the
video and show we definitely on a show
like when you turn it on that's if the
trims are off it'll blink at you and
these are what these are how you center
up all the three bolt and get it well
I'm just gonna pretend that I'm a moron
which is kind of easy to do and then you
can teach me and then if you can teach a
moron then you teach anyone all right
well cool let's do it but yeah you want
to grab a new like mocha out of the box
or do you want to start with cappuccino
and heavily assembly we have one that's
upstairs ah that is in the box basically
how it comes in delivered oh yeah that
looks ready go through the GoPro I like
it what's the LF capability of that okay
well we designed it basically carry
around in water yeah payload yeah
something like that but it's designed to
kind of fly nice and easy with a GoPro
were like something a little bit bigger
it's anyway after that basically we go
ahead to collect all those power wires
into this main battery pigtail you know
all these lights taillight wires are
sorted in and on the back we go ahead
and install the receiver and what we do
is we pre bind them with the transmitter
that's going with this vehicle to all
the transmitters are serialized and
program because we program the
transmitters darwin firmware or didn't
leave it to the factory from there nice
ah because they just work better that
way and then see how these are prebound
everything is serialized transmitters
and receivers and leases everything that
goes to vehicle belongs to that vehicle
essentially yeah so that you know when
you receive it you don't actually have
to go through and bind it or anything
this is also or so that you could fly to
quad shots at the same time right
exactly
nit it's challenging enough when your
team is working in the same office let
alone when you're supporting members
remotely and that's why you need go to
