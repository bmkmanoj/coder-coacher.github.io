some fast and easy hacking using
Armitage a front-end GUI from Metasploit
all that more this time on hack 5
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by the Ben Heck show building modding
and electronics culture brought to you
exclusively by element14 go to assist
express support smarter with go to
assist Express and domain.com got a
great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
calm hello welcome to hack 5 my name is
darren kitchen and I'm Shannon Morse and
we're in the same room I'm Aaron look at
this
we're in a studio well it's coming
together season 9 dude I know it's not
use mine it's closed yes weeks away it's
closed so we know what build mood when
we are on season 9 I will be in the Bay
Area
like literally moved out to the bay I am
so stoked right this is your last trip
here you're still our apartment hunting
I think I found the one today all right
what's with Eddie uh cuz I got plenty of
I don't remember
let's see I think it was in the East Bay
yes we stay or Morell it did a lot today
East Bay okay yeah sweet isn't the the
less expensive area yeah yeah there's
some great stuff in El Cerrito Albany
you know that fun stuff
yes but um that's what you tune in to
hear about what is it called real estate
yeah it's not the real estate hacker
show although that would be interesting
instead we're talking to all sorts of
fun good stuff with our good friend Rob
fuller
aka Rubik dick talking about his
favorite thing Metasploit oh yeah do a
great job over there rapid and and
there's a really neat front end to it
that gives it a graphical user interface
what's that um well it's called Armitage
okay which happens to also be one of my
favorite animes yeah I know I was just
thinking about and and yeah it's like
it's taking a security approach to
Metasploit rather than a hacker anyways
you'll see in the interview but it's
really good look important that has
Rafael over there from that project
talking about it demoing it it looks
great I can't wait to play with it
because you know well no I'm a
Metasploit but dude if it could just be
like now little like a nice gooey
yeah it's a nice gooey Oh Java the
cross-platform oh yes that
yeah that's that's what's going on this
week
cool a little bit of virtualization near
the end but that's the ground good now I
found out a little bit of information a
little bit of hacking news that I
thought you guys would find interesting
George Bronk you may have heard of him
he's this 23 year old guy he's pleaded
guilty to charges that he broke into the
email accounts of thousands of women not
cool of my book but he was able to do it
because he was like scouring them for
nude photos and they posted them on the
Internet I'm sorry women why are you
keeping nude photos of yourself in your
inbox or I guess it would be your sent
box yeah or maybe we just want to leave
those yeah it's stupid yeah delete those
ladies delete them trust me delete those
anyway he searched those ladies Facebook
pages and he was able to find the
answers to these really really common
security questions and then he just
easily logged into their email accounts
by sticking in those security questions
you just figured it all out like um you
know mother's maiden name yeah um if you
haven't figured it out by now don't
actually truthfully answer those really
calling commonly used security questions
because that's just plain stupid
now just don't do it we talked about
computer we've talked about passwords
yeah passwords like using password
hashes and using like different security
like software that you can put stick on
Firefox and whatnot right right
extension yeah bookmarklets
yeah yeah exactly but nobody thinks
about those security questions usually
they're just like oh yeah you know this
will save my life when I forget about my
password but you know people can find
the answers on Facebook and Google does
it right they actually allow you to use
your phone number and well that's still
it's moving the security from you know
the web to another medium which can
still be hacked in its own right or I
guess in that case fun freaked but at
least it's like another layer but you've
got to really think about like okay well
people can easily find that information
even if you don't publish it you might
be social engineer you got a bar on a
good time and they're like hey weird you
know like would you grow up where'd you
grow up I grew up enough
Leonard Wood Missouri no way shouldn't I
what middle school do you go to I went
to I would middle school no Mercedes so
did I in 77 or something oh no I was in
a Lucy I don't yeah then all of a sudden
I'm like mm we're Leonard Wood yeah so
yeah you can Oh social engineering baby
I just wanted this the same problem
because I switched over to sprint and I
don't know hey you had to answer your
security yes I had soy sign up for Tory
in fact
okay so I've like been making like whole
move to the day official work getting a
four one five number or local area code
or NPA if you will and getting a bank
account with like a National Bank or the
congratulations you thank you I finally
guys over back east but anyway yeah I do
too I happen to like oh okay Darren
thanks for creating your new account can
I just go ahead and get you to enter in
your security answers to these questions
like that's like yeah I was I was
certainly at the bank and she was like
just fill out these and I was like sure
and I was just like forty characters of
special you know special care bitch
everything you like yeah well she keyed
it in and it wouldn't take it and I've
got to say I'm not gonna name the bank
but dude come on people wait when you
collect your maximum and no special
characters ah yeah yeah what if your
mother's maiden name was sorry but the
dollar sign yeah percent I had some like
crazy commas and in yeah my own
place bang hamper hash hash Wacka Wacka
- I mean duh everybody knows your
security question about your uncle
congratulations buddy I guess what that
all said I kind of wanted to mention
that there's another fun thing we talked
about md5 hash Susan yeah things like
that in the past and I got a question
like oh well couldn't I just take my
mother's maiden name and and like make a
hash of it using like md5 or sha-1 or
something easily in Linux just echo
space whatever your secret word is and
then type md5 sum and you'll get the the
value you can also eternally do like md5
sum wacka-wacka
us enter type whatever you want hit ctrl
D and that'll trick it into thinking use
file you'll get the sum but couldn't
anybody do that then anybody could do
yeah that's and also md5
can be reversed yeah so there's not as
well maybe five-inch I wonder I'm just
saying
give that some thought and we're
interested in hearing what you guys use
you know for your security questions or
security answers stuff like that you
know what I use what I use a whole bunch
of words that are not in English and
then I turned them into leet speak hmm
and it works quite nicely for secret
questions especially if I use a secret
question that I can translate into
another language all right so I'm gonna
go get my Japanese dictionary and start
adding to some Japanese maybe it's a
Spanish huh do you speak Spanish as well
uh portal war you'll do fine here in the
East Bay and on that note we're gonna go
ahead and kick it up to move expand
thank you so much for joining with
Rafael and talking about armitage going
on the site running your own server
doesn't have to cost a fortune
domain.com Virtual Private servers start
at just thirty four ninety-five a month
and include all of the tools that you
need to manage any size website in fact
our own site hak5 org is running on one
nail take charge with cPanel Plesk
or even SSH in with root access as a
hack five view where you can get 15% off
your order at checkout when you use
coupon code make a five got a great idea
it all starts with a great domain domain
com
alright so today I am joined with refuge
hey ruff hey Rob how's it going good so
Raphael is the creator of Armitage now
Armitage is an independent GUI for
Metasploit now this is a really awesome
thing it has a ton of features built
into it it has all the whole trunk and
everything for Metasploit and it makes
it really really easy for someone who
doesn't know the consulate very well and
doesn't know how to get around to get
sort of a GUI intro to it and and use it
in professional time testing so thanks
for having coming on you have a demo for
us to show but real quick I wanted to
step back from that and say why did you
create Armitage oh well I created
Armitage because uh I used to work as a
security researcher and I've really
loved my work but a piece of guilt I had
was I didn't really know how to hack I
never worked as a pen tester and I
really felt to be in this field there's
a lot of value in knowing how to hack
it's something everybody if you're gonna
do do Network defense you should know
how to hack you should know what you're
up against right so I create armitage to
help people learn how to hack and bring
them into the process much easier
okay so Armitage is written in it's
actually written in Java and a language
called sleep sleep sleep I actually
wrote the language several years ago
I've been working on it since 2002 Wow
awesome
so it's in Java so that means it works
for Windows and Linux and the authorizer
board yep and Mac okay so it uses the
Metasploit RPC right that is except
daemon and you have to start that up
using the RPC Damon in Metasploit but
Armitage does that for you right they
can yes ah when you start it there's a
start RPC button if you click it it'll
start Metasploit statement for you if it
can put awesome and you need the
database code for it absolutely is it do
that as well or do you have to do that
mentally you have to start up the
database yourself okay but once it's
going and you have to actually plug the
setting it settings in okay if you're
using a Metasploit on Windows then
everything's configured for you in terms
of the database gotcha I'm backtrack
Linux as well the database is also
configured so you just have to start it
and Armitage has the settings already
set up for okay can you show us how to
do that
absolutely so let's go over here to
backtrack box okay and the first thing
we're going to do is start up the
database we're going to go to EDD see
init.d
and we're going to type MySQL start okay
okay so but Metasploit handles SQLite
which is deprecated but you can still
use it right I don't recommend using
that with Armitage though okay and
Postgres Oscar's yes okay
Postgres is perfectly acceptable so okay
we started up the MySQL daemon next
thing I do if you want star arm pitch go
to pen test exploits framework three and
if you type SV an update dot something
should do regularly I know you're bad
yeah you'll actually have Armitage
Armitage is in the Metasploit trunk oh
cool so I don't have to go get it from
anywhere I know it's just right there in
yes PN right awesome
I like it we come to my home page but
you can get it from the monster home
page oh you can get
at WWF fast and easy hacking calm ice
all right so okay so let's go ahead
we're in the Metasploit directory now do
an LS and you see there's the armed tej
executable so we're going to do dot
slash Armitage very cool hit enter and
here we go we've got our dialogue and we
get some choices here we can either
click start MSF which will start the RPC
daemon or if I needed to configure the
database settings click this little
question mark and it'll create the
little connect string for all right so
is all that default or some of that not
in there automatically okay so the DB
string on backtrack is in there
automatically okay and with the latest
version of Armitage on Windows it'll be
in there too because it reads the Yama
file with the Postgres database editor
ok so that's good to go you can set what
or select which DB driver you need and
if you're connecting to an already
running Metasploit like say you had it
somewhere else
RPC right Medus play RPC there excuse me
then you can punch in the username
password here if you're just clicking
start MSF use what's there it'll
generate a password for you
automatically awesome so let's go ahead
and click start MSF and as you can see
it's saying ok connection refused
connection refused it's working on
trying to connect to the Metasploit RPC
daemon here we go
using database driver - celts good sign
and there we go
the arms are going to this is on pitch
Wow ok can you describe the different
sections of armor of the GUI that yeah
absolutely so Armitage is organized
around the attack process okay up here
in the menu bars menu bar try to group
functional you might need for example
things to bring host into Armitage or do
an nmap scan up here in the host menu
you can import from an unnecessary and
maps can whatever you need to do so does
this use the importing that Metasploit
has in it or is this custom for you it
uses the importing that Metasploit has
ok so anything that Metasploit currently
can accept you can accept this way
absolutely ok awesome and if you're
interested in tacking which we'll get
into in the demo there's a tax menu
where you can launch client sides or get
recommendations for remote exploits ok
and we're going to do a client side
today yep
awesome very real world we're not
hacking since you know it's greater than
2003 right no more MSO a no 6700 yeah
knows anything all right
okay so let's not get kicked off with an
nmap scan okay all right and then as we
use the other features I'll introduce
them so I can kick off an map just like
I can in DB and map through Armitage
absolutely down here we have a
Metasploit console so anything you could
do in the normal Metasploit console the
tab completion that's all they're
awesome
you can actually get a nice little fine
feature if you need to search yourself
so if you go up now just a real stop do
you have it so that it stores what
happens in there anywhere in the text
file I haven't done that yet I do plan
to add some sort of reporting and
auditing features before I create those
I really don't know what people want or
need so I want to get a feel for that
before I create something that's just
bloat okay so where does someone send
like feature requests best way is to go
to the website or email contact at fast
and easy hacking calm okay I respond to
all emails awesome okay so continuing
along yeah right here we've got mass
play consoles so you can really think of
this as a GUI grown up around the
Metasploit console okay have used on
immunity debugger I have okay it's kind
of like that versus gdb you know a lot
of power but it's still a command line
oriented very good very nice okay so
let's go ahead and kick off an nmap scan
we could do it with just DB underscore
nmap or we can choose any of these MF
scan options I'm going to do a quick
scan that does some OS detection now
punch in my address range on one send
two one six one four six dot zero slash
24 so you going to put in your network
description like you would within map
and click OK okay now the scan is
complete and I'm pitched Ozzie what to
do next if you want to attack use
attacks find attacks and we'll go to
that in a second I'm gonna do them and
hit OK and what we have here is the this
is the target area this shows you the
targets that Armitage currently knows
about as reported by n map ok so each
host arm did you tries tell you what
kind of operating system it thinks it is
thanks this has your nice little image
looking how
you think it is like Windows for Windows
Mac for penguin for Mac and a printer on
there yeah this para one of the hosts is
running on cups other UNIX printing
being off so nmap thought it was a
printer some did shows you a printer
alright but you don't get any output
from nmap it just goes straight in a
database so I'm a big stickler for
running in map outside so and then
importing stuff that way you have
everything log and you can look for the
G map and map or XML and you can import
those into any tool would you recommend
doing the same thing or or do you
recommend doing it this way now I
recommend running and map outside of
Armitage and the reason for that is you
can actually see the progress of your
scan okay right now it makes a great
demo to go a hose and map scan it's
quick it's dirty it's easy but right
overall when you're doing an actual pen
test really run in map outside of so you
can save those are sort or results in
look absolutely and you can import them
so alright so not only we got everything
here we're going to attack right yeah
let's go now let's hack a box so I'm
going to do I'm gonna hit ctrl ass it's
going to change the layout of the hosts
real quick and put them into a stack
layouts just easier to visualize and I'm
going to delete this printer someone go
to host remove host and here we go we've
got our working set of targets if I want
to attack a host in Armitage I got I
have two options i can either launch a
client-side attack or i can use a remote
exploit okay so let's start things off
let's go ahead and kick it off with a
client-side TAC all right so you go over
to the module viewer what do you call it
the module browser okay
all of Metasploit modules are available
from this browser you can navigate to
any of them or you can search for one so
does the modules update with the SVN or
is it or do you have to put them in each
time vision you want it updates
automatically acts very cool which is
really nice Armitage will grow with
Metasploit awesome I have to add support
for the post modules but once I had that
then as new ones are added they'll be
available to you right so you actually
have two options you can go to attacks
and right here these menus show the
different client side attacks available
to you and it's all the ones taken from
the great level greater excellent rated
exploits okay because what I meant that
that level is based off of reliability
liability and if they exploit will turn
over the service or a process right or
box yeah great nuts are very safe mostly
safe reliable excellent or excellent is
usually something a flaw and logic where
grade is a memory corruption that's very
reliable and armitage gives you those by
default you can actually go to settings
and change that but we're trying to make
it as easy as possible without
overwhelming you so if I wanted to one
of my favorite exploits actually just
because of its universalness is uh under
browser attacks uh excuse me I can't do
that once it's new aversion of Armitage
which is not in trunk yet you can do it
that's why not work because this is the
version in trunk ok so uh well what
we're going to do is here we are in
console we'll go to what's a good one on
my favorites recently J doc released uh
a zero day for Internet Explorer but
it's rated the great level right right
so are not great it's good actually and
so it doesn't show up in these menus so
if you wanted to launch that attack you
can't you have to search for it ok
launch it could I launch it from down in
the console area absolutely ok so what's
up first off we'll do the module browser
and we'll do something from the council
a little bit later later but I'm going
to search for MS eleven because that's
where the exploit is and there it is ms
eleven I II CSS import if I double click
on it I get a little description of the
exploit for example this module exploits
a memory corruption blog good I changed
the URI a path to slash and change that
to eighty and I can change any of the
options by just double-clicking it and
let me edit it okay so the URI path
specifies where the exploit will be
hosted a right which a directory will be
served out of right because the
Metasploit i could serve multiple
exploits off of one web server instance
right so another neat thing to so you
can click show Advanced Options and see
a lot more options and you can change it
to those SSL you can do a bunch of
absolutely anything that Metasploit can
do right anything Metasploit you can do
you can change paradise one thing I will
say when you launch an exploit via the
module browser or the exploit launcher
it chooses the pale
for your armitage does oh okay that's
one of the things that it's a choice the
software makes for you because it's just
something easier it's usually the same
thing butter put on Windows a shell on
UNIX if you're using something that can
take Java meterpreter it uses that okay
so let's go ahead now launch our attacks
or just going to click Launch and
armitage will open up a new tab and you
can actually see in this case it's doing
use exploits windows all the things you
would type Armitage is doing it for you
so is that doing it through a resource
file no regular resource file or is it
just sending those commands to be RPC
it's just opening up a console and
sending the commands over are Penn
Staters okay so what I've got here is AC
local IP C where the web star is at just
highlight that let me right click now
let's go over to a victim machine
alright so I'm Johnny victim get over
all right Johnny victim me do this real
quick windows will go to Windows 7 a lot
of people are usually interested in
seeing modern operating systems back
what I'm gonna do paste in the URL here
and hit enter and see that little dot of
death okay now let's go back to our tak
console and watch the action and so all
this user did was go to this your up
that single URL yep you can send it in
an email or you can whatever you need to
do so you got a lightning mode what does
that mean that means we've compromised
the host our exploit a sucessful anytime
you compromised a host with arm tips the
computer turns red and gets lightning
bolts or awesome so does your those
armitage automatically keep the exploit
going or does it stop it after it gets
the first session in the case of a
client-side like this it keeps it going
okay can keep serving up exploits all
day long awesome alright so what's next
okay so one thing I find is people when
they first are new to Metasploit their
use like okay great I hacked the
computer but what do I do next
right so Armitage really focuses on post
exploitation one of the first things
we're going to need to do in this
special case though is because we're in
the browser we want to migrate out of it
that's because we got a memory
corruption bug right yeah we have a
memory corruption bug it's not so stable
in that memory space and if the user
closes the browser then our session goes
bye-bye
right so what we're going to do is
right-click the host we're you go to
meterpreter three we're going to go to
interact meterpreter shell okay and this
is just your meterpreter shell you can
do everything you'd normally do a
meterpreter right here we're going to
run migrate dash F which so we're going
to run migrate right but that's that's a
meterpreter script yes but you have
meterpreter migrate built into it what's
what's the difference here oh so I have
an option to create a new meterpreter
session with a to duplicate your access
okay so there's actually two options so
I'm one you can duplicate your session
mm-hmm we can give that drug see what it
does
the other option is you can open up a
process browser and when you open that
up you have the option to migrate into
another process okay but you have to be
either be an admin or have a process you
can migrate into that's it but the
meterpreter run my gray the meterpreter
script actually starts a new process
right right both the access duplication
to uh technique and migrate dash F both
start anew meterpreter gotcha
so migrated in sometimes the access
table duplicate access takes a minute so
we're just going to go up this version
meterpreter is not supported with this
script for upload exec that's too bad so
what we'll do is we'll just resort to
migrate dash F awesome and he'll go
migrating process 37 64 and the server
and I think that's it alright so let's
let's skip over to johnny-on-the-spot
computer real quick just to see if if
what happens on his side what will occur
the user she all right let's go ahead
and go over there so we're going to go
to a Windows 7 host alright so it's
still going so if he closes that though
like he's like oh no it's gonna oh my
god somebody did something so right
we'll just uh close that browser it's
kind of frozen you know I guess she went
to a web site should know right but we
still have our interpreter shell even if
he closes it since we migrated right
alright so you said post exploitation is
big in Armitage right right alright so
let's see some of that all right let's
go ahead and do that let's go back to uh
back track host our tack console and
here you go you can see we still have a
install session just to verify that
myself I'm a type system foe there we go
alright good I feel good about life so
some demo fail demo fail oh it's always
scary when your life's alright one
things we can do is here in the
meterpreter shell I can actually right
click and access the all the menus for
that session I don't have to go back to
the targets area all the time okay
and some things you might do is for
example I if I want to I can see what
processes are running on the host and
right here you can see at the bottom
notepad that's us alright because we
migrated out of the internet explorer
another option I can browse the file
system wow that's all that's amazing
yeah just typical stuff you can upload
download files rename them whatever you
need to do I like to think that like AOL
so easy to use no wonder it's number one
so okay so let's go ahead and actually
let's do something for real what's up
let's get become a admin ok oh great so
one of the ways you can ask fake
privileges Metasploit or meterpreter has
several localhost privilege acts
escalation exploits built-in so you can
click escape privileges under the ask
access menu and all it does is use the
git system command there we go got
system via technique for yay we're admin
so technique for is actually kid trapped
right right okay so that was patched in
lisam 2010 it was imagined 2000 2010
right right
alright yeah so we're using an unpatched
windows 7 box and okay now for demo sake
so any case so okay great we're adding
in well what are some of the things we
can do well if we're curious well one
things you might want to do is you might
want to go ahead and dump the hashes on
the host right and one of the ways come
for attacking Windows network is once
you have that foothold you dump out
what's called the Sam database and has
encrypted versions of all the passwords
people who've accessed the hosts
recently and you can use that to log
into other hosts okay it's called past
the Hat right as you're passing the
encrypted hash so we go ahead and click
dump ashes and operation fail but
parameter is incorrect
oh I'm bed demo day two I had to mention
demo fail so it obviously means there's
going to be a demo fail let's see yeah I
thought that try run hash dump just
right inside there yeah I'll be fine
that's pretty bizarre I'm kind of
perfectionist so it comes to my software
so there we go right after this I'm
gonna be like coding away patching this
one way or the other nice so when you do
run hash Dom you end up with several the
hashes let me just verify that these are
in the credentials database so let's
give that a mint refresh yeah okay
we're good great so one things you can
do is a pass the hash attack and the way
you do that is you highlight a host
that's on the same domain as that host
and right here you're like well can't
really do too much I can I've got a FTP
or HTTP open on this house let's go
ahead and look at this one and it's
telling me nothing that's X base shows
open on there yep that's our XP this
one's on the domain now okay so if I go
to services I can actually see that this
box is a FTP d5o that tells me Windows
this is Windows 2000 so and map lied to
us usually it gets a write in this case
but that's okay the miracle demos right
so we're going to do is well let's go to
attacks find attacks by port and
Armitage will run DB odd opponent the
background okay to get up a list of
potential tax it can apply this host
okay so it's not actually exploiting it
no it's not going after anything it's
just showing you a tax that I follow for
the host edit scene right and it uses
that to constructive attack menu for
each host so you can right-click that
host and see what attack options are
available to you
alright so how long does it take it
takes a it takes a few seconds so it'll
come back up in a minute or so there we
go
attack analysis complete happy hunter
happy hunting
yeah they even tells you you'll see an
attack menu attached to each host and
targets window so if we go over here
click attack go to SMB
and go to pass the hash okay we clicked
that and comes up and it's got all of
our fascists oh very nice yeah so you
don't have to a copy and paste kind of
convenient so I'm going to do a squad
nap you may use a reverse connection
here and that just tells the host to
connect back to me once it's success
okay and click watch now this isn't
actually routing through anything what
might get to that later but this is
coming directly back out to you right
this is coming directly back out to me
we'll set up pivoting in a moment that's
what my favorite features but you can
see here we were successful in our
attack okay
we've because computers turned right
little lightning bolts we got lightning
bolts
we've got lightning bolts so let's say I
want to tack other house let's say I
want to see what's behind that host okay
what other networks are available to me
and we do our basic ex post exploitation
after that right we willing we browse
files we do everything that we saw
earlier earlier absolutely but in this
case like okay once we've done those
things and we want to go further
maneuver into the network right so we
can do is I've set up pivoting so we go
to meterpreter for pivoting setup and it
gives us a dump of the different
networks available to this host okay so
if this was actually behind a firewall
or something we could actually route
through this session using the pivoting
and and hit other Bob so these boxes
were actually behind absolutely
something else okay so we click Add
pivot arm tidge draws this green line
and we want to do is do the control H
which is a hierarchical layout here are
cool and you can see it's got the pivot
host on top here okay right now any of
these house that were within the range
that pivot have a green line drawn to
the okay and well one thing you might
say though is okay well if this is
something behind a firewall experience
you have one I'd only have one right how
do you scan behind from a compromised
house because nmap won't go through the
pivot right what you can do is you can
use Metasploit discovery scans just
click MSF scans pop in that subnet and
it'll scan for you using all Bennett's
plates discovery modules all 19 of them
Wow okay very very very nice yeah so
just something convenient there so let's
say okay fine I want to attack one of
these hosts let's go over here and I
think we said we weren't going to do MSO
8:06
seven but I just all right this is the
demo exploit right definitely all right
so what we'll do is click on MSO eto 67
everybody has to use it yeah
and comes up here with uh all the
different options already configured for
us because we clicked on that host so
technically we could just click Launch
and it'll work if you need to set the
target for the X point you can do that
just click on it I know this is a
service pack to box so that guarantee
there's no demo fail alright so just a
real quick point to make sure is when
the exploit goes through Metasploit
riveting it's actually going through
your meterpreter session the exploit is
actually sending it through there
through them interpreter that you
already have right however once once the
payload execute on the exploited box
it's coming directly out to you it
depends if you're using a bind
connection or not I want to say and
correct me if I'm wrong on this but I
think it uses the actual session at
least out right so if you're using a
bind your routing will actually it'll
connect through the pivot host right
right in this case we'll use the bonnet
well we're not going to do a reverse
we'll just use the bind okay exploit so
where's God Claud everything's
configured for us I've said to XP
service pack to quick launch in there we
go you're not actually sure if that goes
through the pivot or not I think it does
I think I did like in that stat - an A
or something like that early on well
that's a good thing you know just to
throw a figure out so only wait please
work demo gods don't fail me and there
we go we got lightning got lightnings
even more because at pivots in use we've
got a bright green arrow
oh well indicating that the Oh actually
yes when you go to the console and you
type sessions just something here it
actually shows you the connections how
they're set up and chose to set up there
so you can see the peers okay so if we
go on this box we're going to we're
going to take our our demo to a closed
can we go on this box and see if it's
the net step yeah absolutely let's go
ahead and do that let's go to interact
command shout I have one thing I would
like to do
we close out demo we're going to do just
a net stat - na and I only see I see a
connection two one five two and that's
it that's it Wow okay so you definitely
if you're routing through you want to go
with the body
yeah well that that's if you a she's not
there because that bind it might it
might yeah the dialogue I mean stuff you
know you definitely want to test any
exports you do and how you do them
beforehand before you actually do them
live but for this demo this is working
amazingly right one thing I'd like to
show you too real quick is we kind of
bring things to a close is under
Explorer God do the obligatory screen
shot right right Armitage has a nice
little screenshot browser so you can
actually tell it to watch take
screenshot a ten seconds works with
webcam to or just refresh mm-hmm and we
can see that whoever here is working on
super secret stuff very nice and yeah we
got our secret stuff on our window I got
a hot dog got our goal okay awesome
well thank you for it coming on this has
been a really eye-opening view of
Armitage I've used it a little bit but I
didn't see some of these other amazing
little options and I hope that our
viewers will we'll try it out test it
out and send emails to contact that
that's an easy hack I'm sneezing hacking
um well it's Armitage she's fast and
easy can edit that out is nice
alright well I don't know who's Nick so
