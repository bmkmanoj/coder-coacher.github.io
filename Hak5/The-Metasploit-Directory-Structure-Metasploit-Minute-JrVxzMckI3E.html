time on Metasploit minute this
Metasploit minute is brought to you by
hack 5 and viewers like you
support us directly HHH all calm
welcome to Metasploit minute the
breakdown on breaking in I'm your host
Rob Poehler but you can call me Mel
Vic's in this minute we're going to be
exploring the Metasploit directory
structure now there are two main
directory structures that you're gonna
have to deal with
everyone knows the Metasploit directory
where you have been exploit installed in
this version where we're going to be
talked about is the get person that
we've already talked about in previous
episodes as well as the home directory
dot MSF for so this is in your slash
root or slash home user dot MSF for so
first off we're going to be talking
about the dot MSF for directory so let
me show you on the screen inside of the
dot MSF for directory where you have a
few things we have our database yeah Moe
or yml file which we already put there
that is by default loaded in as the
default configuration for for Metasploit
we also have that history file that
history follows all the commands that
we've typed
inside a logs directory is framework dot
log framework dot log is where if
anything goes wrong or inside of
Metasploit or MSF console you're
probably going to find that in that
information in framework log so in local
there's not really much there in loot
that's where all of our fun stuff is
going to be well we haven't exploited
anything yet we're going to get there I
promise but anything that you do as far
as doing screen captures are pulling
down all kinds of hash hashes and and
fun other things that we'll be talking
about goes in that loot directory by
default it's a primary location the
great thing about this being in your
home directory and we'll talk about the
other things that make this great but
since you can have multiple installs of
Metasploit we have the community edition
as well as the get version on this
particular Kalyan X thing
install all of that loot from either
install goes into this directory so
inside there we'll have the fun stuff
inside of modules directory let's get
back to modules now there's nothing in
there right now but the cool thing about
this directory is that all of the
modules that you create personally and
we'll be going into that in later
segments on how to create modules all of
those modules you can throw them in
there then you don't have to worry what
Metasploit run you're running all of
those modules are automatically loaded
from this directory this way you don't
lose your modules either when you do a
git pull or get update or reset or
however switching back into the plugins
directory now the plugins directory
mirror just like the modules directory
mirrors the plugins directory that we're
going to be talking about in the
Metasploit directory these are all of
your personal plugins your personal
plugins can do own either much more
feature-rich than a module so a module
can do a number of things in its
particular instance and how it runs
but plugins are Metasploit wide or MSF
console wide and we'll be showing those
also in the schema directory it's
basically database schema information
and that's it for the dot MSF for
directory switching back over to the
Metasploit director we have a ton of
directories on a ton of binaries so in
the config directory of configuration
data in data we have all kinds of
information cool thing about this
directory as a word list directory and
when we switching over to wordless lots
of word lists for you to use in your
exploitation stuff lots of defaults that
are known by a collective of pen testers
and Metasploit developers SIDS and
default Tomcat credentials and
what-have-you so we're going to switch
back into our main directory so next up
is the database that's database
information doc now this doc directory
isn't there by default how you do how do
you create that doc directory as you do
yard space doc
now that's already created I'm going to
cancel that that's already created and
once that's done once your doc is done
it's basically generating documentation
on the fly from your Metasploit
directory and it makes it in a very cool
way where you can just host it yourself
that way you never have to have a
internet connection to look at all the
documentation for Metasploit so inside
of that directory once you switch in
there you can type python - m simple
HTTP server this is a great little
one-liner that creates a web server
using Python and as you can see HTTP on
all ports 8000 I've already got this
pulled up over here and you this is a
fully featured documentation so if I
pull out the methods list and I start
typing it's going to give me all the
message methods for different things so
maybe Rex and this is going to take a
while so this VM is a little slow but
and there is so much this this is a
project that is massive so there's so
much in there that sometimes it takes a
while to find what you're looking for
but I guarantee everything that you are
looking for is in there so let's switch
back over to our Metasploit directory so
inside of there that documentation
directory is where we find all over
documentation external is where we find
all of our external source code anything
that is pulled in the Metasploit with
its source available there that since
Metasploit is an open switch project the
library directory or Lib directory of
course has all libraries modules is
where the magic happens module directory
has all of the Metasploit modules and
that's really the heart and soul of
Metasploit if there weren't modules
Metasploit we really wouldn't do and you
do much so we'll be going to into
modules a lot more in depth in later
episodes plugins directory I already
talked about those in the dot MSF for
directory plugins so again they are a
way to do stuff automatically inside of
MS
council or the instance or the section
or whatever of Metasploit so Scripps is
a bunch of scripts everything from
meterpreter scripts to resource scripts
we'll talk about resources and
meterpreter scripts later specking tests
are our test cases on how you can make
sure that Metasploit or anything that
you've changed in Metasploit doesn't
affect the rest of it and the tools
directory tools directory is pretty
interesting that's actually looking
there real quick it has a bunch of
different tools in here that are not
exactly Metasploit modules well they're
not Metasploit modules but they're built
in for Metasploit for other things so
one of my favorites is this piece is
that RB now PS executor RB is a PS exec
external to Metasploit so if you need to
pass the hash and we'll talk about that
later if you need to pass the hash
without having any kind of Metasploit
installed somewhere you can take PS exec
RB you can compile it into an executable
run it on a closed environment and have
passed the hash abilities to your
heart's content without having
Metasploit for you
MSF PI D is another one that I'll
probably killed if I don't mention MSF
Tidy is a awesome little script that
checks your Metasploit modules to make
sure that everything is in the right
place and documented it and done
correctly so that when you submit it as
a module to the github repository or the
the Metasploit project they won't yell
and scream at you for missing a space at
the end or a new line or whatever and
that's it for the directories so let me
know what you think hit me up at MSF at
hack 5 org stay tuned to Metasploit
minute comm for more shows like these
until then mu bik's and i'll be hacking
til the cows come home
yay
demo awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
