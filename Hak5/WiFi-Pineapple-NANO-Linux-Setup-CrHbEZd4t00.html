setting up the Wi-Fi pineapple Nano in
Linux so let's get started first step is
to plug in our Wi-Fi pineapple Nano I'm
using the USB Y cable here and I'm fully
booted because the light is solid blue
so if I come over to my laptop the next
part is to download the latest firmware
from Wi-Fi pineapple comm slash nano I
have that already here in my downloads
directory and if I issue LS USB I'll
notice that I have an Asics electronics
or Fast Ethernet controller that's right
if I now do if config and grep for ETH
I'll notice that in addition to my
standard eth0 which is the Ethernet port
on my laptop also have a new Ethernet
port which is over USB and in this my
case it's ETH 18 because we've been
doing a lot of development and testing
with Wi-Fi pineapple nanos yours will
probably be ETH 1 or 2 with that said I
can now if I do a tiff config f-18
notice that I have an IP address on the
Wi-Fi pineapples Network so to complete
the setup we browse to 172 1642 1 colon
1471 click continue and for security
what we'll need to do is on the reverse
side of the pineapple press the reset
button once and click continue then
we'll click browse and from my downloads
folder I'll choose the bin file I just
downloaded and click upgrade now this
process takes about five minutes so just
be patient wait for the light to stop
blinking when the light solid again
we'll continue with the setup the
firmware flashing is completely blue
light is solid and we're greeted with
this welcome page if not refresh the
browser and the next step is to click
getting started now for secure boot we
need to go ahead
and set it up by pressing the reset
button verify our ownership of the
device and we will be asked to go ahead
and set our passwords and SSID and we'll
login and our Wi-Fi pineapple nano is
now setup so let's go ahead and get our
internet connection sharing going for
that we'll want to download the WP six
script so W get from Wi-Fi pineapple
comm /wc six sh will now make that
executable with chmod plus x WP six sh
and if we now run WP 6 sh will be
notified that we need root access so
let's run that with sudo and it's simply
a matter of answering the questions by
default we have these network
configurations which may or may not work
for you they aren't correct for me
because mine is on eth 18 but I do have
my Wham through wlan0 so I'll say no and
answer the questions and we'll save
these settings for next session so we
don't have to do that again and now
we're connected so we come back over to
our Wi-Fi pineapple we can load
bulletins from Wi-Fi pineapple comm we
can check for the latest firmware
updates we can download modules
over-the-air so leave the comment let us
know what you think and I will see you
on the Wi-Fi pineapple forums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
