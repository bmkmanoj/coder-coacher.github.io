by netflix here at Def Con of course not
only is it about the wireless crazy
stuff going on or the UAVs in the sky
it's really about the people that's why
I'm here with Jason Street hi Jason hi
nose and of course geo from our favorite
contour cock hey to be here now tell me
tell me the people's story about Def Con
this year um it's all about barcode i
don't know if people out there know who
he is but he's a friend of ours that is
in a little bit of an issue right now
health wise and needs some marrow needs
some blood and so jason i have put
together a challenge here we actually
brought in a blood bank i had people
within the first hour we first hour the
entire day was booked with the blood
bank people she spent her entire day not
taking peoples in but turning them away
we had a phenomenal turnout it was
incredible so how do you go about
bringing a blood bank to Def Con yeah it
was it took a lot of phone calls it's
like it just started off in the forms
when you hear about bar code so gonna be
in sick and actually I went down to try
to donate and because of my issues I
couldn't go so it sounds like well does
Gary buddy else going and def con dark
tangent and Cheryl and stuff you know
from accommodate they like pulled
together got some space ready available
and we told the blood bank look we've
got a lot of people that really give
blood it's like over 12,000 people going
to be there that's a good pretty good
pool to work with they usually do it
three months in advance it's like
bookings in like in less than three to
four weeks they're able to at least give
us one day and stuff to do it it's like
otherwise they would have been you know
here the whole time but it's like
probably a lot more alcohol you know
induce but then but but but at least
it's like they would still be able to do
a lot more donations and stuff you know
and then we're trying to work on it
again next year too so if I can keep
this going it's the main thing it's just
that it's about showing that hackers are
trying to work together to think we're
not just trying to hack into computers
we're helping we're part of the
community and this is a really big
community helping each other so they're
like a goal you were trying to achieve
when you set out to start this project
um yes and no we actually had a personal
challenge that if we can get enough
people together we're both going to get
Mohawks
but we have just a ton of people in
there we've got people doing to be the
match with marrow matching and hopefully
a lot of people that didn't get a chance
to donate now are going to head home
find their local blood bank and be able
to donate and Matt's name all the
information is up on the DEF CON forums
for that and is there a particular
website specifically where can people
can find out how they can get involved
with this I mean if you know barcode and
you know you know you want to do
something something good for your fellow
man how do you go about that well the
main thing is just find your local Red
Cross and do a blood donation there at
your local blood donation center but
also go to be the match to org they will
send you a kit and trust me it's like
it's just a little con swab you put it
in it's like an you mail them the cotton
swab and then you're now registered as a
bone marrow donor and it is just that
simple and they said you the kids self
postage and you sent it right back to
them I think between this the eff
hackers for charity if you got the idea
that hackers were about stealing your
private information you've got it all
wrong hackers have some hearts thank you
