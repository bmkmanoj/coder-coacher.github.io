by domain.com okay so we're just gonna
sing right hello welcome to hack five my
name is Gerren kitchen this is your
weekly dose of technology
normally there's someone over here that
says to Nemours and everybody goes yeah
Oh what are we really doing this we're
gonna have a problem here season 10 is
next episode like like episode 10 season
1 reverse that anyway
Shannon something happened you're gonna
find out here real soon we got some
security cam footage we're looking for
your help but that's not why you tuned
in you tuned in because hey it's the end
of hack 5 season 9 and we are ramped up
because every August in Las Vegas the
just wonderful conference that is Def
Con I share I'm don't need to explain it
to you guys but this is the big one and
we're super excited to be part of the
the whole Def Con experience if you will
so of course took the whole act team and
traveled down to Las Vegas for to find
out what is going on at the the nation's
largest hacker conference and this is
our first part of our two-part series on
Def Con this year and we hope you guys
enjoy it stick around to the end for
more information on Shannon and that
thing but until then just going to
remind you guys to trust your techno
list and I will see you a little later
yeah huh okay Paul I guess we'll like
pan somewhere yeah that is that good all
right yay
hey evil server where are the guys they
will be late
geez I'm kind of surprised after Vegas
it was good we shot a whole lot of stuff
for high five an octave movie soldier
my father was an NT 3.51
sir Ron well I stand by my word and he
was crap
I will die NT was crap then and it is
crap now and nt4 wasn't any better yeah
what what is your sister she what if she
windows any it's no wonder your grumpy
departure is not know here at DEFCON 19
very excited to be checking out the wasp
again Mike dude
rich so excited to see you guys again
this thing in the talk of the con it was
so much so last year and even more now
tell me about the upgrades what's going
on with the boss well like like we
talked about last year we went ahead and
put open BTS and the USRP on the plane
so when we can now do GSM cell phone
meddling which is the the big interest
this year and additionally we made some
changes to the flight surfaces and we've
upgraded the hardware so we're now
supporting a one gigahertz processor
versus the 500 that we had last year and
we've redone our base stations or base
station now is a lot smaller and a heck
of a lot more versatile cool so tell me
about just the practical capabilities
first before we get into the
nitty-gritty you mentioned open BTS you
mentioned you've got all the new your
Wi-Fi cards in here what are the
different vector
of attack that this thing well we've got
both active and passive attacks with
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GSM we can do your
typical kismet war flying we can
incorporate the the uber tooth one is on
the aircraft now as well so we can do
grabbing a Bluetooth packets but we can
also do a you know active attacks we
have onboard 4G internet connections so
we can provide Internet service via
rogue access point you know suddenly
we're now flying Starbucks connect
through us and we can watch all your
your nice porn we can do the same with
the GSM we can do the passive attacks of
just grabbing the the mzs and then
potentially reusing those to make phone
calls on your dime or we can actually
reroute your phone calls and send them
to your a sip or VoIP backhaul and
actually record or redirect your phone
calls how hard was it to implement the
open BTS for the the gsm cell phone
hacking stuff well it should not be hard
but as with all things open source the
documentation sometimes does not reflect
reality
so although it is doable it's difficult
there's a steep learning curve but it is
eminently possible by anybody with
enough enough wherewithal to because you
guys are standing on the shoulders of
giants here with like Chris Paget's
research on here dragons like kismet
like it's all of these off-the-shelf
stuff how much of this is just you know
off-the-shelf like the avionics and
whatnot and how much of it where did you
have to build custom very little of it
is anything that we actually
custom-built just some glue scripting to
do the you to handle all the componentry
and make a talk but beyond that almost
100% of the plane is either commercial
off-the-shelf stuff or open-source so
very little of it is that is actually
our work beyond the putting it together
and making it fly
I think that's the beautiful aspect of
it cuz this just says like anyone can go
out today and build one of these what is
again the platform that this is sitting
on here this drone it was built on an
old army fqm 117 B target drone so the
the argued run wait so this was
to be shot down absolutely a soldier
would fly it around and his buddies out
in the field would aim their rifles and
practice their anti-aircraft gunnery
skills on on this scale model of a MIG
fighter they of course went out of use
in the mid-80s and rich happened to have
one in his basement and so we used that
one and and it worked out so well we
bought as many as we could find to pay
for army surplus yes
thanks Uncle Sam yeah so what are the
what are the payload capabilities of
this guy are you kind of reaching the
limits now that you've added so much
more to it well the design
specifications for the for the airframe
itself
call for up to 20 pound takeoff weight
we're sitting it right around 14 pounds
so we've got a little bit more weight
room that if we needed we could add
that's six more pounds of hacking right
there six more pounds of a lot of stuff
the issue we're running into now is
actually physical space without actually
you know starting to hang things off the
bottom or underneath the wings or we've
got a tiny little space right in here
that's big enough for something this
nice for event yeah yeah your logo here
that's awesome so USB hub you see the
uber tooth here we've got the porgy what
is this guy right here
that's the USRP specifically the
specifically the 900 RF X 900 the
support so this is what lets you do the
software-defined radio what frequencies
is M it's a coke a so it's a 2.4
gigahertz spectrum yes well no it's it's
gonna be in the 900s oh and the 900
acres back in 5.2 nice so yes we're
legal we're inside the ham radio
fidelity 10 meter band let me talk to
you about that because you know flying
around a drone with a whole bunch of you
know wireless hacking here you would you
would expect it to raise a couple of
eyebrows how does how is this you know
as far as in the eyes of the FAA and in
the eyes of the FCC if you want to build
a video site or if your website has a
play button I recommend getting a dot TV
domain you see a dot TV website lets you
showcase your original content and
create
unique sight that's just another YouTube
channel just head over to domain comm
and search for the perfect TV domain for
your new idea and then use the coupon
code hak5 at checkout to save an extra
15% and if you need hosting for your dot
TV website don't forget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
