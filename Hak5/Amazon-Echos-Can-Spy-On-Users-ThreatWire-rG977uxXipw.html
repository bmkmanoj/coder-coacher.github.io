of hotel rooms Amazon echoes could spy
on users again in a genealogy website
DNA database was used to capture a
killer all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings I am Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for May 1st 2018
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
our patreon is over at patreon.com slash
threat wire and that is always the best
way to support the show and will help us
reach our next goal so if you want
access to exclusives check out the
patreon link in the show notes below and
now on to the news hackers at
cybersecurity firm f-secure were able to
build a master key that can unlock
thousands upon thousands of hotel room
doors reported on news sources on
wednesday the master key which is
actually several technical components
specifically used together for this task
can be swiped against doors using the
vision by Veen card locking system which
apparently is currently used in 42,000
buildings in 166 countries it leaves
absolutely no trace of it being used and
it takes less than a minute to build it
researchers Thome - a Menon and Timo
here bounine used an old electronic key
card from BOE target building they could
simply use a key card from a room that
they had booked or by copying the key
card of a nearby hotel guest or employee
then they overrode the data with a
portable programming machine called a
proxmark 3 which costs just a few
hundred bucks F secures custom software
allowed for this to work and the RFID
reading and writing device is simply
swiped at the target door which can then
match correctly in under a minute
they responsibly disclosed the
vulnerability to vision by Veen card
manufacturer ASSA ABLOY back in 2017 and
they have worked together with them to
create a solution software fixes have
been available since February of this
year which randomizes the key space and
allows for a better generation of those
keys no proof has been made publicly of
this hack happening in the wild but
according to the duo they were first
inspired when a colleague's laptop was
stolen 15 years ago from a hotel room
during a convention
where the thief left no evidence of
forced entry the researchers will not be
releasing the code to allow hotels time
to update each of their locks which must
be done physically at each and every
lock now to prevent this from happening
while you are staying at a hotel make
sure to use the door chain while in your
room and keep valuables in a safe or in
a secure place
so anyone entering your room will find
nothing of value to steal the Amazon
echo device has an open API which allows
developers to make their own custom apps
this is what allows the device to work
with other texts such as Belkin Wemo x'
thermostats hue lights so no speakers
and the list goes on and on but the
cybersecurity firm check marks made a
POC or a proof of concept that allows
the echo to indefinitely record audio
data so it's basically eavesdropping on
conversations happening around it built
in the echo wakes up when a trigger word
is said which I won't say here to spare
your own devices if you own one and it
will record for a short period until it
goes back to sleep the malicious app
looks like a calculator and it starts
recording when a user says the wake word
start calculator and the audio data is
sent as a transcript to a third party
website now in a video showing the app
and use the researcher shows that his
speech is transcribed into a text doc
and the echo device does not give any
audible cues to tell the user that it is
still recording it does though still
have its blue light on which is a cue
that it is still recording now at the
end of the video the researcher just
says the wake word stop to make the echo
stop recording and the blue light goes
off in order for this to work echo
queries a line of JavaScript code that
says should end session and if not
triggered it remains open to continue
the conversation with the user if it is
supposed to end then it stops recording
and responding now normally echo prompts
the user with an audio cue but in
checkmarks version the echo does not
make an audio reprint
just keeps on listening Amazon has been
notified of the vulnerability and they
have already fixed it by regularly
scanning for skills that record for
unusual lengths of time and they kick
them out of the official store
according to threat post the problem has
been fixed as of April 10th this week's
big story chosen by patrons is all about
DNA
on Thursday reports surfaced about
investigators using DNA from an online
genealogical service to track down and
detain James D'Angelo who was suspected
of going on a crime spree of raping and
killing between 1974 and 1986 in
California and four decades later he was
attributed for committing more than 50
crimes against women and 12 murders and
was known as the Golden State killer or
the east area rapist D'Angelo is 72
years old and his DNA was matched to
that of DNA at a crime scene
but how did investigators link the two
they use the crime scene DNA and
compared it throughout the years to a
couple of genealogy databases online to
which they finally found a match that
was a distant relative of D'Angelo these
genealogy websites cater to users who
simply want to know more about their
ancestry sites like 23andme ancestry DNA
and my heritage they all do this kind of
work with for example a simple saliva
swab and they can link you to
interesting data about your family's
past your health and a lot more one
service called GED match stated on
Friday that it was their database that
helps off the case investigators use
that DNA linked it to a male of about
the same age and location and tracked
down D'Angelo
they then used abandoned DNA samples
from D'Angelo to make the match
abandoned DNA is on items that are
thrown away or they're left in a public
domain such as a coffee cup that is just
randomly thrown away in a trash can on
the sidewalk they then use two samples
to evaluate against the crime scene DNA
and it matched for much of the
Sacramento area law enforcement this was
a cold case until the technology was
available to continue on with the
investigation
D'Angelo who is a former police officer
himself was arrested on two counts of
murder but faces 12 total counts he may
not face any trial for the rapes
committed because the statute of
limitations has expired of course there
are privacy concerns with a case such as
this one when a user decides to upload
their DNA to a website for ancestry
purposes do they also consent to having
their data used in crime investigations
GED match says that yes they do
according to their own policy on their
website and advises users to delete
their data from the database or not
upload it at all if you are concerned
about it but even if you don't upload
your own data a family member could and
since you share some chromosomes with
your family members they also hold a key
to your privacy and in the case of GED
match no court order was needed to
access the database this could set a
precedent for future cases and warrants
to gain access to other sites that store
databases of DNA evidence
patrons make sure to share your favorite
news stories in the community tab or on
discord as well every Friday I'll pick
three or more top stories for a voting
poll that patrons can vote on to be
included in next week's show
patrons also get access to an audio RSS
feed first looks at show topics polls
and discussions just for patrons
behind-the-scenes photos and now that
discord server just for patrons at two
dollars a month and up join now and get
access to all of these and you get to
help support the show and the next go
