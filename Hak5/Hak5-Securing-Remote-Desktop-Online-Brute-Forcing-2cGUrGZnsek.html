to you by go daddy Netflix and the HP
media smart server powered by Microsoft
Windows Home Server hey guys welcome
back to the kitchen I'm gonna follow up
on our brute-forcing segment from last
time we were here except I'm feeling a
little under the weather so I'm gonna
bypass the whole hash salting with
margaritas until I'm feeling a little
bit better so in the meantime last time
we did offline brute-forcing today we're
gonna talk about online brute-forcing
with some chicken noodle soup we've got
some homemade goodness but before we get
into the ingredients let's get into some
theory see the biggest difference
between online brute-forcing offline
obviously is you're connected to
something right you're you're hitting
something that's live your and in most
cases there theoretically is somebody on
the other end right and and it's
obviously much slower I mean we should
off GPUs where you can get like you know
thousands and thousands of attempts per
second and we're gonna really be
calculating our attempts and minutes now
I before I get too much further I must
stress that I am taking the angle here
of of counter measures so while I am
showing some online brute-forcing
demonstration really what I want to
highlight here are some of the ways that
you can use this to protect yourself and
this is really just it's an it's a good
example for many other types of services
that are susceptible it's very similar
things so the practice is kind of
similar so the cool thing is online
brute-force attacks you know if you're
the this administrator on the other end
what not can be detected it's just a
matter of are you looking are you
looking for the right thing and if you
are and if you know what you could do
there's lots of things that we can do to
actually reduce the effectiveness of a
brute-force attack so in our
demonstration we're going to be using
terminal services a wonderful service in
most Windows servers hell it's even in
Windows XP you've gotten it enabled it's
a beautiful little thing that lets us do
remote access using remote desktop
connection RDP get our our remote
connection on and it's nice because it's
pretty ubiquitous across the board on
Windows operating systems and make
systems administrators lives like
actually usable so anyway let's go ahead
and get into the ingredients now for the
hack our ingredients are really nothing
more than an map to find our target and
a program called TS grinder which is an
online brute-force attack program for
for Microsoft Terminal Services for
remote desktop connection okay as far as
the chicken noodle soup is concerned you
know forget that stuff in a can
I'm feeling really sick I want to make
some homemade stuff and feel good right
so we've got a pound of boneless
skinless chicken breast right we've got
four of these cubes this is new to me
for these cubes bullion cubes correct me
if I'm wrong in that pronunciation but
that should be cool eight cups water
already in there we got we got gonna do
two cups of egg noodles then it's gonna
be yummy we've got a can of chicken
chicken broth and a CH can of cream of
chicken just to make a little creamier
right and then we've got some chopped
carrots some diced celery some diced
mushrooms we're gonna throw some onions
into the boil and a little bit of garlic
and a hack five shot glass that's what
we're gonna do so basically we're gonna
put it all together except for the
noodles and we're gonna let that boil or
not quite boil they right under boiling
for like a half hour once the check
it's cooked it's gonna like soak in all
that goodness and we're going to take
the chicken out we're gonna chop it up
and then we're gonna pop it back in with
the noodles until they're really yummy
and then we're gonna serve it and
hopefully I will start feeling better so
let's go ahead and do that all right
here you go
gonna throw this in there you don't you
don't like the chicken you familiar with
that brand all right that's what I
thought let's not forget her onions all
right so well snubs is helping me out
here let me paint you guys the scenario
it's Joe our sis admit and Joe are
assisted men he just set up a wood new
Windows server and his boss like many
bosses before him want him to be
available off hours in case of any kind
of emergency we're not gonna get into
the whole overtime pay thing now to make
his life a little easier Joe decided to
open some ports in the office firewall
to give him access to the remote desktop
feature while he's at home well Joe is
confident about his Windows boxes
security you see he's got automatic
updates turned on and he's picked a
pretty good password it's ridiculous no
I mean it's our exclamation point the
exclamation point see you 1-0 you five
ridiculous
well then outta nowhere pineapple of
evil servers show up and they fire up
nmap and they look around for anything
on port 3389 and then they see Joe's
server and then they fire up TS grinder
an online terminal service brute-forcing
tool and then they use the - delete
option with a really big dictionary file
and they put in at Joe's server and then
pineapple has Agra whiskey sour and then
he passes out an evil server does all
the dirty work and since the brute-force
attack takes place over an encrypted RDP
connection and he would be intrusion
detection systems don't notice and since
T s Grindr disconnects after five failed
attempts nothing is written to the event
log so Joe doesn't even know well
eventually evil server gets in and
pineapple maliciously defaces his
Windows wallpaper with a rude comment
about Joe's mom now without getting too
detailed into an already pretty simple
hack let's just take that for what it is
and
talking about countermeasures now keep
in mind I'm using Windows Terminal
Services here as an example and this
could this theory really applies to just
about anything online that you can
brute-force so as far as the Windows
server is concerned there's a couple of
little techniques that we can use here
to reduce the effectiveness and the
likelihood of this type taking place now
on our Windows server the first thing
that we're going to want to do is come
in here and rename the administrator
account the administrator account by
default has access to to Terminal
Services to you know remote desktop and
we're gonna want to change that to
something else so I actually have a
script here it's a pretty simple visual
basic script that we can just go ahead
and call from the command prompt to a C
script and what's gonna do is rename the
local administrator account from
administrator to Tina Fey's hot because
most hackers don't try to use that as
the username that they login from I have
links in the showing us to do the same
exact thing with a domain administrator
account I just don't have a domain
server setup right here
that I can walk you through it but get
links for that the next thing that we
want to do is we want to review our
password best practices and I've got
some links in the show notes that nice
one to bring up this great website
called password Meter calm I know we
talked about it in episode through
season 3 episode 9 and it's a great site
that's gonna help you test the strength
of your password so again you're gonna
want more than 14 characters just for
the whole you know LM hash Deeley but
you also want something with lots of
numbers and letters and characters and
whatnot so next thing we need to do is
enable complex passwords we can do that
here with a little tool called pass prop
okay so we're gonna run pass prop and
see what it gives us now we've got the
if you just run pass props without the
slash question mark it's going to let
you know let's say administer words can
be simple the administrator account may
not be locked out that's what we want to
change so we're going to do pass prop
with slash comp
flex and that's gonna force complex
passwords and then we're gonna go back
and do it with slash admin lockout what
that means is by default Windows server
does not lock out the administrator
account if it has too many failed
attempts it does this for most other
users and this is set up in your
policies but the administrator account
is kind of like a wild card here right
well setting this allows the
administrator account to be locked out
if too many failed attempts are done
remotely it does not do anything for at
the actual keyboard physical security is
a totally another topic that we could
talk about there's fun things you can do
with USB brute-forcing that that
emulates a keyboard not going to get
into that now but you're not going to
need to worry if you enable this and you
need to beef up your password a couple
of times you're still gonna have all the
attempts you want physically at the
keyboard okay so then what we're going
to do and this is something that I do
but you don't have to this is really a
security through obscurity thing just
like changing it to from administrator
to Tina Fey as hot is security through
obscurity we want to go here into the H
key local machine and under system
currentcontrolset control and then
terminal server you'll find the windows
I'm sorry the wind stations and RDP TCP
folders and in there there is a there is
a D word here called port number and
that port number by default is is that
is 3389
and that's exactly what evil server and
pineapple did was they just had mapped
for that port and they found this server
this is not foolproof there is a program
called probe TS that will basically
probe a Windows server to see if it has
terminal services running you can do the
same thing with them map really but but
it is gonna help you a little bit to
just obscura fie that a bit the next
thing is to enable extensive auditing I
have links to that in the show notes
since this is a domain it not domain
controller it's a little bit more
difficult to demonstrate it for you guys
but basically what we want to do is tell
it to
give us give us some information in the
event log on field access attempts right
so no thank you
really really all right
you did at your own risk no but thank
you
it would deny allah service come on so
that's another thing that's it that's a
topic for another night anyway so the
the enabling at extensive auditing is
basically going to allow us to see
failed logon attempts in our Event
Viewer
there are a couple of programs that are
recommend that it will have links to the
show notes for so that you can actually
see like you know when these things have
been happening and even alert you like
hey you know you're getting you know
thousands of attempts on your your your
FTP your terminal service whatever
because if you see here I go ahead and I
try like more than five times and on the
sixth time here to try to log into
through remote access to through the
Remote Desktop what's going to happen is
in my Event Viewer on your system I'm
gonna see an event ID
1012 and that is remote session from
client exceeded the maximum failed login
attempts right and was first forcibly
terminated that is the only indication
you get by default that somebody's
trying to brute force your remote
desktop here to terminal services that's
it by default so you want to enable the
advanced logging features and you might
want to look into getting some programs
that will alert you when something like
that has happened and then finally the
best thing that you could possibly do to
limit your exposure to an online
brute-force attempt on remote access or
I'm sorry why do I keep saying that
Remote Desktop is to not leave your
remote desktop service open to the world
we've talked about in the past how to
tunnel VNC traffic over something like
SSH you can do the same thing with any
protocol any port so if you just leave
one SSH server running on your network
you can
get to anything else you want so that's
a more advanced topic I'll have some
links that'll help you out in the show
notes if you need to start doing that
right now and let me know if you'd like
to see something about that because I
can whip up a dish for SSH tunneling all
right
I hope that was informative we're gonna
check on the chicken here a little later
on in the show and and send me some love
cuz I'm not feeling good all right all
right take care guys okay so this month
we are playing battlefield 2 and I gotta
say the kids over at hack 5 land
squarespace.com voted for this and it
got raving reviews everybody wants to
play it so you know if it's not your
forte maybe you should vote for
something else anywhere we're playing on
January 31st
it's bf2 dot hack 5 org and definitely
join us in with the game and I also have
to thank our sponsors Netflix I gotta
say I'm definitely enjoying those
battlestar galactica DVDs thank you very
much with Netflix you can rent over 290
thousand titles online including lots of
blu-ray titles with free shipping both

shipping centers so almost all
deliveries happen in just one business
day and Netflix plans start at $4.99 as
a new member you can get a no-risk 2
week free trial membership check it out
at WWF flexkom slash hack 5 and please
guys don't forget the www thing that's
gonna take it away now and I'm gonna go
get me some of that chicken noodle soup
yeah alright guys so today I'm going to
show you some alternatives to Windows
Terminal Services now you guys may be
asking yourself why on earth would you
need an alternative to Windows terminal
server well turns out Terminal Service
licensing is expensive you're gonna be
paying about 85 to 90 dollars per
license for a Windows terminal server
and that starts to add up quite a bit
after a while there are a lot of small
companies and small businesses that
would really get a lot of usefulness out
of Terminal Services if they can
actually just implement it in a
cost-effective manner some of the
benefits to running Terminal Service
before we actually get into the segment
are you know software licensing you
don't have to buy licensing for every
single computer that you're going to
install it on to because you're actually
only installing it on a single machine
the other is hardware
you don't need a Core 2 Duo machine with
you know 4 gigs of ram to you know run
outlook and run you know your accounting
software that just so happens to be
based on Java bad Java so what we're
gonna do is actually use thin clients to
connect to our Windows terminal server
so that we can actually just get to the
Terminal Services login and basically
you then utilize the server that you're
running on as the horsepower and the
brains behind you know all your running
applications and think back to if you
unfortunately if you don't work in an
office I think back to the last time
that you work in an office how many
people run the same bunch of
applications you've got Outlook for your
email or Thunderbird you've got your web
browsing and you've got your accounting
and maybe some other research one okay
five or six applications during the
course of a day a user will use 90% of
the time
basically your your you know $1,500
Dell HP IBM whatever is going to waste
when you're just using those
applications and nothing else
now CAD we can obviously understand you
need a big beefy machine go you but for
everybody else all you need is a
terminal services login now I think a
small business server and stuff like
that they all come with I think five
terminal services logins great what
happens when you have 25 people that you
want to actually use terminal server for
well you go out you get the licensing
you install the licensing and you work
with you know your licensing manager to
actually make sure that blah blah blah
blah blah there's a much easier way and
actually you don't even need Windows
2003 server to utilize Terminal Services
what we're gonna do is we're actually
going to use a Windows that
p-box that we'd have just laying around
the office and actually use that as a
terminal server now you ask how can we
do that well very easy there's an
application called XP unlimited that's
available at XP unlimited and elle.com
NL and basically what we can do is we
could take any Vista any XP or even 2003
machine and turn it into a terminal
server so long as it is 32-bit he's
working on 64-bit you know the whole
thing but 32-bit for now which is cool
the really good thing about this is it's
more cost effective the licensing model
is actually going to allow you to have
unlimited users for about the same cost
as it would cost you to license five
users with the Microsoft Terminal Server
licensing there's two versions available
one of them is the Enterprise version
which allows you to authenticate over a
domain for your Terminal Server logins
and some other stuff load-balancing
which is currently working on and then
there's also the classic version which
will allow you to specify five ten or
unlimited license numbers and this just
uses local local built-in user name and
group database so what we're going to do
is I've actually already got it
installed it's actually running on this
machine right here and we're actually
going to come over here to the control
panel now in the demo version you're
going to get three logins okay now one
of those being a local login because
we're logged in locally so there's one
active session we can come over here and
see the Terminal Services configuration
change the port from 3389 if you want to
feel a little bit more secure through
obscurity okay there's your option for
do you want members to be a you know
people with remote desktop access to be
required to be in that you know user
group which is probably a good idea so
that you have some auditing that you can
go back to that that group and say to
yourself okay
these are the people who have remote
access into this terminal server or you
could just do if they have a domain
login you're good to go
application now if you have ever used
Terminal Services before on Windows
application limiting and you know can
get a little hairy this is as easy as it
could possibly be you've got your list
of users on the left and list of groups
what we've done is we've gone ahead and
we've created a Darrin user because
Darrin doesn't need a big machine Darrin
just needs Terminal Services he's
flicking me off right now but it's true
so what we've done is we've gone ahead
we've limited Darrin to Firefox and
notepad the two things Darrin needs the
most and only ever needs what we can do
is we can actually you know create as
many custom applications as we want if
we want to lock the user down if not you
can just give them you know you can
install the local admin you know all the
applications that you want and then it's
just like another terminal server where
they have access to those so what we can
do is go ahead and create a another
application if we wanted to and this
time we can name it oh god I don't even
know what's installing the machine will
call it temp because it's not actually
going to be there and we'll call it
Tammy XE it's not even it's not here but
that's as easy as it could possibly be
we can verify and oh the application
that we just typed in isn't there so
when we've actually gone ahead and we
wanted to change the application we hit
verify first and the application will
make sure that the Advocate XP unlimited
will make sure that what you want to put
in there is actually going to be there
guess what it's not so we can just go
ahead and remove it so we're going to
verify and everything is okay and we can
save the settings now the other cool
thing about this is is it comes with its
own built-in web server now you may be
asking yourself why do I need a web
server
well sometimes firewall blocking you
don't have the ability to change you
know maybe somebody blocks 3389 for some
reason who the hell knows okay a lot of
times people don't want to open a client
or don't know how to open a client bla
bla bla it's just easier to tell them go
to a website in this case we could go to
the IP address of our machine and I'll
show you on this other machine here what
we're gonna do is we're going to open
Firefox actually excuse me ie because it
needs to have execute the jerem where
the hell is your IE on here Darin is not
a big fan of Internet Explorer so okay
so now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go to my IP address of the machine
which is the XP unlimited machine which
is 10.10 if I could type correctly at o
dot 141 and should come up I think
pretty sure it's taking this taking a
second hold on am I gonna am I gonna
boof haha I did not boof okay so here
it's gonna ask you about the VB script
and apparently Darren's a sir has some
VB script something turned off but what
you could do here is if it actually
installed the ActiveX control you can
enter your username and password that
you would you you hand out to your users
and they could connect right from the
web interface you can also do settings
for the different you know inside the
web interface but what we're going to do
is we're going to show you an example of
how to what it looks like when you
actually log in via RDP a lot of people
don't know that you know Terminal
Services is one of those things that if
you use it at home you're like I just
use already P well that's Terminal
Services so what we're gonna do is
Darrin and I think I remember his
password and here we go so here you can
see that
we're actually running the demo version
of XP unlimited okay and under Darren's
profile we actually had it set up to
start his Firefox as well as notepad but
we chose to have notepad minimized in
Firefox maximize on startup so here we
don't have any Start menu we don't have
you know all the crap on the desktop
that maybe some of the other users have
what we've got is this little button up
in the left hand corner which actually
lists Darrin's options Darrin has
Firefox and Darrin has notepad Darrin
can't get himself into trouble by
braking and otherwise $1500 machine
instead he's isolated into this user
environment on this machine here and he
can open multiple copies of notepad if
he really wanted to or he could open
multiple copies of Firefox if he really
wanted to now you can actually go ahead
and enter like I said any application
you really want you can also nest menus
one deep if you have you know the
Microsoft suite of applications you
don't want to block that all up the
other nice thing and the last thing that
I'm going to talk about is Terminal
Services on security on the server side
basically what it's going to do is it's
actually going to show you much like
Windows terminal server you can actually
go ahead and take a peek don't get too
crazy because you could probably screw
some stuff up in here but user
configuration and local computer
configurations just like you would if
you were gonna do you know Windows
Terminal Services you can lock down DNS
clients you know your security settings
run you know startup scripts basically
anything that you could do security wise
with Terminal Services you can do with
XP unlimited it's completely completely
compatible I mean using term this XP
unlimited for probably the last couple
days and it really reminded me of when I
was working for a company that actually
deployed terminal services correctly
okay so if you think that you have a
need for terminal services and you
don't have the money to say to your boss
boss look we've got 30 people I think 20
of them you know could get by on
Terminal Services think about it if
you're gonna be doing an upgrade for
your systems or you know anything like
that it is nowadays with the advent of
you know really inexpensive servers or
like I said we just turned XP into a
terminal server here and it would cost
us for you know unlimited users it would
cost us 240 bucks so I highly recommend
you guys check this out XP unlimited dot
NL and right now we are going to go
ahead and kick it over to Shannon for
trivia guess what we're having another
trivia giveaway yeah I know we've been
kind of gone for a while on the whole
trivia thing CES happens I'm sorry but
we're back and we have an awesome
giveaway this week it's WYSIWYG Volume
one freaked by Edie piss core it's an
awesome awesome graphic novel and it's
kind of this documentary style
background history of freaking and
hacking so you've probably noticed
letters here and they're appearing no
and then if you've got a hack 5 org
slash trivia and you put in those little
letters here and there to form some kind
of word and enter that trivia question
and hopefully you'll get it right if you
answer in the first 24 hours from when
this episode airs you might get the
chance to win this WYSIWYG comic book
and also I do want to thank our sponsor

I love GoDaddy and so do the rest of the
crew and yeah I think the guys are gonna
finish it up now
all right thanks Shannon now before we
wrap up this show we got a kind of a
couple of things to get to we actually
had another web application security
segment with our friend mu bik's but it
turns out when you tether with your
iPhone and the 3G and the Skype and well
and we'll bring that to you guys when we
can do it properly in studio yeah we do
still have some emails that want to get
to but first we have to thank another
one of her fine sponsors who is bringing
you the technologists week HP yeah I was
kind of interested and surprised when it
popped into our email because I was like
oh we used that yeah
the episode is brought to you by HP's
media smart server powered by Microsoft
Windows Home Server we have Home Server
in our house and we use it primarily
because we stream stuff off of our home
server on to our 360 yeah which is great
for that it's great if you guys have a
another media center in the house one of
the great great things about it is easy
backups of your Apple mm-hmm and Windows
machines yeah they've got this nice
little client app and then it just does
the rest well for Apple machines it
actually supports our think no it
supports time machine ooh
so yeah that's hot yeah so time machine
over the network on the HP media smart
server and it's automatic it's easy
get yourself Windows server and then
switch all your other clients to you
know Mac and Microsoft will be happy I'm
sure that would work as well but it's it
automatically backs up and protects you
guys if you did install the client or
you're using the you know time machine
the media functions of it are absolutely
amazing and it's not an eyesore unlike
you know so many of the other appliances
that are out there this thing actually
looks like you could it could sit if you
guys don't have a closet that you're
gonna throw it into or something I might
feel a little guilty about putting such
a sweet piece of hardware inside your
network closet along with the the ugly
little switch exactly yeah so but
unfortunately ours is tucked away in the
thing in a closet but anyway so anyway
enjoy your digital media
experiences check out the HP what is it
called the media the media smart server
powered by Windows Home Server there you
go
I like that operating system definitely
okay so um bill wrote us from I guess
this is follow-up from for nineteen I
believe to show us a really great
Firefox extension that we can use for us
SSH tunneling users I've been doing a
lot of that especially went to see yeah
yeah I usually go through some me video
but there were some airports with some
really nice Wi-Fi I can't believe we got
that episode uploaded that quick 10
minutes 10 minutes to upload an HD
episode from the Las Vegas Airport the
only thing redeeming about la s was 20
megabits down we were getting it

be all set so or bring or bring the
alpha have to show if they all for some
day they with the 500 milliwatts and the
giant antenna they need to have like

Moz monkey calm and it is the right down
here I've actually had a lot of people
rec with me on my on my blog after I
post the how to yeah switch proxy is
great I'm actually using it right here
and if you see I'll fire up I'll just do
tunnel and then it connects me and and
they log in and bam and I'm running my
local proxy and I right click down here
and then go to switch proxy and proxies
and choose my local SSH tunnel and now
oh my god I'm gonna blow your minds are
gonna go to IP e check in and I'm not
going to blur it because it's just the
IP address of you know hi-5 web server

having to go into the tools and the
settings and all that fun stuff so thank

little pimp egde and not a sponsor or
anything but I think this is really neat
it's the phantom keystroke logger
I'm sorry Keith not logger it's called
ASCII stroker version two what this guy
does is a little USB guy that you pop
into one of your co-workers machines
right and emulate two USB mouse and
keyboard doesn't take any drivers or
anything like that when you just use it
as a regular device right well you can
see it's got a little jog dial on the
side we can set the interval that it
will accidentally hit a keystroke or do
a little mouse movement at so that you
can like totally freaking out this is
like the next version of the
annoy-o-tron the little thing that beeps
and you can't find out where's beeping
right we have one and I can't I don't
know where we should have left it with
the rub three kids but oh wait then
again the TSA would have found it and
then that would have been not good and
pregger would have gotten another
pat-down um so so that is the Phantom
peace trigger and I should have a link
