go further proc 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 checking out the newest
from music's how's it going Ron it's
going great it's been a great crowd and
a lot of interest most definitely
because this is like nothing I've seen
before exactly am I wearing right now
that's the music to em one hundred it's
a hands-free accessory for your
smartphone so you can get all your video
audio available hands-free you can run
applications directly on the device or
you can use it in conjunction with a
Android or an iOS device and load your
apps on there and catch all your video
on the screen and you can also use the
onboard 1080p camera for capturing video
so this kind of seems like a bit of a
departure from the norm that I'm used to
you guys with your life war product
lines and I know that you also do some
other specialized stuff for government
you know how much of a departure was
this really for you guys start
engineering something really
consumer-focused for but your everyday
smartphone right well actually this is
our third generation of monocular
displays as you've made you didn't a lot
of them in the past for the military and
we do industrial models and we wanted to
bring more of that technology to the
consumer market and the big difference
with this one is that it has an onboard
processor running an Android operating
system and putting the smarts on board
changes the game I I know that just
changes everything since you're able to
not have to have this tethered to a
phone but you can tether to the more
what are the different modes of
operation with this well there's three
modes of operation you can run app apps
directly on the device and control it
with buttons on the device or if you
want you can also load software such as
the Android voice recognition software
to to add voice control that you can
hook it into a software app that runs on
a smartphone and that connection would
be Wireless you can also run your apps
on a smartphone gain Android or iOS and
view them in the m1
100 there's also a third and new type of
operating mode where you can have
applications that run on both sides both
on the m100 and on the smartphone so is
there like a special API where the aptly
needs to application on your smartphone
needs to be custom Lee crafted to know
how to access this display for something
like that where you're going to use some
of the special features yes and we we
are actually shipping the SDKs they
started going out about a week ago to
developers and you say this is a full
android device here on my head what is
the experience like for this Android
device given that you've got a limited
input and output here it's a what a Q
wvga display so what is that 600 640 by
303 20 actually it's a lower resolution
than that qvga and the the w when the
wqvga just means that it's 16 by 9
aspect ratio but it's hard to compare it
with a regular monitor because you're
looking at it so close to your eye you
wouldn't find anyone visiting the view
here or the booth here that thinks it's
under 720p the resolution looks that
good and so how have you changed the
Android operating system so that it
makes sense to use it on a device like
this say if I don't tether it to my
phone well it's a standard Android
operating suspect you can load standard
Android apps right into it where it
really starts to shine those when you
take apps and customize them for the
device customization might be as simple
as if you're using it saying an app for
a car you want big bold indicators so
instead of having small little icons on
the screen you have something that fills
up a large part of the screen so it
immediately catches the driver's
attention in other cases if using is for
something like augmented reality there
you might have the processing for the
video done right on board on the
processor so that there's virtually no
lag no late see whatsoever and use your
smartphone for accessing your data and
content and so forth so it depends on
what you're using it for and so I could
imagine a bi am got this in my
motorcycle helmet some way or another
and I've got like Google Maps Navigation
just like I would on my regular Android
phone and then I see
exit is or I can see my speedometer or
things of that nature how does the the
technology actually change from some of
the stuff that you've done in the past
with like your augmented reality rap
series and things like that the products
in the past I mean it's almost a bad
thing to say but they were dumb products
they didn't really have any intelligence
on board so they worked as a display
they worked as a camera but they're
always reliant upon whatever device are
hooked on to the other end where is this
it's a self-contained product you can
enhance it by hooking it into an
external device but you can do a lot
right on board with the processor so
what are those external devices that I
can hook this to any Android or iOS
device and so when I do that do I
actually see the display on my android
or iOS device or do I see parts of the
app or do they have to be custom written
for it you would see you'd see the app
on the screen the only difference would
be if the app has been formatted for
that display ratio for instance if you
run an iPad you're going to have to cut
down on the resolution cut down on the
content versus an iphone where you'd be
able to put pretty much mere mere the
display all right cool and what are some
of the specs of like the camera and you
see this got a microphone we've got
Wi-Fi on boy we've got Bluetooth tell me
that does well you got Wi-Fi Bluetooth
in fact with the Wi-Fi vaina power on
board you hook it directly into a
hotspot not just your laptop or iphone
it's completely adjustable the there's a
number of head mounting systems
available over the head behind the head
over the ear the boom for the display is
adjustable it bends like a little Gumby
bear and it also goes in and out
extendable and then the display itself
tilts up and down to get the right
viewing angle we've got two microphones
on board One for catching your audio the
other for catching the external audio
for noise cancelling and of course we've
got a 1080p high def camera on board
that's what I'm excited about I want to
be able to record HD video wherever I'm
looking have the viewfinder right there
who is this more targeted towards what's
the kind of price point when can I get
one well it's really it's got a very
broad market anyone who has a smartphone
is going to have some application it'll
work with so it's hard to define that
price-wise we're we haven't set a final
price on it but we're expecting is going
to be under five hundred dollars so it's
going to be a very affordable consumer
product and when can we expect to see
these in the market well that's the big
question we're currently planning on
shipping some developer units out in the
end of the first quarter additional ones
in the second quarter the final retail
product is approximately mid-year this
year that is awesome thank you so much
Ron NPR has a great public radio app
