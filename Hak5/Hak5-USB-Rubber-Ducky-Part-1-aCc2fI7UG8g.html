duckies driver backups banana notes and
more I'm Shannon Morse and you are
watching TAC 5
this episode of hack 5 was brought to
you by Squarespace domain.com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain calm and go to assist
Express remote support made easy Paul
you ready to make a hundred people
really happy on this episode of act 5
only under B well I only got a hundred
you got to stick around and find out
what I'm talking about but it don't pass
forward now it's about to get good we've
got awesome stuff coming up in the show
what do we get well Shannon has a bunch
of cool stuff about ways to make it you
don't care it's Windows PC stuff what
you have to do with that stuff at work
right it doesn't make my job easier is
the important thing
well backing up drivers kind of an
important thing when you know they
inevitably lose their driver discs and
then you guys aren't know you have some
sort of back-end repository so when
we're moving from XP to 7 and it doesn't
work on their system we have to give
them their computer back more like you
reformat in your box in your like
where's the driver for this esoteric
webcam oh that's right installed it in
threw it away time to get another five
dollar one from China you can get the
Microsoft at the dollar in there you go
yeah just rush across if you want to
talk about cams first thing I just this
is the the movie micro that should make
a smaller one the movie Nano but this is
a VGA camera that just shoots 2 micro SD
and you know 8 gig max you can just pop
one of these in there and record for
about three hours before the battery
dies it has a an interesting feature
where it's got this mode where you can
turn on and off the recording based on
sound yeah turns out it's based on like
a certain decibel that decibel is the
same amount of volume it takes to flip
the switch to the on position so by
doing by flipping activating the feature
it cuts on so it's really just another
record button Wow yeah
I threw a little velcro on it and the
nice thing is it just sits here in the
corner
Yammer you should be a footage one it
was the other way oh yeah because my
other cam you know kind of sits like up
here and I don't like that I mean that's
good for like narration this one the
audio is crap but it just for you know
getting some video and it doesn't you
can't see in your peripheral vision yeah
so that's what so the idea is on the
hack across America I'll just pop this
in hit record let it record for three
hours and if a cow gets abducted I'm
dying
cuz you know cows be getting abducted in
Kansas Seattle Seattle's still an iffy
well we get to Roswell New Mexico and
then it's do I shoot up or do I go to
San Diego she's not playing in this
space normally shoot up to like whiny
looming in the disastrous needle and
delimit up there yeah I get some shots
of that anyway hiked across America calm
for that this is the the movie micro the
Adams even smaller about 60 bucks and I
think pretty cool
as far as speaking of hardware rob has
run some sort of zip it alternative yeah
it's about a hundred bucks and it runs
open wrt and Shannon and I panned it for
not having Wi-Fi yeah - well he runs
working on it he's got some interesting
stuff planned with this devices no yes
no but it's open wrt and it's got two
gigs of storage that just sounds weird
because it's it's a VRT it quiets and it
helped my by then I think I think
wireless router I think playable but I
don't think
device that you yeah
anyway no the you would be the cable a
lot mimics get into it but anyway very
cool stuff I know that you guys have
been clamoring for some interesting
reviews of it
Rob's got that and then hopefully we'll
see some more interesting things down
the line with that and it's good to have
them on the show yeah this is great we
got we got Jason with the remote cam
thing we've got HD cam over to it's a
rob now vivix and just shipped one up
north at the gym yeah so that'd be
awesome great we're seeing everybody in
the gas again season seven is working
come on baby hold together just got to
get settled into SF and then you know
and then epicness so so quit your
whining make it happen I know this is
your month of toys what's the deal I've
been watching the iPhone Dev Team I'm
wait until I can get my hands on what
Comex was doing but he can jailbreak
this thing already
yeah so is it is it like I office stuff
forever tell me about I have no you go
to a website it loads up at if and you
know no you have to probably think
download um something like black green
but maybe on the same on that I'm only
slightly rid of that yeah you got to do
it on the show for us dude we got to see
this thing unlocked because I think it
would make a beautiful terminal I can
actually type on it and really really
well I can type up better on that thing
that I put on this thing is you can have
SSH and SSH into more the hell you want
in here it could be a $500 SSH like
hello I notice one thing when you're out
and about with this thing not have the
3G is kind of a pain in the ass because
there's only so many McDonald's in the
world yeah
that's a shame on a whole nother level
but yeah but it's gonna my file saw my
everything yeah that's what uh that's
what Tom Merritt does with his I think
it's great he's got you achieved ATT
iPhone but it's just tethered to the
Verizon my fight because there's
actually service and rosin if you want
to go that far you just like drop the
cell phone plan mm-hmm get the MiFi and
then just like speak into the Skype
client and all it'll beat your giant
iPhone you can just forget you can
rocket baby so I can get the iPod
interface going up ya know what I'm
really interested in is the fact that
they've got a $15 a month and $30 month
data plan those are really really
inexpensive Black Rain up on that sink
it up get a little little tethering on
which phone ya know those g phones yeah
anyway we got tethering coming up soon
too with droid and all sorts of fun
stuff that's going to be in preparation
of me not dying when I'm driving through
I know you know where I know ways but
I'm sure I'll go through it oh yeah
that's what's coming up and then oh yeah
like I teased in the the beginning of
this ultra long a block we are talking
about vos be dumb dignity today
and justify only right after Shannon's
segment lapped a long I'm gonna throw a
Shannon here in just a moment but first
we want to remind you guys that don't
take up some hak5 swag we've got about
three weeks left in the hack house and
then um and then the tag five from the
road so no stop it
we talked about this last time let's go
down alright well go it okay well anyway
stuff like this is ending up on eBay
right now so if you got a hack five dot
or slash store you'll see things like
it's my one other goodies yeah you could
bludgeon someone with that more that
coming up but first when it's time to
rebuild your windows box nothing can be
more annoying than trying to find that
driver disk for that esoteric device
especially when that might be your
Ethernet drivers so here to save us from
ourselves
is Shannon with this week's snubs report
brought to you by goto assist Express
on today's snubs report i'll be showing
you how to backup device drivers with
just a few clicks see it's springtime
spring is in the air yay and all of us
are thinking about spring cleaning what
better way than to reformat your windows
computer after being so sluggish over
the winter time of course
it's fairly simple there's not much to
it you backup your documents and your
bookmarks and you boot off your Windows
CD and you start new after your format
or is that all you have to do yeah not
so much if you're anything like me
you've got tons and tons of USB gadgets
lying all over the place you've got your
keyboard in your mouse and your iPod and
you've even got your USB dalek webcam
which I am no clue where that CD is so
how am I going to get that driver oh
maybe I left it on the TARDIS with the
doctor yeah that would make sense
so this is where double driver comes in
which is the ultimate freeware driver
backup tool and I'm gonna test it out
today in the hack 5 cloud lab see
luckily even though I'm in Missouri and
all I have right now for a computer
isn't Nokia booklet I have access to a
host of virtual servers specifically
made for demonstration like this and
demolition so let's get started I'm
gonna connect to my Windows computer
that I want to reformat through go to
assist Express now just a second while I
transfer over double driver C it's a
portable app and it can be running off
of any kind of USB driver that you might
have you don't have to install anything
and luckily operations is pretty
straightforward click scan to get a list
of all the drivers loaded on the machine
you can see from this listing you've got
the name of the driver the version the
date provider and the class so you know
whether it's a USB driver a keyboard or
a graphics card whatever it might be
and by default all the microsoft drivers
aren't checked these are already
included on the windows CD so there's
really no sense in backing them up you
can quickly select all Microsoft or non
microsoft drivers from this drop-down
there we go and now this printer is
gonna be backed up so there's no need to
go find the CD that you installed it
with in the first place and there's no
need to go in search of the support
website which we all know it takes
forever and a day to find the support
website with the correct driver for your
correct Windows version ah drives me
crazy now we just click backup and we
specify a location to save our files the
desktop will work for now I like to
select compress zip folder to save space
and I leave include double driver
checked so that means once I format in
my computer and I've unzip this file
not only will I find a copy of all of my
drivers but I'll also have a copy of
double driver which is going to save me
tons and tons of time in the long run
because it has this handy restore
feature with it so make sure to check
that out all right so double driver is
backing up all my stuff I'm gonna click
close close that and now let's check out
the file it created alright so we've got
our drivers neatly in their own folders
yay and if I open up the included double
driver program and this time click
restore and okay to the prompt there we
go
a list of my drivers that are ready to
be installed ok click restore reboot
plug in and have yourself a nice
refreshing relaxing Mama's home cooked
sweet tea so do you have any thoughts

so you may remember back in no six when
we demonstrated a new tool called the
USB switchblade which essentially made
compromising Windows machines a breeze
when it comes to physical access you see
it took advantage of a feature in
Windows that basically allowed autorun
code to happen on optical media and this
specially crafted sandjas cruiser had
just that had a u3 partition which was
essentially CD FS partition and we could
reflash it and specially craft it to
silently run our own code located on the
readwrite partition and it was a great
hack it was it garnered a lot of
attention a lot of development it was
even well mimicked by Microsoft in their
forensics tool coffee and fortunately or
unfortunately the hole was plugged in
recent versions of Windows no longer
does codes automatically execute from
optical media without a little bit of
user intervention it's a shame though I
mean only we had a device that we could
just plug into a computer and make
happen well we do in fact something that
I've been working on for a little over a
year and and this tool has been a long
time coming in fact actually hinted
quite a bit about it in season 5 episode
3 that's the program that comes with the
chip when you first you know get it in
the mail and plug it in via USB USB ok
that's another very important thing
about this board well a lot of other
arduino like boards may use USB to
interface with the computer what happens
is that they use a USB to serial chip on
the chip on the board itself that will
actually translate it to like 38 400 I
forget the baud rate anyway to serial
this is an actual USB device it shows up
as a USB human interface device and
that's how we can listen to its output
and write stuff to it and all sorts of
fun stuff so that's kind of an
interesting and neat feature that we
will take a you know a much closer look
at in a future segment yes the human
interface device ask
- the TNC is quite interesting as you
might have guessed programming and it's
actually not that difficult you know he
is just an Arduino essentially so we can
use the Arduino IDE and C code and what
makes it truly unique is the fact that
it's a human interface device so that
means that we really could create a
keyboard macro let me show you what I
mean all right so I'm at my unsuspecting
computer here and we're gonna go ahead
and just for a moment plug the ducky in
so have it right here into the USB what
was that actually let's take a look
again in slow motion and what you can
see here is it's doing it's sending the
key presses Windows key R to pull up the
run menu and then CMD enter and then
we've got a command prompt now of course
this demo one all it does is flush my
DNS cache but if you here at the command
prompt
you know Bob's your uncle have fun now
there's something interesting to know
here is that it's just typing as fast as
the other the computer will recognize it
so you know it all happens in like the
blink of an eye and as you can imagine
you know you might need to put some
delays here there depending on the speed
of the computer and stuff like that but
it's super super fast because it's one
computer talking to another so
possibilities are endless you can you
can spew keypresses as fast as the USB
bus and what's really beautiful about
this is it's cross-platform ok I'm in
Windows here sure love to edit in this
and premiere but also loving the bun too
and and mint and yes I can tell you it
works it also works on a Mac because
it's just a human interface device
that's the most beautiful thing is
totally cross-platform and it's also not
just a keyboard it can be used to
emulate mouse clicks as well so you
could actually tell in a position like
um one comma one for the very top left
corner of a of a Mac and what would you
be clicking if you clicked in the very
top left corner of a mat
anyway you guys you Mack guys probably
know the special key presses to really
have a lot more fun and that's why this
will be open and the other interesting
thing is that it cannot easily be
stopped you see this right here has like
a USB identifier of just you know
regular hid right well you can also
program it to be I don't know a
Microsoft keyboard a Logitech keyboard
or whatever you want and what's really
interesting about that is that unless IT
departments are going to suddenly stop
you know it suddenly start limiting the
use of USB keyboards then there's no
antivirus for this no there's no aside
from you know super glue and the USB
port
not a whole lot preventing it at the
moment which is really cool because I
love a physical security the other thing
to keep in mind and you may remember
this from I think late season 5 we did a
little bit of brute forcing Remote
Desktop Protocol and if you recall we're
talking about how after so many attempts
you're going to get locked out and
that's just how the default policies are
in Windows however beautiful little
feature there when your server isn't
going to lock an administrator out from
trying to log in as administrator after
somebody tries if it is at the local
keyboard the other interesting thing and
isn't you might have experienced
something like this yourself is when you
boot up and you're at the login screen
you're like building a new machine or
something you're like typing on the
keyboard nothing is happening like oh I
forgot to plug the USB cable in nice
because we don't have to reboot like
back in the ps2 days if you remember
that but you just plug in your USB
keyboard and before you're even in the
operating system it's like oh yeah sure
USB keyboard come on in what damage
could you do how fast could you type
administrator tab a password enter enter
and you know 20 go to 10 you get the
idea so couple that with like a 32 gig
SD card and a word list or even just
generated on the fly and well if you've
got some time to kill
you've got a potential solution there
for
local brute-forcing and it's not limited
just to like a Windows Server 2003 box
either you could do the thing same thing
to a BIOS or many different systems so
it's very versatile in that regard
now using a dip switch you could easily
program the device to deliver multiple
payloads depending on the switch
configuration for example like a
five-way dip switch will give you 32
different options so maybe a couple for
Windows to do something like opening
backdoors and stalling meterpreter or
stealing documents or on the other hand
you could write a payload that fixes
printer configurations resets firewall
settings or connects to network shares
if you've worked in network
administration like myself you know that
it can be a pain to have to go in
someone's desk to fix problem so why not
automate it of course this project
doesn't end here with the little beta
code we've got the workings of a
filesystem driver which basically means
that with a bit of soldering a micro SD
card could be fitted to the device that
means a couple of things first off
rather than having to recompile the code
every time you wanted to change the
keystrokes for our payload a simple file
could be written and loaded onto the
card second it means that we could
potentially copy executables to the
target machine rather than having to
rely on like downloading from an FTP
which would set off IDs alarms now I
know what you're thinking at first why a
USB rubber ducky well if you've learned
anything from hack 5 over the years it
is that pineapples monkeys there aren't
always what they seem
second you're probably wondering where
can I get one where can I get like the
turnkey solution and unfortunately it's
just not available yet and to be honest
I am a horrible programmer you don't
believe me go back to the first season
and take a look at some of my PHP
segments you'll know what I'm talking
about but that got me thinking well you
guys are excellent coders
and then the USB switchblade project
just ballooned because of so much
community development that I mean soon
after coming out with just the
switchblade itself I came out with my
own payload the USB hacksaw which used a
modified version of USB dump her to
steal data from USB drives plugged into
a machine and then silently email them
back to an anonymous account and there's
been so much more there's been you know
Don's or u3 hacker sable Foxhall coming
up with awesome payloads like the pocket
knife or even the incident response
payload for forensics investigators so
I'd like to kick-start this project and
here's what I've got in mind basically
I've got a special board set up on the
hack five forms for the USB rubber ducky
as well as a wiki coming online and I
have a hundred dev kits ready to go so
all you have to do is go to hack five
dot org slash I want to develop for the
ducky and go ahead and fill out the form
tell me about your programming
experience see Arduino embedded whatever
if you want to get in on this just
specify an address international
domestic whatever and I'll go ahead and
ship one out to you freezies

a great domain domain comm hey guys
today we got a really cool piece our
Hardware not software hardware called
the Nano no it's it's this little tiny
computer when I say tiny it's tiny
so but it packs a pretty good punch it
has a cool stuff first of all I when I
open it up the keyboard was pretty
awesome with big hands it was actually
pretty easy to thumb after you know
being used to the iPhone all the time so
the other cool things in here is has a
MIPS processor which is like
pretty standard across the board for
packages if there's tons of packages out
from theirs right now comes with open
work installed with busybox and apache
already on there I think magic patching
all around there has a 336 ma our 336
megahertz processor decent it'll do good
cool thing is it has two gigs of space
on here which is unheard of on a router
or a succour either so you got tons of
space and it's even expandable with the
SDHC am all right there we have the SD
HD slot so it has headphone jack speaker
speaker mic nope I turned it on it has
what else another half 32 Meg's of RAM
alright but I'm really excited about
this one portion a USB slot now I don't
know if it's host mode it does host mode
or not it is micro USB so I gotta find a
micro USB to micro USB cable it
shouldn't be hard so when you plug the
USB into a Windows box or Linux box it
does a USB Ethernet adapter so what
happens is you can network your nano no
row with your computer and actually
transfer packages around which is cool I
just wish that this was
this was a better cable I guess so
the other cool thing I got a one gig
SDHC in here and I have three mix of our
three gigs of space to store on this
thing and you I'm sure there's what
eight eight gigs out there so you know
there's a lot that I that can be done
with this thing Qi - hardware comm is
where you get it but a lot more to come
this is the Nano note by Qi hardware and
