five hack across america challenge coin
this episode of hack five is brought to
you by domain.com hello and welcome to
hack five my name is Shannon Morris
I'm Darrin kitchen and this is your
weekly dose of Technol s it truly is in
fact this is episode 1901 it truly is
really is welcome to the show everybody
hey did you know this year in hacker
history the first semiconductor
rectifiers were patented as cat whisker
detectors Wow Shannon I feel like we've
come a long way from detecting cat
whiskers with semiconductors thank you
for that awesome tidbit of hacker
history from 1901 any time dude we're
gonna switch to show numbers to hex I'm
sorry we're still a little loopy from
coming back in Def Con we had a grand
old time yeah everybody that came out
and said hello it really means a lot to
us so I'm super stoked about today's
episode because first off we have some
amazing challenge coins sitting over
here yes we do an amazing display of
coins of challenging goodness we'll get
into what some of these are and why they
are in just a bit
because council law of 9 is awesome and
there will be spoilers at the end of
episode so I have these yes oh wow
speaking of Def Con and epic stuff we
brought back look at all the stickers
yeah thank you for the stickers yeah
them make it rain stickers actually we
can speed up the thing so Shannon can
put them all on the board
thank you for stickers yeah thank you
yeah yeah and now you have to stand over
on the right the other side alright
that's good we are going to need a much
bigger board I think you're right Wow we
need to start covering yours with
stickers now to put the pay phone over
there you can put you can cover the pay
phone with stickers and it would be real
wouldn't it
you should put I know a trust your
Technol a sticker on the side of the
phone yes yes
there is an asterisk segment coming up
obviously with a pay phone it's just
screaming for some void hey you know
what other fun stuff we saw at Def Con
what the release of a brand-new
successor to backtrack yes we did
mccally here so we reviewed Kali Linux
on 1408 I believe it was which is the
successor to good old backtrack which
was the successor of course to good old
auditor and WAP X and not box STD and
all of those other live distros great
tools for pen testers since you know it
comes with all the different tools you
need and it's been around for quite a
while it was just updated a few days ago
from when we are recording this now it's
called kali linux 2.0 a download on
actually get your torrents on because it
was going much faster
oh yeah the torrents are way faster
Kelly org slash downloads is where you
can get it's a rolling distro this time
so that basically means that updates are
going to be a lot easier now going
forwards instead of having to go and
update all of your tools separately it's
going to be rolling tools will get
automatic updating in the background so
there's this package updater that runs
in the background and it's going to
notify you of any updates that you might
have let me login so I stopped getting
oh please tell me that your password is
tor still of course all right OOP
somebody put in root okay Tori there we
go so it runs on gnome 3 as you can tell
with native support also can run Katy
LXDE a few other ones if you have a
different league mate or motto like
mates yes that's right the minimum ran
required for the new build is 768 Meg's
so there is a light edition with xfce
desktop in in place of no in case you
want that instead they also updated net
hunter they updated the Chromebook
builds so you can update to Kali 2.0 and
those XFC is gonna be huge for the
Chromebook bill yeah for sure and I
think home books make the best Kali
boxes I think you're right they have the
right makes it very very useful a VMware
was updated VirtualBox
we're updated both by offensive security
so they have builds of those as well
over at offensive security calm so yeh
we have new built for everything
the 4.0 kernel it runs on Debbie and
Jesse with improved hardware and
wireless driver support so lots lots of
added support Kali 2.0 that's kind of
always the big reason to update and of
course you know they do a great job of
just putting all of the tools in
together so that you don't have to sit
there and try to figure out like oh well
this one requires this dependency of
Ruby and this thing needs that gem and
this thing needs this esoteric Python
library that nobody's used and so that
all notwithstanding it's really great to
just like grab a distro that gets the
job done because sometimes you just want
to make it do the thing and I really
applaud them for making it do the thing
but some of the frustration of course
with not just Kali but even the the
backtrack legacy has been like tools get
updated but then you're like damn this
is a real pain to get the new tool on
there and so you might as well just like
install the new OS and that's just kind
of crazy pants it's fine if you have
like a live CD or a live USB but if
you're actually using this in a day to
day scenario use this as a day-to-day it
runs you as route also I know somebody
who got owned at Def Con because he
didn't change his password from tor I
mean I'm doing a demo so yes I'm using
tor right now but dude I know Moe bik's
is going to be really excited that they
made some changes in regards to the
measure yes so they got rid of
Metasploit community and pro editions
inside of kali linux 2.0 but the
Metasploit framework package is still
hosted so basically that means that you
can still use Metasploit in it but not
with that fancy GUI that
with community and Pro Edition me the
fancy anyway and actually all of the
payloads and all of the modules that
you'll find in the community editions in
the pro and whatever other editions they
have are also in the frame community
framework edition the open source one so
you might as well just clone that from
git anyway he really does and that's
what we use in pen test with hack 5 yes
new dates if you haven't checked good
stuff oh yeah so you can download
Metasploit as usual from rapid7 you
would still have to sign up for a
license over there you would have to go
to their site and actually sign up
download it from them but if you just
want framework that's still available in
here the biggest update though other
than of course updating is the interface
so if you want to take a look at my
computer I have it up and running on
here it's a new interface it's new it's
snappy it's very fancy they have this
nice little application tool on the
sidebar which I believe positive yeah
yeah this is gnome 3 right yes so this
is gnome 3 it's probably very very
familiar if you used one of the more
newer ubuntu builds or anything with
gnome 3 running in it it's very easy to
open up any of your different tools and
they all work out of the box I have a
few errors with dependencies on my
machine just because it's yeah it's my
easel whatever you running
Wireshark for the first time ever is
route to that's it
so everything works like it should you
still have the drop down tools up here
as you did in the previous version but
they have been cleaned up a lot they
look a lot easier it's not as big of a
tree so it's a lot easier to find
whatever kind of tools that you're
searching for and everything has been
defined really really well look how they
categorize these guys and I like the
icons to the icons are very useful so
it's very easy to find something that
you're using pretty commonly so this I'm
just I'm just so like happy that this is
where we are right now with hacker
distros like Oh usability making them
pretty making them easy it's like wait
so does that mean that we kind of like
ribbon boom risen past the making it
work aspect which is great that's what
we want yeah that's exactly what this
workspace switching look because that's
a switching so you can either go up here
this is kind of cool because I can
actually push it out with my finger
three I like that yeah and then you have
your tour spaces I can do up to full
screen responsive it is touchscreen
responsive and I kind of love that so
I'm touching my screen right now and
then I can also go back to one of my
regular workspaces I can push up and I
get this notification toolbar at the
bottom so this is where I'll see any
kind of messages for updates that are
going on on my screen and yeah Paul can
see that on his screen up there as well
and if I use my finger to pull it up
they also have a keyboard that pops up
so I'll do that one more time
so they actually included a nice touch
screen and I kind of love that because I
do use my touch screen a lot you know
there are also builds of this forearm so
putting this might be quite easy super
super easy makes you wonder about now
hunter but okay you know either way it's
still really cool yeah really easy same
with gnome 3 you can customize to your
heart's content with your applications
in the different folders or you can put
them over on the sidebar however you
choose there's like a nice little one
for all your popular ones all the ones
that you use the most and things will
automatically be included in there as
you open up your applications more and
more often so this whole update for me
is more about and they even mentioned
this on their blog they say it's about
user experience with this new interface
of course and then maintaining all the
tool repos and all those packages so
making it easier for users to use not as
many updates for like new tools and
things no that's the beauty of it is it
sounds like they've really put a lot of
focus on the engine yeah so that in the
future they can just roll new tools
without having to make you install a new
distro and so of course if you're going
to get everybody baseline done to
something that you're going to continue
rolling out new parts of the engine -
yeah you want to make it pretty so that
they'll want to continue using it so yes
I'm just really happy that this is the
user experience now there are some
issues mine worked out of the box I had
no issues I don't have like RF kill
issues with your mattify I had no
problems with the wireless at all so it
might just be the drivers that are
included in my computer there's a new
version of air crack in here some people
are you know actually
people talked about but you can find all
their tutorials at docs cally org which
are pretty helpful once I started going
through them and they solved most of the
issues that I saw being tweeted out yeah
luckily you're gonna run into some
problems though if you're reading old
tutorials yes that mentioned the old way
of doing things with air crack and then
you have to do the new way so you just
need to be familiar with it yeah just
make sure you're reading the ones for
Kelly 2.0 not Kelly original all the old
stuff will work you just have to make a
few little minor adjustments to the way
your commands and things like mon0 may
not be the same if you're not used to it
if this is your first time experiencing
with Linux or if you're not used to like
running mon0 or double w lazy or
whatever the differences are you might
run into issues with that so definitely
read the new tutorials as opposed to the
old ones because those additional steps
won't be there for you they have radio
or any of those check that out I don't
think a new radios in here look at hack
RF into this guy yeah I didn't see it
when I was going through with him
earlier
let's see good good people just type in
GNU - oh there it is yeah add your seat
good alright yay okay I'm glad you found
it I couldn't find it in the sources
oh well I'll keep looking so luckily
there are some alternatives - because I
know not everybody Kelly is gonna be the
thing for them which I'll also take a
look at all of those in a future episode
I have used pen two for hacker F and
rtl-sdr because gonna radio companion
works in those out of the box there is
also black Arch Linux there's back box
Linux
there's Arch strike which is coming soon
and they're gonna have a newly updated
version of Arch strike so you can find
all of those I'll put the links in the
show notes for each of those these days
I know people should let us know in the
feedback in the comments what they would
like to see either continued with Callie
or what other distros of choice they
have for the pen testing goodness yes
and with that we're gonna take a quick
break but when we get back we're gonna
be cracking some challenge coins yay
yeah it's gonna be fun stick around I'm
gonna play with my hacker afternoon
domain.com and dog club came to hak5
with a great idea build a club all about
learning stuff making things and having
fun and so we did just that and man what
a brilliant idea we recently hosted our
very first ever open house at the hack 5
warehouse and with the help of
domain.com and dot club we put on a mini
LAN party micro drone obstacle course 3d
print fest quadcopter race and killer
barbecue and I must say these guys get
it the internet and hacker culture in
particular it's all about fostering
community from BBS's to phyto net to IRC
it's all about coming together and
having fun and what better domain to do
it than a dock club it's perfect because
the dock club is universally and
globally understood not just here in the
United States so if you're building a
new business or naming your startup
consider a dock club as the ultimate
social domain join us in the San
Francisco Bay Area for workshops and
projects and crazy indoor quadcopter
races at her very own dock club hack
house Club then head over to domain.com
slash club to register your dot Club
today there are only $9.99 a year and
there are thousands of awesome options
still available make sure to use the
coupon code hak5 to save 15% and let the
guys over at domain.com know we sent you
so when you think domain names think
domain.com a little over two years ago
hack across America 2013 kicked off and
with it was a pretty sweet challenge
coin Shannon we're gonna be talking
about some challenge coins yes yes I
love challenge coins please be careful I
just got no you did that one was from
the DEF CON vendors really cool I know
no it says stuff about loot and oh my
gosh I just I love trading challenge
coins it's you know town the coins are
like such a big thing about hacker
culture that typically they're used you
know to prove organization in a thing
like military you're like oh I'm part of
the flying something something so that
wild weasels there we go
that's one and it bears the unit's
insignia and overall it just it's about
enhancing morale they are fond with
hackers and especially when they
actually have a challenge like
do this NSA one no oh this isn't the one
with the numbers around the edge but
that's a fun NSA one and this is one of
my other favorites b-52 oh yeah double
oh eight good stuff
Def Con Wireless village of course
anyway I could get on and on and on
about these pentose with that five area
41 this is good stuff this is actually
the DEF CON Switzerland group zombies
besides anyway yes so challenge codes
are fun and so for so for Def Con you
know like this is where I trade
challenge coins is that Def Con yeah
similarly the DEF CON badges also
contain challenges this year the
challenge was actually on this record
and it's a legit record like I know
people are gonna be like don't do that
but no it is I'm actually stuck don't
eat it um are you trying to like we like
like a 1983 at like oh there you go well
thank you that actually what you're
doing is you're ruining the dual core
track that's on here which is pretty
cool but in addition to that there's a
bunch of other things and the way the
DEF CON does is every other year it
swaps between an analogue in a digital
like you've seen these badges they're
they're basically like mini computers is
pretty cool and so this year was analog
and this year the badge was this record
instead of a circuit board and what's
really cool is that this DEF CON badge
and this hack across America challenge
coin shares something in common they
both have a challenge yeah well they
both have a challenge yes but they were
also both cracked by the Council of nine
oh yes that's cool there's there's a
great write-up on potato sack actually
if you want to go check that out on
actually breaking this down and how how
Council of nine was actually able to you
know figure out lost lost badge but they
were also able to when they you know
finished the DEF CON badge move on to
the hack across America challenge coin
which is epic because this means that I
can now walk you through it in similar
fashion which also means spoilers so if
you're one of the like that's so
so spoilers yes so if you're like one of
the 1000 people who received one of
these coins on the hike across America
2013 tour and you're still working on it
just an FYI otherwise this is really fun
coin and I can't wait to walk you
through it
because there's lots of cool fun gels
and stuff and we're gonna build on this
here real soon
so here is the coin see if we can get a
tight shot on that there we go there's
the front of the coin you'll notice you
got the hak5 emblem on there and it says
trust you technolo sits at the top then
we also have the hack across America and
in between I'll notice a little bit of
cipher text oh good stuff also on the
back there's a lot going on on the back
so we have degrees around the top
starting with 0 so 360 degrees around
here we have the domain.com logo in the
center because domain.com was epic
enough to pay for these because they're
not cheap and those guys are rad and
actually a lot of this had to do with
David over there calling me and saying
like yeah do do something cool but like
Sumerian on there so we'll get to why
Sumerian is on here but most notably
you'll notice there are some numbers
around the perimeter there at the very
top it starts with hashtag hack across
America and then it starts with 3 3 4 4
1 then 2 8 7 8 2 then this one should be
very familiar it's yes this should be
pretty familiar with anybody
old school hack 5 especially you and
Paul Shannon 2 3 1 8 5 oh yeah - 3 1 8 8
News Berg Virginia so actually all of
these zip codes in fact represent the
the places that I visited all the way
around you can see as the numbers
increase you know we're in the four
thousands here or the 40 thousands of
the 30 thousands the 70,000 to 80,000
and then finally ends up in 94 104 which
is San Francisco California this
represents the first hack across America
on the motorcycle bringing us all to
California such good times that is
really cool yeah and yes zip codes
increases they go west good stuff um but
they are not just a zip codes they're
actually you can mod 25 these guys which
is a really simple cipher it just zeros
a 25 to Z oh right so the mod 25
over to a one-time pad if you will and
so basically this one time have had it's
been used many times on Twitter with the
hashtag hashtag hack across America
which makes us susceptible to all sorts
of attacks because well they're one-time
pads mm-hmm they're not supposed to be
reused but anyway you get a bunch of
jumbles of letters when you take all of
those zip codes and convert them over
and you'll also notice another jumble of
letters right here so this translates
over to our nough Thompson one two four
when you use the one-time pad around the
perimeter to actually decipher that now
if you search Arno Thompson you're gonna
get what's called a document a or it's
actually a catalog of anecdotes a
addenda to the aarne-thompson catalog of
anecdotes in the folklore archives of
the finished literature Society
what what does that okay so it's a
document it is a multi-volume tale type
index designed to aid folklorists in
identifying reoccurring plot patterns in
the narratives and the structures of
traditional folk tales oh that's what's
really cool so here it is on Wikipedia
and you can go ahead and pick up this
classification system it's really cool
basically you've got animal tales and
fairy tales and religious tales and it's
a way to catalog all of these so that
you can figure out what the different
plots are so if you haven't lost it
already one two four as we mentioned
that comes down to the Three Little Pigs
now as we're familiar the story of the
three little pigs had to do with these
guys that were trying to save themselves
from was it the wolf yes the big bad
wolf by the way isn't like so many fairy
tales is ridiculous which is why why one
of the numbers is a four I think or
maybe it's the two either way so this
classification system brought brings us
to the Three Little Pigs and as we know
the three pigs tried to save themselves
from the big bad wolf by hiding in a
house full straw and worked so well
houseful made a wood didn't work so well
and then finally a house of bricks and
that worked all right
I should also point out that sometimes
the RNA Thompson dude is like spelled
different for some reasons which is why
if you go to EE f5 to or for d68 comm
which is a reoccurring shared key that
we use on hack 5 quite a lot it's also
printed on this coin right here
the original hack 5 this is the 7 year
challenge coin and on the back there
that translates over if you get your QR
code reader out right now to ef5 to a4
d68 so if you go to that website I'll
pick that up scan that by the way with
the reflection yes it is you get this
and if you take that and run it through
the one-time pad you'll actually get
said and then a bunch of letters /s so
said of course being the UNIX tool to do
some replacements and in this case I'm
just replacing the one spelling of
aarne-thompson with the other because
sometimes it's with an e sometimes it's
with an a okay and your mileage may vary
on Google so that's kind of like a
little hint there so one to four being
three little pigs the big bad wolf as we
know and worked out pretty well for the
pigs I guess for the one in the brick
house that brings us to the Sumerian
okay okay so around the perimeter we
have these numbers which are obvious
they should be zero being here you know
180 being here so those are your degrees
we also have a couple of clocks around
here so the degrees are actually marked
with these clocks these two clocks right
here and here and one of them is
inverted and one is not and it's really
difficult to see the minute and second
hands because they're so small however
there are also in the each quadrant
these what are called Sumerian sex
gizmos so they're kind of like
hieroglyphics right so these and those
are for this clock and these and those
are for that clock and so what those
mean is basically the Sumerians had
invented a base six 360 numbering system
in the third millennium BC and it was
passed down through the ancient
Babylonians who totally ripped them off
and it's now used to measure things like
time and angle and geographic
ordnance in fact it is the reason why we
have 60 seconds in a minute and it's the
reason why we have 60 minutes in an hour
and it's the reason why there are 360
degrees in a compass even though the
military sometimes uses a thousand
degree compass which is weird but
whatever it's arbitrary like why not and
there's actually a really cool counting
system with their knuckles and stuff
that I'm not gonna get into now but
anyway suffice it to say the Sumerians
were kind of badass and domain.com was
kind of badass for starting this whole
mess by saying like dude put Sumerian on
the coin and I'm like awesome I think it
has something to do with William Gibson
move on but if you take degrees minutes
and seconds as you know those can be
expressed as longitude and latitude and
so the non inverted clock here in the
top right this here is going to go ahead
when you decipher the sex gizmos there
it's going to equal around its well you
can see it's around 38 degrees just
based on the numbers right here yeah but
when you decipher these you find out
that it's 38 degrees 14 minutes and five
seconds now the inverted clock over here
that's at 122 degrees but since it's
it's inverted I'm trying to say that
it's negative 122 so- 122 degrees by 38
minutes by 33 seconds now if you didn't
make it negative you just end up
somewhere and like the Mediterranean in
the wrong place but when we go ahead and
see you and we sort of latitude and
longitude coordinates yes
that brings you to if you want to
convert those over to decimal you get to
thirty-eight point two three four seven
two two by negative 120 two point six
four to five okay okay so now of course
the first thing you're going to want to
do is pull that up in Google Maps and
start an epic road trip no matter where
you are
so yeah I'll pick it up from here so
when you actually put in those latitude
and longitude coordinates you end up in
a place in Petaluma if I am correct
so specifically it's 140 Keller Street
and you'll see a little thing right here
that says Twitter on it and if I take my
little Street View guy right here and
drop them you'll notice that and let's
go over here to the entrance
well why don't you refresh that while i
zoom in I've got it over here so a lot
of people were like wait a second so now
you're telling me that I have to drive
to this cow town outside of San
Francisco and that's not necessarily the
case if we drop this street my jakey
did it really okay well then I'm gonna
go down Keller Street and suddenly
there's like an arrow an extra arrow
here and we can actually just from
within Street View walk in the door of
the TWiT brick house so the TWiT brick
house it's known to many podcast
aficionados as Leela force home and it
was paid for by many contributors who
were who basically got customized bricks
laid when they contributed and so we did
that and if we actually go down this
corridor here so when you go through the
corridor if you look closely at all the
different bricks you will find a having
five brick and luckily it's right in the
middle where you can see it pretty
easily it's just past this door yeah and
if you look above oh there we go
ah now mine is getting all weird there
we are
yeah yeah it's above Sonos hak5 and so
yes that's pretty epic that using Street
View were able to go into the lobby of
this place and find a brick labeled hak5
and you'll actually notice right under
hack five it says 3 2 D 2 7 4 8 d 4 8
and just uh just a little fYI that's
actually a 64-bit web key that's derived
when you use that when you generate it
from church to check into this oh
because you know I was thinking ahead in
2010 when we made those bricks so there
we go that right there
brings us back to the front of the coin
now another front of coin as I mentioned
over here we have our hack across
America and we have these two lines here
and what that is is that is some
ciphertext this is actually a es 256
encrypted and that 3 - D - 7 4 BD 4 8
that we saw on the brick is actually the
key
to the coin and so when you decipher
that actually brings you to a URL which
then concludes the first phase of the
hack across America challenge the first
phase the first phase I don't want to
spoil it
although I just did spoil it so follow
