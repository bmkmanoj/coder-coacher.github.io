with uber tooth one and spectrum
analyzing 2.4 gigahertz your user picks
for multi boot USB creators sexing up
our favorite Wi-Fi monitoring tool a
Python feed aggregator and more this
time on hack 5 this segment of hack 5 is
brought to you by t-mobile hello welcome
back 5 my name is Gerren kitchen
my name is Shannon Morse and this is the
Mouseketeers
sound off I went to Disneyland yeah I
see that
is it a cute I went to electronica and
the worlds of color and I've been there
since I was 5 years old so I went on
Indiana Jones again cuz all I remembered
was the boulder coming from flynn's
arcade no it was kind of you know it was
kind of sad and depressing influenced
arcades I would there was no Galaga I
noticed in a star Galaga it wasn't there
when I was I've got a video of Galaga
from it seriously ok you'll have to show
me that after we hosted yeah yeah I was
kind of like hmm but I took hit music
use yeah and I met Snow White ok I meant
the Evil Queen Snow White's cooler she
took all our pictures like this is very
cool she took all of her pictures like
this we got mail
did we yeah maybe we should choose what
we're doing first if you guys had no
didn't hold up and we're having a lot of
fun with some teeth of the uber variety
doing some speculations analysis yeah
yeah and then we're rounding up some new
multiboot goodies mmm yes lots of USB
multi-boot deliciousness from you guys
we're gonna make airmon-ng sexy this is
it's that easy but stick around we're
gonna have a lot of fun de leche in the
long-form edition of hacks I want to
show what this is all the port-to-port 3
if you're on YouTube yeah this is okay
um we get mailed to 548 Market Street
number 3 937 1 San Francisco California
and iPhone 4 and this is a this is
something well what is this it's a post
I hope you enjoyed these pictures
check out more digital agitation calm I
don't know if I should show this my
charity work on Facebook all of this
that's SFW yeah yeah it's there we go oh
it's a little I don't know like
controllers and bondage well thank you
um yes this was sent by does it say
Shutterfly well thank you all do you
want these I don't I don't I really I'm
not gonna hang these really you want
someone with the n64 controller anyway
hot pull stuff thank you maybe maybe
we'll send this on to another
techno list loving individual that wins
trivia or something you've got to stick
around for the new blog for that but
thank you delicious as always we enjoy
receiving your floppy disks of windows
3-1 or your posters of techno less there
you go hey yeah why not
alright so you want to find out about
making uh making the booboo tooth all
sexy and doing a little bit of spectrum
analyzing you know what I don't have fun
I have to go build some multi-boot
deliciousness so I'll talk to you later
okay okay have a good time
alright yeah we've been asked in
numerous times about how about stuff
people ask us everything one of the
things sorry it's a really relaxed show
today one of the things that we were
getting asked a lot though is how to get
started with the uber tooth one if we do
a segment on you know just kind of a 101
you know what it takes to to get this
guy up and running and you know while
this is specific to this hardware really
what's involved is it's similar to many
other tools I know right so anyway if
you're not familiar the uber tooth one
it's an open-source blue two
testing tools made by my Cosman and it's
in response to basically a lack of good
bluetooth testing devices and really
there's some ridiculously high priced
ones in excess of $10,000 for like
commercial monitoring equipment so this
is a very welcome alternative anyway
it's kind of in the same sense that we
have inexpensive Wi-Fi adapters that can
go into monitor or promiscuous mode we
now have the uber tooth one so first and
foremost props go to harvest gardener on
the backtrack Linux forms for putting a
lot of this together while most of the
ober tooth development was done in Mac
OSX
you can easily get it running up in
Linux it's not too difficult thankfully
so today what I'm going to do is go
ahead and setup the dependencies and
compile the uber tooth tools in
backtrack 5 Linux on my host machine so
I guess that's kind of an important
point currently it does not work in a VM
there's kind of like some issues with
Libby USB or at least I haven't been
able to in VirtualBox I may try again
with KVM and get some different results
but we'll see anyway the first
dependency we're going to need is PI
side and if you're not familiar PI side
basically adds cute bindings to Python
letting it use that cross-platform UI
framework for some graphical goodness
yeah now you can go ahead and actually
download that manually from PI side org
or simply go ahead and install it from
apt of course unfortunately it's not in
the default backtrack 5 repository so
you'll go ahead and just add yourself a
little personal package archive or PPA
so let's just go ahead and start by
installing the Python software
properties so apt-get install Python
whoops if I can type
and then we'll add our apt repository
and we'll have to do an app get update
so this will take a minute go ahead and
grab yourself some pineapple juice or
whatever it is you love and now we can
actually go ahead and install those with
apt-get install we'll need Lib and LTAC
dev we need Lib usb tech 1.0 tacho
detective and the PI side tools and now
we're just going to need the PI USB
extension with H's basically provides
USB access to Python I know we're like
pimping our Python today huh
we'll go ahead and extract that archive
and install it now we're also going to
need Bluetooth baseband libraries that
will basically allow us to process raw
Bluetooth data and thankfully lib BT BB
does just the trick
and again extract and in this instance
it's really just a matter of running
make and then make install okay so we're
finally to the part where we actually
get to the uber tooth code and as a
recording the latest version of the uber
tooth software is released two three
eight I'm gonna go ahead and W get that
and again extract it the archive
contains the latest firmware for both
the uber tooth one and the uber tooth
zero as well as the Kai CAD files if
you're so inclined to make your own uber
tooth it also has the documentation and
the host software which includes a few
bluetooth tools kismet plugin and a
little fun spectrum analyzer you see
since the Bluetooth operates in the same
2.4 gigahertz is M band is Wi-Fi we can
actually use nuber tooth one has a basic
spectrum analyzer and see all of the
Wi-Fi signals in a given area so in that
case what we're gonna do here is run let
me LS here yeah so there it is the
spectrum analyzer you why so python spec
and underscore you I got py alright let
me go ahead and maximize this okay
alright and as you can see there's a lot
of you know signal in the area you can
actually see on the far left that's
channel one and on the far right would
be channel 14 and what's kind of fun
thing to do here is if Shannon you want
to actually hit that microwave we've got
a microwave here in the little
kitchenette at the office and look at it
just go crazy not fun I know Wi-Fi
interferes this is great anyway alright
I know that that's thank you go ahead
and kill that I know that's a lot of
info and we're gonna just go ahead and
stop right here and pick up next time
with compiling the kismet from compiling
kismet from source so that we can
actually use the uber tooth plugin and
then go ahead and pack packet capturing
our first Bluetooth packets then we're
going to go ahead and install Wireshark
plug in so we can finally analyze all of
that good stuff and if you haven't
already checked out you can find the
uber tooth one at hack shop comm along
with all of the documentation and the
source files if you're crafting up with
a soldering iron and eager to build your
own now stay tuned because in just a bit
Shannon's going to be introducing her
user picks for multi boot USB creators
but first let's take a quick break and
