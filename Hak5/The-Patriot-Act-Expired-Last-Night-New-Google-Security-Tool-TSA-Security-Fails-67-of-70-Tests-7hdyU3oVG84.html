google makes privacy and security easier
holla VPN 8 secure and a TSA Red Team
stomps TSA security all that more coming
up now on threat liar happy Monday
people i'm patrick norton and this is
threat wire for june first 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and internet freedom I'd like to
start with a huge thanks to everyone
watching especially the folks that are
supporting us at patreon.com / threat
wire with that let's get started first
up did the Patriot Act expire last night
I'm going to quote NPR here quoting
senator Mitch McConnell sometime May
31st that Sunday is in yesterday quote
we shouldn't be disarming unilaterally
as our enemies grow more sophisticated
and aggressive and we certainly should
not be doing so based on a campaign of
demagoguery and disinformation launched
in the wake of unlawful actions of
Edward Snowden meanwhile on Sunday
Senator Rand Paul battled to make sure
the USA Freedom Act would not get voted
on before midnight and which time key
parts of the Patriot Act would expire
the ones used by the NSA to justify bulk
metadata you might know it is massive
phone records gathering or the FBI the
stuff they used to gain Patriot Act
wiretaps in fact the NSA told CNN
officially shut down the bulk metadata
collection program at 744 p.m. on sunday
well in advance of the midnight deadline
for the sunset of the Patriot Act powers
what does all this mean well the USA
Freedom Act will probably get past later
this week it's a compromise between
privacy advocates and color me biased
the folks that believe spying on all
Americans all the time is the only way
to keep America safe as far as the bulk
metadata stuff the Freedom Act telephone
records storage well it gets shoved to
the phone companies instead of at the
NSA so the data will still be gathered
just stored off site which is pretty
accessible if you're the NSA meanwhile
the Justice Department will still be
able to gain wiretap orders for ongoing
investigations under a grandfather
clause in the Patriot Act and that's
just the tip of this iceberg I'm greatly
oversimplifying the battle in the Senate
and skipping large parts of the USA
Freedom Act we'll look at it more later
this week especially if it passes gmail
Docs sheets hangouts calendars Darren
Shannon and IG
a lot about having given our lives over
to Google and we're only half kidding if
anybody ever cracks into my account yes
I have two factor authentication turned
on they can pretty much wreak havoc on
my personal and professional life just
make it a mess so Google promised more
security and Android and back in google
io m is not here yet of course but this
morning Google dropped two new websites
to help you figure out what's going on
with your life on Google the big one my
account google com makes it much easier
to find the tools to change sign in
device ads and other settings on google
and they even created a security setup
wizard to help with passwords and to
verify your device's amazing how many
devices i've logged into in the last
year my favorite find in there though
comes from engadget steve dent who wrote
quote did you know that Google can go
ahead and feature your publicly shared
Google Plus images as a background for
its products and services well now you
do and mountain view lets you take a box
if you want them to cut that out
meanwhile privacy google com is a faq
with answers to questions like what data
does Google collect what does Google do
with the data it collects does Google
sell my personal information what tools
do i have to control my google
experience how does google keep my
information safe and what can i do to
stay safe online i will be spending a
lot of quality time in both sites over
the next couple of days mostly the my
account one because there's a lot of
stuff out there I didn't realize I know
Darren told you on Friday about Halla
VPN and the possibility of using it is
sort of a tool for doing the various
things on the internet kind of a
different spin on that this morning on
cnet com basically a story from adios
holla org which is a security group that
pretty much wants you to stop using
holla you and the 47 million other
people that apparently are using the VPN
service to dogs geofencing on video
content in any case adios holla org says
one that they allow for you to be
tracked across the internet no matter
what you do to they send traffic of
strangers through your internet
connection makes sense it's peer-to-peer
3 they sell access to third parties like
Darren told you and they don't care what
it's used for and for they let anybody
execute programs on your computer now in
theory that one's actually been fixed by
halle but there's a workaround to get
around the fix by halle to allow people
to remotely execute programs on your
computer which is something you never
want people to do so do yourself a favor
if you're a little concerned about Halle
using their company called Luminati to
sell access to your machine or the
network your machine is on a 20 bucks a
gigabyte to do who knows what with your
ISP connection do yourself a favor
listen to the crew of security
researchers behind adios holla org they
claim they don't work for competitors
they say they stand to make no financial
gain they just want you to stop using
holla right now and given the number of
VPN alternatives it's probably worth
considering we usually think of red
teams as the hackers employed to find
weaknesses and computer networks and
systems the red team came in and center
VPN isn't secure but homeland security
red team's found that quote tsa agents
failed 67 out of 70 tests with red team
members repeatedly able to get potential
weapons through checkpoints ouch that
report comes from an ABC News reports
citing quote officials briefed on the
results of a recent homeland security
inspector general's report how bad are
we talking here look we usually try to
hold the we don't like fun fear
uncertainty and doubt but this quote
really stood out in one test an
undercover agent was stopped after
setting off an alarm at a magnetometer
but TSA screeners failed to detect a
fake explosive device that was taped to
his back during a follow-on pat-down so
TSA security make your own call on that
one and in lighter news the next chapter
of Windows security hey windows edge
browser starts to line 29th the official
release date of Windows 10 that's all
for today our next episode hits
wednesday june third and you can find
all our episodes of threat why are links
to our social networks and pretty much
everything else you need to know to
contribute over at threat wire net I
hope you'll contribute to
patreon.com/scishow all I cash air and I
subscribe go a long way to with that I'm
Patrick Norton and I'll see you out on
the Internet
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
