setups for all your traffic tunneling
needs a visit to the RSA conference in
ubuntu folder encryption all day and
more this time on hak5 this segment is
brought to you by untangle hello welcome
back five my name is darren kitchen and
this is your weekly dose of techno lust
and this week i am coming to you guys
from amsterdam i am at the technology
incognita i totally mispronounced that
anyways tech inc dot NL is the place
where you need to go to find this hacker
space and i'm having a hurt her tongue
done something it's it's the the herp
derp here here at the at the amsterdam
and it's actually really good so I'm
excited to be doing this and I've been
getting great feedback on the tour and I
want to thank you for all of that
contributed stuff stay tuned for some
big announcements with other big tours
in mind but today the kind of concept
that I want to get into is VPNs I know
that we've talked about this a little
bit in the past year with a detail and
some of the other virtual private
network technologies but considering
that I'm hacking through Europe and
obviously I'm concerned about my
security as we all should be my privacy
and going through borders and things of
that nature I never want to be just like
out there on the open internet without
you know tunneling my traffic and in so
many ways just for the simplicity of say
even just booking a flight where I can't
do so if my IP address is coming from
Europe because my credit card is in the
United States things of that nature
really helps and so I guess I don't need
to tell you on the concept you guys
already know and I wanted to show you
what i'm using this
time for hack across Europe for my VPN
server because change you to have a
better used to use openvpn and I used
that because it was really easy to set
up with a detail and whatnot and I'm
going to show some other really easy
ways to get set up if you don't want to
set up like a virtual private server if
you say you just got a spare machine at
home but if you do have like a virtual
private server anything running Linux
there's a really easy way to set a
pop-top now pop top is a pptp Damon or a
point-to-point tunneling protocol Damon
and the reason that I choose pptp as
opposed to ipsec or some of the other
VPN technologies is because it's pretty
ubiquitous when it comes to like mobile
phones specifically that's what I wanted
I wanted the same thing that I use on a
laptop to be able to use on my android
phone so I can go everywhere and and get
connected wherever not have to think too
much about the you know what packets are
leaking out wherever as shuttle is what
I mainly use on my laptop but I do like
the flexibility of a pptp and so it's no
more difficult to set up then an ssh
server really but you do need ssh into
your VPS so I am I'm already ssh into my
VPS and what I want to show you is this
awesome script here and I got this
script over at put dispenser here calm
this is an awesome blog where where as
security researcher demonstrated how
there's pizza happening yeah it's good
actually okay so we're going to use the
script to set up very quickly and easily
on debian here we're an ubuntu a pop-top
server it's really simple check this out
so here's a script and if you go through
this basically it it oops that was
cutting it I don't want to cat it I want
in here we'll use man out
it's an interactive pop-top installer
which is really nice because it sets up
the IP tables for you it sets up all of
the configuration scripts if it even
walks you through setting up your first
user I've done this the long way before
after having seen this there's really no
reason not to use this I will point out
that there's a caveat in that the scoop
day you're going to find out put
dispenser die here makes a reference to
an IP address expecting you know to get
the IP address from if config v-net 0
colon 0 now if that is not your server
if you are not doing an open VZ server
it's not going to be that in fact on
this server here them on if i if config
i see that it's just regular eth0 for my
for my land interface so really it's
just a matter of changing that out down
here and I've already done this so just
change you your your interface so that
it makes sense so instead of being at 0
my case it's eth0 other than that I
really haven't had to make any tweaks to
this you can see what it does is you
know it doesn't have to get updated have
to install peepee teepee d which is pop
top and then it goes ahead and creates
the configuration file with a little cat
action and from from there just walks
you through some basic setups with some
ifs and stuff it's it's a really an easy
setup script but it's just a nice thing
to quickly and easily get going so let's
go ahead and issue this I've already
actually set up the script as executable
and so I get prompted here if I want to
set up a new pop tops over and create a
user or create additional users so I'll
go ahead and walk through setting up the
server I'm going to give it a username
I'm going to give it a password
oh yeah and it's doing a apt-get update
and there we go its server setup is
complete go ahead to end point my veep
my connection over to this IP address
with this user name and this password
that's it in fact let's go ahead and
walk through what this did so in / etsy
/ PPP you're going to find the options
here first and foremost you're going to
see if I nano this ppt pd tak options
and this is where sets up all of those
options one thing that you may want to
do is comment out default route or no
default route this is setting it so that
when your device connects to this VPN it
won't automatically set this as its
default gateway to the internet it will
use what it currently has that's nice
and you just want to be able to like VPN
into a network to have access to that
networks resources but for what I'm
trying to do with tunneling all of my
traffic I want to make sure that
everything goes to this VPN so I'm going
to comment that out the other important
file here is chapped secrets and if I
come in here you'll see that I've
actually already done this so I have
this listed in here twice so just to
leave that out but basically you just
give it a name of the client name of the
client an asterisk for the server
because we only have one server the
secret or the password in this case lame
password and for the IP address asterisk
because it's going to be assigned by
DHCP i will note again back in pptp
options we do want to make sure like
it's refusing ms chap it's refusing chap
it's refusing pop these are
authentication protocols that are
horrible in fact even ms chappy 2 i'm
not the most keen on but i do feel
better using this than not using
anything at all and like i said it's
built into iOS Android and you can get
clients very easily for Linux there's
you know a native support in OS
and windows so I think pptp is a pretty
good option in that case you can also
set your dns servers here in this case
just googles so with all of that and
going to go ahead and restart the server
let's see with a slash etsy slush in it
top D pptp D and then restart since I've
made configuration changes and there we
go we're set now I've already set up a
DNS pointed to this server so it's very
easy to go ahead and configure in this
case my phone so let's go ahead and
configure my phone alright so here we
are on my android phone and the first
thing i want to do is check for portals
that I can hack no I'm sorry what I need
to do is come down to settings under
more and you'll find VPN and let's
simply add a VPN network and in this
case the name of it and the server
address so i'll call it fig because i
like fruit fruit or really good and
again it's automatically selected pptp
it is nice that the newer versions
Android you can get the ipsec support so
we can touch on that again later but for
the server address it is me at least the
DNS I've pointed fig dot hack five dot
org and that's it I want to make sure
that i'm using encryption I can show
Advanced Options and set my own DNS or
servers and forwarding if I need to I
don't so I'm just going to go ahead and
with the default save that and then
touch on this and it will ask for my
username which we set up is DK and my
password lame password
oops did I just miss Belle password and
I will be lazy and save the account
information now that one let's not be
lazy all right so connecting and connect
it and you'll know you are because
you'll notice at the top here you end up
with a VPN is activated and you know
this is the same kind of you know same
kind of software we could go to internet
and pull up like IP chicken or any other
place that will tell your IP address and
look at that that is my US IP address
i'm now coming in from the server in New
Jersey instead of Amsterdam which is
great because now I can watch hulu and
all that other fun stuff but for the
most part what I'm concerned about is
this is now an encrypted connection
between say the Wi-Fi here at the
hackerspace and my private server and
you know I can also verify that things
are going out the way that I want like
going into a terminal I like better
terminal emulator pro and run route and
see there we go 173 214 164 136 as one
of my is my default gateway and there we
go and that's pretty much the setup and
this is the reason that I use this it's
quick and easy it's just one little
script you can just run that and be
rockin and let me know what you guys
think and with all of that onion we're
gonna take a quick break and then I'm
going to hand it over to Shannon in
studio cheers
thinking about replacing your outdated
firewall your gateway or UTM wondering

/ hak5 hey guys so we decided to head up
to the RSA conference 2013 over in San
Francisco just a quick drive over the
bridge and they're having it over at the
moscone center again this year you know
I know the RSA Conference is a little
bit more enterprise and its spin very
leaning towards companies but i figured
it's worth a try we're gonna go check it
out make a quick visit out of it get
some schwag and see what kind of
interviews we can come home with checked
out
hey guys i'm here at the RSA conference
in san francisco year 2013 and i found
tile era and mr. Bob dunk Bob hi how are
you doing today nice to meet you thanks
you too now i forgive me i've never
heard of tile era but i hear that it's
pretty cool tell me a little bit about
your company well tile era is a very
exciting company we've been around came
out of stealth mode in 2007 it's
originally an MIT spin out we are the
leader in many core processors meaning
we're putting a lot of compute on a chip
through replication of lots of course so
we deliver really really high
performance and our architecture is very
low power and therefore very power
efficient now what do you guys suggest
that I would use this for mainly well
you know we're here at the RSA
conference and a lot of the people here
on the show floor are using tile era
chips to run their engines intrusion
detection intuition prevention denial of
service prevention encryption decryption
IPSec ssl lots of security applications
are very appropriate to run on this chip
now is this something that a video gamer
would appreciate or is this more related
towards infrastructure and like data
analysis yeah so our target markets are
mostly infrastructures so we sell to
companies building embedded appliances
or servers or the like for really high
throughput applications in the
infrastructure can you give me an
example of a new one that you have out
cuz I heard you had a new one coming out
this year that's right we have just
announced the tile GX 72 so we have 72
processor cores on one ship 80 gigabits
of i/o pci express memory controllers
it's a complete system on a chip now you
said it was low power to is is that the
big thing that makes you different from
other processors out there well there's
really a few things so one of them
certainly is our power efficiency
getting more compute per watt which
matters in applications where you have a
thermal limit and just about every
appliance does it can only support so
much wattage that's very important but
just raw compute and the ability to
manipulate packets really quickly at
wire speed for even minimum packet sizes
that's awesome now a lot of our audio
are there the open-source people there
the Linux geeks and a lot of them owned
companies out there where they need to
do data loss prevention and things like
that are you guys open source or how
does that work for you yeah absolutely
Tyler has been very friendly to the open
source community we run linux on the
chip we run a lots of open source
applications all our development
environment is open so we're we're
really kind of anti boutique programming
or special languages we want to open it
up to the average programmer that's
wonderful it's so good to hear that you
guys keep it open and keep it you know
open source for everybody and easy to
use that's so important no proprietary
code I hate that stuff Bob thank you
very much for speaking to me about this
and I definitely have to check out the
big board back there what's going on
with that one absolutely so maybe we can
give you a tour of the appliance over
here so the new chip we just announced
was the GX 72 here it is in our server
box 72 cores their 80 gig of i/o on the
rear panel I think we have something
like 32 gigabytes of DRAM on there and
and yeah you program in c and c++ and
java in a linux 30 colonel that's
beautiful now where can i find more
information last question I swear so
Tyler accom wewt I le are a calm awesome
thank you so much Bob it was good
speaking to you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
