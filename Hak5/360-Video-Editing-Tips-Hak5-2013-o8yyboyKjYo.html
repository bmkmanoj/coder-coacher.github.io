time on hack 5 hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen and this is
your weekly dose of Technol s if you
haven't already figured it out
snubz is missing so if you see her
please send an email to feedback at hack
5 org we're all very worried know you're
tuning in while we're all off which is
why this is going to be somewhat of a
abbreviated episode in that Jenna and I
are currently rocking across the planet
you can find more details about that
over at do actually you can just go
ahead and head over to Shannon's
Instagram to see her and a llama
how crazy otherwise AK across the planet
calm will take you to all the details on
the meetups if you're watching this week
you may be able to get in on the Gold
Coast or Sydney if not Tokyo meetups so
check that out at hack across the planet
calm but what we're gonna do this week
is pick up on some brief stuff that we
were doing last week as an introduction
to VR videography or 360 videography or
however you want to call it and just
take a quick look at what it takes to
actually edit some video in that format
so basically this is going to vary based
on a vendor of your particular camera
and as an example here I'm using the
Ricoh theta but essentially the workflow
for all of these is I mean it's it's
kind of bizarre because we really are
just stepping into the kiddie pool here
as it were with this technology but for
each particular camera there's an
initial ingestion that tool that is
going to be particularly that specific
camera so for the Ricoh theta the first
thing I need to do off of that camera
which has two hundred eighty degree
lenses is run it through their tool
which is going to give me my
equirectangular formatted video that's
going to be different if you're using a
kodak SP 360 if you're using a gyro pic
if you're using a bubble if you're
whatever camera you happen to be using
that said equirectangular is as we
talked about last week seems to be the
format
of choice for this kind of videography
so let's take a quick look at what that
looks like so here we have a couple of
videos and this is the this is what it
looks like coming right off the camera
okay and as you can see this is actually
not a very large resolution I think this
is basically 1080p across two lenses so
you get something like 1080 a actually
it's it's pretty bad let's go ahead and
actually check this here under media
information and the codec you'll see
yeah it's 1920 by 10 90 it it's not
really that great and that's why I say
like this camera seems to do alright
when it comes to still photography video
is a little lacking but hey you know it
fits in your pocket for those bigger
rigs check out the in fact the crazy one
that Facebook launched you're gonna get
amazing video from those either way
whatever the workflow happens to be
equirectangular seems to be the format
of choice when it actually comes to
chopping this up because I've got this
really awesome long video from this
helicopter tour over Waikiki and I don't
necessarily need the bits where we go
into takeoff and landing and stuff like
that so I just want to get the cool
stuff by the way
thumbs up for the crazy hair today
because I just I feel crazy today that
said let's go ahead and take a look at
what happens when we convert that so
with the reco for instance if I open
this clip in a special application here
I'll get the option to go ahead and save
this out into a playable format you'll
notice in fact to get a couple of yen
symbols here that's a Japanese company
it's kind of interesting but this
software spits out an underscore ER or
equirectangular format I've already gone
ahead and done that so I end up with
something that looks like this and as we
talked about last week stretched at the
top it stretched at the bottom it seems
pretty normal in the middle but we want
to go ahead and trim this a little bit
so what we'll need to do is any
nonlinear editor I happen to be a big
fan of premiere and I'll go ahead and
just drop that guy onto the timeline
another fun little tip here go ahead and
quit that another fun little tip here is
in premiere if you just drag the clip
onto the new icon it will create a
timeline that already has all of the
parameters for that particular video and
you'll see right there so sequences 1920
by 960 so as you can see we have lost
considerable resolution so that's why if
you saw the behind the scenes 360 video
here at the hak5 studio last week you
may notice like it kind of looks like
garbage and unfortunately that's pretty
much how it is with the Ricoh at least
right now so with that I have it on the
timeline and I can go ahead and see that
this is like in seven minute clip and
let's just you know do a little trim
each REME
so that looks like a good spot to start
you like that over and this is fun doing
with a touch pad so there we go now I've
got it down to about a minute and 18
seconds and I'll click on that audio and
get rid of it because it's just
helicopter noise and now I have a pretty
little video of me looking awkward in a
helicopter with boats also as far as
helicopters are concerned I need to take
this moment to apologize to the internet
for being wrong as it were that was not
a helicopter from Hawaii five-o it was
in fact magnum p.i so that's good to
know
alright so back to our edit I can go
ahead and just render this out like I
would any other and what I would want to
do in this case is I want to give it a
format that it's going to be happy with
on say YouTube so I'll go with in h.264
and I want to match the source so
basically that's not going to mess with
the dimensions or anything so my output
as you can see down here will still be
1920 by 960
I've already done that and what you'll
end up with is I have my equirectangular
edited file and here you can see that
the video clip is much shorter there we
go so I've got about a 52 second clip
just as I'm going over the beaches in
Waikiki at this point I can actually go
ahead and get this on the youtubes once
I inject some
metadata we talked about that briefly
last week this is what it pretty much
looks like there is a tool from YouTube
called the spatial media metadata
injector I love me an injector and this
this tool which is available for Windows
and Mac and is also available as just a
Python file which is really cool because
you could automate a lot of stuff with
that in the command line allows you to
go ahead and inject metadata into this
so that it's appropriate for YouTube so
what you do is you just open and then I
choose that clip that we just made and
it's going to go ahead and save out a
fixed version of this so you have to
check spherical which allows it to know
like okay so this is gonna be like
stretched around a sphere you don't
check the 3d top bottom and then you hit
save as and what you end up with is well
in this case this file which looks
exactly like the original except it has
some extra bits in there so now if we
can actually go ahead and upload this to
YouTube it will show go ahead and do it
as private or unlisted because at first
it's going to take a while for the
YouTube to actually process it and turn
it into a 360 video hopefully this step
is an act applicable if you're watching
this video in the future and I know that
it is possible because our friends over
at Facebook have implemented just such a
thing where it's able to actually detect
and so it doesn't need a special program
in fact the Facebook uploader seems to
have a lot more options as far as the
field of view and other cool stuff so
way to go Facebook if you're watching
this on Facebook by the way this has
been free booted in which case yay ok
cool
with that we're gonna take a quick break
and when I get back we'll see if the
hair is still crazy speaking of crazy
