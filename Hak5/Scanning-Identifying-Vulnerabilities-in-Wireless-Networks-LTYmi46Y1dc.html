this spot from episode 3 when we did our
art cache poisoning
Harrison here's getting ready to show us
another sweet security loophole but
joining us is another just absolutely
beautifully talented hacker Isabel my
name is Isabel say hello Isabel so we
decided to do something a little bit
different today yeah this time around
instead of having a specific hack in
mind we went out in the field to find
out what was available to us
unfortunately this network is not on the
women marry Network so it's not gonna be
a lot of fun so let's head down and find
a wireless network that is on the way
memory Network founded in 1693 by the
Reverend James Blea
the College of William and Mary is the
second oldest institution of higher
learning in the United States second to
Harvard she's gonna show us where the
wireless networks are you know I sort of
feel bad about owning William and Mary
kids because they don't really know any
better
so Isabelle has taken us all the way to
the college of women marry bookstore in
1862 during the American Civil War
drunken soldiers of the fifth
Pennsylvania Calvary set fire to the
Wren building reportedly in an attempt
to prevent Confederate snipers from
using it for cover I believe they have a
Wi-Fi access point here and not only
that but it's tied into the Wainwright
wireless network Wes weapons of mass
destruction please aah so the first step
in any successful attack is to run a
little bit of enumeration on the network
that way you can gather some information
about your target so we decided to run a
few in map scans so we could figure out
what systems were vulnerable normally
you need a key because you can jump on
the wireless network they have a device
that are a piece of software that
authenticates you from a website now we
just happen to have a username and
password which yes some things are
better left unsaid but if your student
number 1763 thank you so we're gonna
first find out our subnet and then run a
few in map scans so the first scan we
ran was a ping scan now that will show
us what computers and how many computers
are on the network I have a hard time
imagining that all of these computers
are wireless users because everybody's
on break so all the students are gone
there's nobody these wireless network I
have a feeling what it looks like is
they're using something like the
SonicWALL Soho 3 tzw which is integrated
Wireless into the firewall so the subnet
for the wireless can be set up to be the
same as the subnet for the wired
computer so what we see on our wireless
network connect is the same thing wired
the wired network the next game we ran
was a version scan which revealed the
application name and version of every
software and service that's running on a
particular computer now we did this
several times until we found a
vulnerable computer now this is
interesting I'm seeing
it's actually really interesting yeah I
don't know why why in the world
somebody's got an Apache box out but it
looks like there's an old Apache server
running okay so the particularly version
of Apache that was running on this
computer was one point three point one
seven which is very old and also
susceptible to numerous attacks why
don't we jump on the web and I'm gonna
run a security focus real quick and see
if we can come up with some sort of
exploit for this version of Apache
security focus is a great website that's
not only hosted the bug track mailing
list but also has an up-to-date list of
exploits now some of the other good
sites you can check out our exploit tree
and packet storm according to security
focus Darren you're gonna kill me it
looks like this is built into Metasploit
now so I can see his face already he
doesn't want me using Metasploit all
right you take over that way he can't
hurt he can't like yell at me yeah so I
get yeah yeah okay all right so you're
gonna use Metasploit because it's
already on that computer the IP address
is okay so starting off with Metasploit
we have to decide which exploit we're
going to use and we decided to go with
the Apache chunked win32 yep now the
next step is to set the remote host now
the remote host is obviously the target
computer that we will be exploiting and
from there we decided to do a show of
all the available payloads for our
particular exploit and we set it to the
win32 bind payload right now we have to
set the target that's which operating
system and version of the patch you were
going to be exploiting we set the target
to zero which is the window windows
generic bugger hobs brute force right
and we went ahead and executed the
exploit but this particular payload was
a no-go it did not work yeah so what we
did was unset the payload and then reset
it to the win32 reverse shell now just
as a quick reminder if you're using the
reverse shell you have to make sure to
set your localhost your El host which is
your computer so that shell gets
reflected back to you from there we
executed the exploit and bingo we have a
C prompt in Darwin yep
piece of cake there we are okay all
right so Metasploit has come in here
and prove yourself useful once again
interns like freaking out right now
because the last month but anyhow we've
got rid directory on this computer so
obviously the moral of this story is not
go exploit Apache but rather make sure
that you know who else is on your
network for example number one don't
ever ever ever use a school network ever
number two make sure that when you do
join a network you you know who else is
on the network so you want to scan it
within map just like we didn't find out
who is vulnerable because the
vulnerabilities on a network affect you
directly if we were mean which we're not
we could have chosen to take advantage
of that server we could have set it up
as a host for all types of other attacks
for example we could have made a whole
phishing site out of it and done DNS
poisoning to Spearfish certain users on
that network the other things we could
have done are endless but make sure that
you know who else is on your network and
what services are running that way you
can choose to not be on their network if
you know it's vulnerable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
