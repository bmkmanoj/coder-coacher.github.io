you by domain.com Gregg hey everybody
welcome to this episode of hack five my
name is Shannon Morris and this is your
weekly dose of Technol s you may be
wondering why I have dinosaur Gregg here
instead of Darren and the reason is
because Darren is on his quest for
awesomeness over in Europe you can
follow all that information over at hack
across Europe calm and he's also a
little bit under the weather so I didn't
want him to come in here and contaminate
the entire studio by the way this
episode is releasing the day before his
birthday so make sure that you wish him
a happy birthday okay everybody just go
on Twitter and just like destroy his
entire Twitter stream with happy
birthday wishes so we have a lot of fun
stuff happening on this episode so how
about we go right into it and check it
out hey everybody
so Darren's gone this week he's not
going to be joining me on my segment but
I wanted to have a little bit more fun
with my Arduino so you guys probably
remember last week when I played with
that potentiometer to make my Cylon
well that involved dealing with these
new pins which I haven't really played
with that much yet so I just decided I
should probably figure out how these
work so this week I wanted to talk about
the differences between these two sides
of pins so one side is digital and one
side is analog so these can be used for
inputs either analog inputs or digital
so digital greed which we've been using
in our code this is which we've been
using for like everything from turning a
button on and off to making the LED
blink
you know just simple stuff like that
it's great for button interaction but if
you have something like a light sensor
which I'm gonna play with today which
triggers an action whenever it senses
light or if you have like a temperature
sensor stuff like that it requires this
thing called analog read so analog read
is going to tell you how much light is
being sensed through the light Center
sensor not just if it's on or off so
that's the big difference between analog
and digital
yay so these can be used for temperature
they can be used for light changes
thing that involves a change in in the
range as opposed to just on and off so
we also use this for the potentiometer
as I mentioned before what I did in that
case I just plugged it into the analog a
zero pin and then I triggered the
function by moving the button to change
the speed of the LED flash and it reads
how fast it's going to go not if it's
just on or off so for my first demo
today I'm gonna have two different demo
demos with two different versions of my
code this first one is just going to be
a simple flashing LED so if we want to
look at my little Arduino over here I'll
show you exactly what's going on so
first off we have our Arduino it's
plugged in by a USB and then we have my
breadboard so if we look at the pins on
the Arduino we have one wire going
directly from a digital pin over to the
LED the LED has a resistor which is tied
to ground and that's going over to my
ground pin on the digital side then we
have the light sensor so this is the
little light sensor right here it's a
very very small component but it
basically they all look the same they
have squiggly wires at the top of them
it's pretty easy to tell which ones a
light sensor so that one has a resistor
the resistor is going all the way over
here and that one is going to I believe
that's ground we have one wire that's
going to 5 volts and then we have the
other one which is going to a zero in
this case so we have analog 0 for this
light resistor so when I have it just on
regular light that you see in this room
it blinks on and off at a decent decent
rate if I cover it up completely it
Bleek's faster so you definitely see a
change there and then if I use something
like this little flashlight here and put
it directly on the light sensor you'll
notice that the LED goes really really
slow there we go so it goes crazy slow
so if you want to do this demo for
example I'll show you my code really
quick right over here
alright so it's a very very very very
short clip code first off you put your
constant in tin for your LED whichever
pin is going to be in my case it's nine
the int value equals zero so this sets
the value of the sensor and then you
just have your set up which is going to
say the LED is the output so this is all
very similar and then we go down here to
void loop so this is going to be our
loop which plays again and again until
we unplug it from the power first off we
have analog read which is going to read
the sensor value of a zero there's the
zero digital write is going to be the
LED so it'll turn it off turn it on
it'll automatically stop the program for
a very short time and then turn it off
and again stop the program for a very
short time so you actually see a change
in that on and off in between whenever
it's on so you know you can see it
whenever it's blinking faster or
blinking slower so pretty easy to do in
that case now I'm going to go ahead and
load my other code real quick so you can
see the difference with this one too
this will take a couple of seconds for
it to load but I'll go ahead and run
through the code for you in this case
all this up here is still the same set
up LED is going to be the output LED is
still equals nine for pin number nine
the value still equals zero for the
sensor and that just sets it up down
here the loop is a lot shorter in this
case it says analog read is going to be
a zero so that just reads the sensor
value again and then we have this weird
line here that says analog right LED
value divided by four so this is going
to turn the LED on to match the
brightness of the sensor and then we
wrote in a delay of 50 milliseconds in
between each time it reads the value of
the sensor so this one looks a little
bit weirder but hopefully we can pick it
up on camera so I'll go ahead and pick
this up alright so first off in the room
it's it's you know it's a decently
bright LED if I cover it up you can see
that it dims along with how dim it is on
the light sensor so it tries to match
the light sensor if I put the flashlight
over it it should get brighter and it
does so it gets just a little bit
brighter you can see a very very small
difference in it whenever I do that and
hopefully you see
the camera decently so not a huge change
but you can tell that the LED is going
to change depending on what's happening
with the sensor so the reason I wanted
to bring up this value divided by four
thing that you saw in my code this is
kind of weird but I'm gonna try to
explain it as best I can
analog read can go up to 1023 different
1023 different like computer language
bits or values the values are from 0 to
1023 which is going to be a thousand and
24 different values total so analog
right accepts up to 255 we remember when
we did our brightness 1 it was able to
go up to 255 brightness so value divided
by 24 which our value divided by 4 which
is going to be 1024 divided by 4 equals
250 5.75 which is pretty close to 255
you can also do the same thing with
10:23 if you wanted to so analog signals
can read up to 1024 different signals
between 0 volts and 5 volts on an
Arduino so if I'm using a temperature
sensor for example and this is explained
very very well on the Arduino website as
well if you want to read it up on there
so say I have like a temperature sensor
that does either Fahrenheit or Celsius
depending on which one year you live in
so the reading would have to be
transitioned into something that the
Arduino is going to understand because
if you stick a temperature thing on
there and you just say hey I want you to
read this out as you know 120 Fahrenheit
or whatever it might be that would be
really really hot it's not gonna get it
it's gonna say you know you have to give
me a value between 0 and 10 24 23 so you
have to give it one of those values same
goes for LEDs with a light sensor the
light sensor can trigger up to 1024
different values that will be understood
by the LED as 255 different brightness
levels haha so that's why we had that
value divided by 4 in my code so I know
this was really quick and easy but I
just wanted to kind of round it out and
give you an idea of what the differences
are between these inputs and those
inputs of course there are a lot of
other differences but that's the main
one that I've been running into
so I just wanted to explain it real
quick and we're gonna move on we're
gonna have a little bit of trivia after
the break so stay tuned it doesn't
matter if you're a fan of free candy or
open sky or petrol or logic link or uh
turkey or if the open source encryption
software has been made by the government
the whole time who were fob bus gated or
a frame or if a packet hits a pocket on
a socket on a port for free mustaches if
you have a conspiracy theory you think
to snag a domain name and web hosting
fast boom up and rank you need a website

those over at dome dome domain.com then
get this domain outcome they a very
quick domain discovery system and a very
easy checkout process you know what that
means

we are back in it's time for trivia my
favorite part of the show
sometimes last week's true you a
question was how many of the first Apple
computers were built and the answer is
200 I know that was an easy one this
week's trivia question is what was
Mario's original name if you don't know
who Mario is just Google Nintendo you'll
figure it out answer that over at hack 5
org slash trivia for your chance to win
some awesome hack 5 goodies good luck
I know Greg and then all that crazy
stuff happened in the warehouse
and then I saw that fire I know you
didn't start it but that's ok
I mean I won't tell anybody if he
actually did start it are you live oh
crap
don't tell anybody that I told it was
Greg's fault I didn't start the fire
don't tell Darren that's the Bell routes
