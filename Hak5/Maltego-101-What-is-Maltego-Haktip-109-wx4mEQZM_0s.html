5 and viewers like you
support us directly at hack shop calm
walk and active the show will we break
down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and 19 ninjas I'm Shannon
Morse and today we are checking out
brand new and kind of old-school melty
go yes
so melty go is a program built into Kali
Linux which is what I'm going to show
you today that lets you do
reconnaissance on any person by scraping
up data from all the publicly available
areas of the internets all of them even
the little nooks and crannies so multigo
is used for information gathering and
data mining and it can be useful for
anybody who needs to gather data on a
person or a company and it can be very
very useful if you're working for a
company and you need to find out more
information about them now for my series
on multigo again i am going to be using
kali linux on my virtual machine to
open-mouth ego it's very very simple you
just type melty go into the command line
such as this mouth D goal hit enter and
then you just let it load now since it's
already built in I didn't have to
install anything but if you do just
follow the online tutorial over at mal
teego's website which is patter V I
believe Google it now you go through the
whole registration process which is a
totally free community version of melty
go and then you just sign up there's
also a paid version that can be used for
more detailed outputs and for
penetration testing in a more business
setting which I definitely suggest using
if you need that for
major penetration tests now what I'm
going to do first off is open up a blank
graph and then I'm pretty much golden
and I can go ahead and start my very
first melty go run so to open a new
graph I go up here to this little new
button has a little plus button on it
click on it and it's going to open this
up this new thing that's titled new
graph now you'll notice this thing
called the palette on the left side that
is over here and I'm going to go ahead
and move this out a little bit so you
can see it
so scrolling down this this is going to
show you all sorts of entities that we
can gather data on you can drag and drop
whatever kind of entity that you want to
mind data on by simply and I'm going to
choose domain so I can drag it over here
and then drop it so it automatically
sets to pataga com but you can obviously
change that if you want whatever item
you end up dragging and dropping onto
your graph will end up being a node for
my example I'm going to gather data on
hak5 org because hah I'm allowed to so
I'm going to type in hak5 org and I just
double clicked on the node to be able to
do that and then hit enter and there we
go so now it's changed to hak5 org you
can also change this by double clicking
inside the domain box on your new graph
but my graph still looks kind of boring
so let's go ahead and gather some
specific data to do so I'm going to
right click on my domain box and then
choose run transforms so this means that
it's going to run a search based on
whatever my options depend up being so
I'll right click on it there we go
computers running a little slow so bear
with me so over here I can choose run
transform and I can choose whatever kind
of transform that I want to run hahaha
so I'm going to go ahead and take a look
through here and see which one that I
want to choose you guys play along take
a bit of a time to look at all the
different options and kind of get an
understanding of them and then I will be
right back after the break with even
more fun stuff the hex shop is hack
fives premiers store for all of your pen
testing needs including one of my
favorites the USB rubber ducky which
we're totally bringing to DEFCON and I
can't wait it looks like a flash drive
and it types like a keyboard so it can
type scripts into a computer crazy crazy
fast
like this week's favorite from Jose be
this payload simply sets up a reverse
shell payload on the target computer
it's very simple very very easy to run
and of course we couldn't do this show
without your support so I'd like to
thank you personally with something
special use the coupon code snubz with
any order from the hack shop for your
very own signed hacked tip stickers
thank you so much for supporting the
show
we're back with mallet Tirol
so now you've gotten a chance to go
ahead and run through all the different
options under run transforms go ahead
and choose one that you are interested
in learning about so first off I can run
a transform on the email domain
associated with hak5 org if I wanted to
and I know that there's a few available
out there publicly so I'm pretty sure I
could find like Rubik is email or
something like that so I'm going to
choose emails click on it now it's going
to run then when it's finished I can
scroll down and see what email is
available now I'm going to right click
again I'll run a different transform to
find some more email addresses email at
domain so this would be at HACC five org
let it go ahead and run and then we get
even more ok here we go so we have a
whole bunch on here Darrin at HACC five
org everybody knows that one IT a hack
five org we never did we do IT that's so
funny I wonder if that was some old
school thing that happened before I was
on the show anyway next I can look for
even more information for the website
address which should be hacked five org
I can right click on a server icon so
the next thing I was able to do was look
for a website address which should be
hacked five org so when I get it
appearing over here it says hak5 org
okay cool so that's correct so now I can
right click on this server looking thing
and I can choose a transform labored to
label to server technologies so if I
right click I'm going to look for this
two servers technologies let's see two
server technologies website so I click
on that and then go ahead and let it
wanna run again
okay now we get a whole nother output
down here now when I go over here it
shows me even more interesting
information so now when it's done we can
see that hak5 is running let's see
jQuery and it's running PHP Google
Analytics that's pretty interesting
I can scroll down a little bit farther
and see oh look there's WordPress hmm
how interesting so why is this useful
well if hak5 hasn't updated their
wordpress credentials in a while there
may be a vulnerability there multigo
gives you a really fast and simple way
to search for specific information on a
website on a person on a domain on
pretty much anything that you want to
and return valuable information in just
seconds so it can be really really
useful for if you're working in security
at a certain firm and you need to make
sure that your stuff's up-to-date you
can just click it let it run and there
you go you have your answer in a nice
pretty little graph that you can show
higher up so if you're working at a firm
and it's also really nice to look at at
home - and since it's so simple and
small you can run it from pretty much
any PC now let me know what you think
you can comment below or you can email
us tips at hack 5 org and be sure to
check out our sister show hack 5 at hak5
org for more great stuff just like this
I'll be there reminding you to trust
your techno lust</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
