setting up the Wi-Fi pineapple tetra in
Linux so let's get started the first
step is to plug my computer into the
Wi-Fi pineapples ETH port using the
supplied USB Y cable between the pair of
USB 3 ports on my laptop I'm providing
about 10 watts of power which is
sufficient for the update process and
you can learn more about the specific
power considerations of this beastly
device over a Wi-Fi pineapple comm /
tetra which is where we'll head to
download the latest firmware so let's go
ahead and download the latest firmware
and save it to our downloads folder and
with that I'll want to verify my
connection to the Wi-Fi pineapple tetra
by running if config in a terminal and
you'll notice that in addition to eth0
which is my laptop's built-in Ethernet I
also have ETH 29 and I've received an IP
address from it in the 170 to 1642 range
yours will most likely the ETH 2 or 3
now with that we can come over to 172
1640 - 1 : 14 71 and continue the setup
process we'll click continue and now for
security purposes we'll need to press
the button on the back of the Wi-Fi
pineapple tetra and click continue then
we click Choose file and select our
upgrade bin and click upgrade this
process takes just a few minutes so be
patient and wait for the light to go out
and then start blinking and finally go
solid at which point we'll be ready to
continue setup the blue light is solid
which means the firmware update is
complete and now we're greeted with the
welcome screen so if not hit refresh and
it's just a matter of clicking getting
started from here once again we will
press the button on the back of the
Wi-Fi pineapple tetra to verify
ownership and from here we fill out the
form to complete the setup once again
we'll log in and at this point we can
set up internet connection sharing we
can do this by downloading the WP 5
script from Wi-Fi pineapple comm / WP 6
Sh make that executable and run that as
route alternatively we can plug the live
network cable into the tetras Ethernet
port and click load bulletins from the
dashboard to verify and so with that our
Wi-Fi pineapple tetra is online we've
loaded bulletins we can now go forward
to download
is over the air and I look forward to
hearing your comments so please let us
know what you think and with that I will
see you on the Wi-Fi pineapple forums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
