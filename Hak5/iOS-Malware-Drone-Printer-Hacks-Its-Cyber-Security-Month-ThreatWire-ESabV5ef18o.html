App Store and the ultimate airborne
attack on your corporate network all
that coming up now on threat wire
greetings from beautiful Richmond
California I'm Patrick Norton and this
is threat wire for October 7th 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom and hey
thanks to all of you contributing at
patreon.com slash threat wire you make
this show possible quote Sony
Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton remains
unhappy with how people comb through
leaked emails for embarrassing
information right CNN on the one-year
anniversary of the brutal Sony breach
that took place last year personal
information on 47,000 quotes celebrities
freelancers current and former Sony
employees were leaked on the Internet
hackers even dropped unreleased movies
onto the net and oh yeah the
corporation's email system and doct were
publicly dumped talking about being
doxed damn quote the part that was
distressing was the extent to which
people decided to go through it Saudi
CEO Linton told CNN he still has people
walking up to him at whatever hip lunch
spot he's going to and bringing up the
contents of emails they read online Wow
but that's seriously charming imagine
how the Ashley Madison in Office of
Personnel Management victims feel the
FBI did trace the Sony attacked in North
Korea
apparently trying to prevent the release
of the interview and hey look let's be
honest keeping a nation-state on your
network is pretty hard but damn I've
just decided I need to encrypt
everything I have on a drive or online
that unplug my machines from the network
and burn them with fire and start typing
letters again but not sending them yeah
Burnham before I send them cuz that may
be the only way to ensure security look
I'm being ridiculous but I guess I'm
trying to say security is hard and the
truth is most of the government and big
corporations should be focusing much
harder on it did I mention the OPM
breach what a mess
meanwhile ye specter so named by Palo
Alto Networks is a strong sign that
China is not just an untapped market for
consumer goods but people to exploit
with vicious malware downloadable from
the Apple Store on non jailbroken iOS
devices ye Spectre displays full screen
ads
after you download an app a Spectre
basically it claims to be a new version
of an old iOS media app called queue VOD
which was quote popular for its ability
to allow users to share pornographic
content I think I got that little tidbit
officina ads may sound benign but Palo
Alto Networks says you Specter installs
and launches arbitrary iOS apps can
replace existing apps with those
downloads hijacks other apps execution
to display advertisements change safaris
default search engine bookmarks and open
pages and upload device information Palo
Alto adds quote it's the first malware
we've seen in the wild that abuses
private api's in the iOS system to
implement malicious functionalities let
me see that again
stuff that had been in the lab was out
in the wild on the Chinese iTunes Store
so it has been purged from the App Store
but Palo Alto notes quote moreover
recent research shows that over a
hundred apps in the App Store of abused
private api's and bypassed Apple strict
code review and quote watch out and I
can only hope the u.s. app store is a
little more closely monitored and by the
way Android We Need to Talk
your App Store is still a vicious
vicious mess but I will say thank you
for making it easier to figure out
permissions on apps in the new version
of Android marshmallow I just need to
wait several years before it's out on my
phone by the way did you know its
cybersecurity Awareness Month
neither did I though I'm thinking the
person that named it was a big William
Gibson fan look there's a pretty good
page up at dhs.gov and while I'm about
to mock a few things about cybersecurity
Awareness Month I got to say DHS is
keynote for this week creating a culture
of cybersecurity at work is a pretty
damn good idea did I mention the thing
with Sony and the OPM and the hacking
and the vicious breezin just cruelty
that's going online that said mostly
cyber security where this month means a
lot of organizations that don't normally
talk about security will talk on the
radio about things you should know like
when the ad pops up in your browser it
says you're infected click on this link
to fix it you shouldn't click on that
link and hey you shouldn't open links to
your bank or PayPal or anything that
involves your credit card or stuff from
an Inc link in an email
it's called phishing kids and some of
those emails are pretty good fakes go to
the website and login instead I mean
seriously how long has it been since
you've changed your password
you don't use the same password in every
machine right keep your AV and OS
updated to patch the latest flaws got
all the cool software running the mind
your network even ran a red team
exercise last week are you feelin pretty
on top of it maybe even smug about your
security coolness good you're gonna love
this next story in the words of William
Gibson the street finds its own uses for
things which is why I love this titled
from wired hacking wireless printers
with phones on drones quote you might
think that working on a secured floor in
a 30-story office tower puts you out of
reach of Wi-Fi hackers have to steal
your confidential documents but
researchers in Singapore have
demonstrated how attackers using the
drone plus a mobile phone could easily
intercept documents sent to a seemingly
inaccessible Wi-Fi printer that's all
from Wired how awesome is that go read
