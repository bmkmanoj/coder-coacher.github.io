by go to assist i'm going to show you
guys how to actually back up your gmail
account because well you really never
know what's going to happen out there
there could be the apocalypse Gmail's
entire room of servers wherever they
have them could all go down and burn in
a huge fire you never really know so I'm
going to back up all of my information
whether it's archived in the inbox
starred and labeled all that good stuff
back onto my hard drive just so I can
have it on my encrypted physical machine
oh I'm so sorry Greg I didn't mean to
drop you like that alright so let's go
ahead and get started it's very simple
to do this in ubuntu I'm using the
regular Ubuntu Linux you can also do
this in any other linux distro though it
may be you may have to do work around in
the terminal this version is available
in the Ubuntu Software Center and it is
called get mail so get me Liz the
download that you need you just go into
the boon to software Center and you
install it and next up you do a little
bit of information in the terminal so
I'm going to pull up control-alt-delete
for my terminal and I'm going to zoom in
a little bit so you guys can see it
pretty well
make it a little bit bigger there we go
all right so the first thing you need to
type in is make directory mkdir tak em
0700
home back slash dot get mail
so it's going to go ahead and tell me
that the file already exists because I
did do this in the past but basically
what you're doing right now is making a
directory for the gmail inbox file which
is called a mbox and then tack em 0700
changes the permissions the seven gives
you read write and execute for the owner
and the zeros give no permissions for
the group or other users next up the
second command you're going to put on
sets up the directory for the mbox file
to store your inbox messages and this is
a really simple one you just mkdir tech
em 0700
and home backslash and this time I'm
typing in gmail archive again it's going
to go ahead and already tell me that the
file already exists but it should tell
you that a new directory has been
created for your use now the third
command this one is also very easy it
creates the dot mbox file in the gmail
backup directory so you're going to type
in touch backslash gmail archive
backslash gmail backup dot mbox hit
enter and it has been created now really
simple thing to keep in mind touch
creates new files very very easily all
you have to type is touch the directory
and whatever you want your file to be
called i love that command it's super
easy now in G edit you want to create a
brand new file and you want to tell it
tell a get mail to get your gmail mail
through this file now since it's
somewhat long i'm just going to go to
the direction airy website this is
called how to ich komm it's a very very
useful website with really easy
instructions to do pretty much anything
I'm just going to copy it straight from
here put that into get mail or GG edit
excuse me
now in this one there's a couple of
different things that you want to change
first off is the username obviously if
you leave it as your name at gmail com
it's not going to get anything from your
personal email because that's an example
so I'm going to taint change this to the
hak5 test account and then change my
password keep in mind this password is
in clear text so this is just a example
password that I'm using for this example
also if you chose to change the
directory when you created the directory
or the name of the inbox file you will
also need to change that there as well
and then you'll just go up here to save
as and up here at the top you're going
to change the name to get mail backslash
get mail are see so this is going to put
the new get mail RC file into your get
mail directory press save and it's going
to tell me it already exists but just
hit save and then close out of there and
you're done with that now the next part
also very simple you're going to go into
your terminal and run get mail to do
that all you have to do is type in get
mail
and it's going to take a few minutes
especially if you have a really really
big in box or a lot of stuff in your
archive just let it continue to run
until it goes back to your regular
command line where it gives you your
name next to your home now once this is
done it should have backed up everything
that you wanted it to so let's go ahead
and look into my directory and make sure
that we have that file let's go in here
gmail archive and there it is gmail
backup dot m box now if I click in here
you're going to see a whole slew of
information if I go down to the bottom
where it shows my newest ones first I'll
see you a couple of public keys ha
interesting and there's another public
key scroll a little bit farther up here
we see one of the emails that i sent
yesterday and just left in my inbox this
is a test hey you this is a test of
labels so you can see that you can also
save labels as well if you want to you
can scroll up a little bit farther and
we can see the first couple of support
emails whenever you create a new email
and gmail so everything gets backed up
that you want to now new mbox files can
be saved for use in thunderbird and
outlook all those different places or
you can also create a shell script with
a timed cron job to enhance your
efficiency and automatically download
all the new emails at you know kind of
timed intervals whenever you want them
to if it does stop before it's finished
with which it probably will if you've
been using your email for several years
and you have tons of stuff installed in
it just restart start with the same get
mail command to run it again and it'll
start off wherever it left off also
gmail labels are supposed to be a part
of the dot mbox download I had trouble
with my labels but that might just
because be because of the new version it
could just be a new bug also archived
messages are downloaded as well that's
no problem you can just hit ctrl f in
your mbox file and find your archive
messages and deleted messages are not
backed up that's kind of a given I also
checked out something in true
staying with his encrypted ones at the
end of his segment where we sent each
other our public keys and you can see
down here his begin message this is his
public key in cipher text obviously it
hasn't been unencrypted to you know
regular plain text and that's due to the
fact that the plug-in that we were using
was specifically just a plug-in it's it
doesn't go into your dot mbox file as
well so keep that in mind if you have
any kind of encrypted information in
your inbox it's not going to be
unencrypted with you know whatever
plug-in you use now I also use
two-factor authentication and in this
case you want to use an app specific
password because your password is saved
in clear text now I hope you enjoyed
that I'm definitely going to back up all
my stuff just to you know have an extra
version of it somewhere kind of helps
coming up soon we're going to have your
questions but first we're going to take
a quick break I am really thankful to
