center goes operational the FCC says
open source router operating systems
aren't dead yet but they're trying email
it's more secure now and the Internet of
Things is even more do me than usual all
that more coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Patrick Norton and this is
threat wire for November 17 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom got to drop
some thanks to everybody that makes the
show possible by contributing to
patreon.com/scishow security officer at
microsoft dropped some interesting news
on the MS blog this morning an entry
titled enterprise security for our
mobile-first cloud-first world sound
boring well actually on top of calling
out the billion plus Microsoft drops
annually on quote security research and
development mr. Arceneaux announced that
Microsoft was launching a new get this
folks I'm quoting here a new cyber
defense operations center this
state-of-the-art facility brings
together Security Response experts from
across the company to help protect
detect and respond to threats in real
time staff with dedicated teams 24-7 the
center is direct access to thousands of
security professionals data analysts
engineers development of program
managers and operations specialists
throughout Microsoft to ensure rapid
response and resolution to security
threats informed by decades of
experience working with the industry to
fight threats on a global scale the
center maintains critical connections
with industry security partners
governments and enterprise customers and
engages Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit
when law enforcement needs arise okay
the voice might be making fun of that
but think about it in terms of actually
dealing with massive security issues on
a global platform the idea of having one
big place to bring the grid of
information together sounds pretty smart
actually Arsenal adds quote it's only by
working closely with our partners and
the security ecosystem and governments
around the world that we can ensure
customers and businesses are able to
trust the technology they use and don't
view security as a barrier to technology
adoption which hopefully amongst other
things means Microsoft's can continue to
roll with bounties for bugs and
repairing flaws rather than lawyerin up
and threatening people and bringing out
ndas when security researchers find flaw
microsoft products the FCC is not
banning open source router operating
systems that's the word on the FCC blog
right there in black and white in a
delightfully titled article clearing the
air on Wi-Fi software updates that post
is by julia snap the chief of the office
of engineering and technology at the FCC
to summarize mr. Knapp says people
wanted to know if we were quote
mandating wholesale blocking of open
source firmware modifications that was
with the FCC rules query that said
manufactured have to explain how its
device is protected from flashing and
the installation of third-party firmware
such as DD wrt which to me sounds like
they're calling out open source
firmwares to be stopped in the future
tldr FCC says no we're just trying to
keep devices RF compliant the longer
answer mr. Knapp says quote we were not
but we agree that the guidance we
provide manufacturers must be crystal
clear to avoid confusion so today we
released a revision to that guidance to
clarify that our instructions were
narrowly focused on modifications that
would take a device out of compliance so
the thing here is whether or not they're
actually exists any hardware that allows
you to implement an open source router
operating system without having access
to the things that could potentially
take the router out of FCC compliance oh
boy the future of router firmware is far
from over people the FCC says it
welcomes quotes continued input from
manufacturers users technologists and
others as they work to finalize the new
rules seriously shout from the rooftops
because our router manufacturers you can
trust you a build secure products and be
updating them over time very very short
list email people it's more secure now
but it still has a way to go especially
with encrypted connections between email
servers ie avoiding snooping so says a
report from the University of Michigan
and the University of Illinois who were
oddly enough partnered with Gmail
authentication by the way pretty good
over ninety-four percent inbound
encrypted email the gmail has gone from
33 to 61 percent eighty percent of gmail
the non gmail recipients is encrypted
and of course all gmail gmail is
encrypted and end two of the big
challenges email security number one
malicious DNS servers which is actually
kind of number two because it's more
obscure but potentially more dangerous
and quotes we found regions of the
internet act
preventing message encryption by
tampering with requests to initiate SSL
connections to mitigate this attack we
are working closely with the partners to
the industry association m3 AWG to
strengthen opportunistic TLS using
technologies that we pioneered with
chrome to protecting websites against
interception end quote from the google
blog in question which is my polite way
of saying they're doing stuff at level
you and I can't go Google and just to
keep us all motivated I got a few
security fails of the week yeah first up
vice coms motherboard reports quotes
until this month if you were one of the
more than 10 million metropcs
subscribers anyone who knew your phone
number could easily get all your
personal information from the company's
website including your home address your
type of plan and even your phone's model
and serial number which compared to the
other information sounds pretty mild but
if you're panicked right now because
you're on metropcs we got a link in the
show notes for you second up dr. and
core OS or tightening container security
whoo that's a win right not a security
fail and the standards are kind of
platform specific and kind of done in
different ways and while both are
incredibly important to these type of
containerized objects being successful
in enterprises or just non hackable
because they're so easy to poke hacked
information into just trust me this is
good thing but the fact of the standards
are platforms specific and not kind of
working together not so good please
please docker core OS bring it together
unite the clans unite the clans finally
if you just need to see if you can get a
good old-fashioned panic attack rolling
from a blog entry checkout Krebs right
up the lingering mess from default in
security which starts with a refresher
on the botnets created when you bik
whatif trout us with the remote
administration twist on by default with
default passwords think 600 or a million
potentially botted routers yo on the
internet and ends with a great question
from whitehat security CTO Jeremiah
Grossman who says quote after the
Internet of Things devices get hacked
and moss and only after billions of
internet-connected devices are deployed
in the wild brace yourself right here's
the question he says quote the question
I'm asking myself today is when that day
comes and it will how can we address the
Internet of Things problem five to ten
years from now with billions of those
insecure devices in circulation
yeah security people tell your kids to
get their degrees in computer security
trust me quick reminder if you want to
get more in depth with any of these
stories and i highly suggest you do
especially that one on the Internet of
Things on Krebs look down below we got
links to all the stories in the show
notes and I got to give a big shout out
to each and every one of you that
supports the show on patreon if you find
value from this and can spare a few
cents in episode please consider
becoming a threat wire patron at
patreon.com / threat wire we may even
feature you're adorable hamster like
this one in our next episode come on
somebody other must have a Gila monster
pic they can send in please even better
than Gila monster photos yeah we'll add
an additional weekly episode when we hit
our next patreon milestone it's how we
keep the show coming completely
independent and ad-free patreon com he
can't donate a like share or subscribe
go a long way too and as always you can
find all our episodes links to our
social networks and other ways to
contribute over at threat wire net with
that I'm Patrick Norton and I'll see you
out on the internets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
