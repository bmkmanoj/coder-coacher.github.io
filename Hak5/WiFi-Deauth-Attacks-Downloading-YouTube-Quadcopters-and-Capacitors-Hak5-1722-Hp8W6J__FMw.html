we're flying quadcopters through
sailboats we're doing some UHF stuff
talking about pineapple 2.2 firmware the
new hack across Europe Metasploit minute
launching epic cool stuff throughout
wire coming YouTube download my own
things and Shannon's got capacitors it's
gonna be epic this episode of hack 5 is
brought to you by domain.com hello
welcome back 5 my name is Gary kitchen
and I'm Shannon Morse and it's your
weekly dose of Technol us where we make
technology misbehave just alluding to
there's this new thing yes there is so
we're doing a new show me and Patrick
Norton
it's called tech thing and you can find
it over at tech thing calm or
youtube.com slash C slash tech thing and
we're promoting it via patreon so if you
haven't heard a patreon that's basically
like Kickstarter for creations and for
creators so you can go over to patreon
comm to find out more about that and
yeah it's basically a a how to slash
review show slash all things tech show
so it's very consumer oriented we're
really really excited about it I'm so
excited to get it off the ground I'm so
proud of you guys you guys are really
killin it you're proud of the show and
I'm Morse and Patrick Norton are
creating tech thing so exciting to see
that we can utilize the AK 5 warehouse
in the space that we've created here and
bring creators in and do awesome stuff
and do it with you guys and your support
just as you've supported us over the
years and all of the numerous ways
through the shop and the you know just
like you know what's nice about the show
is it's completely independent so I can
wear my sealer moon shirts on it yes
he's gonna tell me no AK v dot org is
where you can always find all of the
shows within the family and texting and
tek thing calm for the new thing with
Shannon and Patrick keep those in mind
you'll always be able to find us there
and you know what even mu bik's
who has been doing awesome stuff here
with Metasploit minute has launched his
patreon - very excited if you guys
haven't seen Metasploit minute you have
to check it out
Metasploit minute comm it'll take you to
the landing page with all the goodies
basically we're like you know we're on
the third season now of teaching you
guys Metasploit all the way from like
installing it to now we're doing advance
capture modules he's got some
ridiculously awesome
powershell scripts that steal
credentials now the latest episode so
great we shot a whole nother season and
it was it's I like yeah I've watched it
from the beginning so I haven't used
Metasploit but I know how to use it
because he he really digs deep into it
he maybe that's the thing the idea was
like hey let's make like a little quick
Metasploit tip show right and so it
started out like the the Metasploit
minute turned into 15 minutes so you
know it's like a full-on thing but we
are so proud to have you know tech thing
in this wait a minute all parties are
creating the creative awesomeness it's
so exciting this is it's very exciting
we're just you know what begin and
here's the way that I've always felt
about this is you just put your sails up
and window and then you're there for
when the wind will blow
so speaking of sails boat check this out
so my friend Dan check this video this
is ridiculously awesome I just got to
shoot this this is over the San
Francisco Bay yeah where you fire I was
flying an awesome quadcopter I'll get to
that in just a second but my friend Dan
he teaches sailboating to all these like
high school and college aged kids all
you know teaching them how to like tack
the wind and use kinetic energy and lots
of other really specific things that I
have no idea about but it was you found
that I filmed all of this with with the
new bird so they it has beautiful this
was actually the mom thanks but there's
still a lot of tweaking to do like I
need to flash the firmware on the gimbal
here this is the new zoo Gong the zoo
Gong Pro just came out from immersion RC
you guys should know by now if you've
watched any of my video blogs that I
I mean avid drone quadcopter
aircraft enthusiasts and this is a
really sick bird
it's like emergency gyro thing so it
yeah yeah so what happens is the GoPro
is here and like when the craft tilts
we're left and right
it stays stable that's the idea at least
still a lot to do this is immersion our
C's answer to the TBS discovery which is
the team black sheep if you've ever seen
any of their videos they make their own
crafts which are gorgeous I like this
one just because it will fold up in a
matter of moments and then you know you
can just bend these little tabs here and
twist these metal pieces and you know
like so it just becomes like a totally
origami quadcopter that you can just
toss in your backpack and yeah that led
me to doing some in fact that was it's
made in flight really over water I
didn't wear Wow word but it built it
like the night before all the parts came
in like the night before I've been like
waiting for this quadcopter to come out
for sometime and I'm very excited about
that you know what else I was just
looking up drone boarding something that
I did like a year ago now so the
skateboard thing yeah yeah that's the
idea you fly a skateboarder you fly a
quadcopter oops and mute that there's
music and there's music from pro no bozo
but yeah the idea is that you would fly
a quadcopter in front of you while you
skateboard and then you know see if you
can work the hand-eye coordination
because it's it's kind of ridiculous
when you get down to it so I did this
with I dare you to do that with the
Fatshark one oh ok so like be doing fpv
so you're seeing from its perspective as
well as riding a skateboard through
traffic wonderful through traffic well
the only reason I bring this up is
because it turns out drone boarding is a
thing now I got to give props today GT
GT v2 for doing something similar with a
350 QX I'm just like what dude
so you know in honor of that actually I
used to be a skater I still end to some
extent a lot I have a lot of fun with it
I am I learned how to skateboard in high
school yeah can you get clip I can do
kit click thank you very ollie yeah
that's about it you know we made all I
can do Paul I've got it so since we've
got our awesome hack 5 skateboard and
we've got like another one of our fans
makes skateboard decks we'll talk about
it swings later when it comes in well
we've got a special we've got a very
special skate board coming to the to
make the set all pretty but maybe we
could end the episodes with you on a
skateboard doing an ollie and then you
on moving on Joel gave us awesome books
about getting ourselves our licenses yes
I as much as I don't agree with some of
the policy stuff about the you know
government's giving you permission to
use what is a natural resource that is
light are you gonna get your ham radio
let's have to this thing you have to
yeah most most the goodies in this
require ppm yada yada yada we should
really do a drone show because I don't
know if it's very specific to this
audience but maybe that's something that
we'll do later anyway in order to get
all the cool features I need to be using
a different protocol
I have equipment that will do it it's
the problem is it uses for 33 megahertz
UHF and in order to use that stuff I'll
have legally I have to have a ham god
radio license so I have the incentive
now to get that going because yay we can
get them together so I'm so excited I
will be joining you in season 18 okay
front suite yes I knew I would win also
to everybody that mentioned in that
video with the flying through all of the
different regattas as they are called
the little sailboats there was no wind
that day no one was going anywhere Oh
like seriously it was like totally cool
another like we are like a1 not gun
or whatever that means but I was just I
had everybody's permission and it was
totally safe and totally fun and the
worst that could happen is that the
expensive thing would go in the drink so
you have been doing some other fun stuff
right I am prepared okay it's it's been
a crazy Monday in fact this is kind of
like a catch-up
right now really crazy I've got a really
cool toy software open-source goodness
to show you here in a bit but let's just
rattle right through them okay
hack across Europe just talked to
Sabbath only down I've always done it
solo he's gonna be joining me on the
trip we're gonna start in Butch land and
who knows where we're going but hack
across Europe calm is going to be the
place where you can get involved when
you come out to your hacker space
February oh wait that's so close what am
I gonna do I'm gonna be here all by
myself
okay just run that here just where's the
Hat yeah I'll just wear your Indiana
Jones house there you go yeah so
Shannon's gonna run the company Corral
everybody welcome to the show my name is
Darren kitchen I love drones
I love uh-oh I just broke my finger
again so can you give me your best cross
here up mm-hmm
across Europe today was a big day for
not just launching Metasploit minutes
new season and their patreon campaign
but also the new version of the Wi-Fi
pineapple firmware just came out code
name disassociate ops pops and if you
would like to please let us know who
would win just associate ops versus -
Surya and mobile yes your dinosaurs okay
so actually well because we added an
awesome new part of me Wi-Fi pineapple
firmware check this out so here is if
you're familiar with suited to do log
into my password one two three four yes
I'm duplicate this tab here so we did a
couple of cool things basically we can
now like get these check boxes for all
of the different services instead of
like a bunch of we're really spending a
lot of time cleaning up the interface
making it more user friendly so then
bring up piney
P and if you guys haven't seen we did a
awesome blog post here on Wi-Fi
pineapple calm or pent-up a university
on basically how how pine ap works I'll
give you a little teaser here but
essentially it's made up of a bunch of
different modules including karma that
allow you to do some pretty wicked stuff
and this kind of explains all of the
stuff that we launched at DEFCON as well
as all of the new modules yes cute thank
you I love the old emotion graphic a
goodness great cartoons that's half the
reason I'm doing this you do realize
right I know it's like just so you can
draw things i dude seriously when Anna
stories and pineapples everywhere I was
a web dev and graphic designer before I
was assistant man and then I just kind
of before that it all just comes around
so I like using all of this different
stuff but in anyway point being
now that I have pen ap dogma and beacon
response and Auto harvester just just
turn all the checkboxes on okay so I've
got all that going and if I go over into
recon mode this is really rad oh so I'm
gonna stop that scan and run an AP and
clients can you guys are probably used
to for instance war driving right of
course
we're driving with Nets tumblr or kismet
you know if you are you a war driver
where is my war driver but the idea is
that you just basically doing a site
survey you're seeing all of the access
points in the vicinity and you're
cataloging them and sometimes you
catalog them with their GPS coordinates
so that everybody who I found open
hotspots and we can go over there and
get pre-internet and it was really
awesome in like 2001 but seven I did
something really novel with the
pineapple with the launch of the 2x
firmware and that was adding a totally
new view called recon mode which
basically takes a lot of the similar
similar data to what you would find
using like the aircraft suite and all of
these other tools like kismet
individually to kind of pay
a picture of a Wi-Fi landscape to get an
idea of like oh here's my access points
yeah and hey here's a client I think
because here's a MAC address and
connected to that MAC address and I can
well which MAC address is is so look in
this program well that MAC address is
this ap so basically what we did is if
we look over here we can actually see
the APS as well as their their
associated clients so in fact actually
in this case you want to that are not
associated I'm seeing other clients that
are out of range let me run this scan
for just another moment and see if we
can pick up some clients and here we
have our test client connected to bingo
so not just seeing all of the access
points in the area but we can actually
see these clients we can click on the
access point add it to our Piney AP list
to like say clone it or spit it on our
engagement but we can also click on the
client there and go ahead and do them
and tine ap must be started so let me do
that because I thought that I had done
that but I hadn't click the check box
there we go D off the client and boom oh
cool now it's built in and it's super
easy and it's super awesome and there's
so many cool new things coming and I'm
so excited about that so I just thought
I would show you guys because before it
was like all of these uber long commands
and now it's just click on the thingy
thingy although it's speaking of uber
long commands I think I have just the
thing
I found something particular technology
to tickle your techno
I found something rad when I was editing
the first episode of tech thing and you
guys did a fantastic little wrap-up yeah
CES but there wasn't a lot of b-roll
alright yeah and that is go to the
conference and shoot like a lot of video
of the cool things that you see so that
when you come back and talk about them
we can show you from our eyes and
perspectives of what we saw but
thankfully everybody in this day and age
puts up their product demo video up on
YouTube or and if it's not YouTube its
Vimeo or something else of that nature
and so in editing I remembered this
awesome tool and I can't believe we've
never talked about it before and it kind
of comes
to the fact that a lot of people ask
like hey really love the show wish I
could download it oh yeah you can sudo
apt-get install YouTube
- DL ok for download yes it does
youtube - DL right and there's some
really awesome extractors here list
extractors the ex-ceo re it will pull
videos from all of these different sites
including Ted and and who knows what
sells myspace is that still a thing like
every look at all of these discovery
dailymotion this is a fantastic little
tool so tons and tons and tons cool
including YouTube and so one of the
things that I thought I would show here
is I love for instance you can list the
format's available this is the youtube
link for the latest episode of tech
thing and if you do a list format you
can see that what happens when you
upload a video to YouTube is they rien
code it in all of these different
formats yeah right you get em before and
then be praised and WebM you can see
this one is like 240p you don't want to
watch that one but here we go check this
in ATP
okay we got a 1080 1080 version right
yes yeah or 22 is the best this is an
mp4 22 they say it's the best quality
sounds good to me okay
so what you can do then is instead of
just listing two formats and you can do
a lot of do - - helpful because you'll
find that there's a ton of cool stuff
like you can actually get say the
thumbnails which are super interesting
you can get say the description and as
we know from Linux tools being in bash
with the ability to like pipe things in
and out you can use this in part of a
like shell script that could say for
instance check RSS feeds because you can
get RSS feeds out of YouTube playlist
and then you can pipe those into tools
that will use say this as well as
it was a lot of other stuff too to get
exactly what you want for instance in
this case where I did the list formats
you would say tack F and then I would
give it the number so in this case I
would say I want 22 or I want 137 so you
do 137 ok and there you go and so what
it does here is it's mimicking browsing
to the page with a with a user agent
like hey I'm Chrome hey I'm Firefox and
this is so rad because now we're
actually getting that same mp4 file that
they would have otherwise be streaming
to you right except it's like double you
get yeah you're just sticking it on your
computer instead and more over than that
check this out I'm gonna cancel this one
there's these low versions like this
like 160 here it's an mpeg-4 or an mp4
file that's at 192 P really small but
what's cool about this is I'm gonna do
what is it what did I say it was 190 194
160 so 160 but there's another awesome
one tak tak extract audio oh and what
this is going to do is if you have
ffmpeg installed and set up it will go
ahead and download that and in this case
the very small version run it through
there and give you an mp3 file out of
the end of it they end up with like an
audio version because it's kind of cool
is because there's no other way to get
like a static URL out of all of these
different services but it's rad what can
happen when you just take a little bit
of scripting and you and this is all
open source you can go hit hit up at the
repository and find the code and
week.this and embed it into your own
project and I think it's just kind of
rad and kind of relevant so I like rad
things thanks for sharing that
yeah useful yes okay so with that all
the things up here take a quick break
yeah let's take a quick break but when
we get back you're gonna be capacity'
fiying on i'm gonna be in a Papa cap
capacitive she's gonna pop a cap in this
pot generally we get not really
you're gonna let the magic smoke maybe
last time on domain.com that killer idea
struck and we needed a website and
domain name hosting fast so we head over
to domain calm and using the quick
domain discovery system and they're easy
checkout process we had our website up
and running wait wait in no time and
I've told you guys before how much I
love domain.com because they're
affordable reliable and easy to use but
lowest of all because they're super fun
do business with their active on social
media you can tweet them at domain comm
and see what I'm talking about
they are huge fans of hack 5 and they
want to hook you up so get this you get
a special coupon hak5 so use that a
check out get yourself an extra 15% off
and when you think domain names it is
now time for the trivia question of the
week last week's trivia question was who
is the term voltage derived from and the
answer is the Italian physicist
Alessandro Volta who was born in 1745
and died in 1827 he also invented the
voltaic pile possibly the first chemical
battery so there you go interesting fact
for you this week's question is is the
wavelength of infrared light too long or
too short to be seen by humans
you can answer that at haq5 org slash
trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack 5 goodies good luck
we're back and it's time for more fun
times with things that have to do with
circuitry so this week I decided to take
a look at a capacitor so what exactly is
a capacitor well it's this little two
terminal electrical component for
example you might have one that looks
like so it's very very small usually has
a couple of legs and it's a nice big
cylindrical thing on top or you might
have a little orange one which would
look like this one it's really tiny kind
of hard to see but it just looks like a
little orange dot a little bit more on
those later on and why they are shaped
differently so basically these things
can store energy as opposed to just
limiting it or emitting it like a
resistor or a diode would so it's used
to suppress either voltage spikes or you
can use it for signal filtering or you
can use it for local energy storage now
if we take a look at a schematic I have
a couple of different ones to show you
you'll have different shapes and sizes
of capacitors and these are going to be
shaped differently on a schematic but
basically you're going to have the two
legs coming out of two little metal
frames and both of these little metal
frames are going to be parallel to each
other they're gonna look exactly the
same now in some cases if you have a
polarized capacitor if they look a
little bit different either they'll look
like this or in the u.s. you might have
one that is shaped with a curve on one
side and straight on the other now the
reason why you have those we'll get into
as well a little bit now these are going
to be going to tell you how much energy
they have in the shape of something
called a four rod so it'll tell you how
many four rods or how much charge you
can hold in one of these guys so it'll
tell you how much charge you can store
inside of a capacitor more compassion
s-- equals more capacity to store a
charge so if you have one that is one
fraud that's usually a lot of
capacitance usually you're going to have
a little capacitor like these ones that
are made for you know little circuitry
breadboards Arduinos and stuff like that
that are going to equal something like a
micro farad or a pico farad which is
like ten to the twelfth of a fraud so
very very very minimal charge which is
stored on the inside of them
now how are these made you're gonna take
two little metal plates on two different
size so hence why they look like a
parallel bit on a schematic and on the
inside of this you're gonna have this
dielectric insulation stuff in the
middle and that can be made out of glass
plastic there's a few other different
things that can be made out of which is
going to affect how much charge it's
able to hold but basically you're always
going to have two metal pieces on two
sides which had the legs coming out of
them and then you'll have that
dielectric insulation on the inside the
plates if they are far far away from
each other they have less capacitance if
they are close together so much smaller
they're gonna have higher capacitance
now the reason why it works the way it
does is because there's those super
super fun little electrons that you're
gonna find in lots of things they get
charged so first off you have negative
electrons they get sucked into the
capacitor through one side or one of
those legs they end up getting stuck
onto the metal frame the positives or
the protons they end up getting stuck
onto the other metal frame and these
positive protons and the negative
electrons they're really attracted to
each other and they totally want to go
out on dates and stuff but they end up
in this forever dance cycle because they
can't get past the dielectrics the
insulation in the middle this creates
that storage of energy because they're
constantly trying to get attracted to
each other but they can not ever touch
now eventually the capacitor the
capacitor the capacitor won't be able to
hold anymore of those negative electrons
on one of the plates so it starts
kicking out any others who want to join
kind of like if you show up to a club
and they only allow so many people in
because of a fire hazard the capacitor
is basically going to say no you can't
get in here so it'll kick them all out
now the farads will tell you the max
amount of electrons that the capacitor
can hold so I'm going to show you this
pretty handy little jiff over here to
explain this a little bit better so here
we have a resistor this is a light
emitting diode down here hence the two
little arrows so we already discussed
that this one in the middle is a battery
so if we turn on the battery it charges
up the electron and the capacitor
when we switch this little button over
here the capacitor is going to end up
going through the resistor and lighting
up the LED so it will charge up and then
it won't actually do anything until it
actually goes to the LED it's switched
on it's kind of cool now we can get into
some math so the math would be Q equals
C times V so this means Q which is the
charge currently being stored equals C
which is the capacitance in farad's
times V which is the voltage between its
different plates so the fir'aun's is
usually known you're gonna know that no
matter what like when you buy it you're
gonna know what the fraud is more
voltage equals more charge and vice
versa
so if I have a 1 farad capacitor
capacitor which is quite a bit and you
probably won't get one that's one farad
you'll probably want one that's a lot
less so I have a 1 farad capacitor say
this one is 1 fahrrad just for example
if I have a voltage of 2 volts then I
could store two columns of energy per
two volts because one times two equals
two Faraz
there you go so the amount of current
through the cap depends on the
capacitance and how fast the voltage
Rises or how fast it falls if the
voltage is really really high the
current is going to be really really
high if it's slower rising voltage then
you're gonna get a slower current if the
voltage is unchanging if there's nothing
going through it
the current isn't changing then nothing
happens nothing's gonna happen with your
capacitor it just kind of sits there and
waits forever like a sad puppy that's so
depressing now I don't want to bore you
incredibly to death with calculating the
current through a capacitor or a cap so
we'll skip that until we get into more
in depth builds because you don't really
need to know it at the moment now what
do they look like I have some pictures
of some awesome ones because they look
they come in all sorts of different
shapes and sizes and things keep in mind
there's a lot to remember whenever
you're purchasing one more capacitance
equals a larger cap so you'll probably
find one like this large one over in the
corner if you exceed the max bolt you
can end up popping a cap now
I don't know about you guys but I've
actually seen that happen before it
smokes or it does actually cause fire
and it's a little bit scary especially
if it's on a motherboard it wasn't my
fault it was my mom's fault
now caps will also leak a little bit of
energy over time but it's very very
slowly so if you have one sitting there
trying to collect a charge over a long a
period of time and then you just wait to
press that button to light up the LED if
you wait too long you might not get
anything because it's leaked out usually
they have a 0.01 or less resistance
called the equivalent series resistance
as well so keep that in mind and then
you'll have a tolerance or the
capacitance rating which might be off
from plus or minus 1% all the way up to
it could be as high as 20% now first we
have ceramic capacitors these are those
little orange ones like these down here
so you have a bunch of different shapes
and sizes of these two they're always
small they come with a very very low
capacitance become in sizes less than 10
microfarad keep that in mind and they
are also very very cheap you can buy
tons of them from China for crazy crazy
cheap also you have electrolytic caps
which are the cylindrical ones like any
of these five over on the side they
range from 1 microfarad up to 1 miller
fir ARDS and that's a little bit more
capacitance than the smaller ones but
still pretty small and they store lots
more compassionate in that small size
you also need to remember whenever
you're using one of these that you plug
it in the right way notice how the legs
are different sizes that's because the
anode side must be at a higher voltage
than the cathode but they have short and
long legs which are usually marked with
a plus and minus just to keep you away
from potentially popping it yeh popping
caps that sounds kind of scary they
might also have a lot more problems with
leakage too so keep that in mind too now
super capacitors some that I've seen
online are pretty blue in color they
store huge huge amounts of charge but
they can deal with lots and lots of
voltage these are generally blue but we
won't go into those too much because you
probably won't need those for little
builds like we'll do here now last off I
wanted to mention
multiples so if you have several
different capacitors and a parallel
design so you have one capacitor going
over here you have another capacitor
going here on a board then they will be
the sum of all capacitance all the
capacitors on it so if you have caps in
a series though that's a little bit more
weird so say I have one capacitor here I
have another line of power going to
another capacitor that's what I mean for
a series the total capacitance of the
Cape's in the series is stick with me
here the inverse of their sum of all
inverse capacitances so for the series
of capacitors instead of having them
parallel next to each other I'd actually
have them in a series let's say I have
two and each of these equals ten Ferrar
and their super capacitors then they
would normally equal 20 if they were
parallel but in this case you would
multiply them together so you have ten
for ARDS plus ten for art's or times ten
for art's equals 100 for art's instead
of just 20 so you would take that ten
times ten it equals 100 and you would
divide that by 20 so the sum of their
two parts equals five for arts as
opposed to twenty hopefully that made
sense if it didn't just email me and
I'll just write it out because it's a
little bit easier to explain with
numbers written so now you know it how
to actually put them in a series and put
them parallel to each other as opposed
to just using one but generally for all
of our simple builds that we're gonna
start out with we'll just be using one
or we might use one with another led and
use one over there so you probably won't
have to run into too much of that
mathematical all the mathematical
problems but if you do there's a lot of
information online about how to actually
understand it a little bit better now
you can go build something because you
understand how to use capacitors now
there are plenty to choose from so I
suggest doing a little bit of research
and figuring out what size you need for
your different builds of course you can
always go online and check out that
information as well stay tuned because
we have some more fun stuff right after
the break but first let's take a quick
break shall we
mmm good to the last drop wait you're
drinking huh little Ward's ready action
are you drinking more dress I'm drinking
what Ward I'm slurm what what is
slurring goes in the green mug what is
learn it's didn't happen I'll tell you
when you're older I just thought I would
mentioned that we have more driver mugs
there in the hack shop and that's where
you can support us directly and it is
awesome and cool things are happening
I like those mics did you try these in
the dishwasher yes try them in the
dishwasher good okay good stuff I'm
happy to hear that yeah hey hey oh hey I
made a trade over the weekend right
trade yeah I traded some rack gear got
rid of some old stuff we don't need and
I now have our first bit of equipment
for the rack what's yeah in fact most
everyone recommended this particular
piece of equipment this is a pro curve
by HP it's a 48 point gigabit managed
switch oh I can't wait that's good I
love me some pizza boxes let me tell you
that's probably heavier than a pizza box
even though it's 16 inches as the other
pizza boxes are I just know that because
I used to work at Domino's Pizza 19
inches because it can fit a 16-inch
pizza on the inside thank you this is in
fact what is inside most rackmount
19-inch gear is pizzas that is what
powers the Internet and it's why you
should mentally gel edit a bond no
anyway visit us over at Haq shop.com
check out all the new gear all the food
mugs
you can't beliee good news well family
goodness yeah that we just upgraded on
the firmwares super super fun times and
what else should they take you check out
there they should are they you know just
keep an eye on hak5 org and if you're
subscribed over a revision3 and just
make sure
hak5 0rg that's where you can always
find us and thank you thank you
thank you follow us on the news thank
you to everybody who's been supporting
tech thing we we just released it a few
days ago and we've had overwhelming
support so thank you I'm sorry I'm gonna
see this happen oh yeah it is it's like
I feel like we're turning the page a new
chapter in the days of podcast and
resurgence of the we're in a renaissance
period as it were to be a podcaster I
agree yes going back 10 years to where
mas didn't have color screens and just
when you can gear VR your way through
yes so I'm waiting for the cardboard
okay um
feedback at hak5 dot org let us know
what you think and with all of that i'm
darren kitchen I'm Shannon Morse
trust you techno list yeah
slurm I'd be like mom why didn't you
press record she'd be like I'm sorry
honey
token I'm so so glad I'm paying who shut
up cut off the big yellow school bus
hey Steve over two points new first
thing I am SEO man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
