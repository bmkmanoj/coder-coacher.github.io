the speaking spell as a PDA Wi-Fi level
- excellent good okay do your thing used
in that a heck does that mean use the
net shot ah hak5
help me help us
you're my only hope
welcome to high point five I'm your host
Aaron and I'm Wes and we have a very
power packed episode for you this month
we've actually had a couple of special
guests with us first and foremost is one
of our favorite Canadians Jen cutter
from open alpha TV why don't you come on
out here and join us Jen hey guys
to pretend that I'm at least sort of
close to their height my PowerUp level
up
so Jen's joining us from open alpha TV
if you've been living under a rock for a
while I think we've kind of had a kick
Oh on the whole like vid casting thing
for last couple EPS off in about like
democracy fire ant 592 TV remote
controls what's up so this is one of the
awesome podcasts that we're always
talking about that you should definitely
check out yes and if you want to tell us
a little bit about it sure open alpha is
all about video games but kind of
specialized coverage it's not always
about the latest reviews but we go
really in depth on different topics like
PSPs music games the scummvm and the fun
little stuff that people continue a
little PSP hacking loopies be having
today so anyway now that we've got
covered all that let's jump straight
into Darren tag which covers his
favorite things PHP Apache and a cell
phone that's what's that man you want to
get stuff done let's roll
okay so last time on act point 5 I
showed you how to pipe your independent
media into your TV system all around
using coax an RF modulator
well Darren promised how to show you how
to remote control all of that using a
cell phone and that's what we're doing
right now
so hey Darren hey now you've got this
hack worked out for us
yes as they are turning a internet-ready
cell phone or basically any device if
you've got a PSP or you know Pocket PC
laptops and what I'm making that can
connect to your homeland or to the web
we've got a Linux toaster with a web
browser on your land that could control
your media nice so this is basically a
way to control your home theater PC
which we've done now with fire and
democracy and your modulator hack and
what I want to talk about is ways to
customize my favorite media player VLC
okay course I love VLC because it starts
with a V you know VPNs VPN video CLC and
VNC
yeah okay anyway so what are the
requirements for this particular well
obviously we're gonna need VLC 0.8 X and
we'll also need Apache you can either
used one point three point X build or
the two point X build okay and then
we'll also need PHP hmm okay it's lamp
well except with athletics or you know
PHP and Apache yeah all right it works
they work well together
there's just the great machine it's the
dynamic duo they get stuff done it's my
favorite hacking tools
next scene back station same bad time
yes something like yeah so what we need
to do is once we've got all of those
installed we need to do some
customizations
we need to create a HTML file a PHP file
and then do some customizations okay so
you'll find a little website we're gonna
write a little PHP code a little HTML
yeah what's that gonna be well let's
head over here I've got the this is our
Apache HTTP 4 and I'm gonna go into the
index file
alright and basically all this is is a
starting page which you know you'll
you'll hit the button on your cell phone
it'll take you to this page and it's got
two links my first link will start VLC
on your computer ok and this is this one
right here that's this one right here so
it's gonna open up VLC dot PHP so let's
take a quick look at that
here's VLC PHP really simple all it is
is one command it's the system command
and it will start VLC and then give it a
directory that's where our media is
being stored from fire and democracy
items and that's going to act as like a
playlist I'm assuming exactly you hit
this it'll start playing that playlist
ok next one is this command right here
which will start VLC is built-in web
server VLC has a web server to allow you
to control VLC but we're gonna have to
make some customizations right and of
course the next thing being fullscreen
so I said it's fullscreen so back to our
HTML and so once we've clicked on the
start VLC link right I'll start playing
now we need to control it so that's what
this link is here and the reason for
these two links is because it could be
done in one link with JavaScript but I
want this to work
cross-platform any device my phone
supports JavaScript but mine does not
yeah so this will pretty much run on any
cell phone that
as an HTML browser okay okay so this
will take us to our IP address with the
port 8080 that's VLC's web server so
let's head over here looks like you're
using the dying DNS I'm using designed
DNS address two rather than give the IP
address out on the show we're gonna do
the Don DNS yeah makes things easier
yeah and plus it always redirects your
ISPs IP for you
yeah to you so if your IP address
changes at home on your cable modem DSL
you're checking us will take time DNS
comm suite so let's head over to the
indexed HTML this is over in the VLC so
this feels nice on right and the nifty
thing about this is here in the head
we've got all of these VLC tags and
these are custom to VLC and it will
interpret these when it when it runs
okay so here's the form that says the
the stop the pause previous/next you
know all the buttons to do your stuff
like plus a minute - minute and you've
had to actually customize all these to
work on yeah I've just custom that I've
trimmed down the the file so that it
will look nice on a phone on a PSP on a
iPAQ Pocket PC or whatever just made it
real clean real simple yes also I know
of course that code will be in the show
notes so lets you wanna take a look yeah
yeah you know while we get a demo
obviously you've got the hack working
okay we wouldn't be doing the same so
here's the cell phone I gotta go in and
we're on our start page and I'll just
click on VLC or start VLC okay it takes
just a second yeah cuz we're going out
to the Internet and coming back oh there
goes and it's playing our favorite
vidcast so now I'll click on the remote
button alright remote and here we go
we've got stop pause previous/next -
minute plus a minute so let's go ahead
and just you know we'll click Next
some pure ownage oh look there's Canaan
just mask a ninja that's good stuff
alright and then what else we got here
next again oh there's some command N
so I'm geeked Entertainment Television
okay so basically the idea is you walk
in your house you you know after a long
day of work you like it you know like
for me I have a long day at work and so
if I want to sit down and veg out
definitely I don't you know to some good
content rather than the spoon-fed craft
we find on cable television
yeah really yeah if I just want to bed
you up to the boob tube with some
quality entertainment I can fire it up
on my cell phone when I hit you know hit
the driveway and by the time I walk in
and turn on your TV to the channel 2
channel 2 is now the coursework for free
oh yeah I guess it would be 3 or 4 it's
3 or 4 okay so tune in and then now
you've got your spiffy remote and it's
why spiffier than you than uh I mean we
could use like like that right there
yeah something like this right here the
HEI all in wander remote and you know I
have an all in wonder machine I've got
an all in wonder video card as well yeah
I love getting in remote battles with
you because it's a one flaw I found
about these and we're not gonna get well
I guess we could get remote battles over
this because you could get into yeah so
I guess maybe the next step to this hack
is doing some htaccess stuff but I think
I want to talk about that next month
with uh there's some security through
obscurity it's tune in next month that
sorry
so I'm gonna go ahead and shut this down
there's a little exit button or actually
I want to talk about at the bottom of
this oh yeah this is our actual playlist
right here that shows Odin like a
hypertext if I wanted to go straight to
the pure own edge and the playlist I can
hit that and it would skip to any of the
files in the playlist Auto generates
that so based on the contents of our
media phone yes so great ways to just
get your media with any of those
applications pipe it to your TV and now
control it with this awesome awesome
fantastic so as always all the code will
be in the show notes and one little
change to the segment normally when we
do PHP and Apache and all that fun stuff
we throw on an Easter Egg with either
our IP address or a dine DNS and you
guys had a lot of fun in episode 1
playing with our lights turning on and
off yeah so we're not doing that this
time
not that we don't trust you with our
television but we don't trust you with
our television
do not attempt to adjust your television
set I the most awesome in omnipotent
evil server have taken over this signal
join me on my sinister conquest to take
over hack point 5 once and for all
together my script kiddies we will rule
all of IP TV and turned to the dark side
twitch.tv alright I got the signal back
No thank God you that that's the last
row we have got to do something you know
this is just ridiculous he can't be
stopping the show like this it was bad
enough when he killed Frank but when we
brought him back with nmap and no
regrets we partied we had a good time no
but then what happens when we come back
from Canada damn Ally and evil surfer
and bad signs day that's just outside
it's unnatural minutes it's not right
you know what we need to do something
about this who's got the network all
locked up I can't get through the
firewall this is ridiculous well then
we're just gonna have to go for a
brute-force attack what did you did you
not hear me I can't get through the
firewall it's ridiculous I like I'm a
hardware guy mm-hmm physical brute force
right what do you have in mind this is
what I have
top it all this
this episode we had the opportunity to
talk with Alex latch and Henry Howe of
pods intercom about their new video
search service so Henry thanks for
joining us well can you tell me a little
bit about pod zinger what is it and what
is this new video search service you
just rolled out yes Darrin pod singer is
a podcast search engine much like Google
is you can actually go inside the
content of podcasts and video podcast
and search for the things that people
say within those podcasts so you can go
to our website type you know some word
or some topic that you're looking for
and if even if it's not in the metadata
podcast or e pods Nia will return the
results of the spoken words of podcasts
that have those words in it yeah we
recently launched the video feature
adjust this past Monday March 20th which
allows users to now find you know the
same words within a video podcast but
also get a quick preview and jump to on
our website before they can then choose
to download and subscribe to the video
or audio podcast now I've noticed that
the video flash player on your site
takes little to no time to buffer
content is that being cached on your end
it is we actually are producing a very
small versions to improve the jump to
experience for video and it does
actually get you to the middle of a
video podcast so that you can then
determine whether you want to go
download the entire podcast from the
original site
so DC pod zinger is kind of a research
tool like Technorati or is it more like
a content delivery system like our media
or YouTube I think I see is more like a
Technorati as it's really a search site
you know when people want to go find
podcasts you know in the old days of the
web there were directories but now
people all use search and I think that
will be the way it will be with podcasts
and video podcasts as well so that
people are going to find the podcast
that they want to find they're going to
go search for a specific content and
when they find those they'll add those
to their viewing lists and listening
lists so how many podcasts do you have
in the directory and what kind of sites
do you comb to find these I just checked
before coming up here we have 96
300 and was 90 cents probably over 400
now so almost a hundred thousand video
and audio podcast we have to look in a
bunch of different directories you also
have a registration process where
podcast owners can subscribe with our
site and have all of their feeds put
into our search engine and we do speech
recommend their podcast when they come
out so we hit a lot of the major sites
just just to get our assess feeds and
then the registration has brought us a
large percentage at the one that we have
indexed oh now I know a lot of video
podcast such as ours are released under
a Creative Commons license but some are
like do TV that's under copyright how do
you guys plan to deal with that yeah I
mean I all right number one we post a
copyright policy which says that we will
you know we we are a participant in the
DMCA and if anybody who feels that their
content is inappropriately available
through pausing or they simply notify us
and whether it's their content or
somebody else's it's inappropriate we
pull it down our objective is to make
content owned by copywriters copyright
owners accessible and as Henry pointed
out earlier once it is discovered then
to make it downloadable or subscribable
through either from either directly from
the copyright owners site or through one
of the other means that the owner has
has made it available for subscription
whether that be iTunes Yahoo or any of
the others that might emerge we also as
for those people that only want to make
their content available under more
restricted copyrights we we also have a
part of our business which provides
pausing are on a powered by pausing your
basis so we we have a business
development team that is actively
negotiating these deals so that content
which is as as which is not available
publicly as RSS or it is an RSS format
but it's available only under a
subscription we will do business
development arrangements to provide that
power of by pausing or capability from
their site on their private collection
and that's been very very well received
we're quite excited about that effort as
well
now I noticed the Google Adsense on the
website and that raises the question
about revenue so what I'm wondering is
should we expect to see in the future
things like paid search results or even
commercials before the videos thousand
for a number for us advertising dollars
on radio and broadcast television is on
the order of seventy billion dollars for
advertising so there's a lot of money at
stake here we are looking on the
publicly available pods in your site to
fund that primarily the advertising we
are experimenting now with Google ABS
we're adding our own advertisement text
based advertising capabilities and we're
seeing click-through rates that are
consistent with industry norms there
that obviously we'd like to see
increased we connect users with relevant
information if the ads are relevant to
that search then we'd see more likely to
see click-through we also do think there
is an opportunity over you know over
time to begin to provide relevant audio
and video advertising related to the
search we've just begun to really think
about that in a lot of detail so I would
consider that a future but but but that
is a way that all of us who have content
I mean all of us who provide search and
those of you who provide content can
really start to monetize this because
the selling power that we aggregate with
pod zinger eventually will allow us to
sell on very attractive advertising
rates insert those advertisements and
then share those advertisements with the
content donors so we really are excited
about that over time but right now I
would say we're at the beginning stages
so really the question on everybody's
mind is how does pod zinger plan to take
over the world well we've already
planted large large structures
underneath the ground and we're gonna
hit them with lightning bolts alright
guys thanks so much for taking some time
out to talk to us and anybody at home
that's looking for a video search
service is definitely one to check out
all right Darren thanks a lot we
appreciate your time
thanks Jaron is great to be on hack 25
screwdriver
wire cutters rotary tool Wes it's done
no it's not no Wes its tonics it's not
done it's done it's not done Wes
it's not okay
now we take a break from our regularly
scheduled hacking for some viewer
questions this time with a little bit of
a gaming slant I figured as long as Jen
cutter from open alpha is down I'm gonna
take all these gaming questions that
have been accumulating and have the
master yourself answer them so first
Vincent writes I have a PSP which has a
wireless card built in my only problem
is I cannot for the life of me figure
out how to crop WEP and WPA with it
please help so you get these emails a
lot to array oh yeah yes well I don't
know about you my hat it's white it's
very white the White Mage kind of white
I'm just a little dusty but it could be
white so in that case I have to think
that if this is something you really
really want to do with your PSP then you
might want to build up your skills
yourself and go figure out how to do it
cuz I'm not gonna do a story or
something
okay that's like plus 60 experience for
hacking that so there isn't any likes or
sports projects or anything I'm fresh
meat that he should go get nothing
you're getting for me okay you heard of
you first you're not getting it from
Jenner
so moving on Jeff writes I just got a
PSP and a one gigabyte card I want to
get some videos and put them on it
what's the best and easiest program to
convert them compress them and put them
on my PSP well I'm a big fan of PSP
video 9 that's pretty much the only
thing I use for my PSP movies and I also
use it to convert open alpha into PSP
ready format and they're also the same
people that make the program that I love
the video or ipod converter is that
correct same ones yes and that's what I
use to make the iPod version of this
show and that's a dot mp4 so will that
play on the PSP now will play on all PS
PS now when you have 2.0 firmware or
above you can actually pay more formats
really like what I think you can
actually get it some h.264 support in
there and there's homebrew support for
experts oh it's not mp4 but I'm pretty
sure it's in h.264 file it is but when
you want to get to full screen versus
that yeah well I think it's like 320 by
240 I wonder how that looks on a PSP if
you're watching on PSP that'd be cool
send it by D mm-hmm
and of course Sony also has their
official converter an official
management program for the Sony PSP
which is actually
good but since I only had the 1.5
firmware I can't use it to the full
extent in the video is converted with
that will only work on 2.0 and above now
that's a bummer so your arm to upgrade I
guess Oh clearly no boobs like no that's
my hombre stick with the homebrew
because that stuff is really cool it's
the only reason I'd even get a PSP yeah
I don't use it for games
I watched vids and DivX and oh yeah it's
my podcasting machine yeah can do diffic
sex vid I have a test of that homeroom
player yet but it is on my list awesome
sweet moving on Pedro writes I have a
lock to 200 gigabyte Western Digital
hard drive that unlocked with my xbox
but my motherboard died and I cannot
unlock it and I was wondering if there
was a solution for that maybe some
software that can read the key off the
hard drive or something I have no idea
what this guy's I mean I play on xbox
but I don't
so you a normal Xbox well we're gonna
ask well we modded a Gamecube that's how
this is cool yes nice mod I should have
West's mod the Xbox but it's just so
2002 why oh yeah in terms of video
tutorials it has been done but it's
still a worthwhile project if you want
to do it for yourself especially if you
can't get a 360 grab an old xbox mod it
and have some fun with the older games
if that is your thing so what's this guy
done he's put his 200 gigabyte Western
Digital in into his xbox it has wanted
it so that it will read the bigger Drive
why on earth would you do that well
actually for me the reason I would ma on
an Xbox is not for the games it's for
the media center so if you want like a
cheap very funky little media center PC
you know like XBMC yes I've heard a lot
of people that watch the show through
XBMC you know it's it's a great way
taken back to the XBMC even spun off a
project finger I think is called Media
Portal for the PC it's really nifty I
have to check that out yeah it's
basically XBMC for Windows mmm nifty
stuff very nice but when you have that
hard drive in your Xbox it's lots of
that Xbox can you try to convince it
that oh this this is really the Xbox
Drive that came with it really no foolin
it's just bigger ok when you want to
move it out of that when you want to
take it back to your PC or if your xbox
dies like in this case you won't put it
in another Xbox you have to get that key
back or it's a dead drop so every Drive
is like sign me identify ah I see so
that's why you need a program you make
the one we have list
here like obviously Xbox scene is a
great place to go for any kind of Xbox
modding tips tricks guides whatever you
need okay and they've got a tutorial a
kind of a general-purpose unlocking hack
and then there was also another one that
you found that's specific to Western
Digital z' uh it should be specific to
Western Digital there's a whole lot of
steps here we're gonna have a nice
overlay with where to get it how to read
it but it's just about using the master
password to unlock it so that you can
then do whatever you guys I love this
master password it's WDC WDC etc etc
except I'm right on red all right yes
good stuff alright so that pretty much
wraps up questions of course if you want
to email us questions we can always take
those on the air that would be questions
at hak5 org and coming up Wes and
special guest Rob fuller are gonna show
us an awesome little programs for a
thumb drives very nice everyone's got a
thumb drive kicking around let's put it
to use sweet check it out
okay so joining us here today is
Munich's otherwise known as rob some of
you might be very familiar with him he's
here on the show and he's come to show
us a nice little special collection of
programs that you can carry on your USB
thumb drive very very useful very
portable so nice to have you on the show
but good pleasure let's get to it what
what are these programs like what's
their special about these programs okay
well I got a lot of them and will
probably be including them in the show
notes okay but there's four good ones
that I want to point out and I like more
than the others all right um those are
the first one is HFS web server
HFS web server stands for HTTP file
server web server file server web server
gee and you can use not Unix backwards
but um so this little cool little
program what it does is single
executable lightweight and all you have
to do is double click it and you got a
web server and what this web server does
is you drop drag and drop files onto it
and it serves it out to whoever on that
web server has a site nice little web
interface for whoever goes to it ok so
like you to whomever has access to this
particular file server that you've
given right it's it's FTP access for
them you can write well it's faster than
FTP because you can actually use W get
or other other tools on it mhm and open
up like ten connections to it and really
good yeah you can open as many
connections as a web server and use like
W get or like apt-get or something right
if you're running a Linux download
manager that's awesome yeah it's really
cool
and once and this fact that it's a
standalone executable will allow even
like limited users access to the program
you know like they can run the program
themselves without having administrative
privileges right so if I'm a sysadmin
then I go out to a remote site mm-hmm I
don't have to know that that is C is
that that sysadmin administrator
password to get whatever file I need off
the this local guys hard drive hitter
okay and I just send it back it's really
cool okay so next on the list next on
list is space marker I've actually been
using this for a long time
it initially came out on PC world a
little seedy okay long as I get like a
shareware a freeware type deal right and
what it does is visually graphically
shows you your hard drive or whatever
drive you decide to pull up on it okay
and little little colors pastels but you
have a six gig file somewhere that you
don't have no idea where it is but or
whatever size file it's taking up your C
Drive and you partition it normally so
yeah but it's taking up all that space
right okay so you don't know where it is
you fire up space mugger it searches the
whole hard drive real quick and tells
you graphically how much this file is
that size that files this size and you
can delete it from it you're not
directly so you actually have file like
write privileges well like as far as the
leader right whatever front with in file
Mon correct very space mongers a
smuggler so next we got lock note a lock
knock notes you've all heard of notepad
right of course you're not Rachel right
my HTML
everybody has no pet yeah well lock
notes say you have things you want to
store like your keys for your Wi-Fi you
know those 128 bits for a web that you
use not supposed to
and you know these keys and you you
don't want to remember this whole thing
so you put it in notepad you save it you
drop it in the lock note put a password
on it encrypts it okay so it's portable
encryption right and you just store you
don't have to store any program with it
it goes into lock note as an exe and you
double click it put in your password and
you got all your stuff Oh neat so you
don't have to carry lot note itself with
you you just have to have your password
from lock note like whatever password
you set for that file right and that
file and that's it and it's a pretty
pretty secure encryption Tobia hello Lee
and next now many of you might know
about tor Park tour Park is portable
they are a portable Firefox I'm sorry ok
portal Firefox is a tool that was used
on a lot of USB drives when Firefox
started out and what this designer did
I'm not sure of the name but put tor
which is the Onion Router we'll be
talking about later and and smacked it
into their park ok yeah Deer Park and
came out with tor park ok just all you
do is a slap tour park on your USB Drive
double-click it and you're instantly on
the Onion Router so you just you got
Firefox doing around and that's it
so you're surfing in Firefox and it's
instant anonymity right there you go
awesome awesome that is so cool and you
said you're gonna have an extended
listing of a very amended suite
everything on a one gig hard drive or
USB stick that I have thank you so much
Rob that's really cool and like we said
anywhere you know at any time once you
get done watching this or whatever yeah
excuse me listing of all of all of these
programs and a lot of other ones for
your USB thumb drive in the show notes
thanks a lot
enjoy the rest of the show
sir are you the script Kitty mercenaries
from the Holy Roman Empire and do you
Yahoo what language is that new finding
Z does computer she Kazakh
you heard it here first people doesn't a
stance - ok so Jen cutters down we've
been playing a lot lode of video games
more specifically a lot of DDR this is a
DDR pad for the Xbox it works all fine
and dandy but for me it sucks I need
something bigger and harder because that
bunch is under my feet and I step heavy
and plus I got big feet and I hit like
500 freaking buttons at once
now solution I could go buy a red octane
pad for 200 freakin dollars us not gonna
happen I make my own shit so that's what
I did I went out and I made my own hard
DDR pad for just under 50 bucks and
here's how I did it materials for this
project include an old cheap crappy DDR
pad not a necessity
you can hack a controller to do the same
thing see episode 4 on how to hack a
controller 36 by 36 plywood or MDF a
half-inch would be best 36 by 36 plexi
or acrylic and it needs to be an eighth
of an inch thick 36 by 36 custom printed
pad graphic whatever you want just make
sure that the graphics on the pad line
up to how your buttons are gonna be on
your pad screws aluminum foil and wire I
personally prefer cat 5 tools soldering
iron solder drill duct tape and save the
foam padding from the mat if you used
one
here's your process first gut the old
crappy DDR pad you're gonna need the the
computer board the board and the brains
and the plastic thing up top and the
foam from inside everything else throw
away just make sure you kept track of
which way the traces go for the buttons
now the reason you paid attention to the
traces on the pad on the inside is that
we're going to be soldering wires to the
connection points on the board and
running wires from there to the buttons
so after you get all your soldering done
lay your grounding foil on your plywood
itself and tape it down duct tapes the
greatest thing ever invented
and now position your buttons around on
the pad as you see fit where they're
gonna work out best for you
so and the button needs to be ground
file on the bottom then a layer of foam
with holes in it it's got to have the
holes so that when you lay the foam on
top and step on it it'll actually make a
connection then connect the wire to the
top foil and that doesn't have to be
anything fancy you can just twist it up
in there and it'll work just great tape
it all down and make a nice big
duct-tape sandwich lather rinse and
repeat for every button until you're
done
simple as that once all your buttons are
laid out all taped down and look halfway
decent lay your graphic on top put the
plexi on top of that screw it down
very carefully drill pilot holes before
you put a screw in it or else you run a
very very high risk of splitting the
plexi with the screw play that's all you
have to do that's all there is to it
plug it in have a ball if something
doesn't work right take it apart wiggle
it a little bit done lessons learned now
when you're doing mods you know
everything that you see me do is
normally Rev 1 it's the first time I did
it and it pretty much works out I have
to work out the kinks before you see it
but you know take your time and have a
lot of fun with it you know it doesn't
have to be perfect I did mine 36 by 36
because I'm 6 foot 1 I have a long leg
span but make it fit your size and you
know if you decide to do it please email
us at send us pictures show us what you
did and how you made it better that
would be great Wes at hack 5 org info at
hat 5 any of us email us let us know
wiring diagrams plans pictures and our
personal graphic will be posted in the

that you have your own custom DDR pad
you think you're gonna bring your free
skill level a little bit
I will never attain the skill level
varies gen Oh time to fun no so what we
gonna do that up again oh yes definitely
and maybe when I'm in Canada next I can
make one for you
I'd love that some nice couples Matt's
awesome be so good-looking
so now anyway mm-hmm we are here for
trivia zoo so we have last month's
question here which was a bit of a long
one it was if you add the RFC number for
mschap version one and the RFC number
for mschap version two then subtract the
RF I don't know if you can stop right
there because our new tastic my fellow
co-star Darren just loves to come up
with these freaking ridiculous questions
that make no freakin sense you would
anyway long story short answer the
answer was correctly answered first by
Brian who wrote 0 X 0 C 7e blah blah
blah blah hex letters and numbers I
don't need them all right maybe they
write this mind but it's definitely it's
a little bit simpler you just gotta pay
attention and do some proper googling
yeah good googling anyways mine and this
mont strip your question what nonprofit
corporation is responsible for operating
the dot c-- a country code top-level
domain and how many years do elected
directors serve on this corporation's
board so nice a super question in
question in there did it just for you
of course anyway as always is the right
correct answer email it do trivia and
hak5 and pause it now I'm just kidding
watch if you want anyway so up next
let's see here we just did the mod with
you better and you helped me with that
we just did trivia or excuse me
questions and you just helped me with
that
now we're going into the PSP hack PSP
hacking with Windows and Linux know
kinds of fun stuff that beer together on
yes anyway it's the gin and West Show
enjoy okay so Jen cutters with me here
from open alpha TV thank you so much
John for being here my pleasure
and you have a little PSP hack for us I
do and that would be that would be
Windows 95 or 98 on the PSP Windows
Windows 95 or 98 I know if you still
have your CDs you can totally do this
nice okay so uh first of all just a
service purpose I mean having windows no
whatsoever this is one of those things
you do because you can oh yes yes the
best kind of thing the geek motto by far
and so now since we're on a PSP is this
actually running like Windows 95 ah well
see this is why we have tux on set
because this is running emulated through
box links so I'm going to show you how
to set up an image of Windows to move
over to the PSP oh sweet
using box Linux music box Linux so
obviously that would be in the list of
things we need you need a PC you also
need yeah USB PSP cable because you got
to get it across and you need a memory
stick Pro duo but it has to be more than
150 Meg's
because the minimum installation from
Windows 95 is 150 Meg's you'll need more
space from windows 98 and if you want
any hope of using your PSP for other
stuff you need the bigger stick I've got
the one gig SanDisk stick this isn't it
this is the value pack one in my PSP
right now and then to me is the best one
okay so that's basically it except that
your PSP also has to be a 1.5 if you got
the 2.0 you can downgrade but anything
past that in your stock it has to be 1
through 5 you need the kernel access ok
so now that we know what we have and
what we're doing mm-hmm how do we do it
well we gotta go into Windows and all
the downloads for all the files are in
the show notes ok because there's a lot
of stuff that you need and I have to
give mad props to Matt from hacker code
il because he was one of the first guys
to get Windows running on the PSP and
singer wolf who's actually gonna be
hosting most of the files he's on his
account and
and also configuration files if you
don't want to configure things yourself
you can get the pre-made files and get
her done get her done because it is a
very long install so you might want to
actually have like a book or a video
game to play in the meanwhile working on
your PSP you might want to play your ps2
yeah basically so the first thing you
have to do to set up your image and
after you've downloaded all the files
you need you go into the box folder and
open VX image so we want to make a hard
drive enter now this is the part where
we're gonna make it 150 Meg's
becomes minimum installation size now
this is where you get stuff you gotta
start paying attention to mm-hmm you see
how it says 304 16 and sectors per track
of 63 write that down you will need it
three to four more times during
installation or that because even though
we have the pre-made installation files
mm-hmm you don't have to do the bare
minimum 150 if you wanted to make it you
know half gig installation will take
forever but you can do it so you got to
pay attention and write that stuff down
okay
now I'm not gonna remake it because I
already have my stuff already set up but
one of the things that's gonna happen in
a couple of steps from here is this
gonna say like one of the steps is to
format see it's very important you're
not wrecking your hard drive you are
gonna be formatting your image so you're
gonna be formatting your 150 Meg image
that you've created okay not your hard
drive it's okay go do it a lot of people
stop at that step no I'm gonna borrow my
hard drive I don't want to set up a new
computer to make this installation
virtual C Drive yes exactly gotcha so if
you follow the steps it will the
installation does take a couple of hours
cuz you're running it emulated on
whatever kind of PC you have at home and
you're gonna move it all over to the PSP
and then boot it on that and it's gonna
take another 10 to 20 minutes depending
on the version of Windows you're running
95 or 98 yes and that's pretty much it
so if you follow the steps it's all very
detailed in the show notes ok see it and
you're good to go and you can impress
your friends with the windows that
doesn't that much but I did it exactly
if you really want to play minesweeper
on your PSP just get the Lua player
because it comes included on that but
it's not as cool as playing it in
Windows exactly that is cool this is the
ultimate because you can think yeah
absolutely
we noticed through Linux on the PSP what
more can you want exactly so like we
said on the show notes detailed
step-by-step and links to all the files
that we'll need yep so
thanks a lot and enjoy the rest
right
guys do an awesome work I mean huge fans
please on the huge fan at me to bail it
I'll pack you here okay now I'm just
about wrap up this episode of hack point
fine thank you for watching this far now
we do have a lot of things to cover here
at the end first and foremost as always
our contact information that starting
off at the IRC Channel
yes IRC tech file dot C a pound AK 5
email obviously wesat hack 5 org during
a hike 5 org we've got a lead hack 5 org
and Gen with two ends I'd be all right
forearms are farmers I've finally back
ok so last episode we were talking about
the fact that our forms went AWOL
because our we had a web host tried to
distribute the load and the other web
host died and they got a sucked they
just tell you the truth they were really
bad I'm very lucky right now and very
well we can talk about your situation
that little mishap I've got a million
terabytes
um a little big cast jealousy going on
here
and so our forms our forms are back up
we had to start them over at a certain
point so if user your user account may
be there it may not be there but
definitely when you joined yeah sorry
but there a lot of fun stuff going on
there back I'm here now and I'm still
checking for fallen sweet and then of
course the hotline yeah number being 206
3 3 8 hack 5 right there so we're gonna
do a little special announcements this
episode there's there's a couple of
things that we need to talk about about
the future of hack 5 about where we go
on what we're doing and just kind of
clue you guys in on our overall plan
first and foremost we talked about web
hosting and a web hosts that in
particular sucks and I let everybody
know last month and it got a ton of
emails from people saying hey guys go
with dreamhost kind of fighting about
that because we used remo we've been
using I've been on doing those for over
a year now and I
love them to death they are awesome they
got this awesome like goodies thing and
one click install installs WordPress and
one click and our and PHP VV one click
and the polls so they were able to help
hack five get on the air really quick
and hack five that orgs hosted by them I
know you've got some more website got a
bunch of websites hosted by them as well
and you know I've also gotten a lot of
emails about people saying hey how can
we support the show and if you're
looking for web hosting and you decide
that dream host is a good option for you
mean they got like some crazy plans like
10 bucks for like 20 gigabytes of
storage and about a transfer yeah and
that's kind of important for us and
we'll get to that real soon why you need
that so this isn't a sponsor or anything
but I have looked into and we do have
kind of like a referral program thing
going on so if you're in the market for
some web hosting and dreamhost looks
like the right option for you using the
coupon code hak5 because there's no
whole point in hack point 5 no there's
no point in hack 5 there's a point a
hack point 5 editor anyway the coupon
code is hak5 and and if you use that at
checkout you'll get $25 off your
purchase and we get a kickback and that
helps us pay for bandwidth which is kind
of important when you're doing a vidcast
yes now Jen knows about the next one and
she might want to talk about that and
that's the heck of a LAN party
that's something I've wanted to I know
this time we are all gamers and we are
like Warcraft great game Guitar Hero
great game but there are other games
they're games that you need a server for
like say counter-strike sauce and shield
a counter-strike I don't know I think
might be able to take me I will find out
later find out we'd like to find out but
we need a game server dude
Wes and I have just been waiting to to
school some noobs or I'm sorry
we've been waiting to get schooled yes
and so with our be fun to do a hack 5
LAN party and I'd like to make it kind
of like a regular thing you know every
month you know release getting a for me
it's all about the UT 2k for I'm a big
fan I'm a big fan of the counter-strike
I'm definitely leaning towards
counter-strike sorry for the wind yes
by the way after eww baby and there's
always quake 3 which is just is a staple
it's it's a bread and butter warm rod on
my box quick for if we ever make some
money then maybe we can get some boxes
to actually play that's nice but that's
so anyway well I'm talking about yeah so
we're talking some sponsors and
hopefully we'll find somebody that'll
help us get a game server because those
things don't grow on trees but we'd love
to do that so if you are a game hosting
company or know of some really cool cool
ones kick us an email we'd love to hear
some feedback and also feedback on what
games you're interested in playing we'll
throw a poll up on the website and also
sound off in forums or kick us some
email because we want to get some frags
on it's been like nine months since
we've played a video game these four
keys that I used to move again W a s d
dot TV another great vidcast um the DVD
wouldn't talk about that the DVD yes
we've decided to kind of make a
compilation of the best of hack point
five or were in the process of working
on it actually and we want to release it
as a free DVD under the creative
comments license for all of you to
download via BitTorrent as the ISO and
burn it as many times as you want
download it as many times as you want
you can download it once and burn
multiple oh but if you want to download
it multiple times and seed it over
multiple boxin that'd be awesome
yes anyway don't let it distribute it
you know tell us so what you think if
you think it's a good idea or not and
that's pretty much it yeah the ideas
will even offer like the cover art and
stuff so it's kind of like a free thing
well we've got the idea of doing like a
season one paid thing like later on you
know recoup some of this cost and and
also tons of extra features on both
these a lot of behind the scenes
extended bloopers oh that's gonna be fun
you were never meant to see that's the
truth
in fact I gotta get her to sign the
release for that one but the idea is
that you can burn this and can to tell
your friends and you know let them check
out it's kind of grassroots and I think
it's gonna be a lot of fun I think I
send off in the forms on that into some
email we look forward to hearing your
feedback about that so we'd like to
thank all of our guests Jen
