okay so Darren got one of those Tripoli
pcs is little fisher-price overgrown
versions of one of these things and he
drugged me out here on set and he's like
oh look look I have a trippity pc and i
have a wireless access point what am I
doing here you're your Watson for me
because I can't do a segment alone the
truth be told i'm going to show how to
use the epc or basically any computer
that you may have but with backtrack
three and aircrack-ng to crack wpa so
what does that wired protected access
something like that Wi-Fi Protected
access yeah yes as opposed to WP WEP
which is wireless encryption wired
equivalency privacy oh is that what it
is it was like wireless thing or doesn't
know Tim O'Leary some crapola yeah
everything's a protocol so anyway okay
so we've got we've got the fisher-price
toy yes we've got a wireless access
point there we go or our access yes not
our in hours not not your neighbors this
is this is all about auditing yeah we
only want to make sure that our
passwords are secure but this is the
age-old story the we're going to show
you how insecure your crap can be if you
don't use a decent password yeah
basically try you know it's something
you always have to worry about
insecurity okay so let's get down to the
nuts and bolts so we've got the tripoli
pc which on a quick side note has an
actress and a rose whatever yeah an
atheros Wi-Fi card which is pretty cool
because with backtrack three beta deck
yeah backtrack three latest version has
bad Wi-Fi drivers for the atheros chip
in here so that it can go into what's
called monitor mode and monitor mode
being different than promiscuous mode
because monitor mode then allows us to
just listen to any kind of Wi-Fi traffic
around us as opposed to exact needing
some kind of network association exactly
yeah so you know anyone so we're just
seeing what's in the air right okay so
let's get down to the nuts and bolts so
you've got backtrack three running right
now and so what's our first step well
the first thing we need
understand is a little bit of how this
works and I'm not going to go into great
detail about all of the intricacies of
you know the the encryption scheme and
stuff like that but i will link in the
show notes if this does interest you
there's some amazing reading
exceptionally from a Seth fogey you
believe has an awesome article a link to
that explains some of the more details
about this but what you need to
understand is that this is only going to
be for cracking wpa networks with PS k
which is pre-shared keys exactly so as
opposed to some of the more intricate
authentication methods that you would
find like radius in enterprise
environments PS k is what you would find
in most home and small offices right I'd
like your place exactly and the only
vector of attack here is really to brute
force the handshake more specifically a
dictionary attack yes well see the thing
is the handshake is the four-way
handshake occurs when a a client
connects to the access point and what
we're going to be doing is trying to
listen for one of those and once we have
one of those we're going to run it past
a dictionary attack like you've said
we're not going to try to brute-force
this because I mean honestly the
pre-shared key is from eight characters
263 characters which would take which
can take literally hundreds of years for
the maximum key length uh because with
each you figure if you've got a if you
could crack 3 million to 6 million you
could try three million 26 million keys
per day it's still for any character
password that's 200 million two hundred
million i think tours it 200 million
possibilities i think for a foreign aid
character password so that's cool ascii
yeah so um so anyway anyway so we've
rambled enough let's let's let's get
into the nuts and bolts up so i'm
assuming we have to do a little bit of a
numeration just know what we're dealing
with so first thing let's do is find out
about our target so for that we're going
to run kismet so fire up kismet here
mm-hmm and let's go ahead and sort this
and there's our network hak5 so open
that up and i'm going to need a couple
of key pieces of information first off
verify its wpa-psk if it's not psk
you're just this futile find somebody
else or
I mean yeah okay so the other I mean is
our bssid that's basically the mac
address of the wireless network right we
want to write all this stuff down I got
over here my little notepad because it's
awesome and we also need to know what
channel it's on its channel 11 okay so
we've got its bssid we've got the
channel let's go ahead and start our
wireless card in monitor mode so for
that we want to use airmon-ng and stop a
th 0 a th 0 being the device for so
we're basically stopping normal wireless
usage right now now we start it with
Wi-Fi 0 which is our mad Wi-Fi drivers
on channel 11 and now we've put it into
my monitor mode using the mad Wi-Fi
drivers yes so next thing you need to do
is start up arrow dump okay so I've got
the command here let's just go ahead and
dissect this arrow dump dash ng with
dash C 4 11 so we're looking just at all
11 dash dash bssid and this is the bssid
of our hack point 5 wireless access
point so we got from kismet now the dash
W parameter here tells it to save the
file we're saving them as psk files and
it was going to make a PS k dash 1 cap
psh to cap etc etc and we're using the
h0 device okay so we've got that going
on we can see our bssid here we can see
the beacons we can see how much data is
going through the encryption type etc
etc also down here are listed the
clients that are connected to it we see
this one right here the very first one
is using quite a bit of well we've got
some packets so yeah at least we know
that we've got at least somebody's
actively using the wireless network so
now to get the handshake since we
already have two clients on the network
to get the handshake there are two
methods for grabbing it one is passively
just meaning waiting let's sit here and
wait for someone to connect but let's
always made it up because there's
already six minutes into the segment's d
off someone right right now d off this
all we're going to do is pass the client
some packets kind of just over the what
wireless network even though we're not
connected to it yeah but c'mon as them
these d off packets saying you're not
allowed to be on here you're not
to be on here you're not allowed to be
literally you're not allowed but you
know your authorization ard exactly and
and most operating systems will be like
Oh what okay reconnect let me pass you
the key again to tell you I'm allowed to
be here so let's just take a look at
this command for that airplay ng 0 for
the dr dash 15 is how many d off packets
were going to send okay we could also
change this 15 20 and then that would
just send infinite d off packets but
that would be malicious is no fun so
here's the bssid of our access point and
dash C is the bssid of our client here
that we found from this step and we can
see is still using tons of packets so
he's active and then a th 0 now there
they go and if we look over here now
they're being deal here it is and are
already they got the handshake in the
top right here you can see wpa handshake
it found one because we d off that
computer right and now don't get
confused when you see the handshake
because that's the handshake that's
being done on the access point so that's
not the mac address of the client that
you get a mac address of or the SSID of
the access point now finally we run
aircrack-ng with the dash W and our
dictionary file we just have a file here
d ICT it's a 40 megabyte word list and
I'll have links to get some word lists
this isn't a huge word list it has
several languages common words common
passwords use X got love and I'm just
kidding I can't remember the other ones
I feel so dumb now the only three I can
ever remember so now that's all I'm
thinking about so that you could use a
much bigger dictionary file yeah of
course whatever that are simply tote
around with you so aircrack-ng WR
dictionary file dash be for the bssid of
the access point that we're trying to
crack and then psk start cap we press
ENTER and here comes the fun part
because you can write range right here
it's just looking through all these
right here yeah all these words and
hopefully it where it is key found star
wars which is a horrible horrible
password yes because it's in the
dictionary anything that's in the
dictionary is a bad thing there we go
okay so you're going to have shown
much for everything sure will okay Oh
quick little side note the true reason
this is out here yes this is under DS
and Nintendo DS is you've got a spiffy
little thing on here on your DX s RDX
extreme mud ship anyway I've got a
modchip for you nintendo DS and you can
run homebrew there's an awesome NBS file
that will allow you to do the office yes
if you just want to be a jackass no no
it's not for just being a jackass it's
because you know you can do this you can
run aircrack-ng in Windows but say like
you don't have a nice card that can go
into monitor mode so you like you have a
card that won't allow you to send d off
packets this is just a little side this
is just your side tool yeah and and
basically this air plate nintendo DS
homebrew app will allow you to choose
the access point and send however many d
off packets you want keep in mind that
the range is important when you're
sending these d offs it really matters
like what your proximity is to the other
clients just because the access point
can see them you need to be close enough
so that the clients getting the d off
back exactly okay so this only has a
wireless card wireless radio capable of
sending I believe 2 megabits per second
it's not very powerful so you basically
need to be sitting right beside the
person it's a fun toy but yeah they are
better okay our trips and d off your
wireless it's like I'm plugging your
network card by accident yes okay so
show notes show notes on the wiki and of
course more articles in there that you
can read that I'll explain right much
more about link title sort information
and stuff like that said hopefully that
will change your mind just so slightly
about the about the little hack top no
because when i actually get a working
dual boot of OS 10 in yeah linux 17-inch
not going to be a 15 it's a 15 2 pounds
yeah I don't camp it you know I can do
whatever I okay you know what I like my
all right and on my OpenGL reseller
rainy ring yes oft where direct x 7 for
the win yeah anyway where are you pues
hey Chris let's like tell the viewers
about the frets on fire they probably
remember from the last episode of hak5
live you came and you showed us how you
rocking out with frets on fire on the
epc was that fun yes not too much frames
per second but was a lot of fun yes it
was a lot of fun so at the end of that
segment were like oh this so cool you
can make your own songs and that's
exactly what you did right I took the
heck five theme and took a chunk out of
it and basically just made a short
little song and threats on fire yeah so
so for those that aren't familiar with
frets on fire what's the back of the
boat version it okay frets on fire is
like guitar hero for the PC open source
you know you can run it on I think it
runs on linux mac OS x the website is
frets on fire on sourceforge net and
they link to all the community stuff and
everything cool so it's basically guitar
hero pc so while woody used to control
it normally a lot of people use their
keyboard but you actually can use so you
could get like a like a model m keyboard
and actually like now probably but uh
you actually can use your guitar here
because it has the microsoft the pecs
the xbox accessories drivers okay
support so need for your USB Xbox guitar
not so much for your ps2 or ps3 or do
you need just one of those adapter
things I think you can use it with
adapter sweet and and for the Xbox Live
one xbox one I guess you're going to
need some drivers yeah so it's the same
drivers you use three controllers and
saw the microsoft site here you thought
you don't use the XP CD drivers those
won't work with this okay I found that
out the hard way so and basically what I
did was I went on and there's a good
really good tutorial on these forums ok
said sacrifice on fire done that does he
fancy s tutorials here yeah this Fred
sapphire dinette and keyboards on fire
at nap they're basically the same kind
of thing and there's tutorials on both
on how to do this so okay so how did we
take the hak5 lot not that I thought
that hike hak5 theme that season one
hak5 theme we all know and love and turn
that in some new rock with with audacity
I'll
yes here's all that city and this is
what it looked like after I got done
editing it I took took a what does it
look like about 25 30 seconds out of it
and and what you do is you are going to
file see your mp3 intensity you choose
your bit and then we just we chose a bit
here because we're going to keep it
short okay and then you can export it as
what you do for this for free to our
editor this awkwardness is what you need
the form another open source codec I
like it so after you export it as that
and you I put it into here and there's a
bunch of other ones that we were using
and here's the freeter editor ok so
we've exported is all then we can just
import that into the free tar editor all
right sofrito editor was that allowed to
do this allows you to insert your notes
this is the fun part this is where you
get to actually you know put the right
notes for the right chords and
everything in there typically if you can
do this with other songs you would want
the guitar tab you can there's places
you can find that online and you would
you know compare it all up and sure yeah
your put your notes in so you take your
OGG your art file and you go to in the
free tour editor you create a new song
and then you just select your all ours
was think do we have to have the project
open i actually have it up right now
let's see the notes so here's the i'm
gonna mute this for a second so okay i
see it going over so so there's a little
bit of in each row before i start the
notes and then I think right around here
what is this track 0 1 2 3 4 are those
needing these the buttons ok oh I see
green when you add yellow blue and since
this since I already imported the song
in friends on fire I can even show you
how it works right now like I do 12 or I
can even do it this way okay so you just
press the numbers here on the keyboard
when you hear the notes because this is
playing back we just had a muted or you
can go into the configure controller do
it this way go back alright when you
play it ok I mute it so actually have to
turn it yeah I want me to
all right and then a press button record
so if I wanted to add more notes Oh a
little loud yeah that's cool so if I
want to press more buttons that are
already there i can I can you know I
think I have to oh I can't pan press
button to record press from record I
think I already have it mapped to the
keys okay so I had remapped but it's
when the offices so if you really you
say that this up yeah if you know the
song and you can go into the editor and
actually play it like you're doing it
and it so it's actually easier than
doing the Aastra five okay so so now
that we've done it so we've we've
converted our mp3 to an arm we brought
into free tar so and free tar wow how do
we get that entail you're going to save
in fire and yes it saves it as a dot sng
you can put it wherever you want to save
it to it doesn't really matter right now
um and then you can just minimize that
and you take and actually take that song
file mm-hmm that sng that we just made
and you have to go back out of the
internet and on in the inlet tutorial it
links you and we'll have this link in
the show notes as well this is a it's
nucular CH / fof tools and this is a
basically online converter to convert
the song file into the actual frets on
fire mid format yeah okay so that's all
does you you click allow the site again
my no script gotcha you have to you
click here oops and depending on what
difficulty you want it to be so when you
create it you know you can make easy
hard and then this will actually make it
the right it'll put the right tags on it
so then when Fred set fire opens it
knows where to put it I see so you just
browse find your song file and put it in
there convert it and then it lets you
just download a mi d file yep that's
like midi i'm not sure if it's quite
midi per se but it's a dot m ID ok yeah
it says midi sequence i bet all this
always does ok oh all is doing basically
is taking your notes matching them up
with the OGG file gotcha so the frets
program reads them what do you have to
give to the frets program now ok play it
what you do is the same author you just
had before you
you paste it into the data songs
directory in friends on fire okay and
then you rename 12 guitar dog and then
paste it again and then rename the other
12 song Bella so you're putting the same
file in there twice okay you're just
naming one song and one guitar so that
it knows how to read it so without
further ado once those are all in there
oh there's one more step that you have
to do with its in the tutorial and it is
the and I'll just open song deny yeah
just open it and you just basically it
actually does a lot of this for you you
copy and paste something they tell you
how to do it there's great and that's
where we put the name and the artists
the only stuff you have to edit is this
stuff right down here okay me the artist
ok so the Hat 15 by Ashley wit yes just
save that in there and once you do that
we ready to rock now you're ready to
rock all right let's write an open up
frets on fire I have a lot of icons I
know and here we go how our porcelain
friend isn't here that's how so I
already have it configured with my
controller okay play the game and
there's some others in heck came right
up there it is great and I did it once
already so we're gonna we're going to do
this again alright so medium difficulty
cuz it's the only one I made right now
if you had a few made different versions
over the adult show up here okay cool so
let's do media so I'm going to try to do
this now these notes are a little you
know since its since the theme has a lot
of horns in it separately guitar I think
there's a guitar seeing theme often yeah
there's this guitar going on to this
wondering if this will ever expand to
like rock band where you get to make the
jump are in the oh that's cool
this is something that I've always
wanted to do is just ever since playing
the first guitar would be like oh when
if he's awesome to play your own theme
and you totally did it and I stopped
from a Texas oh yeah there's you can do
a lot more you do a much longer song
just a demo sacrum you have four stars
rock oh yeah yes awesome eighty-nine
percent accuracy on a song you even
built yourself I just got a lot better
than it yeah we can't all rock as good
as Paul I guess not I guess nice well
dude thank you so much for bringing this
I mean it's a really great fun segment I
had a lot of fun watching you I mean
gonna actually uh I go back get the full
ver I'm gonna try to do the whole song
and I'll have it up on the wiki and
everything cool so we're gonna put this
in the show notes in the form so
everybody can rock along with this link
absolutely alright so well then I guess
the only thing we need to let them know
is that they can find out all about
fronts on fire at what is it frets on
fire on fire at sourceforge.net sweet
and they can find out about you and your
rockness over adding back up Chris
Grayling calm that's place thank you
Chris you bet why just get a domain name
when you can get it all register your
domain name with godaddy.com the number
one domain registrar worldwide and get
free hosting with a website builder a
free blog a complete email and much much
more Plus as a fan of hak5 enter code
hjk 3 that's hack and the number three
and get your comm name for just 695 a
year get your piece of the internet at
godaddy.com Go Go Daddy so last month
trivia question was TDM and fdm are
examples of fixed link sharing
technologies that's a mouthful here
comes bigger one what variable
multiplexing alternative is stated to be
in the next revision of evdo
technobabble turnabout would you like a
glass of water yeah really and the
correct answer would be statistical
multiplexing and that was correctly
answered by Jeb dude do you remember
when we look this up last month coming
up with a trivia question there's a lot
of fun because we like okay it's just
pretty cool because it's like basically
the difference between constant bit rate
and variable bit rate so you've got a
whole bunch of spectrum and only
this many users they all get a lot more
of the pool and then get more users it
just can easily run it down yeah it's
good stuff it's kind of neat so this
monstrovia question this one may be a
question is the NEC v20 processor a
29,000 transistor cpu was reverse
engineered to be pin compatible with
what intel chip and there's a lot of fun
history behind this one so if you do
know the answer off the top of your head
make sure you email trivia at hak5 org
and if you have to look it up make sure
to just read about it because it is
pretty cool history timeline next month
so right now right now we we go to the
next segment which would be the one
right after these sponsors which
okay so hey what's up everybody I know
I've done a lot of projects in the past
that people have emailed me and messaged
me and every other form of communication
you can possibly get ahold of me with
and asked well that's all cool and on I
really want to do it but I I've never
done anything like that before you know
anything along those lines and I never
really have any good advice for other
than to go and do it but I know how
intimidating that can be when it
involves ripping apart something that's
perfectly good to harvest parts out of
it and you don't want to break it and
not have anything have two broken things
instead of your end product a good way
to hone those modding skills that you so
awesomely desire is buying kits
specifically the one I have here is the
Herbie the mouse bot kit from solar
buttocks at solar bot XCOM and like I
said Herbie Herbie here is a kit it
comes completely all-inclusive all you
need is a soldering iron and solder to
put him together that's it they provide
everything else and if you take a look
at her be here what her be is he's a
little robot kind of a little autonomous
thing and there's two little black eyes
right there see that's them right there
they they chase light the little ir
photoreceptor things I forget their
technical name right now but what they
do is they sense infrared light and make
him turn in the direction of the light
his little whiskers up here are back up
sensors so when they run into something
he just kind of backs up and keeps going
same thing with this tail here that's
what the little loops for same thing if
we look at his and we look at his head
here these are all the solder points for
most of the major electronics they're
very very easy to work with her be here
actually falls in the kind of
intermediate
to novice hobbyist if you look under his
belly here here's his two motors that
make them go there's an IC chip which
has IC chip that's little redundant p I
see that is the brains of the operation
a capacitor on/off switch resistor bunch
more traces and stuff and if you look
he's actually held together with solder
but what's so cool about these solder
points is that they're still functional
they still carry signal this is a relay
and that relays what actually sends him
into reverse a couple more solder points
battery bay and he's not overly
complicated in the slightest he he looks
intimidating but all these kids are
pretty much self-explanatory and here's
the directions nothing special except
for the fact that they have nice big
pictures and everything is written in
plain English and on top of that if you
look real closely here on the PCB let's
focus focus there we go look labeled LED
it was optional so I didn't put it on
but there's pictures and they tell you
the squares negative circle is positive
great little gifts and what's another
cool thing about her be say that led is
actually an infrared LED that you can
hook up so he'll play with other
Herbie's too and they'll chase each
other and stuff so you get two of them
going plus your cats and your dog it's
fun for hours kid you not it's sterile
to watch them go now as I mentioned
before Herbie's made by the solar
buttocks company solar biotics calm and
the proceeds from all of their kits go
to the kiss institute for practical
robotics they're doing it for the kids
it's an institute a nonprofit
organization that they they use simple
robotics for teaching kids science and
math and project management and also
which other stuff like that so for some
of you that might have kids already that
are old enough to not try to cauterize a
wound with a soldering iron or cause one
cauterize cause that it you know it's
something to think about yeah it'd just
be a really really good thing I'll have
a link to solar bhatak sand the show
notes and I'll take some high res
pictures of her be here so you can get a
really really good look of what's going
on because I know compression can ruin
it so check them out if you want to just
get into modding or a gift for somebody
you know that likes electronics and
stuff like that ww sold robotics calm so
maybe you've got a new mp3 player for
Christmas and you're wondering what to
do with the old one you want to do a
little hacking or maybe you're upset
with the the current firmware on your
existing mp3 player well we've got the
solution or at least Chris curling thank
you for coming down once again to to
show us rockbox hot box yes some so
basically Rock boxes and open source
firmware for mp3 players works on ipods
I rivers just off all kinds of different
toshiba sandisk Apple all sorts of most
of the you know popular mp3 players
would work a cool so it's a replacement
firmware so we're wiping out the current
operating system here on this fifth in a
pod it actually doesn't wipe it out okay
puts the bootloader on there what's is a
grub that's been scrubbed okay it's a
bit line it's pretty transparent and
this is linux based and open source so
I'm majan it's pretty extendable oh yes
so what would being worked on what kind
of features do we have on this as
opposed to you know the stock firm are
you would get on your regular mp3 of the
main ones that I can the main ones that
uh that I can think of off the bat is
playlist functionality you can actually
build and edit playlists on this thing
that's what the ipod you have to do it
in iTunes and you have to it's yeah well
they've got be on the go playlist but
you're talking about actually putting
together real playlist okay cool
whatever you have up you can just select
a bunch of songs from it and create a
playlist that's cool it has all kinds it
for applications text editor I think
there's a dictionary I don't know that
using a text editor only that a text
yeah it's probably not something it's
more of a novelty thing but there's a
lot of there's a calculator out here
that is actually pretty good there are a
lot of different applications games lots
of different yeah you're showing me some
of those games you want to get you want
to actually just show us one of those
right now as they look and really cool
yeah I will we'll go to that so so we
can get a good shot yes I'm just going
to hold the camera here yes that's how
we do it and we go to plugins games and
so here they all are starts up with
blackjack bubbles do bubbles is a great
gas bubbles inside that is now let me
move that up and it tells you there's
some instructions and basically I just
played a start and this one's cool
because it uses the use of the actual
sliding functionality yeah I think
that's blue goes over there there we go
and read one goes right there so if
you've played bubble bobble this is very
similar pretty much so a lot better than
the standard ipod games oh absolutely
who knows if your I river or any of
those came with games at all yes most
important question and this is one that
Paul would be familiar with does it play
doom always it goes play doom here we go
so this isn't the regular doom one ok
uses a freedom one you're not familiar
with freedom you might want to google
that it's pretty much a just a you know
how boom is open source but the wad
files aren't well it's basically a free
wad so you can get all the graphics and
maps and stuff that has been made by the
community and it's very similar to the
original doom experience move around
punch get your gone up like this so you
can take out that imp before they get to
me here ok all right
I can move there's another one so what
about the playback what is the the audio
features like so that's one of the most
important things actually there's 15
different formats supported I think they
actually have a go there's actually a
feature page on here here we go so it
goes from MPEG audio to aguas AC wave
obviously flack there's flex board
that's great that's because that's
something that a lot of people would
love in their ipod and then some some
other things monkey's audio I haven't
actually heard of that one it'll play
middies I mean it will play all kinds of
things and it actually has a list here
of the different players and what they
actually play so cool and you were
telling me earlier that even has like a
lot of custom like playback options so
if you really so it looks like it was
engineered by audio files I go haces
subject settings and then there's sound
settings in here which is some basic
stuff which has like bass cutoff channel
configuration like if you have if
there's even a karaoke mode in there
crossfade equalizer settings dithering
as different and then if you go under
general settings and to playback and
this is where you get into the really
neat stuff anti skip there's some don't
see it in this menu if there's gapless
playback but it's not of this menu it
even has last.fm support so if you have
last.fm installed on your on your
computer the only thing with that is it
have to be I think you have to sink it
in iTunes in order for games okay but
other than that it works great so where
can people in what do you do to install
it okay you basically download the
Installer there's a windows installer
from rockbox org there's all the way
there's they have all the tutorials and
everything for linux and however you you
know whichever way you want to do it so
you've got it on windows right here so
let's table is that installs here's the
here's the rockbox utility and when you
first load it it'll come up with this
quick start kind of tab and if it
doesn't just detect your device right
away you have to just click change and
tell it what you know tell it where it
is and what it is in
it sees it and you just click the
complete installation button and then
put all the games and applications and
everything out there sounds really plug
and play yeah definitely and if you
wanted to do it manually you could just
do the regular boot loader and rock box
and then add things as you wanted to
sounds a little bit easier to install
than Linux doom when we try that last
year only slightly but and I'd like to
be the ability that you can you know
switch between the operating systems in
the bootloader so it really sounds like
a fun thing that people might want to
try out where can they find this rockbox
org awesome and Chris where can people
find any more information about all the
fun stuff you doing duck Chris Grayling
calm that's the place okay so that's
pretty much going to wrap up this
episode of hak5 as always we have a
little housekeeping to do at the end of
every show first and foremost is you
wanted to get like a quick revisit to
yes the remote assistant segment from
last month got a lot of great responses
from that people sending them some some
really good feedback and one of the
programs or services I'd like to mention

that that kind of follows a life of this
kid Kevin who has a similar life to
another hacker by the name of
Mitnick maybe and you know it just shows
his like early exploits learning about
freaking and about social engineering
and it's pretty cool i mean the the guy
