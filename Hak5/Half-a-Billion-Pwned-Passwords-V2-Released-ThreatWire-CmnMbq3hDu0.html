Intel releases a new firmware update for
Spectre and the net neutrality repeal
was published but the fight is not over
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I am Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for February 27th 2018 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom you will
probably notice that I'm a little bit
stuffy today and you'll obviously notice
there is an echo in this episode we are
currently in the midst of a really big
move to a new studio space so not only
have I kicked up a whole bunch of dust
and I got a sinus infection but the echo
is going to change in the near future
don't worry about it for now though I've
got this minimal setup going on we do
have some echo don't worry it's going to
be improved soon and thank you so much
to our patrons for helping out with this
it's patreon.com slash threat wire that
is the best way to support the show and
will help us reach our next goal and now
onto the news first being pwned
passwords so on Thursday of last week's
security researcher Troy hunt announced
and launched version two of his tool
called pwned passwords version 1 was
originally launched six months ago with
about 320 million passwords but the
updated one has over 500 million
yeah that's half a billion passwords
that are known to be as NIST puts it
commonly used expected or compromised so
potent passwords now includes data from
the online er spam bot dump as well as
clear text credentials from the dark web
all of the 500 million plus passwords
are sha-1 hashed
which gives them the ability to be
easily used but office gated just enough
to require a little bit of effort to
view the entire database in clear-text
a password research collective on
twitter who goes by the screen name at
sign o prime found over 3 million
entries that were incorrectly entered
due to source data issues so hunt took
this information as well and removed the
junk data from the database
troit also added a counter next to each
entry so you can see how many
the password has actually been used
which can also help determine how
vulnerable it is now the data is
available via his site as a 7-zip direct
download or a torrent which he
recommends using the torrent for
security admins this set could be super
useful whenever users update their
passwords by comparing the new password
hash to the vulnerable database of
hashes any password that is already
determined to be pwned could be blocked
and the user asked to pick a different
password with the help of CloudFlare a
password checker that uses K anonymity
was created now k anonymity will compare
the first five characters of sha-1
hashes to the remaining characters of
anything that matches it so the API will
respond with hundreds of possible
entries and account of how many times
the password was used so the original
password could be one of those hashes
but the API allows for Samsung and anima
T whenever you're searching if you have
no need for the entire database you can
also enter a suspected vulnerable
password into have I been pwned calm
slash passwords which I'll put that link
down in the show notes or you can also
visit password security info which is a
third party open source query site made
by felix gifford as an entry into a
competition that troy ran and enter your
password there to see if it's breached
but of course as with any website use
caution whenever you're choosing to
enter a password onto a web site within
one day password manager one password
added the API to their platform which
will check the hashes against your
locally stored passwords to see if
there's a match which means only the
first five characters of the hash are
sent out the rest are checked locally
that's super secure now if you use one
password you can hit shift ctrl alt C or
option C to open the POC and follow the
on-screen prompts to check it out I
think that's pretty cool
intel has announced their release of
updated firmware for the skylake copy
lake and coffee lake processors which
are the sixth seventh and eighth
generation of Intel CPUs which will
protect against the specter flaw which
was previous released earlier this year
now specifically these updates protect
against Spectre
two attacks this update will give
operating systems the ability to prevent
one process from influencing or changing
the predictions of another process which
was the whole point in the whole issue
with Spectre now Intel has taken a lot
of heat for their Spectre and melt down
CPU updates notably so because they
cause consumer and machines to reboot to
crash or to just error out now while the
sixth seventh and eighth generation
processors now have these fixes being
distributed older processes like Sandy
Bridge and Ivy Bridge and Haswell are
still in beta so we haven't seen
anything about those yet other CPUs are
still in pre beta and Intel has not
released a statement regarding delivery
dates for those firmware updates now
while they have released this news that
does not mean that updates are available
for consumers just yet I know I'm
waiting for - most likely you will still
have to wait till Intel's partners and
OM part manufacturers like motherboard
manufacturers and desktop suppliers
actually push those updates to their
users Intel has also been upping their
game as far as vulnerabilities go as a
whole they just launched a new bug
bounty program last week with max
rewards of up to get this $250,000 they
also posted a white paper about Google
software fix for Spectre available via
the link below but this does not make
Intel invincible until has had 32
lawsuits filed against them for the
attacks thirty of which are class-action
lawsuits from consumers until losses are
yet to be determined
back in December the FCC voted 3-2 to to
overrule an abandoned net neutrality
title to open Internet order this ruling
officially went into the Federal
Register on February 22nd and will go
into effect on April 23rd which is 60
days later now you would think that the
fight is over and we lost but it is far
from it 23 different states have
petitioned for a judicial review calling
it arbitrary capricious and an abuse of
discretion also stating that it violates
the Constitution and communications at
of 1934 whoa the Congressional review
Act requires a majority vote in Congress
to overturn a ruling and currently only
one vote is required for the review we
are almost there
battle for the Netcom has created a page
dedicated to contacting Congress and
getting more senators on board to review
and overturn the FCC's ruling but of
course passing in the house and being
signed by the president would require a
much more concerted effort now states
have also been working on their own net
neutrality laws and rules using a
loophole in the FCC ruling by basically
just not doing business with any ISP
that uses these rules to throttle to
push better connections for higher
paying partners or to block competition
the FCC is also facing some reviews and
inquiries from the Government
Accountability Office and the Inspector
General regarding their downplaying of
key components and audit PI's
relationship with ISPs which is
seemingly very close so it seems that
this battle for a free and open Internet
is not ending but continuing it is
certainly going to be a very interesting
year if you are a patreon patron you can
send in your favorite stories on the
community tab to get featured on the
show like Joel who posted this little
tidbit apparently patreon is moving away
from at base two-factor authentication
and using SMS only if you want to let
patreon know why that is a very very bad
move like I did and how SMS based
authentication can be stolen by a third
party or how SMS based authentication
only works for one account
unlike app based then you can tweet them
there at patreon on Twitter you can tell
I'm not salty not throwing shade either
really I'm not okay maybe I am everyone
who does support threat wire over on
patreon.com slash threat where y'all are
the reason that we can keep on bringing
in news every single week we are on the
way and super close to our next goal
which allows me to upgrade some more of
the set and our equipment which by the
way do you like this new camera I know I
do it also opens up a live video Q&amp;amp;A
just for pay
turns each and every month and if you
are already a patron you get access to
an audio RSS feed first looks at show
topics extra pictures pulls discussions
just for patrons and a lot more any
little bit helps us grow the show keep
an independent and you are awesome
also check out these amazing fur babies
we got some new ones from our patreon
supporters really appreciate those so
make sure to check out those perk levels
and keep this show coming completely
independent of course you can always
share the show as well on your favorite
social media page and with that I am
Shannon Morse and I will see you on the
Internet
with less echo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
