showcase the suite software dan was
talking about that would allow us to use
one mouse and one keyboard for multiple
multiple machines excuse me what is it
Darren it's called synergy and as you
said you're right it's like it's the
software that will let you take a mouse
and a keyboard and rule them all with it
so first things first you know obviously
we use a lot of Windows but you know
there's people use open source Mac users
is a cross-platform can we use this
totally cross-platform that's why we've
got set up here we've got a windows
machine we have a mac mini courtesy of
our camera guy Paul yep all the camera
can you and we've got your laptop here
running gentoo right so and we've got
them all networked together on the same
land and using synergy we have a server
running on the mac mini it could be on
any of these but we've got it running on
the mac meeting we've hit clients
running on the windows in the gentoo box
and those all communicate and using the
network we're able to emulate the
keyboard and mouse so that we only have
one set of one pair of keyboard mouse on
the desk and then three monitors so the
way that the software works is that on
the server you will tell it on this
machine we've told it that the windows
machine is to the right of it and that
the Linux machine is to the left of it
so that when you move the mouse across
the left side of the screen it will come
in to the right side of the Linux
machine and vice versa so you can move
your mouse you know across as if it was
one big extended desktop and that way
whatever your cursor is on becomes the
active machine that your keyboard will
accept input from ok computer will
accept the keyboard from yeah so I can
you know I can just I can work on this
machine I can work on that machine and
right between my web server my web
developer my graphics editor where we
can get a lot of is this perfect for
multitaskers that are running multiple
operating systems in fact ill you know
I've got two windows machines on my desk
and they were great i've got my editing
box and I've got my development box and
I'm going back and forth i am actually
doing one I've see I've seen the uber
micro for that and they run at different
resolutions but the coolest thing is it
approximates because i have three
monitors that are all the same exact
same Bank size right now it emulates
where they should be okay so if I'm
running if I'm running 1024 x 768 in
this monitor and I want to go to the
monitor on the right-hand side that's
right at 1280 x 1024
I can go through the right-hand corner
out and I end up in the left-hand corner
in tough love you possibly awesome
fantastic now we're talking about using
one keyboard one mouse for three
different machines now all of these
machines have some kind of log in
process control alt delete you know just
regular user and whatever OS X uses
because I've never touched it you know
when I've reboot will I be able to use
that same single mouse and keyboard to
login service machines sure with Windows
for the control too late it's actually
control at pause okay and as for
starting up I think what you're asking
is I do i still need a keyboard and
mouse attached to the other machines
besides the server right right and the
answer is no now I still keep a keyboard
attached to one of my machines because
it won't get past bios without a
keyboard unfortunately but you know it
gives the old keyboard air press f1 to
continue with a lot or energy any key
yeah Marzuki anyway no you don't need to
have a keyboard mouse attached to each
machine if they don't need it because
you can set up on Windows it as a
service so that it starts up on boot and
it'll be you know running when you get
to the login screen same thing with the
Mac there's three different ways to do
it that are illustrated on the website
and with X with Linux it's an X
configuration okay so yeah if you're
like excellent calm for something
exactly okay so since you're running all
of this over the network is there any
kind of network security issues now
granted well this is all in the land so
I'm not worried about it you're not
going to run it be running some kind of
packet sniffer on me and I wouldn't be
setting up three different laptops at a
you know at a starbucks or something and
you know hoping that somebody's not like
listening to my packets I don't think
what they say in the website is don't
run this on an untrusted network because
there is no authentication and there is
no encryption so if you're like in a
dorm environment and you're worried
you're a little paranoid about somebody
sniffing your keyboard mouse traffic
they could actually do that however you
can use ssh to secure it just got to
make sure that you do ssh port
forwarding and i believe its port 24 800
right and you know we've we've talked
about port forwarding and ssh before in
previous episodes and we'll have links
in the show notes to some other you know
sage servers that will run on various
operating systems but yeah it by default
the software is not secure I'm running
it here in the studio the only I know
everybody on this land now you're on the
land I'm on land Paul's on land like
yeah so I mean you're not sniffing my
pecs are ya never thanks no just kidding
okay but seriously so all right so
synergy has proven to be like a really
really versatile really good program it
was my life oh yeah it's fantastic for
jumping between machines and that happen
to code like like I do right now I have
to like roll my chair around and go from
keyboard mouse whatever right our friend
Rob had had two sets of keyboard and
mice on his desk you know one that he'd
pull under and yeah yeah and it's like
that's ridiculous well you know it
serves a purpose to an extent but then
there's just like wow just title
together yeah so I mean so we've gone
through all these three machines now sir
any other features that you really like
to highlight that are just really really
clear that would look really good okay
this is one thing that blew my mind you
know as well as the fact that it just
works seamlessly and beautifully it has
a clipboard that works between all three
systems so if you were in X chat on your
gen 2 box and you wanted to copy and
paste something over to your Mac machine
you just copy it over here coming over
here paste it and it will work you like
you say like you're watching in
Photoshop and you're like you got a
webpage open on the windows machine you
want to like paste it into GIMP copy
paste images text they work seamlessly
across the platform so so like the
clipboard is cross-platform
cross-network I can go from here to
there there to here here to any way it
makes it so that these three machines
don't feel like three separate machines
it just feels like you're working
environment doesn't matter what OS it is
so that is beautiful beautiful not make
sure that I install synergy or it's
obviously on my laptop now I'm after put
on my windows box so I can go jump
between it too because I'm tired of
having to jump back exactly i mean if
you're thinking about making the change
but you're thinking about making the
switch but you can't you know really
like the Mac Mini is a perfect example
of a reason why you want to use synergy
is because you know i love the mackney
I've been thinking about really getting
mac mini see that out of the macbook but
if i get a mac mini
totally setting it up on my land and I'm
totally going to be using synergy so
that I can slowly make the transition
right and slowly get into the reality
distortion field that is Mac but anyway
i am steve jobs and you'll do what I say
okay so we can bounce back and forth
between the you know all machines using
the clipboard that synergy has built in
which is incredible now what about like
gaming you know FPS shooters you're
using your mouse you going back and
forth with the keyboard you Jeff crazy
now what happens if I smack the mouse
too far you know I Ranger the same exact
problem I was playing on the hak5 UT
server and I was getting sprags on but
it wasn't really happened when I would
go too far left I'd look a little do
parla I'm on my scream but it would
actually come out of the machine and go
into the next machine that will minimize
yeah so I found out reading the website
that actually there's workaround for
that and if you press scroll lock
whatever your mouse whatever machine
your mouse is currently all inactive it
locks you on to that machine Wow so if
you're doing abs gaming yeah lock
yourself in with with scroll lock in
that way you won't work if you're like
really involved in what are you working
on like I know I've done it before like
you know you get really involved you
just start slinging the medals underwear
yeah yeah like you're in the zone now
like one of those stupid things it's a
stupid and silly but I have fun with it
is that like my screen savers it'll
actually sink of all it's like all your
screen saver so that all three go on at
the same time and you can actually
configure I haven't done this myself but
you supposedly the website says that you
can figure it so that one login will log
in to all three machines at once nice oh
that's kind of a cool feature that I
haven't really delved into but they say
that it's available I just feel like
something after research or anything and
the website is synergy to dot
sourceforge net and it's licensed under
the gnu GPL okay so it is an open source
open source and we heart open source
here at five me hard open source so I do
believe I'm out out of Courvoisier so
this segments going to have to in here
yes so let's go through what Ellie's
doing because I've got a mod coming up
which is like cool because I did some
stuff but let's go check out this month
trivia thank you yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
