brought to you by go daddy.com Beck's
beer Crysis warhead and Paul the camera
guy action figure now with over a dozen
attachments and accessories
thank you all right that's enough
hey everybody welcome this week's
episode of hak5 on that let's talk
Darren kitchen for those of you who
haven't seen the show before we are a
technology-based show focused on
everything from home brew gaming white
hat and black hat hacking and systems
administration anything you could
basically think of we encompass
everything in the whole IT umbrella
action call it techno lyst techno lust
yeah there you go we got a great show
for you guys tonight we are talking to
Chris Grayling he's back from Virginia
Beach he's going to be telling us about
reverse engineering part 2 we're going
to go in and actually do some hands-on
and get some get some goodness out of
that so I'm looking forward to that so
we could did the theory last week and
now it's time to application get into
that crack me and Shannon you're going
now Estelle jacovic I am a little bit
old school with the bulletin board
systems and Lord yeah we're not talking
religion here we're talking about a
little red dragon that I'm aware of so
we'll get to that a little later but
first I'm gonna head over and talk to
chris about cracking some crack knees
sorry have fun with that I will all
right okay hey what's welcome my set I
know I need to shake my hand I know you
did that's seriously you're awake No so
we're back and everybody that remembers
from last week we went over a lot of the
theory about reverse engineering so if
you just dived into the middle you might
want to go back and see that if you
haven't yeah we're going to go in and
actually use one of the tools that I
talked about last night net reflector
and we're going to go and use little
python and and actually make an
application do something that it wasn't
really designed to do you're tickling my
technical is already so let's get right
down into it we have an application you
told me earlier this is a legal
application that we ND cracking yeah
this little crack nizza and I talked to
bottom a long time ago on season three
and basically they're good Chris gates
from learn security online actually
makes these and distributes them for
people to practice on so they don't have
to go and you know crack something that
might have a you know like a copywriter
somehow you know it was over I've done
directly so bored and you want to crack
something rather than going out and
finding your latest favorite game and
and trying to you know play with that
you might want to try with something
legal first to hone your skills exactly
you recommend going over Chris kade ste
at learn security online.com yes sweet
and you can pick up these crack knees I
was up to number four now I think so
let's take a look at this crack me was
it look like all right this is what when
you open the crack me th see it comes up
with a little gooey here and and I can
tell right away that this icon is it was
probably made in net ok so I'm one we
got 3 we have four buttons here what do
they do sao tome one tone two and two
and three we're trying to make them
match it says the tones don't match ok
when we make the tones match it's going
to come up with something to say we won
the contest or whatever we have to go
Open Sesame and then all of a sudden the
aliens come to end up just a disclaimer
the contests already been won and
everything this is a we're not spoiling
anything here but I think we'll do
number four in a future date sounds good
so x okay so the first thing you said
that the first thing you notice right
off the bat with this is that it's
written in net and that you figured out
just by the icons by the most when the
default GUI when you make a dotnet
application using Microsoft's tools is
it just gives you a default icon of you
consume in Iraq right there okay so
that's just a default GUI that it kind
of gives you to play with you know
instead of having to design your own
Microsoft so last week you're telling me
that there's different disassemblers for
different types of applications we've
identified this one is a.net one so
rather than using like w32 this summer
dism or ID a pro we're going to be using
red gates dotnet reflector sweet so that
will compile rd assemble our net code
let's take a look at me so right away
what I notice is when I open it up in
here typically with dot net applications
when you open it it's it's very apparent
as to what's going on here it's things
are kind of you know when I close this
right away the only thing that really
stands out is this next thing any TZ
okay so we can see here we've got Nets
right under our references what is any
TV well that's a zoom back out of here
and I actually save this google search
just to show you know this i googled it
it's a net executive most compressor and
packer so what it does is it compresses
an exe within an exe so this is the same
kind of
the same kind of principle same kind of
method that's used by like people in the
cracking seen people in you know maybe
some of those shadier sides of the web
that use to disguise their applications
within other applications so that say
for existence heuristics from in a
popular antivirus software wouldn't
picked up wouldn't pick this up okay and
that's free to use so we can go and
exactly using this we can open up the
executable inside this executable so
what we do and is uh we go in and if you
open up the resources here we can see
zip dll right here yeah let's take a
look at that there we go so zip dll that
means there's some kind of zip action
going on compress and that's where you
see it's going on and this is the actual
this acc stuff this is the actual
resource that it's compressing this is
the executive a file okay so you can
tell it's a little bit smaller this is a
standard bite size and this is a
different bite size so that means it's
okay this is the actual thing the actual
package is 7499 bytes we see that over
there on the right and we're going to
use the zip dll to extract it so we can
see what's inside of that and we don't
even have to actually use that the debt
that wreck net reflector will do it for
you you just right click save as okay
and I've named it zip zip ok so we've
already got saved out so now we've got
it so it's a zip file great we can just
extract it like it would not exist no no
no it's not exactly a zip file you can't
open it with winrar or winzip it's a
special it's a compressed file but it's
not compressed within the file standards
of those for me so it's not using our
zip RAR any of those standards though so
that's where that Nazi comes into play
right yes alright so what we do is since
it was used you know package with that
there is a Python script and I have it
open right here really quick this is and
we'll have this in the show notes and
everything in great so so this is the
net z.z lib library this is yeah you use
the Z lib library in Python and what we
do is yeah we'll zoom right in on that
and so just so you can see what we're
doing here ok so we've got our Python
open and we're going to go ahead and
give it this code and when we're done
with this I'm looking at the etsy ofz
open zip zip and then F F unzip this is
what we're going to name it okay
extracted and then it just died
is the writing the compressed and
uncompressed and then it yeah okay just
for X file it's a fair bit as always and
Python there when i hit enter here it's
just going to do it for me saves it out
yep so what we do now is when I and I
already have it open another any other
network okay so so we've got we've got
the executable that was inside that
first executable extracted using the net
Z this look like original idea to in
this one great so it's got a separate
exe and now we can open that again in
another instance of dotnet reflect
exactly when we open that and let me
just minimize this really quick now you
see there's form one form to you have
your resources everything looks kind of
here we go yeah cool everything looks
nice it doesn't look like that net stuff
before so now we'll go in really quick
open up form one and what I came the
application on the title bar exactly and
what I found is with when you go down
here to click object and pose okay
there's a couple of different objects in
here yeah there's objects and then we'll
go right over to here console beep and
it has two numbers console dot deep
300.com of 500 now I suspect just
listening to these tones maybe a little
bit of an eye you know past freak stuff
is coming in here but sounds a lot like
DTMF or dual-tone multi-frequency and
may be completely wrong but those two
values look like they might be frequency
values volume values that come together
to make a segment that's going to be
awesome they do and what we notice here
is there's 300 and 500 and if i zoom out
really quick and I go to tone too we
noticed that the 500 doesn't change ok
so we've always got a different number
in our second tone in our detail first
time yeah the second toe is always 500
ok and that's what's causing the
problems utilizing the program is
expecting it to be slightly different
exact great so we've identified where
our problem is here in our packaged code
inside of the code now how do we going
to change that ok what we do is we break
these out into hex values and I have
those written right here this is 600
index equals 50 80 20 000 is what I
broke it out too and we'll have that in
the you know well you've got some
resources in your in your blog with your
article about how to convert those
values into hexes for everybody that
doesn't just
yeah we just I just use a standard hex
calculator you can just find them
anywhere line okay so what do we do now
so we've say like you've gone through
each of these objects here and and found
is we've got our 300 or 600 whatever the
tone 31 was and we've converted those
over to hex how are we going to to then
change that to what they need to be
inside that program good question we use
a hex editor okay one of the heck
setters at eyes that i came across i
liked is a plug-in for notepad plus plus
we have i already had this doll there
you go great program so what we did is
uh I were looking at it right here yeah
and this is actually the kind of the
finished product I didn't want to go
through and do a whole lot of X editing
and you know so so this is the the
program that was within the program that
bat executable opened up in a hex editor
exactly and we've done a search for to c
0 100 actually we did a search for the
fa 0 0 0 which was the old wrong value
and then i already converted them over
okay so so so before it was 250 what it
needed to be with 300 so you just open
it in the hex editor you haven't found
that hex value which was previously fa 0
0 0 0 which was half of the 500
basically oh I threw it is doing there
so somebody tries to take you I mean did
you did you know what the tones were
supposed to be um I kind of knew what
they were supposed to be I also used a
really helpful guy from someone who
solved the puzzle now watch so you know
which help for the pie when you get the
strategy guy really playing the game
where you just wallowing did help with a
Python script I had a good idea of what
was going on I hear you with the Python
I'm not so much like I like all of the
all of the stuff that we've done to get
here you know leaves you with a lot of
knowledge there's a lot of time a lot of
things you have to do to actually get
into here and do it yeah you got to have
to learn a little bit of Python releases
I had to do awesome elaborately she's
know a little bit of pi thought he
should so what we did was we change the
250 to the to the 300 here so I'll zoom
in so you can see the two co one okay so
once you change those values you just
save it out in the hex editor as a
separate program so let's go ahead and
see that program right so i put the
separate program i already have open
here it looks the same as the 0 as the
original one it doesn't even if you
wanted to you could have changed the
form well sure I mean it was your
program at that point you owned it okay
you can change the GUI road
want to and you know do whatever you
want so with the finished program and
you've unlocked it any upgrade male
Chris it learns great well don't email
them ok welcome you know a little of
this it's already been some but there's
more contests going all the time its
learned security online so if this is
totally your cup of tea head over there
pick up the latest cracking and see if
you can win I what are the prize usually
books looks security type books yeah
awesome and if you guys are totally
interested in this type of content and
want to hear more also I know that we've
you know just gone over the high level
of the practice here but if there's more
specific stuff that you want us to hone
in on on some of these segments
definitely hit us up feedback at hak5
org well put together a segment just for
you guys or do a follow-up for Q&amp;amp;A type
thing on what you guys thought so I
guess at this point Chris awesome job
and I can't wait for next week because
you're back here next week damn another
little piece of goodness with viruses
how viruses but at this point I think
it's time to head over to Shannon and
see what's going on with this week's
trivia this week's trivia is the curt

thread for this trivia question we will
send you a PM asking for your address
and your name and we will send you these
nifty brand-new hak5 stickers i know
they're beautiful we just got them in
the mail so as you guys know godaddy is

for detail and get your piece of the
internet at godaddy.com next we're going
to talk to Darren about some yummy
spiffy pineapple stuff but first we're
going to take a break
yeah that's it
hey kids why play with yourself when you
could play with me Paul the camera guy
action figures that's right i'm so
 badass they made an action
figure out of me i'm available with over
a dozen attachments and accessories
including tripods lights cameras HD
video mixers two cigars a bottle vodka
and kungfu grip don't wait nag your
parents now you won't be cool until
you've played with me Paul the camera
guy action figure available in pal and
ntsc at Paul the camera guy calm order
today
so last week you guys may have
remembered that Darren was at a coffee
shop with some messed-up kind of
pineapple looking thing well today he's
back talking about yah cigar and we're
gonna actually gonna crack that
double-decker pineapple open and see
what actually makes it tick Darren what
we got today well we're actually going
to be building our own yas occur and I
guess before I get to that a really
quick need to make an apology for my new
chief Wanda as Tamara lied if I CSS is
their yeah Seager Nick dear yeah Seager
hp9 a clan americana owned dunk afford
the Becks as his bundle bar so aside
from that Yankee I know I know and
German in like in high school so it's
not the greatest and can't believe it
took me that long to realize oh it's
y'all's occur as a rated yo as in yes
very nice yes man so this guy is the yes
man let me tell you what I'm talking
about here before I even show you the
interface I've got my wireless network
connections I don't know I'm doing this
in windows here you can do it in your
favorite version of linux I'm just going
to do it real quick here because it's
easy this is my my wireless connection
thing and it's showing me that there are
what for access points available to me
well that's because this machine is safe
right now okay this machine not so much
with the get known but I want to show
you what this guy really does on this
machine so I've got my eeepc here fired
up in Windows and he's my target my my
noob if you will so I'm the noob you're
the noob okay so let's go ahead and
stand oh we've got this yas occur and
you just sat down at your new epc at the
coffee shop wherever and you've decided
you want to get on some internets so
what is your oh hey look at that Wow all
is between all these access it's a ton
of access and they're all full you look
hey go up to the top look at oh wow hey
very top very top does that say pro know
oh yeah thatthat's prono bozos wireless
network i'm totally con alone out here
the guy that does our music you know and
from the theme song i was just up in
canada hanging out with him a couple
weeks ago hopped on his wireless network
now my machine my witness machine just
remembers that wireless network is like
oh yeah next time in since I remember
prone a bozo next time I'm around pros
network just go ahead and connect right
so that's what this guy is done the
little fawn rowdy here with yas occur
and karma the guy that we stuffed inside
the pineapple is picking up all of those
requests in the air that's probes and
saying that's totally me so that's why
we have that huge list of available
access point even though they're not
actually around yeah this guy is saying
hey I'm Pro know hey I'm and that
machine everything says Oh front of oz I
remember you automatically connects and
we're like whew welcome to my network
yeah things just got interesting so how
do we actually make this thing work sure
well we've built this on a faun router
awesome guy by the name of Robin wood
has put a lot of time into building mad
Wi-Fi drivers for the faun so that we
can run karma then that's on the that's
the back end thing that makes all of
those access points job and then what
he's done is taken it a step further and
built a an interface a beautiful Ajax
the interface mind you now keep in mind
all of this is in early beta okay so
what we see here I'm going to go ahead
and take a look at the very top of it is
our status controls so when we first
fire this up we see now normally when
you first fire this up everything isn't
on by default so this thing isn't lethal
right out of the box you still have to
connect to it you just do that by
running a cat5 cable from your your fon
router here into your machine or if you
want to be a little bit later later on
you can make yourself a little access
point in there that's actually safe so
you can leave this inside your pineapple
and and go in and connect to it that way
I had this guy in the pineapple
connected with my battery which is down
on the floor they're charging and and
and I'll show you I'll get links to that
in my shown is talking about battery
pack some ways to power this guy
remotely okay okay so you don't need a
wall jack everywhere you go to n people
okay so either over the ethernet or the
wireless you get to this and the first
thing you see is a little wizard that
helps you set up the interface I've
already got that done here and let me
show you what's going on here so we've
got interface is currently up okay we've
got karma is currently on that means
that those you know request those probes
are getting stiffed by this thing and
reported back is yes that's me now we've
got a blacklist and white list feature
here and what that basically means is
you see here where
says add SSID to the list we can go
ahead and put in there hak5 so i can say
all right i want to own all of the
wireless in this area but all the cool
kids on hak5 SSID there okay we can let
them still connect I'm not trying to
intercept those at all so you go ahead
and add that to your white list you can
change you can do blacklisting or white
listing right now you have to set them
up every time right it's not too big of
a deal like you said early early beta
early early beta and this is really the
early version of the interface I mean
I've seen it change with a couple of
revisions and I'm sure it will continue
to change now what happens down here is
the really fun part connected clients
what happens is as soon as you turn this
on other machines in the area as they do
try to connect to their access points
that they you know normally they know
like that they know of right and what we
see here are the MAC addresses of these
these noobs if you will so we've got
this MAC address here and this I mac
address here and guess what they've seen
the faun and the fon said yes and they
became happy and we got you know really
excited because now we can do fun stuff
so let me show you the cool fun stuff
right so down here we've got a we've
just gotta drop down and right now the
functionality that's built into these
drop downs are to add the sside to the
list or to kick the mac address off of
dairy auger and and have no more fun
with them so as you can see it's all of
the underlying structure is there it's
it's it's ready to be improved on right
and it's trivial to add these things all
of this is just is its running in Ruby
right so there's Ruby on the fon and so
it's extensible you just go into the
Ruby code and add all of your scripts so
there's a whole bunch of there's a whole
bunch of what are they called shell
scripts okay that do different things so
there's and that's where you expand upon
it so I think that's a whole different
topic altogether I'm going to be talking
to Robin wood at torque on sep tember 26
through 20th so whatever the show is
after that we should have an interview
with him and talk about more the future
of the development of this
okay so but right now we just want to
get the dairy also go right up and
running so that it's accepting noobs and
then we can add some more fun payloads
to a little later right okay so like I
said this is all running on the on the
fon he told me that he just got the mad
Wi-Fi drivers running on the epc so it
actually turned this into my pc into a
into a dairy aw sugar there is in fact a
dairy Oscar the raw sugar is really just
a front end that makes all of this easy
it's a Ajax the interface like I showed
you with those clients connecting place
really these guys this just dynamically
updates so that you know as the people
join you can start having fun with their
you just sit back and you relax and
watch you get your little log area here
where you can see what's going on and
the underlying part of it is karma and
karma I should mention if you're using
an EPC you want check out backtrack
three because its built-in right and
head over we might remote exploit or
grab yourself a copy of that because you
know so if you don't have a fun router
you can still do this with an EPC or you
can still do it with anything else where
you can set up mad Wi-Fi but it's just a
lot more difficult all right there well
you've given them a great bit of info we
should probably give the kids a chance
to do some homework yes we're actually
giving you a homework on the show but
you I mean the amount of info here is
just going to take too long so we're
going to have to break it up in a couple
other segments so it's got some time to
go get some funds follow along you've
got instructions on how to do this yeah
if you want to if you've got a fun or if
you're getting fun and you want to get
the turkey in the oven reference episode
3 X 07 or 3 x 08 I've got a link in the
show notes to where you can go ahead and
unlock this guy get the new version of
open wrt on here that's what you're
going to need to get gaza car running
and so and then i'll continue this on
but this is a lot of information I glad
I could demo it to you here and show you
exactly what it does so next time we can
pop it in the oven and then after that
we'll that takes a long time to bake
yeah after that will extend on it next
week you're going you've got another
segment and an after that you've got
Robin wood at torque on remember to
follow hak5 on Twitter because Shannon
and Darren are actually
torque on in San Diego so you can follow
along and I think you guys are giving
away some stickers or stickers all sorts
of fun stuff so torque out he's going to
talk with Robin wood and we're gonna
come back we're going to dive right back
in and baste the turkey and then eat it
up so now we've got land party with
Shannon awesome yeah so we're having a
LAN party it's coming up this Saturday
September 20th and we are playing
counter-strike source get ready to get
owned alright I'm just kidding anyway
you can play along with us at game hak5
org but if you're not really feeling
like playing the games on Saturday you
can definitely check us out we're going
to be doing a live webcam streaming all
day because we're going to be filming
the next couple of episodes and you can
follow us at hak5 org and as you guys
know our sponsor is Crysis warhead yeah
Matt tell us about it thanks Shannon
yeah I I played crysis myself and as
soon as I heard that Crysis warhead was
going to be coming out I I already have
my copy pre-ordered Crysis warhead
actually comes out the eighteenth of
September behind us here we have the
demo plan Crysis warhead basically takes
place in a parallel timeline of crisis
it the other dude that got dropped' on
the other side of the island yeah you're
him so it's it's faster it's more bloody
it's more intense it's no longer a game
about survival it's about domination
which is something you know we know hear
about it like that kind of stuff i like
i like the way that it's like you know
from another perspective so I played
half-life and remember blue shift and
all those kind of the same but but
they've I mean if you've liked my rig
will run this even though it didn't run
crysis so I mean I've upgraded way since
right they telling me that it's like way
tweaked they optimize the CryEngine to
which is the engine that powers crisis
and Crysis warhead so that you can play
at better settings on you know maybe a
not next-gen rig but so yeah Crysis
warhead comes out September 18th guys I
highly encourage you to go buy it
because I had a blast playing crysis so
uh you know and after all they are
sponsor and we want to thank them for a
sponsor in the show so now
now we're going to kick it back to
Shannon because she knows what's coming
up yeah oh my god I want to play that
game so bad now that I saw that trailer
holy crap yeah where was I oh yeah so
I'm going to be talking about some
bulletin board systems some lord in a
little bit but first Matt is going to
tell us how to visually configure your
linux firewalk easily over to you hey
guys i'm here to show you a GUI for your
linux iptables firewalls cisco pix
firewalls anything that may need IP
tables or anything of the sort that you
usually have to do manually we cannot do
in a fresh awesome GUI Oh God the
website of the product that we're
actually be talking about is firewall
builder it's fw build org they have
packages for Windows Mac and as well as
Linux well now what's the thing with
that be the Linux ones are free and the
right the Linux one is free the mac and
windows clients both require you to
register after 30 days and i think it's
like 79 99 or that so it behooves you to
use Linux you set up you bun to package
for that but we're going to go ahead and
dive right into the application here
okay we've already got it installed and
we're going to create a new profile a
new object file and basically this is
just going to be random text this is
just a container to put your firewall
rules writing exact wish ma'am so those
of you who have used enterprise
applications for monitoring our excuse
me managing firewalls like four screens
pixie's to write them you'll notice this
pretty easily we're going to go ahead
and create a new firewall we're going to
name it Matt's firewall it's going to be
an IP tables based firewall that's going
to be installed on a linksys with space
soft firmware on it okay we're to use a
standard temperate library and there's
actually a template already built in
here for linksys firewalls oh okay let's
use that so now we've got the firewall
listed here we can actually go into the
policies and we can change them however
we want so we will change list exactly
what is here you see ping reply time
exceeded all that kind of stuff what
we're going to do is real quick we're
going to go ahead and
add a rule we're going to block AOL
walking AOL good choice exactly so the
great thing about this is the entire
interface is drag and drop oh that's so
nice we're going to go from source any
actually were going to go from source
it's going to be outside it's going to
be outside or inside so we want it to be
there we go we're going to go objects
address ranges or actually excuse me
networks and we're going to go with our
network which is going to be okay so
it's coming from inside kinda get out
right so if somebody has like AOL or a
IM installed it's going to exactly ok so
we drag that to the source the
destination is going to be any and the
service we can go here there's actually
pre-populated services already now you
can define your own services if you like
we're going to go ahead select TCP and
we're to go ahead here and select AOL
AOL and there are just going to drag
that in their interface all ok and the
action is going to be blocked alright so
now that we've gone ahead and modified
this rule here and we're actually going
to do is we're going to compare to build
that okay we've got to build it to make
sure that there's no issues with the
actual rules and oak inflictions compare
now we're not going to actually brick
whatever Bob this just as a sanity check
and all the rules make sure they're
actually going to work before you write
cool so you're not uploading something
is going to bork your box gotcha so
we're going to go ahead and click Next
and we're going to save it okay it
doesn't really matter what we save it as
it doesn't matter what we're going to
save it as and coming down here and look
at that its success success great
success so we click finish and now we're
actually going to go ahead and build our
excuse me insoles we can install the
rules directly from this interface which
is a great thing well you don't have to
log into this and then that and figure
out how to do it so energy pushes it out
to wherever you're okay right your
username your passphrase and then the
actual destination and if we actually
had a space hopper outer in here it
would actually upload and install those
rules for us and boom we've got a well
disabled on our linksys router there we
go so the great thing is GUI management
the firewall filters and
policies drag and drop drag and drop we
love drag and drop anything that makes
assisted mins life a lot easier we're
all four but right now we're going to go
ahead and check out this week's land
party and to get us more info on that is
Shannon the Lampard excuse me no way
that's alright that's alright let's just
take it from here we're actually talking
a little bit nostalgia here yes very
nostalgic I'm gonna take you back to the
80s and the 90s before the interwebs it
was really cool with the bulletin board
system I'm a child of that generation
and I grew up on bulletin board systems
back before you dialed in to AOL to get
online or doubt in prodigy or your local
ISP you would you know dial into these
bulletin board systems which are
basically like a hobbyist with a
computer and a modem and they would run
a system that you know the community
could dial into and play games and
message so we're running one on hak5 yes
we are I was never into this when I was
little but I got into it a few months
ago kind of disappeared for a while but
we're bringing it back so I'm going to
show you how to log in real quick it's
very easy you just go to start run type
in CMD and it takes you to the command
window and you type in telnet space BBS
hak5 org didn't ask you of course that's
for more than just windows the same
command will get you there on linux
machine on a Mac on any of that stuff ha
nice alright so we get into the hak5
telnet right here and it's super simple
to get to Lord which is legend of the
Red Dragon our little video game that we
like to play on there I'm so stoked
about this because like door games are
really like one of the things that made
bulletin board systems so much fun so I
mean in addition to the chat rooms that
there may have it's a multi-node
bulletin board MTG multiple modems on on
the server you're dialing or the message
boards or the file libraries where maybe
there's ratios I mean it's really like
you know the predecessor is too common
day f serves or stuff like that but the
door games or awards at least for me so
I played a lot of these and one that I
definitely phone
with back in the day and that we've
brought back legend of the red dragon so
good and tell us about this all right so
you get to this screen you press X to go
to external programs to four games and
you're at the Lord right there it loads
the realm and then you're in you can
play the game it's basically an RPG but
very very old school there's some ascii
art in there and you can fight the
woodland creatures it's all typing it's
a lot of fun I suggest it to anybody
who's in our community that really wants
to get involved we're going to be in
here playing every day and you should do
yeah it's one of those things where you
only can play so many moves every single
day so it's one of the things where you
just got to log in and get your like 10
minutes five minutes a game play in so
that you know you're leveling up along
with everybody else and the objective
which I've sadly never reached in all
the years of playing Lord is to of
course slay the red dragon and save all
of the people in the village from that
thing that's been terrorizing the
children by basically leveling up and
killing creatures in the woods and
killing there's PvP at the pvp server
you can play kill other people yeah
steal their loot don't sleep in the
fields out there you'll definitely get
killed if you just sleep there instead
of the hotel Shannon thanks so much and
yeah I I will be seeing you in legend
the Red Dragon I'm gonna take the star
