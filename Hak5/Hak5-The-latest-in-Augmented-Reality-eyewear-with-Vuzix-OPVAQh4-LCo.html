cyborgs we're looking at the latest and
augmented reality glasses the ultimate
tool for analyzing recovering and fixing
abort box 4g USB modems and Linux can
they play nice together hmm and whose
multitask datagram IP flow is making
Nets glow we'll find out all that and
more this time on hak5 this segment of
pack 5 is brought to you by domain.com
hello and welcome hak5 my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse shany more
chance sure i'm washing is you Tecna
what's up how you doing I'm doing it I'm
super excited we're going to derby con
that's right we are Louisville so I hope
to see you there that's the end of sep
tember the beginning of October should
be obvious I'll be planning playing the
part of vendor again I will be playing
the part of hacker interviewers Kitchell
otherwise beer-drinking Congo er are
there parties no this hacker con they
decided that they were going to do it
with all the alcohol the parties all
that nice wait for me Barry there's like
regimen oh no what do you think I me
like five people there yeah this is
really exciting it's their first one so
we'll find out I'm super stoked for it
yeah a very good vibe going into this
one already so if you're in the area
definitely come by say hi to us and hike
where's the match it is in Louisville
Louisville little bell kentucky kentucky
i think i drove through there once on my
way to North Carolina we're gonna get
some whiskey mom got it ok you can get
the whiskey I'm not getting whiskey same
sad things happens when I drink whiskey
I'll be there with a camera so look
forward to that just a few weeks ok
Piper heads dude also like ridiculously
good stuff coming around just the corner
here so very stoked about that and last
week you guys remember we were talking
about the case mod with ben heck and
here it is the wonderful case bought
this week we need your help went out
because that bad boy
that full ATX for under two hundred
dollars is killer and it needs it need
you to go over to revision 3.com / boat
and say yes okay i have to say that
thing is a lot more heavier than it
looks so vote for us cuz that thing was
killing my back when i was walking
around saying that's good it's about to
get a lot happier I'm doubling the
battery of the UH I'm doubling the UM
I'm not doing any more of that walking
around San Francisco window I'll go
downstairs starbucks middle bring it to
Der Beek on I'm putting the second
battery in it to double the lifespan
yeah okay well speaking of conventions
we actually got something in the mail
hmm I'm gonna need a tow mail me ta like
were you Marcus street number 39 371 say
okay so you hold me or you hold this
before there you go that's actually for
you so this is from David Hughes and he
basically sent us this all sorts of
stuff a sticker this patch and then the
t-shirt for this convention called last
con last con takes place in austin texas
from the friday the 28th of october and
it is the lone star application security
conference it's also going to be the
first place of they will be hosting
owasp which is the open web application
security project so it sounds like a fun
convention and stickers sorry we can't
go this year but now everybody knows
about it so I hope plenty well boom
there we go it's animal we need like the
bulletin board that they have at the
back of the University Senate where you
put the push pin up in your leg party we
need that here on the show yes yeah
maybe bumper or something but ladies con
but dude that'd be bad there you go we
have some great stuff kind of coming up
in just a bit I had the great pleasure
of talking to Clark tever you may
remember yeah what was awesome man we
spoke to lose that CEOs at CES yeah they
were showing off some pretty wicked like
a homeless a VR goggles because that's
so 90's but the augmented reality
glasses that they are these new ones are
pretty wicked I actually have one on
water right now I I had some ideas when
I checked out the the glasses and I
can't wait to see
I mean it's kind of a crazy story to
like 500 bucks but it's affordable a
screen and that do do you think about
what those were on the nine news I'm
going to leave my cyberpunk dreams here
in just a bit and when we get back I
know that you're diving into all sorts
of fun analysis and recovery yes oh it's
going to be deliciously amazing and fun
cool and then let's also not forget Dale
chase at the end of the a block with our
hack your headlines remix will see you
guys in just a bit like that yell today
guys we have the great pleasure being
joined by Clark Deborah hey how are you
mad then glad to be back there unless
I'm we saw each other was at CES CS yeah
we checked out some of your wicked new
products including one behind closed
doors a prototype you guys called the
Raptor or a see-through now you get some
see-through stuff is this the Raptor
that this isn't the Raptor this is the
star 1200 it's a little bit different
technology than the Raptor it uses just
a LCD display and then a beam splitter
and so you get fifty percent of the
light you know transmits back into your
eye but you can still see your
environment and maintain your
situational awareness whereas the Raptor
used waveguide technology and the
benefit of the waveguide and it's still
under development is it moves the
display engines to the side which gives
you a lower profile on the glasses
because when you look at the outside you
may not realize you know if we flip
these around here you'll see that these
boxes are actually where you know the
video signal is right and then that's
being projected down from above this
this area right here and it's kind of
like it tilted is it tilt a glass is it
in there yeah it's called a beam
splitter so it's a glass that transmits
some of the light through and reflects
some of the other light ok but this
essentially provides you the same thing
you put these on you see right through
them yeah yeah it's pretty cool like you
don't really see a whole bunch of stuff
in your field of vision so the so I mean
this is this is targeted at an
industrial audience or research audience
very like think tank oriented you know
it's a stepping stone product because
when the waveguide technology gaps
through then then it's like we're at a
pair of oakleys dude that's what
everybody wants are you kidding edge I
want that in my motorcycle helmet you
know I want to have like my tachometer
my speedometer and like GPS signals
telling me where to
off and you know thing telling me how
far behind the cops are oh that's
definitely the goal is is just the
incredible amount of materiality
applications that you can you can you've
actually got kind of a demo application
here it started on which is kind of fun
because we are now filming Paul filming
us but it's in predator vision maybe we
can get Jason Jason come over here Jason
ah come on you got a great shirt for
this demo looks like a turtle so great
anyway so uh so single webcam on here so
the idea of still doing augmented
reality with that as opposed to was it
the the room not the rap 12 on your body
wrapped 1200 AR when they have the SDK
for ya same kind of idea here except you
don't have to feedback what you're
seeing yeah because it allows you to see
through the the display you don't need
two cameras because we can just
mathematically figure out where we need
to display for each eye for it to a line
but with a video passed through device
which is what the rap 1200 AR is you
need two cameras so that you maintain
your sense of depth perception yeah but
it's not even just that like you've got
the two cameras but you also have to
you've got like a field of view like
this and that's that's that's no good
you know then you're then you're driving
like a Californian where this is repeal
hook you you know well I like to you
know I think that there's applications
for see-through and video pass through
they are because video pastor ER is
really immersive and so when you see an
object in 3d space it's compiled you
know it's combined with the video feed
so it feels natural and it's really
opaque yeah and with the see-through
it's a slightly different application
it's more you know what I like to think
of it as augmented reality in the sense
that you're taking data and you're
giving yourself new abilities based on
this presentation of data in your field
of view yeah like ability to remember
people's names and how to pronounce him
like I could put a box over your head
and have it like you know hit Facebook's
facial recognition software and be like
oh that's Clark you know and this is how
you pronounce his last name I don't know
yeah that is that is pretty wicked so
where do people get in on this because
that so you say it's for research on
them and yeah well I mean it's available
online it's the first see through a our
production model you know the first
view so musics calm / AR and you can go
and you can just order from the site and
it'll get shipped right to you nice
those are pricey though right yeah
they're about five thousand dollars okay
let's let's scale it down just a bit
this this is we saw a prototype of this
as well at CES this is finally out
there's one I've been waiting for the
rap 1200 and so tell me about this guy
so the nice thing about the rap 1200 is
it's a lot more adjustable than our
previous models it has a tilt adjustment
depending on your the way you're looking
at it and it's also has these
adjustments that allow you to change the
position of the display because everyone
has a different distance between their
eyes so this allows you to really tune
it in and you know so you have great 3d
you don't get any of that double vision
or anything like that so they support 3d
they support 2d video they plug into an
iPhone or get the sander get the same
music the universal music's connector
the is this right here you've got with
vga but you also have what i pod docks
and stuff like that yeah 30-pin you can
do composite video I mean really if it's
a video source we can plug into it and
you can get it and what's the runs like
on that I think it's it's a 16 by 9
version of SVGA ok so it's SVG a plus
yeah uh and it comes with a the VR
version the rap 1200 VR comes with a six
degree-of-freedom head tracker so you
can play games and you know what this
this has the USB port for it to write so
you just so what does that allow you to
do let's head tracker so the head
tracker I mean it really allows you to
do whatever you can come together we
have an sdk for the the product so you
can brainstorm something you could have
it remotely control a camera feed or you
could plug it in traditionally we have
support for a bunch of different 3d game
but it tracks your head movement the
idea finish your roll how does it do
that to that like accelerometer yeah
there's a there's a bunch of different
sensors in there that give you give you
a bearing you know you don't need to
measure the field of the earth and
because you don't need to wear the funny
hat and put something on top of your
monitor know if you have the reference
point you set it up when you first sit
down at ever you going to use it you
calibrate it so it gets rid of any kind
of drift that happens and then uncle
like calibrating the touch screen on
your old PDA
to like look up into the rain like all
these different places like exactly yeah
I mean straight ahead you press one
button you're locked in and then you can
go you know play a first-person shooter
and that's what I want to or honestly
I've been looking at those things since
like two thousand something and and yeah
it seems like that's finally so these
are at a much more palatable price point
too yeah these are about five hundred
dollars on the web right see now we're
talking we're getting into hacker
territory where I would like to start
hacking with those what kind of crazy
hacks have you seen and I mean in
addition to your predator demo yeah so
so with the video i wear especially with
the head tracking there's a couple
different spaces that I've seen I've
seen it in the real world people put a
camera on a remote-controlled helicopter
or plane and they fly their plane in
first-person make your mother watch your
copter with the camera on it yeah yeah
it's actually another hack that or
another a project anyway yeah AR Drone
ya go or well anyway I'll tell you about
it later there's this really cool
vertical takeoff and landing yeah it's
like it's whole totally sick anyway and
then there's some really clever connect
text that we've seen where people are
you know they put on the glasses so
they're in first person view not only I
mean instantly cool points I said I am 0
cool yeah I'm packing a Gibson well I'm
doing Gibson's are being hacked live
people it's all about the heavy metal so
right put it connect in front of me okay
the connect you know I can see your
skeleton city is my skeleton and we plug
that into the computer we can render a
3d space and I can be a character in
that and so I can put my hand in front
of my eyes and I have head tracking and
I will see myself as an as my avatar
whoa so so you could be in World of
Warcraft of course as a female character
yes of course is a furry this saturday
and there you go actually it only works
with fries I only works with parise
folks so you have to pick the right
monitors yeah all right that's wicked
dude and you're even chewing like a
somebody set up took it to the extreme
taking that as well as a wiimote in a
gun yeah to like put together first
person shooter that that's you've got it
all then you've got like the swinging of
your gun
the moving of your head with the head
tracker the video coming back from and
then moving your arms and limbs with the
Kinect it's like wow holodeck it's
happening it is it I was joking it's the
lawnmower men you know we've had to wait
an extra 10 years or so but ya know
we're getting their attitude just being
able to see through those that opens up
so many applications I'm sure so many
people watching right now have those
brilliant ideas if they have those
brilliant ideas and they want to start
hacking at your code you have like open
SDKs and stuff yeah we definitely do we
have an SDK that supports both the
displays and the head tracker and we
have code demos for for all different
types of uses soon can we get at some of
this country here sure I'm actually
going to release the demo that's running
with the predator vision and then I have
a bounding box version of the demo that
looks at the brightest pixels in the
scene and draws a little square around
them I'm going to put those both on the
heck five like that really so once you
get the square around the object it's
like all right you know fire the
missiles too sweet it's so great to
catch up with you it's so cool to see
the new products and I'm glad that we
got to play with them I know I'm going
to be getting one of these immediately
thanks so much for more information head
over to music's com we've got more great
technology including bunnies coming up
and first I'm gonna take a quick break
so it seems to be something more like
straight forward by USB rubber ducky com
oh no it should be more hardcore like
like tactical Assault ducks calm I'm
leaning towards for bramble human
interface device calm we got her curvy
