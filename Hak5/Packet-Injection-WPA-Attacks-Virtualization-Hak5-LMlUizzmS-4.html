City we're gonna be bringing you over to
Hoboken New Jersey in our favorite dive
bar to bring you Wi-Fi hack and
virtualization all that and more on this
episode of hack 5
this episode of the hack 5 is brought to
you by Squarespace
GoDaddy and Gamefly starts Lake of
course no no it's like this is his dance
his dance involves punching the air
always go punch the air in his sleep you
only know because you sleep with him on
tight budget trips we got to thank John
our buddy John there give it up oh boy
hell yeah for Hoboken we're here at DC's
in Hoboken which is pretty fantastic
small but you know it's one of those you
guys think everybody goes to this park
do you guys think Webster Hall felt I
mean there was like 18 hundred people or
something crazy like that like it was
crowded but there was never enough seats
for everybody I mean yeah well yeah well
the second floor is a little different
vibe you guys go down to the first floor
during the vacation shoot yeah yeah I
was just walking around and just
watching people just watching their
reactions I love it it's amazing when
you get that many people with the same
goal in mind this is a passion and I
know he's gonna be a crazy fan to come
out to a diggnation live yeah exactly
you know I just it was it was awesome
just like last year in school so yeah
definitely but uh but yes so yeah that
was what two nights ago yeah already oh
this trip is gonna be over too soon yeah
that's all right I brought I'm bringing
home a souvenir though
so during like when we were when we were
in the when we were upstairs or in the
green room okay and you guys know like
all that fun Wi-Fi stuff I was doing on
the car ride up well I just left it
running like the whole the whole show
well I got like I don't have a million
packets clawbacks
yeah I actually would have owned more
but the DHCP pool ran out like I would
made it like what is it I can never
remember a or C what Class C I made it a
Class C Network right so only 250 and I
only made like a DHCP address pool of
like 150 people right
and everyone's iPhone that pineapple
just sucked everyone in everyone's like
iPhone around like I kept on running
into like hak5 fans like giving them
stickers and stuff I'm like hey is your
iPhone on are you on your home tower I
hope that his windows mobile phone is
like stand it out at like you know looks
give me a revision3 guest yeah so so
yeah that was you were working on that
the entire way up well I did something
more than I normally do like okay so I
mean I have a lot of fun just doing the
pineapple stuff and I'm just getting
them to think it's their own home
network using yoga and you know connect
to their home network where they're
roaming and and just sniff the package
save it all to a packet capture because
remember Google or was on like couple
weeks ago and the moving scheme down
like hit off this pool delay I want to
write I really want to put that tool
through its chest the net-net witness
because I want to see like what because
it just like I wanted a ton of packets
to threat this thing and see what its
gonna really show me right like visually
like oh there's the ladies and the red
dresses and stuff yeah so I figured a
couple million packets from the
diggnation
maybe will look like scroll like all the
MAC addresses you know you know who you
are
this is your MAC address yeah yeah so
like I did a little something extra
though right
I brought my alpha awesome one like 500
milliwatts
USB adapter daily in backtrack 3 I like
for for some things but man backtrack
for anyway so I was running on air pone
you guys have used that heard of it no
so
I love the name first but it's kind of
been around for a while if came out like
DEFCON 12 so 2004 right and then there
was some updates in 2006 okay and
nothing since do that so the last three
years this project has been like pretty
dark yeah what it does is it allows you
to do like raw brain injection like raw
like if you've got a cool card like you
know like that
alpha which you've got real time chips
that we're like the atheros chip and my
EPC and stuff you can do what's called
like it's one thing to put your card in
monitor mode where you see all the Wi-Fi
traffic in the air which and other
things that just willy nilly just throw
some packets in the air say hey I'm a
such-and-such
this is two such and such you know
spoofing everything right and just put
your own packets out there
and if you can do that this cool tool
for air pone it's like built-in to
backtrack and so like you can see since
you can see all the traffic going
through the air you can see like an HTTP
request where somebody's like you know
trying to go to google.com right and
you're like oh I see the HTTP headers
and stuff right well if they're if I'm
close to you if you're like on your
laptop go into Google and like the
access points like over there or
something I'm closer to you so if I see
you doing the get request for it I can
reply back as posing as the router and
get and get and give you my HTML my my
images whatever faster than the access
point game we should we should just
post our little hack five logos
everywhere well that's one of the things
is um one of the examples that comes
with it is like you know like replace
all the images with puppies same
principles so it's a fun tool it'll play
with I was adding some like headers
stuff when you like at the diggnation
meetup I figured maybe do a little
self-promotion and put on the headers
when everybody goes to like if anybody
goes to a web page there I'm like the
iPhone or something
another thing that says you know mmm
packet who loves you packet act 5 loves
you packets you know check out hack 503
every Wednesdays at noon right and I
hope that doesn't like piss off anyone
that we with the packets a little
I wasn't
there's no bogging there's no you know
that kind of thing well no I logged all
the packet captures and I'm gonna run
them through the thing auditing looking
for stuff but the other thing is I don't
give a damn I'm not gonna like have you
know my way with somebody's pop3 account
right there aim account yeah I'm just
gonna around but under yosity
killed the cat though about to kill the
aardwolf quite possibly oh so um so
anyway they're the whole reason though
right that I like I mean this tools been
around since 2004 and Here I am like
playing with it now it's because um
who's been like all this time like out
of nowhere recent development an update
came out late last month and yeah well
it was a it's a new developer ok so
there's new maintain or taking care of
the project is open source and stuff and
it's it's coming under the wing of
remote exploit so the same people that
make like backtrack that new wireless
key keyboard logger dealer will play
that so I think it's cool that all of a
sudden it's getting some new life
version 1.4 just came out it adds
support for like more wireless chipsets
so like that's why I'm like crazy about
how Pharos chips and like the Alpha with
the real tax because those are the ones
that can actually do that injection
sometimes you have to use like old
kernels and stuff to get that to
work it's really complicated and
the point is that it's got support for
Mack 802 11 anyway some it's a Wi-Fi
driver set that supports like more chips
oh yeah potentially a lot more people
can play with this tool and have fun
without so do they have any idea how you
know frequent the updates are gonna be
is it just kind of you know this is you
know we're trying to play catch-up here
because it hasn't been you know
maintained for so long and then they'll
start you know doing additional Stoppers
is kind of like the blur
well the blurb it that blurb was really
short and I think it is kind of more of
a maintenance they're just bringing it
up to speed I mean the tool itself is
solid and awesome but unless you've got
you know specific are yes and specific
kernels since its requesting patches and
you know it's just getting it up to date
I don't know it's a good sign though
that it's under the wing of remote
exploit because you know they do
something equal tools very active like
forms and stuff there I don't know we'll
see I mean hopefully it's like they
start doing some like feature stuff now
I mean it's pretty solid as is oh yeah
it's really like you create these
filters we're like when you see this do
this so like when you see a request for
a JPEG send this you know so and it's
very likely you could do some really
ridiculous stuff but right so that's
what kept me busy in the car and adds
Ignatian pictures do you ever see so
many photos this trip yeah I guess it
looks ridiculous - it looks like it
looks like a like a like a spaghetti
monster all the cables and everything
it's an explosion yeah who said that
it's like my acer aspire one with a like
like a USB and Ethernet and more USB and
Wi-Fi dongles and pawn routers with
pineapple stickers and my cell phone
that's the whole thing is any more USB
ports I do I was running the entire
thing through my cell phone so I was
like serving up my a video connection so
much like the contest winner last week
yeah everything that you
we're doing is three years old yeah see
tie it in I bring it all together that
was the trigger that was it was or not
to trivia but the contest yeah well I
mean we call it it's on the script it
always says trivia because that's our
heritage spirited well cheers to our
purity this month LAN party is
counter-strike source will be playing
over at CSS dock 5 org on Saturday June
27th make sure to join us and get all of
your details over at hack 5 land
squarespace.com and I'd like to thank
our sponsor Squarespace
as you know Squarespace is the quick and
easy way to build a beautiful blog or
website without ever messing with any
code and over the last six months
Squarespace has grown over a hundred
percent may attribute much of that
growth to fans like you as a special
thanks to revision3 fans
Squarespace will be giving away an
iPhone a day for the next 30 days to
lucky fans all you have to do is include
pound Squarespace into a tweet to be
entered into the drawing a winner will
be chosen at the end of each day and
announced on squarespace.com and
twitter.com slash Squarespace
you get another email about
virtualization questions God so many of
those jeez yeah it's about five or six a
day no six but I think I think my
highest was like ten like when when the
latest episode came out it was just kind
of like oh god like I have one guy
who wants to run like multiple game
instances inside virtual I'm like yeah
it's like Game Servers like wouldn't
virtualization is perfect 99 not console
he wants to run the actual client inside
the virtual machine Oh like playing
half-life 2 in a virtual machine yeah
but I don't know why he that's like they
do it was a whole leg of email and I'm
not making fun of well what would you I
mean I mean what would you put your
finger down and say there's a definitive
answer on gaming and virtualization the
desktop virtualization there are like
DirectX extensions that allow DirectX to
pass through to the virtual machine and
stuff like that but not on like a like a
server product or anything like that
it's yeah there's virtually I mean
there's hardware acceleration to the
point yeah it makes the mouse smooth you
know you're not going to be running 30
frames a second inside a virtual machine
here it's not going to happen
yeah but at the same time there are
there you know questions like well I
want to run you know a system like
untangle which we briefly mentioned on
the show I'm gonna do this I'm it you
should do a segment on that well I mean
we need me on and you know I want to run
untangle I want to run an asterisk
server I want to
you know an ass box I want to do you
know whatever there's there's five or
six everyday installations that people
it just personalization is perfect for
and the reason it's perfect because
there are these appliances that are
already built dude I got the like the
the dim dim one yeah so it's not a gym
dim I was like showing my company was
like do white why are you gonna spend a
lot of money when you know hoping stores
goodness Dib dim awesome and I wanted to
get it right I'm like oh dude they got
because I wanted to like brand it or
whatever Rises like versions and
versions are going that I got some like
stuff now where you can just the hosting
and whatnot but um they just like that's
what they call it is a virtual appliance
I downloaded like a VMDK mounted it BAM
I had dim dim server I think I tweaked
like the Ethernet interface yeah I mean
there are those people they're gonna be
like I want to do it all myself well
that's good there's always gonna be
those people if you compile it from
source it's gonna run faster of course
but it's been all are you saying are you
saying - yours - Jen - no I'm not saying
- yours - Jen - oh but I will say that I
will say this the Jen - people are a
breed above most others yeah because
they can you know instantly think this
this this this this this this and this
needs to be in the kernel gonna go ahead
and do that all myself me I'm happy with
checkboxes okay could she get input but
but getting back to it there is really
you know the all these virtual
appliances you know VMware lists them
some of them on their website otherwise
you know untangle pfsense that's around
pfsense and untangle or you know your
router smash you run around inside a
virtual machine yeah oh this is pretty
all it is is network interfaces and your
virtualizing the network interfaces yeah
so i could like literally
emulate like like a cisco write like
something hardcore that i don't have the
money to like no you're you're just
you're it's it's not it's not that
you're doing that you're the the
hardware Nick inside you like you still
need an orange and a red
but you still but you just bind them
exactly the virtual machine all right
there's your you know and the nice thing
about it is you don't have five or six
small machines taking up because your
router you're you know you're nasty like
I'll leave our smooth wall and our open
filer for example could all beyond the
same virtual machine or a virtual
servant
kind of thing you know and okay maybe
you'll have a separate one for big Nash
because that's all I mean the whole
reason that we built the the whole
reason that we built our router the way
that we did like in the second third
third season um yeah yeah with smooth
wall was that we were like the goal was
to build the least like the most power
effective and it was a low-power chip
and if you look at that thing like I
don't know what uses eight megahertz at
any given time yeah maybe that's it's
it's it's when you have that many it's
it's a waste of power it's a waste of
space it's a waste of cooling the area
that kind of thing the room in the hack
house gets hot you walk into the our
closet downstairs like and it's sauna
you know so this way exactly
this way you can consolidate everything
that you need to have and then you know
per if you'll play with you know other
machines as you have there's no reason
that you need to put you know all these
things but anyway you know there's so
questions about bad questions you know I
did want to tell people that VMware
isn't it
we've mentioned this briefly there's n
there's hyper-v which is free with one
pole and I have been playing with I
forget the name of its the Sun mercial
bomb the VirtualBox says it's not a it's
not a server oh well for you know
playing around on your desktop it's been
alright yeah I mean like if you're doing
you know desktop virtualization you want
to learn you know you want to or what I
use it for right you know
I mean it's it's it's great if you're
doing desktop virtualization but the
server virtualization and people are
like well what about bare-metal
hypervisor what if you know I just do
this kind of virtualization well I
understand that but we're really talking
about is we're talking about the
consolidation of the entire
infrastructure to easily manageable and
cost-effective solution I mean that's I
mean that's like where your whole series
has been about the enterprise stuff and
I mean as like a guy that runs the
enterprise stuff half the reason isn't
that ok so the cost savings is what's
the bottom line that gets your boss to
sign off on it
and that's cool but what you want as an
IT guy is to not have a ton of frakkin
pizza boxes all that need their own
individual love you just want to look
good look through with rich you know I'm
saying and that's what I did you know
it's it's a single console connect I can
just skip between virtual machines I
don't have to have you know your crazy
number of remote desktop sessions that's
been you know I can pop back and forth
I can I can unmount the disk from one
server mounted on another without having
to copy like the data off the one and to
the other so cool so we're gonna do some
free stuff on Ohio yes from free version
Laurie stuff we're gonna we're gonna
wrap up the VMware and then we're gonna
take some suggestions and you know do a
little you know Show and Tell with the
QA so I've got literally hundreds of
emails that will go ahead and will say
ok this is a great one this is a great
one then we'll show the answer to the
question on the show and not just tell
you what it is but be like this is a
scenario this is the solution kind of
thing and we'll go that way I like it I
like it when our audience emails us yes
feedback ahead 5 or just you or me or
just forums blah yeah twitter twitter
yeah the Internet's awesome we should
just have hack 5 at the internet dot
internets yeah I wish there was Donnie
Internet's I can get down with some dot
Enis you know there's a dot after the
comma really there's another dot it's
the it's the it's the hypothetical dot
you mean the one that exists but doesn't
exist it's like it's like Gaia or
something
I'm just saying it's like the devil at
it what if I was confide we can drink
some beer yeah
round two last week's trivia question
was when was the first time that Matloff
stock appeared in anything having to do
with hak5
that was correctly answered by voodoo
torture congratulations fetus voodoo
said that Matt let's talk first appeared
in hak5
when he was on a YouTube video in July
4th of 2006 giving hak5 a $500 check
just for being awesome Buddha we're
going to send you some very sweet swag
from the hack shop and let me thank our
wonderful sponsor GoDaddy

slash contest
so you guys play with cow patty did I
when I was in Ohio I saw how they
actually like picked one up and played
frisbee with it yeah one that's good
times I think it's um it's called I
think it's called cow patty because it's
got WPA in the middle of it like Co WPA
TTY another TTY is a reference to like
the terminal whatever it could be yeah
yeah just like um like we've talked
about WPA hacking like back in the third
season yes three extra secrex just have
one of those and I did like air crack
and show you some brute force dictionary
based on right this is another tool to
do the same thing but more than just
dictionaries it can do rainbow tables
okay so much like we did our own rainbow
table of 120 gigs yeah this one isn't
quite as big you can't be nah
well it's interesting the way that they
put it together right so actually that's
made by a separate project you're
getting at the Church of wife I think
okay so it's like how patty right well
it it's a brute-force attack tool for
WPA PSK so not your radius stuff not
your enterprise grade stuff but the
stuff that we all have at home and lots
of you know lazy businesses they've all
been told WPA is more secure than WEP it
is it is easy drop right thank you I got
your that kind of thing so you know
while while it's correct the tools are
now coming available which makes I mean
that the tools have been available for a
while this one is another one that's
been around for a while but it just like
got some recent new loves at 4.5 just
came out it's got some cool new features
right that makes it a little easier and
quicker to do some things
I mean basically what the tool does is
is just snip up you just use your
favorite tool like arrow dump or other
caf
I think even kismet you can just sniff
up just like you do like Wireshark we've
been talking about a lot like wireshark
capture the packets over the Ethernet
same thing with Wi-Fi and like what they
are a dump you put your card into
something called like monitor mode okay
okay and like we were talking about with
with air pone special cards can go into
monitor mode injection do that fun stuff
if you've got a card that can do that if
you can listen to just like all the
wireless traffic in the air he's just
going through our brains right now
whatever I can't sir yes no my foil hat
no that amplifies it yeah but it's um it
you know if you can just see what's
going on in the air you can do some
really cool stuff so when you connect to
like your your WPA password protected
access point at home you do what's call
it a four-way handshake which is some
crazy Captain Planet stuff but without
you know hope and and that's our and um
and like within that handshake or the
hashes and everything necessary to
extract for the key out of that WPA the
difficult thing though is WPA is is more
to get a lot more secure than WEP
because it's salt ated
and we touched on this one when you did
that with lava crack was a lot is a USB
bootable yeah because there's another
one off anyway LM hashes right they
don't have the salt the sausage so the
salt is like okay my wireless network is
called Darren that's my SSID yeah okay
and my it's not if both of us had the
SSI or the same okay yeah we had the PSK
as lame sauce they would be different
because that what happens is you take
the password and the SSID name and
that's how you get the hash so that's
why you can't come up with like that's
what the rainbow tables are a lot more
difficult because because you're not
just trying to crack passwords at that
point you're then trying to crack yeah
pass
combination is this what I think it is
well are we gonna need salt because it's
alright that's fantastic do yours no no
don't do it
do intestine it's good it's good stuff
just it doesn't even know I actually
it's sweet it's sweet it's really good
come on oh finish it for coming down
oh whatever is that Charlie's fault
that's Charlie's fault kinda like get
through right there you know so yeah so
you're not just cracking the password
now germinating the password and put
together yeah yeah so but what the thing
is like the Church of Wi-Fi put together
a rainbow table project and you can read
more about it Church Wi-Fi I'll show you
some links to render man our buddy he's
got some cool stuff on a wave is a
combination it's a rainbow table
combination of a thousand of the most
common SSID names
so obviously links is gonna be in there
and your neck area you know whatever the
 they are you know and one quick
thing is there's a there's a wireless
manufacturer out there that actually
creates completely random default SIDS
really yes Wow well then I would buy
their product if I was a noob I can
remember it but I remember trying to fix
somebody's thing I'm like where did you
come up with this crazy ass you know
Wireless ID and they're like oh just
came like that I was like oh so your
SSID a thousand and most common
a million of the most popular right yeah
so you know the obvious stuff God sex so
true to why five badass for 40-gig
rainbow table set download a torrent
whatever or just get on like DVDs
whatever its surrender man
and so you snip up yours like arrow jump
or you use a header cap or you use
kismet to snip up that wireless traffic
in monitor mode and get that four-way
handshake and then you can you can pass
it to this tool with your rainbow table
and reconstruct and in Reverse the hash
and see what the see what it was right
well the password well what's gonna take
a walk I was getting that four-way
inching because you've got to be there
listening well nope not even that you've
got about their learning their inaction
mmm and you got to be there when they
connect so like if I was trying to get
Matt's password I'd have to be like
staking out his office that is like
corporate headquarters physically be
there and listen to it this makes it
easier because we owe to you we only
need the second where that's what the
new version okay so um like typically
with the with the previous version what
happened is you'd have to get all four
parts of the four way handshake
yeah and I mean to do that either stake
it out or you do a D off attack like you
did at the airport with the DS and you
give them recreate Andry handshake and
you're on or you bring the attack to you
so rather than me going to your office I
just talked to you I go down to the
coffee shop where I go to diggnation
with a pineapple and everybody tries to
connect to whatever they want and when
they do that you've got everything you
need
well what happens is okay so the cool
way to do it within four point five
version is you take like a shitty router
like take a ticket neck here right yeah
and give it its um make it a WPA
protected Network
call it corporate wire Acme corporate
Wireless right because that's what we're
trying to target and you make a WPA key
of you know
Kermit the Frog right right which is
obviously wrong right which is wrong
however it's available and just like
we've shown with like the yo cigar the
pineapple people at my coffee shop they
open up their laptop automatic or their
corporate network or whatever and bam
they try to connect to this now
obviously the password is going to be
 right it's not going to connect
but you don't actually need them to
connect to get the info glueing the new
version
you only need to the the first frame I
think and I'm not going to like put a
spreadsheet in front of you we're get
all our geeky with the H max and whatnot
but basically the first frame doesn't
include the authentication but the
second frame does third and fourth
actually awesome stuff whatever the
seconds the most important that's what
includes the hash that's going to
contain that password so you've now
brought the attack to you like you can
just go to the airport what like you can
wherever van pineapple post a P or a
