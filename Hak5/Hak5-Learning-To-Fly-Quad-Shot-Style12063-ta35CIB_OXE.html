by the Ford Focus Electric oh we've got
insurance for this right immediately on
my I've actually never done one of these
don't go what oh okay all right so we
will do some flying oh and just throttle
up the quad shot is standing a little
bit on this land so the right motor
starts cleaning up first and just give
it a slight bump then it will start
hovering so you can see chris's
controlling throttle and if you the
right stick if you move it to the left
and right the quad shot will move left
and right and when you move it forward
and backwards the quad shot will do
watch exactly that and on the left stick
you have your so if you move it sideways
you it will turn around and throttle it
will hover up faster so we will gain
some altitude now and look at ourselves
hello and now if you pitch forward you
can start flying on the wing let's go
over sensitivity first oh that's right
so you can switch the right switch
around and you get lower and higher
sensitivity of this stick so depending
on on the setting so too will be less
movement and three will be even mush
here so it is it is nice for beginners
to start with three on the right switch
f it nice and easy and slow moving and
if you get profession like Chris for
example then you can switch the mode 1
and then it will be very responsive so
now I think we can try to pitch forward
and do a slow turn around and make a
round
all done in mode 1 all down in mode 1 so
it is just pitched over a little bit so
because we think GoPro camera is on the
on the quad shot it it it has it easier
to fly on the wing because the mass is
off-center so now you see it is blinking
that means the battery is getting lower
and lower so now we will basically land
and we can replace the battery so we can
wait also longer and then you will see
that the quad shot will indicate much
more vigorously that it's that the
battery is getting lower by waggling it
swing let's see when that happens
and still blinking
it takes a while so we can look at
ourselves again hello
you see that the surfaces are moving to
control the flight to keep it steady
even in bright sunshine you see the LEDs
blinking
he's holding on yeah it's holding on on
a to its charge let's land of regardless
yes
alright so this night now we will take
off and gain some altitude and with the
left switch we can flip it over to mode
2 in and then you don't need to hold the
pitch deck on the right to keep keep it
forward it just wants to stay on the
wing and you now if you move the role
steak on the right then it will bank and
also turn around turn so it will
coordinate the turn for you so the only
thing you basically have to control is
the row and then you can fly circles and
have fun with it and if you want to gain
some altitude you basically throttle
ended up and then it will gain altitude
you may need to pitch a little bit but
or you decrease the throttle then it
will gently glide down
so she says no this is this would be the
mode to and we have one more mode that
is a lot of fun that is the mode 3 we're
going to
so now we can show you a descent on the
unint mode 2 by decreasing the throttle
and gliding down to the ground you just
coordinate the turn by just using your
right stick and then it glides down very
gently and then you can flip it into
mode 1 and it recovers and covers four
covers in one spot
and you decrease the throttle very
gently and mm-hmm very gently
Roche
oh just look like a good spot the lab
and it lands beautifully underground
alright so we will do another flight and
do some 3d flying just gain some
altitude and and it can rise quite
quickly and now we note one even you can
do some things and switch to mode 3 then
you have full control about the attitude
you can do anything for example a flip
and
and on the wing a hammerhead
arise and turn around you meet a Cuban
eight
whoops your skill now if you can also
how it usually realize how much doing so
basically the lea is getting out of your
way mostly but it is still stabilizing
the system so it is controllable now we
can hang loose outside loop
I guess nitrogen I fetch is pretty good
yes you can fly onto on the winglets
basically you and the pilots are giving
you some lift and it is knife-edge
wonderful backward flip and another
backward flip chip that Ian I guess and
try that's been
yeah you can do a lot of things sergeant
how did
still mode 3 now we switch into mode 1
now it stabilizes in level flight let me
show the mode 1 fast descent like gain
some altitude is that such a useful
thing to know yeah so we will show you
how to descend quite quickly in mode 1
you basically throttle down and pitch
either forward or backward then it
descends on the wing if you don't do
that then you may get reversal and then
it starts oscillating like that so don't
do that either descent very slowly and
gently or you pitch forward or backward
so that it's basically parachutes itself
down to the ground like this and then
you can level up
and there comes the landing approaching
for landing perfect
alright let's do some 3d flying with
come around yeah and gain some altitude
and switch into mode 3 there we go yeah
good yeah that was a wide loop do a
barrel roll what an aileron roll like
this tipping
Oh
oops
okay it's better out there that's inside
trying to make something up can you try
to pass by us yeah it's leaking another
photo photo pass plus the town- hello
wave to it wave it yay and again hello
hey blue gotcha typing I hope it will
catch it you can look at the video it
will be a lot of scatter I'm pretty sure
it was a very good shot though the other
thing you can do is Google mode 1 false
be sent right on top of us point it down
there you go yeah and you don't have to
all right good
yeah it's landed I guess mode 1 and
approach for landing
nice today we are once again sponsored
by our friends at Ford and we have been
loving our time playing with the focus
electric one of my personal favorite
things about the Ford Focus Electric is
that is compatible with the myford
mobile app and this is great if you're
new like me to electric vehicles it'll
tell you how much charge you have left
in your current trip as well as a map
with local charging stations so you
always know how far you need to go on
your current charge so you'll never get
caught off guard and can drive
confidently knowing your range now this
is just one of many great features found
in the Focus Electric tune in to future
episodes to see more thanks again to
Ford for sponsoring this episode of hak5
and for their commitment to technology
before we wrap this up it's time to find
out about the Technos photo of the week
this week's technolog photo of the week
is from Matt be who writes my friends
and I were recently at the TSA national
conference at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel
in Nashville we all brought our
pineapples and Alpha's and we had a mini
hackfest what that sounds like loads of
fun and many passwords thank you for
sending that in so much and you can
always send in your photos over to
feedback at hak5 org with the subject
line technol s photo of the week ah the
pineapple and the TSA that goes so well
together don't they and the little
grenade packs too you mean the plastic
pineapple that we used to a couple and
we actually have a whole box of those
plastic pineapples let's just throw them
up on the shop because there's fun as a
novel it's not a bad idea just don't
bring them on the airplanes yeah well
actually last time I got in trouble with
her in trouble with one I was just like
oh it's my novelty router they were like
oh that's so cute oh you're so adorable
you a little hacker yeah seriously
though super useful on the plane if like
one person pays for go glow like last
time I used it microphone pineapple my
phone paid for the gogo inflight and
then it was tethered as USB 02 my laptop
and everybody else's devices and
everybody else was like free internets
cool I like this just for the like
people around the seats the seats around
me you know just as for you yeah i'm
sure it totally violated why don't you
bring the yo-yo and just like screw that
on the middle they really that's what
that's what are you doing I'm just gonna
you know get on the airplane with the
yagi antenna yeah that's that's not
gonna cause any sort of problem no
problems at all alright let's find out
about this week's trivia so last week's
trivia question was in March of 2011
Android debug bridge was used in an
attack to install rootkits and other
malware from command and control servers
which prompted what kind of action by
Google and the answer is that Google
remote 58 infected apps from the android
marketplace and they remotely removed
the applications from 260,000 victim
phones
yikes this week's question is the first
Intel sandy bridge chips used what
socket you can answer that over at hak5
org slash trivia for your chance to win
some awesome swag swag from the awesome
hack shop swag box as we wrap up I want
to say as as we talk about the hack shop
and the Android debug all that other fun
stuff is we put this week I'm so stoked
about this is totally out of spec so
last week cause dude that awesome stuff
talking about the you know the ADB stuff
they can do found a phone and so it's
like all right well what are you gonna
do then get a micro us a micro USB cable
and then an OTG cable and plug them too
and it just gets nasty and why would you
do that why don't you just we're totally
freaking out we totally went and had
made basically micro to micro USB it's a
b2b connector it's got the pin 5
grounded so 20 TG does the charging in
all the division find these anywhere
well the thing is when women to
manufacture these were like hey yeah
would you ate the thin they're like you
can't do that why do I not well because
it's out of spec wise it's not expect
because the the USB consortium doesn't
want you to or something but dude does
the thing super happy it's I know I've
never been this excited about a cable
but the cause cable you know this into
your phone now uh no well is it plugged
into something else on the other end
