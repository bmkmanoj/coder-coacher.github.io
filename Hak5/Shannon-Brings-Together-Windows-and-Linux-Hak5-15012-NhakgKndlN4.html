without cramping your linux lifestyle
snubs reports on this hack five segments
this segment is brought to you by crash
plans so we all love Linux it's one of
my favorite operating systems by far but
depending on how you look at it
unfortunately it doesn't run everything
now as much as we champion open source
the fact is that we still live in a
Windows world and for many of us we must
find a way to balance philosophy and
reality now thankfully there are some
really nifty workarounds that will allow
you to keep your sanity while running
the occasional Windows program now I
know for example that Darin he really
has a love-hate relationship with
programs like Adobe Photoshop
Illustrator Premiere I mean come on
Adobe really you need to port your stuff
it's been way too long now today I'm
going to introduce you to several
options to run Windows programs on your
Linux machine or other workarounds that
are similar to that now first and
foremost is dual booting while you won't
be necessarily running programs in Linux
it does give you the option to use just
one machine now you still have to pay
for a Windows license and sacrifices
some of your disk space but at least
when you do need to run a Windows
program it'll take full advantage of
your computer's resources some like to
call it bare metal as opposed to say a
virtual machine now this obvious
annoyance here is the constant rebooting
as you have to switch tasks which can
get really really annoying now I feel
all you're looking to do is to get into
the occasional land party game this
could be the best solution for you now
personally I find it easiest when dual
booting when building a dual booting
machine is to install Windows first and
then Linux after that since I'm a fan of
grub instead of the Windows equivalent
and second is remote desktop if you have
a spare machine on the network and you
really can't beat the built-in remote
desktop in Windows it's called RDP or
Remote Desktop Protocol this has been a
staple for Simmons for years and the
same can be true for most desktop users
as well now plenty of remote desktop
programs exist for linux including the
one called romina remote desktop client
in a boon too so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you how to set up RDP on Windows
and Linux so I'm gonna start on my
Windows machines you go over here to
computer under your Start menu go to
properties and then advanced system
settings now from here you want to go to
remote and allow remote assistant and
connections from computers running any
version of RDP that's the last tab allow
connections from computers running any
version of remote desktop click OK and
then you're all set now the next thing
you want to do is open Romina RDP client
in Ubuntu so to do that I'll just open
up the - that's easy
Romina desktop client open that and once
it is open you want to click on the new
icon up here with a little plus sign and
add your Windows machines IP address now
if you don't know that this can be found
on your Windows machine by going to the
command prompt and type in ipconfig and
I'm sure you guys already know how to do
this but I'll go ahead and do it anyway
there we go so once you find it from
your from ipconfig you can go ahead and
go back to brim Mina on your Ubuntu
desktop and you want to go ahead and
leave it as quick connect if you want
type in the server IP address the
username and password so for mine
I'll type those in like I spelled that
wrong
I always spell things wrong when I'm on
camera and then you click OK a couple of
times and you'll log in and this should
work client resolution 256 connect
connecting
yes okay and it looks like it's working
there we go
perfect so now I am connected through
Romina remote desktop client onto my
Linux could be computer from Windows and
also don't do this over the Internet's
because it's not really secure so only
do it if you're on the same network as
both of your machines are now this isn't
exactly a great solution for gaming and
it might not be the best for streaming
video over proprietary yet convenient
platforms such as Netflix but if you
must run basic office or imaging
applications it's gonna do the trick and
it's quite well over a local network so
why not now number three is crossover
Linux this emulator is a commercialized
version of wine meaning you get a 14-day
free trial and it's non open-source and
it cost 60 bucks for one license but I
decided to try it anyway unlike dual
booting or virtual machines it doesn't
require a Windows license however you
still need a license for the programs
that you decide to run it is supported
right out of the box like for popular
stuff like office and Photoshop and ie
if you ever wanted to run that on Linux
god I hope not but you'll need to buy
those separately so I tested this with
ie since it's you know free but I swear
to god I would never use this actually
on my machine so all I had to do was
open
crossover Linux
and then I chose whatever application
- go ahead install now it installs
everything straight through the
application but once it is actually done
I'll do that later you just go to your -
and you type in Internet Explorer and it
gives you a brand new icon that you can
open up and run it on your machine so
it's very easy to use but again it's 60
bucks and I don't necessarily want to
spend that kind of money on a virtual
machine for Internet Explorer now number
four is running a virtual machine
VirtualBox and VMware are both very
common choices for a virtual machine I
actually did a comparison of these two
in hack tip number 14 now these will
enable you to run Windows operating
system and programs in a window inside
of Linux this may not be a great choice
if you're using a slower machine like an
older generation I three like this one
or if you're looking to do some gaming
but if you have an updated computer that
can process many tasks at once this is a
really good choice unlike dual booting
you can easily switch between Linux and
Windows apps because Windows will
literally b18 running in a window how
cute yeah not really all right
number five this one is wine and we all
love to worry about wine no I'm just
kidding and also play on Linux I talked
about play on Linux in episode 1215 of
hack 5 we actually went really into
detail about that and wine and running
that flicks off of wine it was actually
a lot of fun now wine stands for wine is
not an emulator even though it kind of
sort of is but kind of isn't and it
enables you to run programs in linux and
with over 20,000 programs said to work
in wine i do suggest checking out their
website for compatibility notes and more
and that's over at app DB y HQ org play
on linux which we also demoed in 1215 is
a GUI front-end for mine and I
personally really like play on Linux
it's very easy to use and it's lots of
fun
now my last one is Ruby or a live CD if
you really want to keep your Windows
machine and all of its programs you can
also install Lubuntu on a live CD or
live USB and boot from your USB each
time you want to run Linux you just need
to burn the ISO image to a disk and then
run your USB whenever you want to boot
into Linux now will be is a
--does installer for Mbutu desktop it'll
let you install a boon to kind of like a
program inside windows when you boot up
from your computer you have the option
to boot into Linux or Windows when it
looks like a separate operating system
it's actually just using a file on your
windows partition so now you know you
know all six of the different ways to
get programs onto your Linux machine
even though they don't necessarily work
on there and please don't use internet
explorer because that's terrible god
that's like I don't know that's like
your blasphemous right alright so
there's a website online it's called Hal
to geek comm they have a great website
first steps on some of these not all of
them but quite a few of these different
different Hal twos that you can use
personally for anything that you need to
do and let me know which items you
prefer to do which of the six steps is
your favorite and if you have any other
ways to actually get into your Windows
machine if you need be you can always
email me at feedback at hack 5 org and
we'll be right back after a quick break
I'll be using CrashPlan for years and I
never thought it would be this
enthusiastic about backups but let me
tell you these guys are doing it right
first of all all of your data is yours
and yours only and that's why CrashPlan
offers the best privacy guards using
bruce schneier open source and Blowfish
cipher you can generate and import your
own private key so it never is stored on
their servers and once more CrashPlan is
cross-platform try saying that it's a
cross-platform CrashPlan clients for
Windows Mac Linux even Solaris you can
see why I love it and coupled with truly
unlimited backups I mean seriously I
personally have a couple of terabytes up
in the cloud that you can see why I'm so
excited and I also really love that they
don't throttle so you know you can
actually get those terabytes up there
with the bandwidth that you actually
have it's kind of fantastic now the fact
that CrashPlan software is so flexible
it'll backup any file not just to their
off-site servers but even to your own
external hard drive I use that in the
band all the time I love it and two
computers friends get this or free so as
a hacker as geeks as IT professionals we
know the importance of off-site backups
and has hacked by viewers they're
hooking us up with this really cool
special deal you get their one-year
unlimited plans that are normally $59.99
a year which is totally reasonable about
five bucks a month but get this because
you're a hack five viewer and because
they believe in this stuff CrashPlan
comm slash hack it up and you'll get 20%
off so that's that's unlimited backup
for less than four bucks a month it is
never too soon to back it up so I highly
encourage you guys to take advantage of
this special offer at CrashPlan comm
slash hack it up and also stay tuned for
a very special webinar live I'm gonna be
partaking with CrashPlan on August 29th
so just stay tuned to twitter.com slash
CrashPlan it's time for the technology
of the week in this photo is from sudo
now he said yaa cigar doesn't always fly
but when he does he goes first-class
maybe he has some Jack and Coke maybe
catches up on his backlog of hak5
podcasts maybe gets belligerent to the
in-flight wireless users maybe place
some Sudoku
yah cigar is unpredictable like that
yeah Sega I love this photo that's
really cool and it's kind of awesome to
see you using a Wi-Fi pineapple on a
plane so thank you so much sudo for
sharing that with us and you can always
email your photos to feedback at hack 5
org and use the subject line technology
can find them super easy and show them
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
