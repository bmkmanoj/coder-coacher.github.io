and iOS Shannon reports on this segment
of hak5 this segment of hak5 is brought
to you by domain.com hello welcome to
hack 5 my name is darren kitchen and
this is a very special episode of hak5
it's still your weekly dose of technol
us and before we get into the awesome
show I really wanted to say thank you to

further adieu the show is coming up but
I wanted to thank you and remind you
everybody come out October twelfth if
you can't make it in person tune into
the live stream and we'll see you Wi-Fi
pineapple calm hit it
this week I decided to check out three
different Android applications so that
you can send secure text messages to all
your friends now these three apps are
called wicker textsecure which is by
thought crime and sure post so I decided
to do a comparison of all three to find
out which one is best and see which one
you guys like the most so my first one
is called wicker this one is a free
program that you can download a free
application on Google Play it's
cross-platform though so it's also
available for iOS and it lets you send
not only secure text messages but also
picture audio and video as well now one
really cool thing about wicker is the
fact that it lets you control how long a
message can be read on your friend's
phone so when you're ready you can say
hey I just want this to be read for one
day or maybe you know one hour even five
days it's all up to you you can change
that and customize it however you want
another nice thing is it's very easy to
use but one thing that's not so nice
it's closed source want one now that's a
big no-no for a lot of people especially
if you work around cryptography and
encryption a lot like we do it's a very
important thing for it to be open source
because how do you know it was made
right and how do you know if somebody's
actually encrypting everything correctly
now they state that they don't hold the
keys to your encryption and that
encryption is aes-256 NRH RSA 4096 TLS
as well now it does require you to have
a data account and if you do want to
download it you can go over to my wicker
com now I did have it on my phone right
over here so let me go ahead and log
into this real quick oh there's my nexus
4 so i'll log in real quick
and there we go so I just put it on my
home screen it's this little explosion
right here I think the biggest seller
with this is the fact that they say you
can actually make your well make all of
your different text messages explode or
disappear off of your friends cell phone
i think that's their their major sell
point right here so if i go back to it
you can see that i already friended
darren kitchen up here so Darren kitchen
personal you basically have to just know
their screen name whatever that might be
so i found a screen name and i can
actually search from within wicker to
find his screen name then i just add him
as a friend now once he's accepted he
appears right here and i can also
include his picture right here from my
own contact database on my an android
cell phone so if i click into him right
now i'll go ahead and do that i'm going
to be able to see everything that he has
sent me now Darren just sent me a
message on here so when I click on
Darrin kitchens name up here and you'll
see all your friends in a list i click
on his name and it shows me every single
conversation that we've had every text
message that he has sent me so if he
sends me a message right now Darren go
ahead and send me a message what's going
to happen is it's going to show up down
here and it'll show up with a nice
little lock button so this is my newest
message that he's just sent me up here
and it just says something silly okay so
there he's just sent me a text message
it shows up as a lock key I click on
that and it unencrypted sit so it says
banana how cute up here in the corner it
also serves you the little time stamp so
it tells me I have five days until this
actually disappears off of my phone so
it will disappear for good or at least
so they say and up here I can also
delete him as a contact now there are
also a couple of other settings that you
can do in wicker for example if you go
into the settings you can do secure file
shredding which means that you can shred
everything all the clean deleted files
off of your device it can also do a
session timeout so it'll show you how
long your app takes to actually lock you
out and you can change your self
destruction so whenever those text
messages actually destruct from your
android phone now it's time for tech
secure now textsecure is android only
but they do say iOS is going to be
coming soon it's also free and it also
lets you do text mms video audio
whatever you want now this one is very
easy to use it's also open source so yes
that's awesome definite pro now cool
thing about this is you can see you know
all the things on github you also have
the option to copy existing messages on
your phone into textsecure so basically
you all your old messages that are on
your phone currently you can encrypt
those inside text secure so that you
don't have any unencrypted messages you
can delete the original versions as well
now you can text non-encrypted versions
to non tech secure users but you can
also send encrypted messages to your
tech secure friends those users as well
it does require a text account so it's
not going over data it's actually going
over text and you can download this one
over at whisper systems org now i also
downloaded this one as well and i'll go
to my home screen now this one is right
in the middle so it gives you a little
it looks like a little text bubble so i
click on that and right now it just
shows me a regular boring screen you
know nothing really new about that now
if you want to add a friend what you'll
do is click on the little Add button
down at the bottom it looks like a
little messaging paragraphing so I went
to text Darren kitchen so I'll go in
here i'm not going to show you this
because it does show phone numbers and
i'll click on his phone number that i
believe already has him in their tech
secure database because he currently
uses this as well i'll send him a
message that says hi
and I will cover up the top of this that
you can't see his number but basically
it's going to show me a white screen
right now but when he sends me a text
message back it should appear under here
as well now Darren hasn't added me as a
friend yet but I have his phone right
here and what happens is it's going to
give him a little bit of a little
notification so I'm going to cover up my
number at the top I'll show you this
screen so it basically says textsecure
detected you have received a message
from somebody who supports tech secure
and encrypted would you like your
encrypted sessions would you like to
initiate a secure session so I'm going
to click on oops initiate exchange there
we go alright so now on his and it looks
a little bit different from mine down
here it says hi and then he can also add
customization so he can see my picture
and whatnot down there very cool and
super easy to use and the nice thing
about this one is it requires text
instead of data which can be a pro or
con depending on how you look at that
and it also lets you do text messages to
people who are outside of that but
remember those are unencrypted now next
up is sure post and I'll go ahead and
let Darren get back his phone so sure
spot not sure post that's a UPS thing
sure spot is Android only this one is
free so it's not on iOS unfortunately
now it does have text picture audio and
video support as well this one lets you
control whenever a message will be
deleted from a recipients phone as well
as wicker that's kind of a cool pro so
basically what's going to happen is
whenever you're ready you can just say
delete message as soon as it's deleted
off of your phone it'll also be deleted
off of your friends phone as well this
one is also open source but they do
except of course donations now sure spot
members will only be able to get the
end-to-end encryption you will not be
able to use this with anybody outside of
that because it does require data as
well now this one does create a couple
of keys a key pair that's
256 AES GCM with a an encrypted key
basically and you can get this over at
sure spot dot me so i also downloaded
this one on my home screen it just looks
like that little up in the corner so
i'll click on that and i'm going to go
ahead and initiate a session okay so i
have a couple of friends and here as are
ready if you want to add a friend you
just type in their name down here and
click invite at the beginning of it you
can also have friends take a picture of
a QR code that appears down here as well
if you don't know their actual screen
name so when a person is invited it'll
say invited next to their name and then
once they accept that will actually
disappear now when you go into your
friend's name so I'll choose hak5 Darren
so once it loads up you're going to see
any kind of conversation that you've
already had with them for some reason
there's a little camel down there I
still have not figured that out
completely but i'm sure i will in the
future so i can send him a message like
i'll send him a little message that says
hello
you
hello and of course Darren's reminding
everybody to go to feedback at hak5 org
to let us know their recommendations as
well Thank You Darren so it's also a
very easy one to use it's super simple
it's a little bit buggy I've noticed
whenever you're trying to switch between
different contacts there's a bit of a
bug in there but of course it is open
source you're going to run into that
kind of problem now and then now those
are my top three that I've found
personally I think I probably like tech
secure the most i know that's also
Darren's favorite as well and I can
understand why whoo yes exactly it's
very easy to use super simple it's fast
it's not it hasn't seemed very buggy to
me at all wicker would be my favorite
but it's closed source so I really don't
know personally how much data they can
actually collect from that and what
they're actually seeing now coming up
soon we'll have plenty more information
for you from the hack shop but first
let's go ahead and take a quick break
