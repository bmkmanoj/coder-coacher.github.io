easter eggs a corporate IT
infrastructure plan and our open source
free is in frost brewed beer to read of
the week all that and more on this
episode of hak5
this episode of high five is brought to
you by frost brewed Coors Light the
world's most refreshing beer dimdim easy
free web conferencing and the National

limit under arrest hey everybody welcome
this week's episode of hak5 I'm Matt
less stock I'm Shannon Morse I'm Darren
kitchen and we've got an excellent show
for you today however Darren you are
here not yeah oh no riding we're

Friday night yeah I can I hope to
structure it this way so that on Friday
tomorrow I would be on my way to the
Blue Ridge Parkway to get my camp and
biking and all that fun stuff on
motorcycles so that I can have the house
thought to myself that's not all just
into the hack house watch you it's going
to be interesting yeah very Boyer's to
community so why aren't you going I'm
not going because my rear wheels out of
a London because some douche with a
700-pound Valkyrie I think decided to be
fun to put his front tire on my back
tire and Percival we're stopping but
that's nice of you must fell off it
actually it kind of made me feel a
little good but no no mama no there's
the same pancake it oh it feels like it
feels like it's like countersteering me
when I'm going into a turn to kind of
almost feels like it's fishtailing very
very creepy so getting kind of a sick
feeling yeah oh dude it's that you know
in the cradle on the whatever it's
called the theme park thing whatever

other than being excited for Canada's
not much I've been playing with my
Kindle hey pictures work work yeah man
that's like work oh well let's get right
into it because we got an awesome one
going on and I hear that you're going to
be sharing with us a whole bunch
infrastructure goodness yeah coming up
we're going to be talking about planning
in infrastructure correctly not a whole
lot of show-and-tell today more of
logistics and
no design elements sounds cool it's time
once again for the open source free is
in frost brewed beer treat of the week
like USB keys by hate working on Windows
PCs you're going to love Felix this day
of small linux based bootable USB key
combines the power of the internet a
hard drive and a pretty GUI to free that
box from its oppressive blue screening
Overlord and let it realize it's true
destiny by network installing your
favorite linux distro Christ listen you
guys are going to love this check it out
at Felix not source boards how do you
get your beer cold certified check out
the project cold experiments at Coors
Light calm / project cold there's an
experiment section where guys have
created new ways to chill beer quickly
you can vote on whether their methods
are cold certified and share them on
Facebook there are also no you're cold
animations that give you tips on how to
get in keep your beer cold they've got
tips on packing for a tailgater fridge

ice bath with your washing machine just
in time for your labor day party at
Coors Light they've made beer their
policy all coors light cans are now cold
activated when the mountains turn from
white to blue your beer is as cold as
Iraqis
alright guys so here we are we're going
to kick off our network infrastructure
revamp kind of planning project whatever
you want to call it not really a
specific idea or methodology that we
want to convey what we're going to do is
we're going to try and kick it off here
and then go into more of taking your
questions in your feedback and roll that
into future episodes and segments the
reason this all came up is I recently
had to do a network infrastructure
revamp of my network from my
nine-to-five job as you can see here
we've got patch panels server redo as
far as wiring and cabling moving
networking equipment out of the the rack
and so on and so forth and before I
tackled this project yeah a lot of
people just want to dive right in but
there's a couple considerations that you
really need to make before you actually
start planning procuring equipment and
then eventually deploying it most of you
have to get it approved and things like
that if you have a higher up that you
need to deal with and they need to see
the value in what you're actually going
to be spending money on and there's a
couple big steps that need to be be
taken one of them is define your
business and design requirements you
know why is it that you're going to be
redoing the network why is it that you
you know feel the need to do this is
there a performance issue is there
security issue things like that define
the network assessment go through and
look at what you've currently got is
there are there things that you're going
to reutilization everything if so it
makes it a little easier because you can
do in production testing separate of
your corporate infrastructure if you're
doing a you know kind of a patch job
makes a little bit more difficult you
have two scheduled downtime with users
and make sure that people are aware that
you're actually going to be affecting
network performance and possibly taking
the whole bitch down infrastructure
selection you know we're going to go and
I acquired power connect switches
squeegee who is a frequent hack house
visitor he acquired Cisco equipment for
four times as much as the equipment that
I paid for it all depends on how much
are actually looking to spend in your
budget and how much you're actually
looking to spend going forward now you
may be able to procure you know dealt
equipment now and Cisco equipment later
it all depends now if you're going to do
that make sure that you take into
account what your actual growth or
expansion is going to be and plan
accordingly don't get locked into a
specific product or group of products
company whatever just because you know
price there something Cisco does great
and there are some things that Dell
those great you just got to kind of
really do the research and things like
that and kind of make your own informed
decisions once you actually have your
network assessment down the other thing
is your design proposal review you're
going to write up a budget you're going
to write up a design and you're going to
present it to somebody unless you're the
one making the decisions and
implementing the equipment in the event
that you're not making the decisions
somebody has to sign off and give you
the money to actually buy this stuff
it's very important that people who are
approving this equipment these changes
these modifications understand why it is
that they even need to consider this
because otherwise they're just going to
turn you down flat out and say what do
you want to spend fifteen thousand
dollars worth of money for my email has
been working fine my justification that
I used was we're having serious speed
issues and it was very cumbersome to add
new users to add new servers and beyond
that a lot of our servers suffer from
heat issues because there wasn't correct
airflow through the through the rack and
here's an example of what the rack
looked like and then this is what the
rack looks like now so as you can see
all the cables themselves are routed and
you know going back to you know why this
is a perfect example I can cleanly see
what's what I can
see you know if i need to replace
something now some of you were like well
where are your cable management arms let
me tell you something when is the last
time that you can honestly say that you
had to hotswap a fan and they do have I
believe hot swappable memory modules now
when's the last time you actually had to
hotswap something go ahead I'll give you
a second can't think of a time right see
that's the problem the cable management
arms that we had in place we're blocking
so much air flow that it was getting
recycled inside the cage this way air
flows from the front to the back and it
gets exhausted out the rest of the room
so from here you can see huge
improvement so these are a couple of the
design considerations budgetary
processing that you're going to need to
do if you actually want your project
they get approved we didn't really show
a whole lot of the nitty-gritty
unfortunately like I said I had to have
it done my boss was down my throat but I
will I promise I will take you to my
office one of these episodes here and
show you exactly what we did and then
we're going to go ahead and do a very
pretty kind of overview and maybe I'll
get Paul to do some 3d modeling because
I know how much he loves three 3d
modeling right Paul yeah that's what I
thought of network closet server room
things like that if you have your
questions please submit them to me at
matt @ h5 dot org almost booth that one
and submit them to me and i'll try my
best to answer them we do get a lot of
emails here so if i don't get to you
right away keep pestering me and I
promise I'll get pissed off to the point
where I will actually respond coming up
we've got Darren who is going to tell us
what's going on with this month land
party this one's laying party is Duty
for the PC
yeah that's what I thought I gotta take
moment you get the headphones on wearing
the hoodie your mother's basement cool
and play with us and get all the details
about future LAN parties over a hack Bob
land of squarespace com which is where
you can find out about our steam boop
boop for upcoming games or just find out
where we're playing game go high five
org Saturday be there we're gonna think
one of our awesome sponsors the national
fight against drunk driving listen
people alcohol drugs and driving do not
mix and the message is pretty clear
drinking and driving over the limit
under arrest don't put yourself or
others in danger police will be out in
force from august twenty-first through
Labor Day weekend cracking down on drunk
drivers beyond just putting your life or
mine at risk you could cost yourself a
bundle of time and money lots of drivers
license higher insurance rates and
dozens of other expenses attorney's fees
fines awesome towing repairs loss of
work the list goes on and on drinking
and driving is so easy to avoid go out
have fun this plan ahead get a
designated driver all a taxi take the
bus or rent a limo they're actually
pretty cheap when you split it up
between half a dozen people so Shannon
the Amazon Kindle yes while it may be
able to read the hitchhiker's guide for
the galaxy some maybe XKCD would
actually argue that it is the
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy it
definitely has a couple of interesting
little qualities to it hmm the the
proverbial device you buy once and has
internet for life that just makes it's
wonderful free internet yes like if I
was homeless I would just need this and
I could check my email every day for
free well so we can do more than just
check her email that right yes one cool
thing that I figured out you can do is
hit alt shift em and you can play a
little bit of minesweeper oh yes you can
play minesweeper on the Kindle who would
have thought that you can play a video
game on here that's so interest crazy
they're going to start putting computer
internets on the video so cool and then
you go back to the homepage and you hit
the browser and you can do google maps
mm-hmm
hmm yeah my one computer couldn't do
that I just play the mines me it's very
cool you just hit the browser and then
you hit alt one and you can choose Oh
two or three to hit restaurants or gas
stations that are nearby important
things you need to know about when
you're very very entry way what we're
doing with the home gas stations gas
stations when you're not some all my
cigarettes all right okay free stuff
okay free books very cool there's one
site that i really like it's called mini
book scott net there's tons of free
completely open free licensed books that
you can choose from there's thousands of
them so you can get your hands on back
yeah so you don't necessarily have to go
to the Amazon store to buy times and
tons of different books you can just
browse the web for free open license
open license things gotta love that
stuff also you can't read PDFs on this
thing so you have to get a PDF converter
it's very very I know it's so sad but
there is this one cool cool tool called
mobile pocket creator which you can
download for free and you can convert
all of your favorite PDF so you can read
even like text books and articles that
you've created you know stuff for work
whatever you want or you can send your
Word documents Excel documents and PDFs
to name the at free kindle calm and they
will email you back the kindle file so
that you can read all those documents
right on here you just have to transfer
them that giant zip file you got from
birthday yeah you just stick them all up
on your like eight gig SD card that you
have in the back of it and there you go
your best way to do it it's wonderful
also from the browser you can choose to
read your email you just go to like em
gmail com if you aren't gmail yes you
can't do other emails here okay
hopefully everybody is on gmail because
well what else was another ones I don't
know your own but you can actually read
if you've got a pop3 account you can
actually read it with Gmail it'll suck
it right in that's true and they've
you're right md gmail before i had a
proper client on like my smartphone that
was I mean it's a pretty damn good
mobile site right far as mobile sites
are concerned and you can also check out
the google reader in mobile mode and
your calendar i I didn't know you could
check out your calendar all the kindle
but that's so
cool to me because I have tons and tons
of crap on my google calendar and it's
very important that I can always see
that thing I'm also i found out that you
have to pay for certain blogs and news
articles yeah complete boo I know so go
to Kindle feeder dot-com and you know
check out TechCrunch and gadget and
every single website that you'd ever
wanted to eat read all those feeds
everything you can get them for free and
then we can get to google reader you can
get to all of your feeds there you go
it's excellent well I pay for what could
be dirt cheap it wasn't run by a bunch
of profiteering gluttons mm-hmm SMS and
instant messaging this is pretty cool
you can actually inst SMS your friends
just use the 10 digit cell phone number
and then email it to the correct gateway
which for example AT&amp;amp;T is the tangent
digit cell phone number at txt AT&amp;amp;T net
and then it'll automatically transfer a
text message to your friends on their
cell phone right there are a bunch of
these email to SMS gateways and I've
used them in the past for all things
like more sequel server is failing
alerts well lets them all on the show
notes there's a one for verizon one for
a tmobile i think there's one for
everyone pretty much hmm and then you
can also do yahoo instant messaging with
yahoo messenger for all the 10 people
the 10 whole people who want to use that
on the kindle can do it now there we go
actually own a kindle because nobody
wanted but you know of as i was properly
developed it could potentially also run
IRC I don't know something to look into
all right now let's see if this pulls up
a good one yeah see there we go okay so
this is one of my favorite things that I
just figured out how to do this is the
picture viewer well this should be a
screen saver that generally comes with
some weird picture of an author musician
or something that you've never actually
heard of so I decided to put my favorite
anime photos on it pretty easy process
to do all you do is plug in your kindle
to the little micro USB dealy mini USB
port and then you open up your kindle to
the root file and you make a little
picture folder and then inside the
picture folder you make another folder
code called i'll call it anime pictures
and then side of the anime pictures
folder you put all your pictures inside
of there as many as you can
there's only like I don't know 500 Meg's
available on this thing but you can also
put them on your SD card so you your
eight gig SD card how does he show up on
the device well you go back to the home
screen Paul and then from the home
screen you hit alt Z to refresh it
mm-hmm mine's not refreshing you crashed
it there you go yeah and sometimes that
does happen actually so you hit alt Z it
refreshes the whole list of you all of
your books which you got for free from
many books net of course and you can see
that I have a folder nail called my
pictures hmm yeah so I go up to it open
up my pictures and I can browse through
all of my photos oh it's lovely and then
I just hit page back and page forward to
go through all the photos and then if
you decide that you find one that you
really like you just hit alt shift 0
mm-hmm so i'll hit that and it says this
picture has been exported to the
screensaver whoa so you can like
customize your yes sir we do you can
customize it yay oh but I'm your
lightning saver on epaper or e yeah I
was correct so y'all look at the photo
is it here we go bot so um so do any of
these work with the kindle too yes the
picture viewer does work with the kindle
to as far as i know i don't have one so
i haven't been able to test that so
there's this kind of cool little hack
that I found online for the kindle to
where you don't necessarily have to use
whispernet you can tether the kindle to
via USB to your laptop or your computer
and use the computers internet on the
kindle i remember doing something just
like I would my pocket pc that i kind of
wish it was vice versa yeah that's what
i really want yours whispernet in the
laptop because that would be amazing but
sadly it's not yeah so that's and there
we now what we hands on my mac addresses
i'm sure that there's tons and tons of
other hacks out there but I haven't
found them yet and I really want to find
some more stuff for this thing because I
know I know that there's other things
you can do um oh we've got some other
stuff in the works but we do but our
keep that secret until next next episode
