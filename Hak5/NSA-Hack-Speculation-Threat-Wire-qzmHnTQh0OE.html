fall prey to malware and a TCP
vulnerability is found on many Android
devices all that coming up now on threat
wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse and
this is threat wire for august
twenty-third 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom make sure to subscribe
to our YouTube channel to get all of
these shows before anyone else and check
out our patreon to see how you can help
the show grow that's over at patreon.com
/ threat wire onto the news first off of
course the NSA on monday of last week a
hacking group called shadow brokers
created an auction for cyber weapons
made by the NSA or at least that's what
they claimed the group said they had
stolen several programs used for cyber
espionage from the NSA hacking group
called the equation group shadow brokers
released a public file showing many
documents from the NSA programs as well
as an encrypted file that could be
auctioned off once they hit 1 million
Bitcoin after a few days of controversy
on whether or not the auction was for
real NSA programs evidence showed up
claiming that it was indeed real an
agency manual instructing NSA ops to
track program use with a string of
characters which also appears in the
code shadow brokers released the code
seems to be tied to a program called
second date which is said to infect
millions of devices worldwide with
malware which allows communications to
be sent back to NSA servers Kaspersky
Labs also delved into the publicly
released data and found strong
connections between the programs they
had already found and what shadow
brokers was releasing to further prove
the theory that the data is actually
real cisco announced that one of the
files from shadow brokers hack was
actually a zero-day product flaw in a
cisco product that had gone undiscovered
for years wearing many because that
would mean the NSA was holding on 20
days without disclosing them to
manufacturers so companies like Cisco
could actually secure their products so
how did they hack the NSA if it is
indeed true well no one knows for
certain unfortunately but some suspect
that shadow brokers hacked an NSA
staging server we also do not know who
the shadow brokers group is
other than a little bit odd it's odd
because a normal hack of this size would
usually be sold for thousands or
millions of dollars not auctioned off
necessarily Edward Snowden believe them
to be involved with or in response to
the hacks of the DNC or the Democratic
National Convention and similar recent
breaches to Democratic data and
suggested that it could be a warning
from Russian hackers to US officials
Snowden suspects again Russian
involvement but this has not been proven
what we do know now is that more and
more data is coming to light showing
that this seems legit and as more
information is reported we will share it
on threat wire as well as on our social
networking feeds I would probably be
playing pokemon go right now if it
weren't for the fact that there are no
poka stops where I work it's highly
unfortunate and I would definitely be
catching me some Pokemon right now if it
weren't for that case but if you are
playing pokemon go right now do not be
fooled by an SMS message offering up
thousands of pokey coins for clicks on
links this should be a no duh but
apparently it's not over the past
several weeks attackers have been
sending malicious SMS messages to mobile
device owners in North America offering
them just this polka coins the site
links usually ask the device owner to
share the link with their friends to get
the polka coins which ends up with more
spamming some sites asked for Pokemon go
login credentials to deposit your coins
which means that you would be going up
guess what your google account
information attackers are also using
ransomware written fake pokemon go apps
for laptops and pc's to encrypt files
until you pay to get them decrypted so
to all the pokemon go players and to
consumers in general be extremely
skeptical of any links in SMS or any
apps that pretend to be your favorite
game a major vulnerability was disclosed
just last week that affects 8 out of 10
android devices allowing an attacker to
cancel a connection or attack traffic
between two hosts over tcp or also known
as the transmission control protocol
apparently this flaw has existed since
2012 on linux systems due to the way tcp
is implemented on those machines the
entire research on this molnar ability
was closed in paper by the university of
fornia Riverside and US Army Research
Laboratory it's called off path TCP
exploit global rate limit considered
dangerous so a patch for the TCP problem
has already been pushed to the Linux
kernel but of course over the air
security patches for mobile devices tend
to take a little bit of time to be
distributed through their carriers this
attack over tcp would require a thief to
identify both ends of the transmission
so they would have to know a point a and
A to point B and it takes advantage of
the regular global rate limit time for
TCP packets to be acknowledged and then
responded to by a host until the patch
makes its way to your device you can use
a VPN for communications to better
protect your said device thanks again to
all the fine people who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow and in return this
is the really cool fun part we're going
to build an RSS for you and when we
reach our next goal we will bring on
another episode every single week we
might even feature you're adorable fur
babies like this new one super cute
puppy makes four months old four months
old so cute in an upcoming episode so
send us your fur babies I think they're
adorable check out the perk levels on
patreon and thanks again for helping us
keep this coming completely independent

favorite social media page use the
hashtag threat wires so that we can see
it and with that I'm Shannon Morse and i
will see you on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
