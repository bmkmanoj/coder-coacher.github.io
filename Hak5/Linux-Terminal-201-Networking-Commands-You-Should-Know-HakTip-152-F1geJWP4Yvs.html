bitbucket by Atlassian welcome to hack
tip the show will we break down concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas before I get started don't
forget to hit the subscribe button if
you are watching this over on YouTube so
you get to see all of our new hack tip
episodes I am super excited we have tons
of episodes lined up for you in the next
coming months so make sure you subscribe
I am your host Shannon Morse and today
we are talking about viewing networking
information via the terminal okay
networking is the bane of my existence
something is always going wrong with
online networks and if it's the fault of
your ISP or whether chances are you
can't do much about it and then you're
kind of out of luck but there are some
handy commands in Linux that can help
you keep an eye on your network and fix
any kind of issues that might pop up
internally either on your computer
either on your computer or on the
network itself now if you are new to
networking keep in mind that the IP
address is your Internet Protocol
address that specifically divides
defines who your computer is on the
network it can be a 32-bit number like 1
7 2.15 3 8 12 or something like that on
ipv4 or a much bigger number that would
be a hundred and twenty eight bits for
ipv6 now I've dug deep into IP is on
hack tip episode 125 so refer back to
that episode for more information and
I'll put that link in the show notes so
you can check it out and learn a bit a
little bit more about networking if you
aren't familiar now your host and domain
name are what the computer converts the
IP address into so it's easily human
readable like hack 5 org
ww hack 5 org and the URI or the Uniform
Resource identifier encompasses URLs and
you are ends now let's talk about these
commands let's get right into it so
first off is pings this is one of my
favorites I use it all the time p ing
this can be used to send an echo request
to a network host this is really great
if you want to check your network
connection just in case you think that
you're offline I use ping 8.8.8.8 all
the time and
you'll see that running now this just
pains Google servers and it keeps an eye
out for any packet loss now we have
discussed echo requests and replies
during my hack tips over on the
Wireshark series so refer to that
playlist for more and again I'll put
that link in the show notes so moving on
with peeing this is going to give me a
default byte of 64 bits and you can see
that in it looks like the first line
right here and you'll see that
continually going on this is small
enough of a packet that it's not going
to cause any kind of fragmentation
issues and then you'll see the IP
address that I pinged the ICMP sequence
number and they should be in line as
long as everything's good the time to
live in time and milliseconds that it
took for the reply at the very end if
you want to make this stop just hit
control-c and that is going to end it
and it's also going to give you some
information down at the bottom you'll
notice at the bottom of my screen which
if you do see any kind of packet loss if
it tells you that you had a certain
packet loss down here it can signify a
problem with your network connection now
ping is also going to keep going unless
you stop it just like I did or you can
add ping
taxi for or whatever number you specify
8.8.8.8 and if I let that run it will
only go for sequences and then it will
stop after that because I specifically
told it just go for times now I want you
to check out trace route or trace route
and depending on who you are I like to
say route so that's what I'm going to
say trace route and then I'll put in
agent loser detour route no more dots
this is going to show you all of the
hops through different routers that your
packet has to take to get to the website
that you are trying to ping you'll
notice that it's quite a few different
sequences and there's lots of jargon in
here which we don't necessarily need to
deal with trace file shows me 13
different routers that I had to travel
through to eventually reach Google ID
you see identifying information for most
of them but for private ones I'll just
see a star star star for example right
here you'll just see that star star
it might be behind a firewall or
something like that but nevertheless
this router or this this ping that I
sent out for some rated reason when it
hit that network it was private I also
see three millisecond times for each one
right over here for example right here
and then you next to it you'll notice
one two and three so I have three
different millisecond time intervals
listed for the same hop showing me a
sample of how long a packet is going to
take to get from the router back to me
now try these out with some different
IPS and you'll probably notice some
different intervals of times for
different IPS that you try to ping and
we are going to have a bunch more
examples about networking right after
this break let's be honest your code is
your world you create it you tweak it
and you lovingly obsess over it every
single day so picking the right
repository management tool is
super-important only the best for your
code right that's why the team at
Atlassian created bit bucket vic bucket
is the git solution for professional
teams helping over five million
developers build with a purpose the
bucket gives teams of all sizes free yes
again I did say free private
repositories with state-of-the-art
features like the world's best pull
request algorithm built in continuous
delivery and integrations with your
favorite tools like docker which I know
a lot of you guys use out there AWS and
as your plus you will get JIRA
integration since it is from Atlassian
giving your team everything you need to
take your code from concept all the way
out to the customer we have used bit
buckets to share private code and collab
on it so that the code is perfect before
we release it into the wild the bucket
is for the code that takes us to Mars
it's the code that decodes the human
genome or drives your next car maybe
it's for your next InfoSec tool visit
bitbucket org slash for the code to
start your free account
that's bitbucket dot org slash for the
code tribeca today what will your code
do we are now back with more networking
now we're going to try to run a couple
of different commands first off let's
try this one net stat tak ie
then hit enter this is going to show you
your current devices network status and
settings
over mine I see two different ones
specifically because I'm just using well
two different ones at the moment if I
plug in Ethernet I would see a third one
but I'm just using Wireless at the
moment so one of these is going to be
Wireless
that is my WL P 58 s zero and then
another one which commonly is referred
to as eth0 would be Ethernet in my case
Ethernet looks really funny it's a long
digit string of random numbers and
letters so keep that in mind for newer
Linux devices the other one that I
wanted to point out though is this top
one that is called low or loopback
interface so this basically means that
the computer uses it to talk to itself
if you disconnect any of your interfaces
though the IP address listed is going to
disappear you will notice for each of
these you have some kind of address
associated with the network interface so
in my case down here I have this one and
then for low or loopback I have this one
which that is not going to change at
least as far as I can tell it has not
changed the wireless one though
potentially can depending on what
network you're on if you choose to
disable one of these interfaces it will
cease to exist in netstat so if you run
that command you will no longer see it
in the list if they are working and
connected you will see a valid IP
address like I mentioned earlier and
check out other netstat commands with
next at tach help so that's that tactic
help and you can also type in man net
set to see all sorts of different
protocols and commands and everything
that you can use with it also PS I did
want to mention ifconfig because I know
everybody will if I don't mention it too
in iwconfig that's coming up later but I
have config I have config tak a that's
the first one I wanted to mention this
is going to show you very very similar
results lastly for today I also wanted
to mention using the host command define
your IP address of a hostname so if I
wanted to find Google's host or Google's
IP address for their hostname I could
type in host wwm
enter and it will show me their ipv4
address and if they have ipv6 it will
also show me ipv6 you can do this via
vice versa - and show the domain name
instead so that's pretty cool a little
additional thing that you can do there
in case you're looking for a specific IP
address now thank you again so much -
bitbucket we have a bunch of hack tips
heading your way so make sure again to
subscribe to our YouTube channel it's
youtube.com slash hack 5 until then I
want to hear your feedback comment below
and let me know what kind of network
issues you've run into and how you have
fixed them in the command line interface
I think that would really help a lot of
our other viewers out there who may have
run into similar experiences or problems
and be sure to check out our sister show
hack 5 for more great stuff just like
this and again check the show notes for
any additional emotes and I will be
there over on hack 5 reminding you to
trust your Technol us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
