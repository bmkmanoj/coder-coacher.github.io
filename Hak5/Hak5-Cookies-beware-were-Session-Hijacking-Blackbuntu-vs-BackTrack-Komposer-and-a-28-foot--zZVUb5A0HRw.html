session hijacking time then Darren
reports from Chicago with a 28-foot
multi-touch bar plus websites made easy
with composure a backtrack versus black
bun to review and a whole lot more this
time on hack 5 this episode of hack 5 is
brought to you by fresh books online
invoicing domain.com your next big idea
starts at domain.com and go to assist
express support smarter with GoToAssist
express hello and welcome back 5 my name
is darren kitchen and this is the show
where I walk into the frame from right I
believe that's right yeah may be correct
yes we got a great show for you guys
this week because man did we get a ton
of awesome response from the last
episode so we've got more
man-in-the-middle goodness with sniff
enough passwords to own sessions stuff
like that biases do check this out
I was just in Chicago for a day trip
yesterday dude this is insane I flew out
in the morning got to Chicago I was
there for like like three hours and then
I got back on a plane and came back but
you know I know but in a couple of hours
that I was in Chicago at this conference
the automate 2011 conference which was
really cool is about like automation and
like robots and stuff dude I saw this
the sickest robots you've ever seen
these things are like crazy industrial
things the largest industrial robot I
guess known to man or something was
there on display the head ones on
display there that were like building
cars they had a robot that was building
another robot yeah and all these like
crazy and like all these arms and stuff
like totally looked like something out
of portal yeah of course we're not
I know seriously there was this one that
had like this hand came out
one of them was like changing its arm
like I had detachable arm and it was
like kept on changing what our Matt had
on cuz had different tools on him and
then the other one kept on going with
like this claw and like have like
cameras on all these different things so
one would be like drilling something and
I'd be like checking the work on the
other one that was really creepy
I love it but of course we're not here
to talk about robot arms that I was
actually I flew out there to talk to
Aaron bitly remember him yeah okay so
yeah yeah we did the multi-touch table
with it yeah he built like multi-touch
tables he did one for us he went on the
show it things like season six or
something and as you see he's like great
at it and he's like homebrew but now
he's working for this company doing them
and he they've come up with I think
they're calling it the first ever it's
like a it's a bar but it's like in a
c-shape so it's like the first time
there's a written multi-touch bar that
actually wraps around and it's really
crazy because there's like eight
displays and it's totally sick hotty
totty Club April seconds heck I party
shuffleboard ooh
they were they were gonna hook it up so
they could play pong on the other things
yeah and like you could like maybe in
the next version I was saying like it'd
be cool if you could like buy the girl
at the end of the bar a drink with it
yeah yeah I'm get him a Ramos fizz party
this party April 2nd at the hotsy-totsy
club here 7 o'clock in Albany California
which is in the East Bay right next to
San Francisco in the Bay Area and
there's a BART station like three blocks
from that yeah so it's like it's like a
half mile or something come on out and
yeah we're gonna have dual core and
daily chase yes ssl provider Komodo is a
hack allowing the attackers to obtain
secure certificates for Google Yahoo
Skype others Komodos claiming that this
sophisticated attack must have been
actually state driven against their
european provider european european
provider their own incident report
actually points out that the IP
addresses were from a well from iran and
while simply obtaining these search
I guess don't allow anyone to don't
actually make the sites vulnerable it
would allow someone to sniff passwords
read emails and things of that nature if
of course you were and impersonate these
legitimate sites if you were the man in
the middle which you could do if you
were say Iran and you controlled the
nation's telecommunications
infrastructure
category the RSA SecurID systems have
been hacked
yes the secure ID is a tool that
authenticates by having you key in a
password but it also has you key in a
series of random numbers a few days ago
the tool sent out an email to its users
saying that it was a victim of a hack
that extracted certain data from the RSA
system the data that was directly
related to their security two-factor
authentication tools yeah this affects
like a lot of customers and they've been
saying that it wasn't a directly
targeting towards the actual
authentication mechanism but it's like
full disclosure they have to you know
because that's what they do they do
two-factor authentication they have to
tell their customers so I don't know it
kind of makes people's confidence waver
and that's the thing so they said that
it's not that bad but make sure you beef
up your security company yeah make
stronger pranks guys because obviously
just another person saying that is
really going to get people to change
their passwords okay so check this out
say you wanted to build your own Stuxnet
like worm and attack SCADA systems well
now your job for that could be a lot
easier security researcher Luigi ARIMA
ARIMA I'm that lower third I am so sorry
basically released a proof of concept
code for 34 vulnerabilities affecting
scattered systems found in Siemens
iconic 7 technologies and dat ACD ATAC
basically the code released through bug
track mailing lists doesn't affect the
backend systems but merely the operating
platforms however this could allow an
attacker to potentially crash systems
retrieve sensitive data or just dig
deeper into the network hey you know the
Nintendo 3ds is out right I'm excited
about that
all right so you can go over to your
local retail
demo I think its pilot wings or ever it
whatever 3d game is out yeah I'm excited
about pilot guys that's cool
so yeah the demo units they've been
available to play in stores but they
won't let you check out the menu or the
specs underneath the games that ought to
play on the devices which kind of stinks
cuz I totally want to see how the menu
sets up and stuff luckily there is a
nice little hat to let you get into the
main menu and see what lies beneath
inside those awesome new toys so check
out the link and give it a try mmm guess
what else you can give a try you can
find out if say your ISP or your
government is messing with your data yes
in the wake of the internet blackouts at
egypt and libya basically Google is
announcing awards to at least for at
least a million dollars to Georgia Tech
researchers who are working on tools for
web users and users of smart phones and
tablets to detect whether your ISP is
actually adhering to service level
agreements or of data is being tampered
with that's seems to be like this is in
the news a lot huh alright well I don't
know about you I kind of have like
kittens what kind of kittens I love
keyboard kittens you know what else I
love I love the hack tip this week's
hack tip comes to us from Gary websites
always make you log in with a username
and a password which is great but when
you're logged on to their pages all cozy
in London you're browsing in securely on
a regular old HTTP site HTTP session
hacking called sie jacking happens when
an attacker gets the users cookie which
you were transmitted when you first
logged in and they can use it to do
anything that you would normally do not
good the only way to really protect
yourself from this is through SSL or
HTTPS like what you see on your banking
websites and now Facebook and Twitter
hopefully Firesheep by Eric Butler
demonstrates how vulnerable your login
is it's a man-in-the-middle attack
Firefox extension that anyone has the
ability to use t use Firesheep first
make sure to download wind peak app then
download the browser extension and open
it using Firefox by dragging it into
your list of extensions and add-ons
which you may need
to restart Firefox I did when I
downloaded it go to view sidebar
Firesheep
and enable it and now simply kick click
start capturing and you'll be able to
see the usernames and photos of anyone
on your network that logs into one of
the specific sites that Firesheep uses
click on the name or photo of anyone on
the list and you are now logged in as
them with the ability to do whatever you
want as them on that site it's scary huh
so Darren you got a some Twitter
actually yeah yeah so I'm here I'm on
the Twitter I'm on the social network
doing all that fun stuff I know that
you're already following up with last
week's hacked if so your laptop so my
laptop thing my laptop thinks that
you're the router yes and the router
thinks that you're my laptop slowly I'm
a man in the middle right now alright so
I'm gonna go ahead and do something on
Twitter and I'm gonna start capturing
there you go there you are already so I
can double click on your name and Oh No
hey look at Kirby Oh No see this is
where the demo goes all wrong when now
shannon has access to my Twitter
thankfully she can't do things like
change my password because it would
actually ask her for my password and she
only asked my cookie but still ah what
are you doing nothing what oh this is
not gonna be good so luckily you know
Twitter and Facebook have caught on to
this and have enabled the ability to use
HTTPS secure logins so if you haven't
updated your settings do it right now
before I get on the same wireless router
as you guys do you guys have a tip to
share email them to tips at hack 5 org
in will show them off when you're back

back live i'm darren kitchen at the
automate 2011 conference checking out
some sweet stuff from image source you
guys know that I'm a huge fan of
multi-touch displays in fact we had
Aaron bit LaRon just a few seasons ago
to talk about his home brews stuff and
guess what he's here
nice to see him last time we got
together you are at like your parents
place building multi-touch ease in the
garage or Virginia Tech oh yeah in the
last year I went from just something
that I thought was cool to you know
producing these four different companies
even one for Penny Marshall the movie
producer and then I was lucky enough to
team up with country logistics and since
then we've kind of been starting to take
over the multi-touch revolution and
trying to stay ahead of the curve yeah
well this is really exquisite I gotta
say you know it's just a much grander
scale about how much of this technology
here is similar to say for instance the
multi-touch that we saw on hack 5 last
well the fundamentals are basically the
same it's its optical base and you're
using infrared light but there's a lot
of little things that you kind of learn
as you go that a lot of people you got
to try it before you even know if it's
gonna work and so it's just kind of a
learning curve so what would you say is
the biggest challenge making a 28-foot
odd irregular-shaped multi-touch bar I
guess you know making it seamless in a
way that an operating system would see
eight monitors or eight displays and
then stitching them together with
DirectX or OpenGL and then making touch
seamless across that irregular shape so
tell me about the graphics card what's
actually running inside your hardware
wise um well we actually have one of the
latest Sandy Bridge Intel processors and
it is a powerhouse the Sandy Bridge
processor chipset is really great we
have a lot of RAM we have actually ATI
Radeon 58 70s which we have both are two
of them and they have two gigs of memory
and they
six independent output graphics cards
for this 28-foot how many I mean this
I'm assuming this is LCD or rear
projection
its rear projection and so you've got
essentially eight monitors or however
many projectors you have in here how do
you run that off of those two parts well
basically we had to crossfire them or in
Nvidia's terms SLI them to be able to
process this many particles and this
type of graphic engine altogether
without stuttering or losing framerate
and why ATI instead of Nvidia with the
sli
the real difference I mean there's also
matrix they make some some good
multi-headed cards too we've actually
tried both Nvidia and matrix and the
problem that we run into is when you're
going over two cards to run simultaneous
displays you get stuttering in between
them ATI was the only one who could do
AI Finity Nvidia kind of went in a
different direction for powerhouse type
graphics but their largest output card
is four outputs independent as far as I
know and we've tried their Quadro cards
and it just didn't work out
there are several projectors down
brighter putting the light on the back
of this this display but is there you
know or there what are the other
elements that go into that and how do we
even track our fingers with the
projection well basically the way it
works is you have a projector
that's projecting onto a screen and
underneath the screen where the
projector is there's infrared lights and
they are shooting up massive infrared
lights shooting up and when you put your
fingers on the screen like this that
infrared light is bouncing off the earth
off your fingers and into the tracking
program and that's why you can have your
fingers you can have object recognition
and then
you know you can you can do so many cool
things by bouncing infrared light off
that's insane now are the infrared
lights like like here's the thing the
the glass top is is right here on the
top rebel and I don't see the infrared
lights around the perimeter like I did
on the last multi-touch did for the show
so where are the lights
well for this one we did a rear di rear
diffused illumination setup the previous
model was a FTIR frustrated total
internal reflection and that's when we
shot the IR lights through the sides
what we're doing now is we're shooting
the IR lights from the bottom and what
that does is that allows us to do object
tracking which we could not do on the
FTIR setup that I did for you nice now
before you're using like the sony i tuoi
a good experience with that it's kind of
what the users not that it's no longer
homebrew what are you using now we're
using the imaging source cameras they're
great cameras they're you know that the
ps3 camera that's it's a good camera but
that's that's where you start you know
and you want to go to a more
professional camera you want something
to built you know for for this type of
technology oh this is a this is a
machine vision camera completely
programmable and the one the ones that
are being used for the multi-touch bar
here is a what's called a CMOS camera
and completely completely programmable
and from the imaging source you get all
the SDKs needed to program the camera
the optics on the other hand it's a
quite a inexpensive lens
I think it's either a 2.9 or a 2 point 1
millimetre focus lens depending on
depending on about 5 o'clock a.m. when
they change the malls so what what's
coming out of here
I see Ethernet yeah I'm assuming that's
your power
actually there's there's a there's an
Ethernet we have all protocols we have
firewire Ethernet and USB outputs and
they're all pushed as avi files so
everything's in avi is that comes out of
the camera and what do you get out I
mean what's the resolution in the color
spaces what we can push RGB 24 hour GB
32 it just depends on the camera and
what you need if you need a different
driver from our company you just let me
know what about the same camera and you
just we're gonna get you get like raw
uncompressed I guess yeah you can get
raw uncompressed as a matter of fact a
bunch of my friends and astronomy use
our cameras to look at the Stars and
they love the raw uncompressed files and
then they take images for 180 seconds or
so and they mesh them together and with
a software called regice X so yeah and
what's the actual resolution in your
pick up there the resolution of the
cameras that we're using the multi-touch
is 740 by 480
so that's standard definition that's the
standard definition and our cameras go
from VGA resolution all the way up to 5
megapixel okay so five megapixel are
brought on compresses we could get out
of her IVs correct Wow and you'll be
pushing a whole information you'd be
you'd need a sand a very fast San Jose
this is this OpenGL is his truck tax
this is pulling DirectX in through an
engine called the mercury particle
engine it is I use that with Adobe but
anyway that's that's really what does it
take to program these effects in you
know it's a very simple visual editor so
you can actually go through and just add
nodes of particle effects and then go in
and customize those like you're familiar
with inside of a visual studio
environment okay well what about like
the future of this like playing games on
it getting chat playing YouTube videos
old math how would you go about that
we're looking forward to trying some
different implementations in there I'm a
flash developer by trade and so I would
love to see some flash capability built
into here and we've done some
prototyping on that with some success so
hopefully we'll be seeing some of that
in version 2.0 coming up do you expect
to get the same kind of hardware
acceleration out of Flash that you would
out of XNA No let's be honest
nice well working people find more about
carny logistics you can go onto our
website that's wwr any logistics com
thanks so much now anytime

I love creating websites and I have been
doing so since I was in Middle School
way back in the day and it was really
easy I can move around some photos and
text and I could change the color I
could click Save and I was done it was
awesome
I used to love geo cities nowadays you
either code your own theme or you choose
somebody else's in you modify it so to
make things a lot easier
we have composer compose composer is a
web authoring tool with no HTML or
coding needed it features tons of stuff
like an FTP site manager with a
browsable sidebar and tree view kind of
like the Explorers folder pane and then
there's a color picker for easy to use
color swapping just click with your
mouse tab so you can edit several
documents at once there's a CSS editor a
styler which is this toolbar that lets
you change styles instantly you can
customize your toolbars you can do this
thing called a cleaner which gets rid of
all those annoying little brackets the
bracket B our carrots that will make
your documents valid and you can do
visible mark so you can view carriage
returns and block borders you can also
do say table and cell resizing for
rulers and adjust rows and columns
really easily and there is an automated
spell checker which is great because
sometimes I really suck at spelling so I
really just wanted to give you guys a
quick overview on what it does how it
looks and how to get around in the
program so I've pulled up composer right
here on my website you can download it
from composer dotnet and this is what
the tool looks like when you first open
it when you actually do start it up for
the first time or every time you get a
whole bunch of these really nice tips
that are actually quite useful so I
suggest reading through all of those and
then you go through the normal menu you
have your open file or you can do your
recent pages like for me I have the hack
shop open right now so you can see what
it looks like under edit you can do
things like copy and paste as usual
paste without formatting Find and
Replace so you can find certain words
like I could find all the words FAQ or
all the policy words and change it to
something like frequently asked
questions actually written out pretty
much whatever why you can check this
selling as usual in the publishing site
settings under view you have the choices
of your toolbars which ones you want to
be shown for myself I like to have all
the toolbars showing so I know exactly
what I can do and then you can do things
like HTML tags an HTML source code under
insert you can insert images tables
cells text anything that you want you
have characters and symbols that you can
choose from you can insert smart widgets
like this one that they have that says
made with composer button that you can
add to your website you have HTML and
PHP code if you know how to do PHP
coding and you can do a lot of
formatting for example I can change the
font the style the text size and the
color are all the normal stuff I can
mess with the paragraphs and make them
exactly how I want kind of like you have
in Word I can I can increase the indents
I can decrease them I can align stuff I
can do all sorts of things and then
under table I can insert tables I can
save them I can delete them under tools
I have a markup cleaner which is the one
that marks marks up all the brackets and
cleans it up for you
I can validate my HTML and I can go into
the CSS editor so under the CSS
stylesheet you can change all sorts of
stuff from your text background borders
even the boxes and lists it's very very
nice and simple to use and then if you
have any issues you can always go over
to the help and browse their forums
which are very handy indeed down here
under the image of the store you can
actually open up several different pages
at once so I can browse different ones I
can save them as I need to and I can
open them and re-edit them pretty much
do anything that I need to do if I want
to look at the HTML tags I can go over
to this tab right here I can view the
source over here which is very handy and
I can also check out the nice preview
without all the boxes around everything
so all in all I think composure is a
very nice program to use it kind of
reminds me of the days back when I used
Geo cities and
made my own sailormoon web fan sites
I've talked about radical breeze and
composer now and do you guys have any
kind of programs kind of like this make
sure you email me over at feedback at
hack 5 org and I'll definitely check
those out and now a word from Darren
with our road test once again it's time
for the road test and this week I want
to tell you guys about a piece of
technology that you should steer clear
of it is the coarse hair solid-state
drive the force here is f 120 and I'm
sorry I gotta say this is the worst
solid-state drive I've ever seen half
the time I boot into Windows I get this
and then the other half of the time if
you go into suspend mode and come back
from s3 well guess what prepare for a
blue screen because it can't find the
drive it's even better when you boot up
and I can't see your hard drive in so
you reboot again because the disk hasn't
what's spun up but so where's it a spin
there's no spinning it's a solid state
it's a piece of crap what do you guys
like what do you guys hate email me
feedback a hack 5 dot org I'm getting
rid of this thing immediately what do
you Jason what do you like you just
switched over to solid say right yeah
one two five seven f9q whatever it's the
fat it's the juice kill what what it's
the g.skill 120 that's 30 bucks less
than this thing and this thing is
bastard rock you dead to me dead to me
email us and now that's right a word
from our sponsor
if you provide technical supports and
friends colleagues or family we've had
an easy cost-effective way to do it
without being there in person well the
best way for me to provide technical
support is to do it online with go to
assist Express go to it's just Express
lets you view and control another
person's computer and quickly resolve
technical issues I've used it to help
friends learn new software or to fix
family computer problems without being
there oh yeah try go to assist Express
free for 30-days for this special offer
you must visit go to assist calm / hak5
again that's go to assist calm / a take
a five for a free trial
that just about wraps up this episode of
hack 5 but as you guys know we have some
excellent emails I'm very excited about
the ones that we have this week we have
curated them thank you for keeping them
short as well the truth of writing a
good email actually is to write what you
want to say and then read it back and
then say the same exact thing with half
the words yeah if you do that dude
that's that's Victor wrote in I was
wondering what the computer is that you
usually have in the show because it
looks really good I think I might want
to get one but I don't know the model or
the manufacturer this was a question
that I got not sure if it was before or
after I switched machines what I used to
have was the Nokia 3G booklet the
booklet 3G it has jeezum you could get
like an 18 he data plan with it so you
could get on the Internet pretty much
anywhere in the US and then it also did
wireless only there's no Ethernet ports
on it but there's tons of USB ports an
HDMI which is wonderful
yeah but it is an atom so you know it's
nowhere near the speed of a real machine
I mean it does have a 10 inch display
but you know what I got to say is that
this is the new machine we're rocking
and it has an 11.6 inch screen that's
actually I think it's the same residence
that it's 1366 768 this model right here
is actually an i7 with 4 gigs I think
you've got the i3 with Intel Core i3 3
gigs of memory you need to remove that
sticker 250 gig hard drive but I
switched it out right hundred and then
we're actually I'm new skin anyway we'll
talk about skins later but whoohoo this
is the Acer timeline X 1830 T and I love
it except I kind of wish that they put
the header on for the mini PCIe on the
bottom because it would be useful if say
I wanted to put a SIM card slot like the
you know one there and get a SIM from
t-mobile or I guess AT&amp;amp;T now but
whatever will be or
you know I'm just talking about if I
won't put a sim card in it as it as a 3G
modem rather than having a dongle nobody
wants a donger the dongle is coming out
of stuff is nobody yeah
prior to that I was using this 15.4 inch
beast pretty much just because it had
Nvidia graphics and a 1080p display but
I think this guy is getting retired
although it does have the really nice
hack five like engraved wood yeah it's a
wood sticker engraved it was laser
engraved it's pretty cool and then as
you guys know it abused lots of machines
on the past but I'll have some lower
Turks with all of us including E PCs and
Acer Aspire ones hooray so our next
email comes from one I was watching
episode 903 and at the end you have
mentioned black bun - I have used
backtrack before but I've never heard of
black bun - so I started to poke around
the internet and found out not only
black I'm too but not track both are
sort of the same idea both are based on
Ubuntu both use gnome both have the
standard backtrack program sweet so I
was thinking all three of them would
make a really good head-to-head battle
or just for a review well haven't played
with knack track but I have extensively
used backtrack over the last couple of
years and I just started playing with
with back black bun - now and I got to
say there's also a pen pen what is it
it's like Jen - Oh pen - it's based on
Jen - and it's pen test I haven't played
with that one yet but so here are some
my thoughts basically I played with
black bun - now for about a week it's
you know prior to that I've been using
backtrack since well version 3 like
early maybe even earlier than that but
anyway but never as my primary Oh Wes so
basically here are a couple of my
observations essentially black bun - is
based on ubuntu 10.10 or moon - and it's
running gnome which is a great windows
manager I think and it may be familiar
to you so you know that's kind of nice
now backtrack is way more established
than black bunch of black bunch is
pretty new their version Oh point - well
its counterpart black track they're
coming up on beta of 5.0 which
look so good so a backtrack though
backtracks the basis for offensive
security courses where you can get
certified and they teach all sorts of
things from penetration testing to
wireless attacks and they have both like
in-person and online learning scenarios
so that's cool for that now in
comparison to backtrack though black bun
2 doesn't have as much of a community as
you might imagine with them being pretty
new but you'll so you're more likely to
find some tutorials for backtrack now
with that being said most of what you
would do with backtrack you could do
very easily with black one too they
actually have a very similar feature set
in the programs and applications that
are installed ma the the biggest strong
point though for me about black punto on
in my book at least is the fact that
it's really just a highly customized
version of Ubuntu with gnome which I'm
already familiar with and it's better
for me suited as my primary Linux OS
then again I've run into some stability
issues on this machine and for the time
being I will be switching back to
backtrack for release
- now I'm going to reassess all of this
though when backtrack 5 debuts it's
supposed to be soon it's supposed to be
supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit
compatible it's going to be based on
Ubuntu 10.04 which is the LTS version a
long term support version and check this
out I'm so excited about this they will
officially support KDE gnome and fluxbox
so for me that's kind of one of the
biggest byxis deals there enough of that
black bun too though let's find out
about this week's tech analyst photo
this week's photo comes from Ryan Ryan's
dog is showing off his technic the yeah

pineapple version one oh yeah maybe we
