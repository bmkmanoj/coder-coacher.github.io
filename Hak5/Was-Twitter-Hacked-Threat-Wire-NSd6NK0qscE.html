when you delete files and the IRS is
back online all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for jun 14
2016 your summary of the threats to our
security our privacy and our internet
freedom if you are a current patreon of
threat wire thank you you are helping
fund the production of this show in our
goal of managing an RSS patreon calm
down to the news first off stop freaking
out everybody just stop everyone don't
freak out late last week there was news
that surface that Twitter may or may not
have been hacked and over 32 million
usernames and passwords were exposed and
a searchable database at leaked source
com I'm a little skeptical about the
whole twitter got hacked headline though
there's a few reasons for that so the
data was being sold on the dark web by
username tessa 88 and leaked source
suspects that the usernames passwords
and email addresses associated with this
claim were compiled by using malware
that infected browsers like Firefox and
Chrome users would save their passwords
and usernames in Firefox or Chrome yada
yada yada malware yay so Twitter and
some cyber security professionals do not
think that malware is at fault here or
is not the main problem but using the
same password across multiple sites is
in this case a person could use the data
from previous hacks such as LinkedIn or
myspace and cross compile that with
Twitter data of users that were using
the same password across both sites and
thereby they have 32 million usernames
and passwords of people on Twitter from
those other hacks now in a tweet as well
as a blog post Twitter says that the
usernames and passwords quote may have
been amassed from combining information
from other recent breaches malware on
victims machines that are stealing
passwords for all sites or a combination
of both now Twitter holds strongly that
their own servers were not hacked and
that they use HTTPS and bcrypt for
encryption of the passwords twitter also
cross-references the data from other
hacks and other leaks to
their own users they'll lock down any
kind of accounts that they deem need
extra protection if they find leaked
information that may also pertain to a
user on their own social network so
while chances are pretty high that
Twitter did not actually get hacked
using a strong password two-factor
authentication and a different password
on every single site is still really
really highly suggested just do it a 37
year old systems administrator was
convicted guilty of violating the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or CFAA
last week and faces up to 10 years in
jail along with up to a quarter million
dollars in payments for deleting files
off of get this an employer's server
before leaving a job at an auto dealer
software firm so the actions taken by
the defendant his name is Michael Thomas
were deemed damaging by the employer and
he was charged with unauthorized damages
now Thomas disabled the company's VPN
for a period of time he tampered with
the error alert system and he also
deleted a bunch of files which were on a
backup which by the way were also backed
up so they didn't actually lose anything
in that case they just had to go back
and find them so while the actions were
harmful and motive a couple of IT
employees got laid off a bit before he
actually went in and deleted those files
there was no evidence during the trial
showing that Thomas wasn't authorized as
in the company didn't have official
documents or policies detailing what
their systems admin could or could not
do so opponents of this outcome think
that this could have been settled in a
civil court and he should simply pay
money for the damages not actually get
jail time and that this will be a
precedent for future outcomes you get in
a spat with your employer you delete
some files become a felon under the
broad CFAA law so I am kind of curious
what your take on this one is did he
deserve the conviction let me know in a
comment below following the 2015 hack of
the IRS get transcript service the
agency took down the site for over a
year now get transcript is available
again with more authentication users are
now required to have a social security
number along with all the historical
data about themselves an email a phone
number as well as a credit card or a
loan number with
your name on the account and an email or
a text will be used to send a
verification code to the user before
they can login users will also be able
to see the date and time their
transcript was last accessed now the tax
transcripts are used by US citizens as
proof of income for mortgages and for
loans and they can also be used to look
up adjusted gross income for e-filing
the IRS is also planning to deploy six
digit PIN codes for taxpayers later on
this year not quite yet because of go
figure security concerns before I go I
