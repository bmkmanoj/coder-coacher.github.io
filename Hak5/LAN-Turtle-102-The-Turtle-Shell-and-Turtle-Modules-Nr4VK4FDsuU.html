basics and today we're going to be
talking about the turtle shell and
turtle modules so we're picking up from
where we left off in the previous
episode where we went ahead and updated
to the latest version of the software so
let's get back to our windows host and
continue the process so here we are and
we have this left over from our previous
session it says in putty it is inactive
I can right-click here and restart the
session and I'm going to receive this
alert again the reason being the key
fingerprint has changed and that is
because it's a very new version of the
software so we say yes add that to the
keyring I'm gonna log in as before as
root and the default password sh3 llz
because it has been changed after the
reflash and of course again prompted for
a new password so at this point here we
are this right here is the turtle shell
you can navigate it with arrow keys with
enter to go into a menu with escape to
go back you can also if you'd like in
putty at least you can go ahead and
click I can say you know click change IP
it change way and MAC address and hit
select and I can do that and I can
choose a random MAC address if I want or
I can click cancel and click back
likewise with keyboard so what I want to
get you familiar with though this what
right here is what we call the turtle
shell if I quit this shell you'll notice
this is just you're in a embedded Linux
device and I can go ahead and you know
LS tech la slash and hurray from this
banner though you can see says enter
turtle to return to the shell so at any
time I'm going to clear this I can it
just right turtle and there I am back in
the shell so at this point let's go
ahead and get ourselves some modules
because they are the ones that do the
heavy lifting on the turtle
now by default there's only one module
in the latest version and that is module
manager there's a reason for that
because I want you to always have the
latest versions of the modules and
because this is pretty awesome in that
there's a lot of community development
here there's
open-source Turtle modules is a very
simple API later on we'll get into
actually writing our own very simple but
for right now consider this kind of an
app store where all of the modules are
free and it just goes ahead and
downloads them from LAN turtlecom
let's take a look I'm gonna go into
module manager it's the only one
selected and so I'll press return to hit
select and every module can be started
and stopped enabled disabled and
configured so for right here there's
nothing to do starting or enabling it
let's go ahead and configure the module
manager and here I get the option to get
the directory from LAN turtlecom I can
delete modules that I currently have I
can update the ones that are already
installed or I can go back so from the
directory it will ask me are you sure
because I do a this is going to make a
connection tool and turtlecom so you
know if I've gone ahead and deployed
this at a client site and I'm trying to
be covert this may not be something that
I want to do otherwise if you're setting
this up in your own lab then feel free
so I'll go ahead and choose yes and Here
I am presented with the list of
available modules now I'm going to go
ahead and just check all of these use
the space bar to put a checkbox next to
them this should be very familiar to
anybody who's installed a Linux distro
with anaconda and we're gonna go ahead
and tab over to ok and this will
download and install all of the modules
that I've selected let me know that they
installed and now if I go back and I go
back again you'll notice that I have
many more modules all of these modules
available for me fantastic ok so let's
go ahead and understand a few basics
about these modules I said that they can
be started stopped or configured enabled
and disabled what does that mean well
let's take a look at say netcat reverse
show this is a very simple module all it
does is creates a reverse shell using
netcat it's a staple of tcp/ip it's a
Swiss Army knife it's a really wonderful
thing I'm gonna walk you through the
process of configuring it starting at
stopping it and enabling it so let's go
ahead and configure here and
configuration for each module is going
to be different it's
depend on what the module actually does
in this case this creates a persistent
reversed shell that provides us access
to /bin slash sh or our bash prompt if
you will and that means that we'll be
able to have access to our turtle shell
from anywhere which is really cool in
this case the only two parameters that
it wants is a host and a port now with
many of these configurations there'll
also be a help option and we can get
some useful stuff here like hey here's a
command that you could run on you know
another machine with netcat as a
listener or where you could go ahead and
receive that connection so I'm going to
go ahead and do that over here I have
this Linux box set up let me increase
that font size just a little bit for you
and I'm going to let's see find out my
IP address first
it is 10 73 31 244 so I'll go ahead and
copy that and clear the screen and I'm
going to run netcat tak l4 listen tak V
for verbose tak P for the port and I'll
choose 8080 so now that's listening on
port 8080 I'm gonna go back over here
and I'm going to say ok and I'm going to
set my host to 10 73 31 244 and the port
to 8080 yes these are all in the same
LAN so this will work perfectly and when
I go ahead and choose start this is
actually going to go ahead start this
particular net cast reverse shell module
using the settings that are provided
under configure and it says starting the
reverse shell I can hit OK and I can go
back now when I do this you'll notice
that right here I have an X next to
netcat reverse shell and that means that
it is running I can tell that by going
here and I see hey I received a
connection and if you're familiar with
netcat reverse shells
this means that similar to how we just
did before if I do an LS tak la slash I
go ahead and receive the output as I
would expect I can do cat / XE / banner
and I am there you see it on my land
turtle so from here let's go ahead and
stop our module as you might imagine we
select it and then we just press stop
and over here we can see that the
connection has been disconnected there
we are
so what is enabling well quite simply it
just means start this module every
I'm the land turtle starts every time it
boots up every time we plug it in so
I'll go ahead and hit enable you can see
now the status is stopped so if I go
back I'll see that I do not have a
checkmark next to it but if I take a
look at it says boot up status is
enabled so this means that as long as I
have a netcat listener and say up in the
cloud somewhere and I drop this on a
land it's going to go ahead and
establish that net cat connection so
there you are
very simple all that modules can do are
you can configure them you can start and
stop them you can enable them and
likewise if I don't want this to happen
every time I boot up my land turtle I
can go ahead here and say disable now of
course we can even quit the turtle shell
by hitting the Escape key a few times
we're pressing back I can come down here
and hit it exit and I want to show you
something real quick which is if ILS
tech la / XE / config / modules I'm
sorry / XE / turtle / modules you'll
notice there are all of the modules so
likewise if I would if I wanted to I can
go ahead and set up my listener again
and I can run / XE / turtle / modules /
netcat reverse shell start and there we
are
I'm started and I'm on my land turtle
likewise I can do that again but with
stop and to make things easier
there are also shortcuts by we start
that for start netcat Rev shell and stop
netcat Rev shell so those are land
turtle modules we're going to get more
into those later on but suffice it to
say they can be downloaded from the
module manager they can be configured
they can start and stop and they can of
course enable and disable with that i'm
darren kitchen I'll see you at LAN
turtlecom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
