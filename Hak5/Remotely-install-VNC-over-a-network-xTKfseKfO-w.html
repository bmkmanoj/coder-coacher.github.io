VNC session on Darren's computer using
metasploit however Darren today is going
to show us how to do this the legit way
through a computer network so once you
show us what you got in right well I'm
going to take a few steps back yeah last
month Harrison did get VNC access on my
computer using metasploit and it was
kind of cool but what I've done is I've
dug in and this is one of these tools
that i use to administrate a huge
network of computers and it comes in a
lot handy first take a step back VNC is
a remote desktop application it allows
you to remotely log into somebody's
computer and you can use the mouse
keyboard you see what's on their screen
it's really nifty so it's a lot like our
DP it's just like remote desktop
protocol and windows and it's also
similar to like things like go to my pc
and stuff but it's open source it's
really neat and there's a really there's
a lot of great tools for it and this is
one of those that I love all right this
is called fast push and it's from Dark
Age co uk and it's a great little tool
that allows you to remotely install it
on a windows network so if you're
running a Windows computer and you're on
the network and I need to get to your
computer then I could use this tool if I
had your administrator password to to
install the VNC service on your computer
and then login ok Andy show you how it's
done it's really simple alright so here
we go we've got fast push open this is
it's the just extract the zip throw it
in the root and it supports a lot of
different VNC distributions there's you
know the regular realvnc various
versions of that as well as ultra VNC
deviancy and my favorite tight VNC now
see that's where I have a little
question for it i don't really know a
lot about the different being sees
others so once you give me a little idea
of sure you just like much so there's
the real VNC which is the original one
created by AT&amp;amp;T labs ok there's tight
VNC which is kind of like a spin-off on
that and each VNC distribution kind of
have is it a little spin on VNC tight
VNC is really cool because it has like
JPEG compression so if you're on a
slower network you know it may not look
as good but it will allow you to get the
job done a lot quicker and then Z B and
C and ultra V&amp;amp;C have their own little
features but I mainly just stick to the
real distributor
and the tight distribution all right
okay gosh it and so we've extracted
everything here so we'll go over to what
command prompt and it's real simple the
command is fast push a tour fp8 and that
will bring up this nice little splash
screen here where we can set our options
it's pretty easy we just enter in an IP
address of the computer and the network
that we want to install it on so in this
case 192 168 1 2 139 and then we're
going to give it we're going to tell
what version of VNC would want to
install our case it's going to be real
337 and then we need to give it a user
name and that would be administrator you
need to make sure that the user that
you're installing this with it has
administrative access on that machine
and then the password and then we're
going to give it we're going to say PWD
and this will be the password for the
VNC server so I'm just going to call it
test okay so press Enter yes yeah and it
goes ahead connects to the remote
machine and installs this so I don't
actually have to go to that machine so
if I'm on a huge network with hundreds
of computers and I know which computer
need you know to install it on it's
great or from a programmer standpoint I
can see what you just did get all of
what I need all of the computers if I
want to stall at one time until yeah
it's it's great right yeah I could you
know create a job to install on all the
machines across the network if you have
the administrative password for all of
those and it makes systems
administration a breeze so everything is
installed i'm going to go ahead and fire
up VNC viewer connects that machine and
password there we go well and i was like
that was really now i'm on my machine at
home I like that's really really cool
there's also one little things that I'd
like to mention and that is with theirs
on the Dark Age homepage there's a
little tweak for the 337 version of
realvnc which has this cool little
feature where it replaces the regular
VNC service so that it doesn't have a
tray icon
and with some other and with some of the
other switches that you can use with
fast push it allows you to like turn off
putting icons on the desktop and in the
Start menu so you could put kind of like
a silent installation of VNC on your
computer or your friends computer that
is really awesome I really appreciate
that I learn a little something new the
guys are interested in learning more
about this make sure you visit the show
notes and we will see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
