who experiences more bad press an NSA
contractor is in hot water and the EU
wants to make IOT devices more secure
all that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I am Shannon Morrison this is
threat wire for Tuesday October 11 2016
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
first off a big thanks to our patrons at
patreon.com slash threat wire you fund
the making of this show so thank you for
letting us bring you security news every
single week our first story comes from
open whisper systems the makers of the
popular signal messaging app which
allows end-to-end encryption for users
the company received a subpoena from the
Eastern District of Virginia in early
2016 requiring information on to signal
users for an investigation in this case
open whisper systems doesn't keep much
data as is so they could only provide
registration date and the last date the
users were connected signal doesn't
store contacts groups who users
communicate with or messages which
obviously are encrypted according to the
documents the FBI requested quote any
and all subscriber information and any
associated accounts to include
subscriber name address telephone number
email addresses method of payment IP
registration IP history logs and
addresses account history toll records
upstream and downstream providers any
associated accounts acquired through
cookie data and any other contact
information from inception to the
present which the intercept argues is
much broader than what a subpoena should
allow the subpoena that they received
also came with a gag order basically
making it impossible for the company to
notify the public that they actually
received that paperwork so for one year
the subpoena was supposed to be in place
as a gag order now the subpoena and
responses can be read on open whisper
systems website due to the ACLU working
with the company to retract that gag
order by arguing first amendment rights
that the government must demonstrate a
compelling interest in keeping a
subpoena secret which they couldn't
necessarily do the ACLU points out in an
article that the government quickly
agreed to publicly disclosing MOU
of the subpoena given it was so easy to
overturn this also shows that the
government is more interested in secrecy
about subpoenas than they are
transparency and it makes us wonder how
often they issued gag orders to
companies that we just don't know about
yahoo has been having a worst week ever
seriously mercury is not in retrograde
so what is going on with them I mean
first they announced that they were
hacked back in 2014 and now information
has come to light about a
government-sponsored program being found
on their servers which was used to scan
for certain character sets in emails to
look for unknown data and we don't
actually know what they were looking for
or why yahoo built this program in 2015
on top of their software designed a scan
incoming email from malware or child
pornography which looking for malware on
email servers is pretty common but this
was kept secret from Yahoo's security
team until the team discovered the
software they assumed a hacker put it
there and they opened up a high priority
internal case into the matter the
program is no longer in use but during
the time that it was installed it could
have created serious backdoors into the
company's servers for anyone to peek
into with some team members calling it a
poorly designed or buggy rootkit
so basically Yahoo built a buggy program
which look like a rootkit
into their server to scan incoming email
and they didn't tell their security team
and bad guys could have used it while it
was there to do their own snooping and
now Verizon wants a discount of 1
billion bucks before they buy Yahoo
because they they want to buy Yahoo
because apparently you get a discount if
the thing that you want to buy has
security problems who a contractor at
Booz Allen Hamilton the same company
that Edward Snowden worked at while he
was working as a contractor with the NSA
has been accused of copying highly
confidential and classified data from
the NSA the Department of Justice is
filing a case against Harold Martin of
Maryland after the FBI found classified
documents in his home and his personal
car he faces at least one year in prison
and up to 10 years for theft of the
government property now while we do know
that Snowden's leak documents were used
for whistleblowing we do not know what
Martin's motives were his theft was
found during the ongoing shadow brokers
investigation which we reported on quite
a while
back on threat wire it is not clear if
the stolen documents in Martin's case
have any relation to the shadow brokers
leak of NSA spying software however
there were some very obvious
similarities between the two Internet of
Things devices have been the staple of
many security and privacy news releases
lately especially with their role in the
Mirai botnet which uses unprotected IOT
devices to take down servers with a huge
DDoS attack now in an article by your
active it looks like the European
Commission is looking into proposing new
legislation for these devices lawmakers
want to create rules that companies will
have to meet to sell their IOT devices
and to make them go through a process to
get certification that guarantees
privacy I think that's pretty cool and I
feel like this is one time when the
government is making a good choice you
go
