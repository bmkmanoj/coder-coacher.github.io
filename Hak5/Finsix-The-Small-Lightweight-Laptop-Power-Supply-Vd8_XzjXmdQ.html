by Toyota for hack 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2014 looking at some really
cool power technology i'm here with
Joseph from fin 6 how are you Joseph
great great to be with you ok so I take
it that you were not happy with the
current state of affairs when it comes
to these guys these massive power bricks
that we lug around I think anybody who
travels anybody who's on the go hates
carrying around the traditional brick
it's heavy its bulky it's hard to pack
and you just hate it nobody likes to
carry it around I'm actually using what
what is it a HP Chromebook 11 only
because it's micro USB and at least the
chargers for micro USB are relatively
small but you've taken a different
approach rather than change all the
laptops out there which is not about to
happen you've changed the power supply
okay let's take a look right so what
Finn 6 has done is develop a new
technology it's based on high frequency
power conversion and this is the result
we can shrink down current laptop
adapters to 1/4 the size that they are
today and 1/6 the weight using this
novel VHF power conversion technology so
for people on the go you don't have to
carry the brick anymore we've also built
in a USB port right here so you can
charge your smartphone your tablet any
USB device so you can leave that adapter
at home as well leave the brick at home
and this is all you need to travel with
to charge your laptop and your other
devices so is this gonna work with my
laptop and will also provide enough
power to actually charge it or is it
just enough to run it yeah so it'll
charge it and it'll you it'll be enough
power to do whatever you want to do on
your laptop this is 65 watts and almost
all the laptops today are going to be 65
watts and below and we're also including
DC tips with the product so all the
popular laptop models will be supported
by this unit so my sony my Lenovo HP
doesn't matter it's all gonna even
though they're kind of you know some of
the Lenovo ones get really weird
absolutely we're gonna include all the
tips in the package with the adapter
so it'll support all the adapt all the
laptops out of the box so how is it if
you know if it's that you know if you're
able to make a switching power adapter
that takes AC and gives you DC at the
wattage that you need then why are these
so big and you're also being very
generous here because this is one of the
smaller ones you should see mine for my
workstation laptop it's insane
the current bricks are limited by the
current power conversion technology and
they use a switching frequency of around
a hundred kilohertz and so what does
that mean that means you're limited the
size of the power components that are
inside are going to be big and bulky and
the way around that is to go up really
high in frequency so physics goes a
thousand times faster to around sixty
five megahertz and by doing that we're
able to shrink the components to really
small sizes and then this is the result
so you get a smaller because you're
going faster but what's the with the the
result of that do you get more heat or
with the you know the drawback there no
there's no drawback we're still as
efficient as the current products and
we're still gonna meet all those touch
temperature requirements so it's gonna
be safe to touch so even got all the UL
and everything else you need so you
don't have all the worldwide agency
approvals so we're eventually gonna so
we're going to start in the u.s. selling
it but we're gonna ship this worldwide
when are you launching it in the US
we're gonna start pre-sales in March and
you can go to WWF in six comm and sign
up and production starts this summer
awesome how much is it going to set me
back $89 retail $89 for how many grams
for 45 grams that's a tenth of a pound
Wow I think I could lift that with a
micro quadcopter that is fantastic
Joseph I really appreciate it thank you
so much for continued coverage of all
things CES 2014 head over to revision
