design this time on hack 5 commonly
racing quad copters feature very similar
components you'll find that they all
have similar power systems like motors
and propellers and ESC S coupled with
flight controllers and fpv packages and
while there's a lot of variations in
those components nothing makes more of a
difference on the racetrack and really
how it all comes together how they're
implemented and here to talk to us a
little bit about the theory behind what
makes a good racing quadcopter is RC
modeling experts and my good friend and
designer of flight systems which is kind
of awesome Kevin K Kevin thanks for
coming on again good to be here it's
awesome I'm just loving the fact that
this hobby if you really if you want to
go down the rabbit hole it's really fun
because it lends itself to so many fun
things in stem you're constantly
learning
you're constantly refining and building
better craft and racing against yourself
you know a part of it is like oh I know
I can do better and then the other fun
part is when it gets really competitive
and we start right that's how we met in
fact right was racing each other yeah
and you know it's it's really a fun
competitive sport that's like builds
camaraderie so I wanted to talk about
like when I first got into this most of
the quad copters I was seeing was what
we call an H quad right and now it's
weird it's like there was a flip-flop
it's like at first quad copters were
pluses then they were X's then they were
H's and now X's are coming back and if
none of that makes any sense let's shake
it down sure let's talk about frame
design because again these components
are very similar I got what 22 of fours
in here it's same thing and that that
but these are these are two extremely
different quad copters that's correct
yeah yeah so what's so good tell me what
are the basics of a frame so you know
the the main thing is you're probably
going to be carrying fpv gear you're
gonna have a propulsion system and you
just want everything to layout clean and
be somewhat protected in a crash
situation and that's I mean basically it
I mean
but you with different geometries you'll
get different flight characteristics you
know I I favor the ex because you know
all the CG is concentrated in the center
of the frame which allows it to change
direction really really quickly it's
just easier to fly and more maneuverable
in my opinion so as you mentioned CG
that's the center of gravity you know
the center of gravity I would expect on
all of these to be so you know in the
center that's really where you want it
if you have too much junk in the trunk
or too big of a camera in the front
you're going to be offsetting and then
you're you know you can sure you can fix
it in post as it were you can fix it
with trimming or with you know different
pins and flake character you know
different characteristics and the flight
controller but you're losing your
potential there right I know what these
H's the idea was to give yourself a big
fuselage here so that you can pack in
all of that gear you know so I can have
the camera in the front so it doesn't
see the propellers which is nice if
you're going to get you know gorgeous
photography and such but I think two
things have happened one the racing
scene really took off absolutely so who
really cares if you see your props all
right or not right no and then the other
thing is the miniaturization of the
components exactly so I don't think that
an H is really all that necessary
anymore so if you were to say getting
into getting into racing for the first
time would you recommend an X and what
would be some of the benefits there
personally yes absolutely I would
recommend an X because I mean for one
thing when you're flying you can see
that the the the profile here the the
amount of surface area is huge compared
to this so the amount of drag is
actually a bigger factor in a lot of
ways than the the total weight of a
craft oh really
yeah okay you know because I'm always
looking at things like thrust to weight
ratio so you figure you know you pair
okay I've got these props with these
motors and this battery system you do
the math on a static calculator and
you're like okay I'm generating a
kilogram of thrust and I only weigh 250
grams so I have a four to one thrust to
weight ratio and that's you know this 41
and the one I mean it gets kind of crazy
when you look at some of these I've
always just looked at it like okay more
power you're saying there's a little
more finesse to it than just more power
sure sure so like if you look at this
frame here and you look at the profile
these 13 millimeter arms this tiny
little fuselage hmm there's very very
little wind resistance and of course
materials you see if I put those arms
side-by-side you can see yeah there's a
lot less for them to actually grab onto
there then the wind that is right right
yeah this is all propulsion and there's
a lot of other stuff going on here it's
like an in fact actually of flying
something like this it's kind of like a
sail like you get a good Gus that's
again the whole bottom of it it's kind
of like the Space Shuttle in that it's a
lifting body right right I mean you've
got the wings but the fuselage of the
Space Shuttle helps generate that lift
as well right so it's very similar in
something like this yeah and here you've
just got all your weight right in the
center so you're kind of like a like a
like a brick through a window right it's
it's almost like a sphere I mean it in
the rotation to take turns and something
like this is you know more or less
instant and it just simplifies things
because the handling is much more simple
whereas you know you get more yeah
there's there's just it's more complex
to fly a craft like that in my opinion
okay so two things there you talked
about the maneuvering touch on that but
also getting into this for the very
first time getting into racing now if
you're a new pilot let's talk about
setup because I know that when you go to
configure a quadcopter for example we've
been using clean flight but you know
there's many awesome flight controllers
out there right they all typically ask
you to choose something like what design
are you a plus or you man X and then
there's not really an age as much so
it's almost like the flight controllers
are expecting equal distance between
each of the four propellers as opposed
to here where they're not actually equal
distance this isn't an X with a fuselage
in the center the distance between the
you know front motors and the motors
side to side and forward to back are are
different right right
correct yes does that make it easier to
tune I've limited tuning is just a black
magic yeah - Nina's come with complex
said it's it's more simple when the
frame is symmetric like that mm-hmm and
so would you recommend add two new
pilots to get into an X to start with I
think it's a really good choice because
you know you're gonna get better
performance it's easier to fly and it's
easier to tune so I think it's so you
know it's a good way to go so let's talk
about maneuverability because I think
that's one of the areas where this
really shines not just because of the
wind resistance but you're talking about
turning and like in a racing scenario
where you're going through chicane and
under gates and around different
obstacles right turning is where it let
me just like in like Formula One racing
or anything like that that's where
you're going to be passing people
absolutely not as much in the
straightaways because uh most of the
courses that people fly in there will be
like one good straightaway and then a
lot of turns right right right yeah so
the the agility of a frame of a pure
axis in my mind superior to an H but you
know a lot of it's personal preference
but that's what I found
okay well we have a couple of exes here
which is really interesting because I
want to talk to you about some of the
different power systems because I
noticed here like these are very similar
however you've paired them with much
different motors and props and so I want
to talk to you a little bit about kind
of the balance when it comes to that
because over here was this these are
five inch props right and you're you're
pairing them with some what are these
2204 motors 22:04 cobras okay and these
things are doing what like 20 300 kV a
300 yeah okay so that's generating a lot
of thrust right but these guys right
here with these dys motors you're a
little bit more kV 2700 right right so
you're getting more rotation per volt
but at the same time they are they're
using four inch props like five
enterprise
so the the other end of the equation is
that you know it's a smaller frame and
it's less drag mm-hmm so and these are
1800 force 18:06 okay so what would be
the diff
it's like what's what are the
characteristic difference between these
two quadcopters so the agility on this
this frame and this motor setup is it's
very high this is a very it's very
simple to fly this through gates at high
speed and maneuver
this the the the top end on this thing
is just ludicrous so that's kind of what
it boils down to and so what about the
the motors and and the props are you
gonna get like higher torque or what
what kind of different differences in
the specifications are in the slight
characteristics are you gonna see when
you start playing with matching
different motors and props gotcha yeah
like a four inch prop you'll feel more
locked in at a higher kV it'll feel
it'll feel more precise it'll feel more
controlled with the with the larger
props you get a lot of brute force and
speed but the the fine control is so a
little different so you need it's a it's
a higher level of skilled required to do
the same maneuvers on this as this okay
so two things that I noticed right off
the bat as well just looking at these
X's versus your more traditional 258
Racer this is a very common q AV 250
first off you're using tri blades or as
opposed to your typical and dual bladed
props and then the other thing that I
notice is if you look at the spacing
between these you know tip to tip right
I have like a good like three inches
between those and these are both 5 inch
props it's just that these are fries and
these are tools right and the tolerances
here if I try to line those up there
you'll see they are very yeah if I can
get this guy here right as you can see
like we're talking what a millimeter a
couple millimeters there yeah they're
almost touching each other right right
yeah it you know early on you we'd
always hear these things about the
motors need to be this far apart and
that the other thing that you know in in
practice we don't see that that being a
problem at all and what's interesting is
to look at these two together these have
the same power train oh yeah
so as a motorist it's it's really it's
like you know just the engine in the car
and this is just a much smaller car
it's the the thrush generated and the
wind resistance here is it's it's a very
significant difference in how it
translates into performance to speed
right and so I also noticed that like
for example these are bullnose props so
you're you're generating some like
vortices off the tips of these
propellers as they're spinning and so
these vortices are just crashing into
each other and yet you're saying as
opposed to the conventional wisdom that
we were all taught right many years ago
when people were flying balsa wood for
fifties that it doesn't actually matter
when the rubber meets the road right
well I'm sure that there's an impact
there but what we find is that the the
trade-off that we get with this type of
setup outweighs the you know whatever K
is taken away by the proximity of the
props mm-hmm this is awesome you've been
building these for some time now I know
you've been swearing on and because of
the balance because of the CG I know
that once you you know strap a battery
onto the bottom of these guys you really
just have like all the mass in the
center you're saying that makes all the
difference yes and I can say from
experience losing to Kevin seriously
losing many times in my age quad that I
I'm I'm won over I'm really thankful to
take this little guy out and I'm excited
to start playing around with a 130 so
it's just really exciting times to be in
this racing scene as as everything is
moving so quickly so what is it what's
the next big thing that's exciting you
in the racing community right now well
the the prospect of getting real-time HD
is incredibly exciting and I hear that
that's coming that's you know the that
would be just so much more observe you
know a high rate data stream into the
goggles oh yeah I think actually if
you've been watching like fpv racing
videos on youtube and you're like wow
that looks so gorgeous and fun it's
because people are using like 4k GoPro
is mounted to the front of their
quadcopter they're actually seeing in
the goggles is standard definition and
if you're too young to remember that to
ask your parents because over-the-air TV
was really crappy
a decade ago right yeah yeah we've got
like 600 TV lines in our video feed
which is you know a lot less than 4k
yeah like imagine 640 by 480 yeah with a
lot of fuzziness it's no good
oh man so it's anyway it's just great to
have you on to geek out about all of the
little idiosyncrasies and the little
tiny things that make those differences
as we're all you know on an equal
playing field here and yet so much
innovation in the way that is all put
together yeah it's kind of it reminds me
of the early days of like people
building IBM clones
you know PC computers and and just like
it's the way you put it all together it
really is yeah yeah
so tell me these you've put together
yourself these are your actual own brand
of quad copter you want to tell us a
little bit about these yeah these are
razor quads and this is the razor 5 and
this is the razor 4 and then you know
the naming conventions based on the prop
size and I mean and it's really you know
I've since I've become obsessed with
this I've been just spending time trying
to make the perfect frame and I you know
built I don't know probably hundreds of
frames and played with lots of different
stuff and this is really what I feel
like is the best for me personally and
and I think it translates well for a lot
of people because of the agility and
speed and Herot to this design yeah you
should see this guy flinging around the
racecourse you do a 180 without
scrubbing any speed it's kind of insane
and actually to give you guys an example
because I raced with cabinet you know
not every weekend I wish I could make it
to every weekend this event but but I
don't know how well you're gonna be able
to get that Shannon but this is my like
basher quad right there and you can see
that there's a little camera on the
front yeah so this is just a little
camera nice notice it's tilted up and
the reason for the up tilt is is that
when you're flying you know you're going
like this so this would be my camera is
level that's kind of the attitude of my
quadcopter we compare that to yours over
here yeah yeah you're damn near sideways
Kevin right so hopefully that gives you
kind of an eye
the difference in speed and and and just
the balls eNOS of this this is a really
awesome build thanks for sharing this
with us yeah everybody check these out
and with that we're gonna take a quick
break but man Kevin again thanks I did
the most amazing thing this morning I
had an idea and I brought it onto the
Internet let me tell you how I did it I
went over to domain.com and I used their
epic domain discovery system to help me
find the perfect domain and then the
quick and simple checkout system had my
website up and online in no time I'm not
lying guys this is literally what I did
like a couple hours ago and I used
coupon code hak5 you know why because
domain calm has been supporting hak5 for
years they love what we do they love you
guys and I'm gonna hook you up and
that's why we have that special code
that saves you 15% off so I just want to
remind you guys that you should tweet at
domain.com and say hey thanks for
supporting act 5 all these years and
then when you're thinking about getting
your next domain go to domain com2
Shannon and I do get your website up an
online real quick and easy when you
think domain names think domain.com that
just about wraps up this week's episode
of hack 5 but before we get going very
exciting announcements want to clue you
in on some really cool things happening
here at the hack 5 warehouse and that is
in addition to pen test with hack 5
which is so much fun with mu bik's and
sebastian and i teaching the ins and
outs of penetration testing in a storage
Riven environment we are doing very
similarly fly with hack 5 learn all the
details of flight with hack 5 calm and
join us in our very first workshops as
we will be teaching the ins and outs
with us the experts with kevin with josh
it's gonna be so much fun building and
flying fpv quadcopter x' so Walker you
know walk in not knowing anything walk
away with the heap of material tools and
have been built and learned to fly and
tune your very first quadcopter it's
exciting stuff yeah it's gonna be it's a
really fun endeavor for us to do we are
so passionate about it we have done
similar stuff at the hack 5 open houses
and so we're like hey let's take it to
the next logical level and it just makes
sense that we could just standardize on
a craft that we can all come together
and build and learn
all of the stuff hands-on more than we
can ever try to bestow to you in a
half-hour episode of hack 5 and of
course if you are new here you can check
out our new videos our welcome to hack 5
videos over on YouTube or hack 5 org
hopefully that will introduce some new
concepts to your friends and get some
more people watching this show really
appreciate your support and if you have
any questions or concerns that you want
to throw our way you can always email us
feedback at hack 5 org and you know
what's being a FAQ 5 or give you go to
the homepage now you'll find the details
on meetups all around the world as we
hack across the planet so going I
already happened
it may have been because we were
recording before we leave but that's
where you'll find details on Tokyo as
well as Sydney and the Gold Coast and
who knows who knows where we'll go next
it's really exciting because people are
emailing us and being like hey
opportunities await and so it's really I
want to go to Ireland well there you go
you should have an Ireland Alexis I was
about to say if you go to Dublin there's
one man you need to meet yeah hey with
that said very excited that you guys
have been helping us live the dream make
this happen you can continue supporting
us directly if you would like over at
hack shop calm a chicken shop calm
that's where you can find all of the
penetration testing equipment that we
put so much love into at this very own
warehouse so thank you so much for that
thanks for subscribing and stick your
comments below and we'll check them out
there you go stick your comments below
there you go I with that said i'm darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse trust to
techno West
oh stop it you're scaring when you do
that face you're making the audience sad
look at them hold 800 doleful day Scott
there's subtitles right I why can't I
see them
Oh what if they like just popped up but
they were backwards and I had to go like
this to see them be really cool yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
