Derby con 6.0 recharge in Louisville
Kentucky hello welcome to hack 5 my name
is Gerren kitchen my name is Jana Morris
igloo does a techno list we've just got
back from Derby car yes I get I
literally just walked onto the site
notice fine yeah that's really great
mmm how we do it here please send us an
animated gif of how to pronounce
Louisville I know how to pronounce it
okay
it's Louisville nobody and I just said
it's like that little bit you said
Louisville oh whatever
I think you said Louisville it's Louie
you gotta have the the like southern
thing in there real oh all right
Louisville there we go so today we have
a couple of interviews first off we
interviewed Dave Kennedy about being one
of the cofounders of derbycon and we
also talked to a couple of guys who did
the hack my Derby contest I'm very
excited about it they won this contest
and you know I'll let them speak for
itself but before we get to those hey it
wouldn't be a hacker con without coming
home Snickers yay this one even says
have a beer have a breakthrough you know
the ladder fails at least you had a beer
oh that's cool
that's from Sky dog con and that is not
the sticker the sticker is on this side
I just peel off the wrong end anyway I
know how to work these let's go ahead
and sticker up the wall and Dave Kennedy
for president I think that's my favorite
one right I have to say the Dave Kennedy
for president with of course the clown
Kennedy that's the one that is the one
so we hope that you guys can make it out
to Tudor become sometime it is a
fantastic con we have so much fun every
time we go we'll be definitely adding
that one back into the rotation a
special place for you and yeah so we
will see you guys on the other side as
we sticker up this amazing wall thank
you for the stickers Derby con Dave
what's new
Darren what's up well we're just
wrapping up Derby con I think I've got
about four hours of sleep in the past
five days so I'm I feel great well I
mean it's three to one in action right
that's right that's right I mean you
know I think the conference went well
though and
exciting and I think a lot of people
have fun and I actually can't wait for
next year so this is the sixth Derby con
right that's right we started this six
years ago and that's our six run time
runnin and I think we get better every
year I've heard nothing but good things
happening we had the with hain't clan on
Friday we had a panty raid on Saturday
and dual-core and whitey cracker I mean
it's just off the hook and the talks I
mean just amazing so were you expecting
it to be like this like on the first
year no no and we had no idea what we
still have no idea we're doing but you
know it's it's funny you know every year
we get a little bit less you know
ill-prepared on certain things that we
do so I think this year I was one of the
smoothest that we've had I think the
attendees had a great time and you know
just one big family which was what we're
trying to accomplish here and just the
kind of the vibe and the feel everybody
here just awesome yeah what would you
use to describe like the difference
between your typical hacker con and what
you guys are developing here yeah I
remember you know for me it was DEFCON 9
was my first Def Con and Alexis Park
where you know you got to hang around
with folks and just kind of meet people
and and talk to people that you knew in
the industry and you know me coming up
in the industry I wasn't it you know no
one knew who Dave Kennedy was or
anything like that and I remember you
know talking to the shmoo group and
hanging out with them and Bruce Potter
and you know call the deck house and all
those folks and you know it's just one
big group of collaboration and you know
they kind of inspired me to you know
move forward and try to progress and
learn and that's what we really try I
wanted to try to recreate here is you
know you can go up to anybody
everybody's approachable I was having a
great time we're all learning or all
sharing but we're also teaching the next
generation of folks what we need to do
to make the industry better and that's
really what the feel that we want here
so as well how do you like quantify that
that what is the element that maintains
that kind of camaraderie and that vibe
that you're you're trying to achieve
well I think it all starts from from
what we want the con to be like you know
when we start the opening ceremonies for
example it's a family feel everybody's
onstage you know you only meet everybody
or outside we're talking everybody we're
downstairs you know and and everything
from the you know the outside con you
know that happens on the floor outside
you know and at the bar I'll whip
through through the entire conference I
think it just gives the whole vibe
throughout the entire thing and I mean
it's it's a combination of the folks
that are right in the conference but I
also think it has everything to do with
what the attendees want to get out of it
because they really are the ones that
make the conference so I think you know
having folks like yourself being
approachable when I saw you out there
you know hanging out with folks and
talking to them I mean there's no
cliques there's no barriers you know
it's really breaking down those walls
and trying to you know come up with what
we did can do to make this industry
better and I think that's the vibe that
you get you've kept it really small is
do what you say that's like an aspect of
that yeah that's that's one of the
biggest things we struggle with you know
as Derby con gets more and more popular
you know you run the risk of you know
selling tickets at extremely fast and it
you know becoming very difficult to kind
of find everything and I think you know
that's what we really try to play with
is if we do decide to grow the
conference you know what does that mean
and do we do it in a way that you could
still keep the feel and that's something
that we battle with so I'm not sure if
we're gonna grow it foe continuously the
same size we'll probably do maybe a
combination both in kind of play with it
and see what makes the best sense but we
like where it's at now we like to feel
where it's at now we really don't want
to change that too much so I think we'll
keep it going away it's at awesome and
it was there were like one major change
that he made this year that stood out to
you well I have to say that that the the
bands this year I don't know how we're
gonna top it you know with hearing the
wu-tang clan come you know met the man
about a man I mean they just rocked the
house the party was honest and obviously
I'm a little bit biased on their be kind
of from but it's the best con party I've
ever been to in my entire life so I
think we went all on that I think the
balance that we did on the scheduling
this year we had a very good balance of
incident response you know scada
offense and defense there's a lot of
defensive talks here this year a lot of
PowerShell talks a Microsoft keynoting
you know the folks that made PowerShell
so those are all the key things that you
know we really tried doing to make this
conference you know really balance a lot
of different folks so I think it turned
out well cool and then before we get
going I want to hear like because I just
saw some amazing stuff from Clio and
Beirut using set I know that there's
been some awesome additions to it what's
what's new and set and what's coming so
I'm actually working on the latest
version of set which has a lot of
different office keishon techniques in
it around PowerShell injection which you
know is still one of the top methods
that we typically use for exploitation
I just added the SMS spoofing module
because I'm mr. robot and everybody's
bugging me to put it back in there so I
put the SMS module back in recently but
the new module should be really awesome
coming on and I should have hopefully I
that's on the next two weeks so I really
afford to the new version is set there's
also the pentesters framework which is a
framework
building your own pant that's
distribution that's been getting a lot
of popularity I push a new version out
for that so a lot of good stuff coming
out from though from the open source
sighs for sure absolutely where can
people find those the github pages or
whatever they have you because if you're
not playing with social engineering
toolkit you have to be github.com slash
trust at SAC all the open-source
projects are right there so if it's it
there and that's that's ringing download
them all and it's got user manuals and
everything you need rad dude Dave it is
been a pleasure I love that this is the
hugging con keep it going and we'll see
you next year here at Derby con 2016 and
I'm finding about a hacking your Derby
hanging your Derby and here to join me
and explain the whole lot is agent 66
hello how you doing good morning and
gang Grif morning so what is hack your
Derby so hack your Derby is a contest
where you take your average Derby hat
and then you make it do things that
Derby hats generally don't do well what
what is it the Derby hats generally do
do well Derby hats generally sit on your
head and look fashionable
well I mean we are in Kentucky and
looking fashionable is quite important
so I understand that there are two
different types of aspects of this
conference can you kind of mohawk or
sorry aspects of this contest can you
walk me through that sure you have your
homegrown Derby right Nate and then you
also have your build onsite Derby so
they give you a plastic derby or what
have you and you have to build with what
you have in the 30 hours or less and
present his he has time to mature make
it nice look really fashionable and
functional
all right I love the maker aspect the
hacker aspect of this and and just like
altering something to do something
completely different than it was
originally intended I love the absurdity
of hats and of course you know act 5 we
love having the system so what was your
inspiration behind your hat so when I
first heard about the contests a few
years ago this is what I had pictured I
pictured that it wasn't since it's a
hacker con right I pictured a hat that
people could try to break into when it
said hack your Derby and when I found
out that that wasn't quite what it was I
thought well why don't I build that and
see what it does you know see how it see
how it goes so how do i hack your Derby
so there's a website hack my Derby com
which will take you to the scoreboard
site which has the rules and information
about how to play and whatnot and then
once you've seen that you can then it
takes you to other external links like
web hack my Derby which actually goes
through a reverse reverse VPN tunnel
from AWS to my hat alright so they go
they hit the web but the web is hitting
your hat is hitting the web is hitting
my head it is it is I am serving live
web pages and SSH and believe it or not
an old mud from the late 90s
oh dude wait hang on which mud its
circle mud okay I may remain out of
played aardwolf mud regardless that is
fantastic so your so your hat is so I
get that you've got you know Wi-Fi on
your hat that that means that I don't
have to actually be in proximity of your
hat to hack it right so there's two ways
to connect to it a because I wasn't sure
how cell service was gonna be here at
the con there is a small Wi-Fi adapter
which gets me about 20 yards proximity
where you can just connect to it it'll
hand you a name server and those same
names I just gave you will still resolve
so have you had hackers following you
around with laptops the entire
conference just trying to stay within
proximity of you that's that's sort of
how it worked last year because I didn't
have the cellular connection but so
that's why we added that this year so if
you're not connected to the local
wireless you just use the commodity
internet and you can get to the same hat
so I connect to your hat over Wi-Fi or
through the web and what do I get when I
connect so if you connect the other web
you get a basically a dummy corporation
that I call called or that I made up
called Derby Corp it's not to be
confused with derpy Corp sure it's it's
it's their their their goal as a company
is to make data centers and hats because
they're more secure because your data is
always with you it's good to diversify
your business as well so you're not too
dependent on one vertical exactly
exactly so you know they also make the
the stovepipe cluster fantastic ok so
there are then a set of challenges to
what break into their network or one so
the the the idea of the corporation was
to give you like the feel like you're
actually interacting with something
right
so so so if you're on a pen test
engagement for example it's not just
nameless things that you're working on
it's you're working for a company right
to try to break into stuff so that's why
I did all of it so I made a whole bunch
of funny inside jokes for the the
website for the the fake company that
you know make references to a bunch of
silly things there's there was even a
reference to TCP / carrier Pidgeon to
try to get inner data center
connectivity working nice so can you
walk me through the hardware of the Hat
cuz I'm really interested in this play
on the side and I see some antennas what
is going on here right sure so here let
me I don't know how well you'll be able
to see it on camera but basically we've
got a Raspberry Pi zero which runs
raspbian and docker and then inside the
docker containers there's a web service
there's the mud there's a DNS server and
then there's the there's a shell server
right so you can SSH into one and and
whatnot the screen on the side is
basically an advertised loop that says
you know where the website is and
whatnot
if you connect to the SSH container
however one of the two of the flags I'm
not gonna tell you how to get them are
you run this script and it actually asks
you a question and the question is about
a certain thing that occurred at Derby
Con 2012 which was very amusing and if
you answer it right you get the chance
to put in a string which will then show
up on the screen so you see you can see
that there's this loop of things
happening beneath the the header here
like right there it says add hacking
Dave that's his message somebody put in
so it ends up on the screen it gets
added to the loop it plays that for the
rest of the conference that's cool and
then the rest of it is okay so the rest
of it is all right inside of here the
antenna is for the cellular device I've
got this this cheap cellular to 3G
adapter that I got this connects via
Project Phi Google's project fly I've
got an Adafruit our link Wi-Fi adapter
in there that's what does the access
point I've rigged up a switch because
you know raspberry PI's don't have an
on/off switch and that's kind of a pain
in the butt when you don't have a
display or a keyboard connected I have
this little battery controller also from
Adafruit and a small internal battery
that gets me like five minutes of
runtime so that I can interchange
batteries during the conference without
having to take the thing offline because
after all I'm assisted man enough times
important you got like a little UPS
battery backup system
Kirby's got a UPS I can't wait to see
the iterations of this I want to see the
data center hat next have you documented
any of this if anybody that's otherwise
going to derbycon and wants to kind of
like iterate on this so I completely
wrote up last year's Derby a there was a
presentation I did here in one of the
stable talks so if you look up iron
geeks website and find his videos it was
on Sunday toward the end of the day so
that's one thing you can watch I also
presented it besides Delaware last year
that's on YouTube you can look it up I
think I called it I put a data center in
my hat or something like that
and I also wrote it about a blog entry
on my own website which is underground
which is und our ground org slash hmd
for hack my Derby 2015 that was last
year's build I'll probably write up
another one under hmd 2016 once I have
the time to write this one up three aim
time how long did it take you to put all
this together so I had learned a lot
from last year's so this year it was
just get me a parts list get the parts
ordered and I did that in like May or
June but then I didn't earnestly start
working on it until maybe August or so I
got maybe 2030 hours into the building
all right you my friend did not have
2030 hours over the course of months
however agent 66 tell me about your
experience and what your Derby does ok
so experience is really cool Nate was a
big help so was a few others he also
vino phage and we basically use a lot of
the spare parts that he had to construct
this so this is basically composed of a
Wi-Fi pineapple that's just searching
for probes the probes are getting
written to a file thanks to Wi-Fi
pineapples great architecture and then
we're paying it to a PI 0 the PI 0 is
going through parsing the information
after it runs through a script and we're
just displaying the top 5 vendors that
are being recognized in the area so it's
it's very simplistic next year I think
will be cooler so so you're actually
just checking out the oh you eyes of the
MAC addresses a bit of the devices that
are probing and then just showing us he
you know top 5 vendors
so Intel of course and then you'll have
you know Apple of course yes essentially
that's what it's doing yep
we kind of modified what you had and
made a little little quicker the
interesting thing about this hat outside
of you know everybody's interested in
the Wi-Fi pineapple is all the adhesive
for everything that's in here if you
think hacked five stickers pilfered from
the booth exactly so and this is your
first hack my derby entry first one in
my first time at Derby con yeah oh
fantastic well it's a great con I'm
honored to see the pineapple being used
in such a manner how did you guys do in
the contest we both took first place in
the in the two categories so I got first
place in the in the home built and he
got first place in the the build on site
nice it's awesome to be hanging out with
the rune drawers guys this has been a
true pleasure please give me a shoutout
where can people find you guys on social
media and all that so I think the the
easiest way to find me is look me up on
key base key based I owe slash gang
Griffin alright we'll be exchanging keys
soon an agent 66 you can find me on
Twitter websites not currently
functional but just agent 66 rad thanks
so much guys I look forward to seeing
the iterations next year this was
awesome and this is the kind of
creativity that I love seeing at through

our summer open house series where we
did competitive drone racing and
battling drone battle Club and it
occurred to me we shouldn't share that
dog Club love because when domain.com
told me about dock club and all of the

extra radios in a 24 thousand milliamp
per battery I've since updated it with a
Raspberry Pi 3 in a Wi-Fi pineapple

keep saying that now I really want to
know the interesting thing that happened
in 2012 that's a fun way to put it I'm
assuming it's NSFW was during the party

something at the party and again again
we're obfuscating lots here there were
three items in the bag an alpha wireless
card a bottle of champagne and a box of
condoms sounds like a good time it was
