login forms forever21 got hacked and
snowden releases his very own mobile
security system all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I am Shannon
Morrison this is threat wire for January
2nd 2018 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom happy new year our patreon is
over at patreon.com slash threat wire
and that is always the best way to
support the show and will help us reach
our next goal this next goal opens up a
special Q&amp;amp;A between me and all of our
patrons plus it helps me upgrade the set
as well an FYI if you'll be in Las Vegas
next week for CES 2018 I'll be having a
meet-up with my friends at daily tech
news show and tech thing including
Patrick Norton it will be on Tuesday
January 9th at 8 p.m. at the level up
arcade and bar in the MGM Grand it's a
brand new bar so we're gonna check it
out
no signup needed just show up and hang
out and I'll put a link to the details
below in the show notes and now on to
the news so John shared today's top
story on patreon in by the way if you
are a patron over on patreon share your
top story picks on the community tab of
patreon to be featured in a post by
Princeton Center for Information
Technology Policy researchers identified
a new way for third-party scripts to
exfiltrate a user's username or email
information from a site by exploiting
the browser's password manager now many
different browsers very popular ones
including Firefox and Chrome have a
built-in tool to save passwords
usernames credit card details addresses
so that you can ship to yourself all
sorts of information these details are
automatically filled upon visiting a
site that matches the credentials now
this is a little bit different from
third-party extensions like LastPass or
one password for the built-in browser
tool an attacker could use the tool to
track a user's web traffic with a script
built into the website without the user
knowing though cross-site scripting
attacks are common for built-in autofill
tools this one in particular is the
first to use the tool not
steal password credentials but to track
a user's web traffic in order for this
to happen the user chooses to save their
login credentials for a website in the
browser like normal then whenever they
visit some page on the same domain like
for example if they visit a sub header
the new page will include a third-party
tracking script that is hidden
completely hidden from the user in it
turns out it's a login form
so the browser auto fills it thinking
that it's a login page the email address
is then hashed and sent to a third-party
server potentially for advertising now
of the top 1 million sites 1000 were
using this type of hidden tracking since
browsers do not require human
interaction to autofill at least the
user name or email address this attack
works the third-party script which is
written in JavaScript then saves that
data and since a username or email
address generally does not require any
kind of change on a site even clearing
cookies are using incognito mode or
switching to a new device will not
prevent it from happening while the data
is hashed before sent it is not
necessarily anonymous since it is hashed
via md5 sha-1 or sha-256
and it is not salted the two scripts are
run by ad think and on audience now
since the first party which is the
website owner is embedding the code for
a third party the login form then
technically this is working as promised
but since the data is being used
surreptitiously for something other than
simply logging in it creates a trust
between the user and the third party
that simply should not be there now how
can this be prevented
all right so website owners can put
login forms on a separate domain that
pop up during the login third-party
frameworks can also be isolated users
can also install ad blockers or tracking
protection and not use the built-in
autofill options in the browser browsers
could also force user interaction before
autofill occurs now if this happens then
the user would not be able to interact
with the hidden login form because it is
hidden given that most of our audience
over here is male you probably are not
directly impacted by this breach but a
spouse a friend or a family member may
have been or you if you have purchased a
gift for the women
watch my show all 5% of us listen up
forever21 announced last week that they
were targeted in a hack from April 3rd
all the way to November 18th 2017 where
point-of-sale systems in several
different stores across the United
States were infected with malware that
stole credit card information from
customers forever 21 did not announce
how many customers were at risk but they
did explain that credit card numbers
expiration dates verification codes and
some cardholder names were all stolen in
the hack originally forever21
announced an incident on November 14th
but did not know all of the details at
that time this is an update to that news
release with clear impact now no cards
were used on their online store that
were affected it was just in their
stores forever 21 states that many
pointed sale devices did not have
encryption enabled for some reason which
allows the malware to intercept
unencrypted data from tracks on credit
cards
now not all point-of-sale systems in the
affected stores were breached and the
dates varied from store to store some
were breached for weeks
some were breached for months some were
just a few days forever 21 did not name
which stores were affected but there is
an ongoing investigation recently Edward
Snowden who is most notable for his
leaks of NSA documents several years ago
released a new Android application
through his company called freedom of
the press foundation the app which is
named Haven is designed to be left in
your hotel room as a mobile security
system that should alert you of any kind
of sound or movement while you are gone
I ended up tweeting about this stating
that I would use it on a burner phone as
I would not be caught dead leaving my
real phone unattended to which Snowden
himself replied that is the essential
idea you install it on your unused phone
as a spare set of eyes and it will send
alerts to your real phone then the
primary could be iOS or Android it
doesn't matter which what's more
important as Haven does not need an
active plan as it can simply communicate
over Wi-Fi or Ethernet with tor or
signal so Thank You Snowden I am
probably on some kind of list now if I
wasn't already and
say if you are listening I would love it
if my husband cleaned up the dishes when
I get home from work today it uses the
cameras the microphones and the
accelerometers to monitor for motion and
disturbance in the room it'll capture
anything that happens whether it's a
maid cleaning or a lock-picker entering
your room or an NSA agent messing with
your electronics the picture or audio
will be sent to your real phone over
whichever text messaging you prefer now
by using signal the data transferred is
encrypted end-to-end if you choose
signal a user can also configure it to
work with or bot which is a tor app for
Android if you work with highly
sensitive information if you're a
journalist if you're an activist or like
me you simply go to hacker cons this
could be deemed useful to you Haven is
free it's open source and it's currently
available in the Google Play Store and
you can bet I will be doing a review on
either hack 5 or tech thing thank you
again to all of the wonderful people out
there who contribute to patreon.com

little bit helps us grow the show and in
return you will get access to a bunch of
extras on patreon we might even feature
your adorable furry baby in an upcoming
episode just like these ones I love
checking out your fur babies so thank
you so much for sending them in patrons
