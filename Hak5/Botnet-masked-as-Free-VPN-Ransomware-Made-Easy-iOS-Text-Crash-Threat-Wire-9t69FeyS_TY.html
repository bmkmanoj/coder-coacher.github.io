twitter and snapchat a free ransomware
builder takes a twenty percent cut and a
free VPN service it comes out of costs
I'll give you a hint it's a botnet all
that more coming up now on threat wire
i'm darren kitchen and this is threat
wire for friday may 29th 2015 your
summary of the threat to our security
privacy and internet freedom and a huge
mad props to all of our patrons that
have been helping us bring back the show
in a big way and with that let's get
started because you know what's really
fun crashing your friends iphone that's
right you can send a text message with
these non latin characters and as so
eloquently described by Popular
Mechanics the string of Unicode
characters processed by the iOS text
rendering service their core text will
cause the phone to reboot when it's
rendered in the notification area which
is kind of hilarious and while it's
really fun to reboot your friends phones
by using text messages security
researchers have discovered that other
apps such as Twitter and snapchat can be
used to deliver the malicious text as
well the bug affects most Apple products
including the iPhone iPad and Apple
watch and Mac users can experience the
bug to they'd have to receive the string
of Unicode characters in the terminal
Apple has issued a bulletin
acknowledging the bug and offering a
workaround that is using Siri to reply
to the malicious message in order to
prevent the iphone crashing you can also
just go ahead and disable the
notifications altogether I'm sure there
will be a patch soon ransomware has been
on the rise and mainly because it's
effective and lucrative and unlike your
typical malicious virus which will I
don't know delete your data ransomware
actually encrypts your data and holds
you hostage until you pay for the
decryption key usually with bitcoin
bitcoin so if you're the malicious or
you could make some money in this highly
illegal and unethical way but if you're
particularly entrepreneurial you may
consider acting as a ransomware
man-in-the-middle that is what a new
ransomware service does it goes by the
name of talks and talks users can sign
up and create their own customized
ransomware in just a few simple steps
providing the dollar amount for the
ransom and
our own threatening text and the talk
service will go ahead and generate a two
megabyte windows screensaver vile which
if run will set up a tour client and
then you know the victim will use the
command line curl tool to communicate
with the talks back end and if the
victim pays the ransom Moulton talks is
going to cut you in a t20 splits getting
hit with the windows centric malware is
similar to the other ways just please
urge your friends the non techie type to
stop double-clicking on every random
executable they come across on the web
considering the simplicity of talks
itself the ransomware I mean pretty much
all it does is replace the dollar amount
and the threatening message so it's
pretty likely the antivirus vendors are
going to have signatures rather quickly
more and more media companies are using
geofencing as a means to lock down
content it's a technique where companies
only let viewers from IP addresses known
to be within their country to view the
content you can think like the BBC
iPlayer and from a technical standpoint
it's pretty terrible practice because
the internet was not developed with
borders in mind and it's actually pretty
easy to circumvent these restrictions in
recent years VPNs have become a
preferred way to mask your internet
traffic is having originated from
another country and you know partly
because of the increase in geo fenced
premium content and also because the
extremely low cost of VPN services now
and one such service hola hola hola
we'll go with whole lot offers its users
a free VPN but there may be some strings
attached Jolla is ridiculously easy to
install and set up on Chrome it's just a
simple extension and a few clicks you'll
be up and running and once installed
your computer becomes part of a well it
becomes both a client to a VPN and a
server for someone else's traffic it's
kind of like tour except without the
anonymity layer and then everyone is
also an exit node and you know what it
means to Jolla is that they can provide
a service just by peering everyone
together instead of spending its own
resources it's a cool idea until oh lawd
just goes his head and starts selling
its clients resources as reported by
torrentfreak hola generates additional
revenue by selling its clients idle
bandwidth through its Luminati brand and
the service allows anyone to make HTTP
requests
through its vast subscriber base
basically it's a botnet for hire and
it's on the backs of the unwitting users
now this came to light recently when the
forum eight chan was hit with a
distributed denial-of-service attack
that was traced back to Jolla users
Jolla is claiming that the practice is
clearly spelled out in its terms of
service and if users don't want to be
part of the botnet basically they can
pay five dollars a month for the premium
VPN you know I read this story and
honestly all I want to do is set up a
whole love EPN on my virtual machines
and then go ahead and like sniff all the
HTTP and secure draft coming out of them
is that terrible let me know your
thoughts you can leave those in the
comments below and before i go i do want
