you by domain.com OOP hello gonna hack
five my name is Harry what
that's how you doing I have a knife in
my pocket I have a knife right here I'm
Shannon Morse welcome to this week's
episode of hak5 for keeping mistakes we
take this show very seriously this is
the show where you can go to trust your
technolo wait what do we say week making
tech misbehave I'm not really sure we
have epic awesome stuff going on and I'm
I'm enthused this is we're shooting out
of order because this is the last chance
i'm gonna be here before heading over to
the hack across europe if you haven't
already signed up in your in the
European Economic Area or whatever you
guys call it now hit up hack across
Europe com see how you can come out to
some of the meetups I know we will be in
berlin amsterdam Dublin London we'll see
if we can make it anywhere all the
places so just the places what happens
that sounds super fun huh you're gonna
see sad yes except will be my spotter
for the droning we'll talk about a
little later oh yes well speaking of
fans and our awesome viewers we got a
gift from a few yes we did I am very
excited about this we have no I had
little idea but we have not seen what's
in this box and but there we go i got a
knife right here in our new tactical
elite bag huh oh you got all these rough
huh I'm am either Kershaw those guys are
the best the onion leith i want to say
yes it's a Ken Onion design that's
called the leak mine is better what are
you talking about i might have teeth
yeah i know we don't need teeth it's a
yeah you always need teeth but it's tape
it's packing care i use this to open up
letters okay fine we'll see whose knife
is me okay um so this right here is an
awesome
design by our friend by andreas and you
can find his stuff oh look that is so
easy do you not have in trouble on my
end pissing uh yeah by andreas on
twitter and you can find his website by
andreas com he's got some ridiculously
awesome designs oh is this what I think
it is hola my housewarming gift is a
little late but enjoy the ride for the
ride oh that's cool Oh has wheels and
everything whoa skateboard hey got a sec
and it's got a caring what does it say
it says thought you should thought you
should cruise Europe and style like a
rock I've never seen a board with up
efforts they come forth with a strap
skateboard purse it's a well supposedly
this is also functional so let's let's
give it a looksie so I said get some
grip tape here oh oh it's got crypt oh
wow wow that's cool I'm wow that's me
super impressive never seen anything
like this a board with like a leather
strap big one yeah but here's here's
what I'm really excited about I have not
seen this oh oh yes that's so cool
that's kind of wicked this this is
ridiculous not a sticker or anything oh
man that is cool yeah maybe we will have
to get bring back I think we should add
at the end yeah you know it don't look
really good right there right I'm saying
oh I think it was WOW okay this is
probably just about the most RAB gift
from a fan we've ever received so
everybody should go and check out by
andreas by andreas on twitter com monkey
now um dude look at the wheels on this
thing and I try it yeah here okay thanks
that's done lyosha too yeah well of
course it is
oh nice and smooth especially on this
carpet okay well maybe at the end of the
show we'll get you doing a kickflip oh
yeah like I can do one of those okay
well I used to be able to you in high
school this is this is seriously rad
have never seen anything so meticulous
the course skating is concerned I mean
look at the leather on anywhere whatever
okay um getting totally sidetracked here
we should probably get into some led
goods some actuals so I you know here's
actually here's the thing this is all
about the gear I don't know you guys
know this but one of the reasons why we
started hak5 is because we needed an
excuse to buy fancy camera equipment
because we have this thing called techno
lust and it drives us to want cool
things like electric skateboard cameras
and drones and fun things of that nature
so yes we got a really good video yes we
did Wes by this guy named Aussie klutz
and he basically said hey I wanted to
explain to you guys why you're not
changing the voltage on an LED you're
actually changing it the pulse width
modulation to make it actually pulse
whatever your you have a LED that's
fading from like on to off yeah I felt
so embarrassed when I said that I knew
the moment and I know right now I
thought I was saying it wrong but I'm
like I don't know what the esoteric
pneus of an LED view thing called again
changing the amperage changing voltage
either it turns out in a way it's kind
of changing the voltage from on and off
uh on and off but it just depends on the
speed of the photon all right whatever
okay so so we sent this crazy handy
video we basically explained the
positive negative charges that and how
they apply to light emitting diodes or
LEDs and why when you're fading an LED
you're not changing the voltage but the
duty cycle of the photons with pulse
width modulation so the part of the LED
that creates light is called a semi
conductor and that's the itty-bitty
little metal part that's inside of an
LED and this is inside of the casing so
it's you can see it if you have a clear
casing you have to give the LED enough
voltage to rid this rid this little semi
conductor of this little area that's in
the very middle of it and it's called a
depletion region it sounds weird that's
way more than I read when I was getting
into a theory for it yeah so so he
explained it really well but I'm just
going to kind of grease over it so this
little depletion region it acts out as
sort of an inductor or an insulator for
the middle of the semi conductor what
you need to do when you're giving your
LED power with that voltage you want to
basically make that depletion area
disappear so the more voltage you give
it the more those positive side of those
positive charged electrons are going to
push towards the middle and the more the
negative ones are going to push towards
the middle too and once you get all of
your positive ones and all of your
negative ones pushing towards the middle
fast enough it makes that depletion
range disappear and then your LED lights
up okay but as far as my terrible
expertise but is force feeding is
concerned it's not actually just varying
the voltage actually not using a little
bit of human trickery here isn't it so
we asked about pulse width modulation in
fact in a weird sense when we talked
about signal theory yes signal theory
right when we told you antennas things
like time division multiplexing pulse
amplitude modulation things of that
nature and really it's just we this is
when we had the whole discussion about
hurts right and then I started punching
you once per second and that's a hurt
right so this is it hurts too which is
interesting interesting enough so it
changes the speed of the photons in the
LED so both pulse width modulation that
happens several several times a minute
it can happen tens of thousands if he
needs to go fast enough for so for
example a little light dimmer that you
would have in your household you know to
just dim your lights that you have up in
your ceiling that might change at 120
Hertz i found that number off of
Wikipedia so it has a pretty fast speed
but other things can get up into the
tens of thousands hurts and that's
basically a waveform that shows the
speed of the change from on to off
you're never going to go in the middle
basically you're you're always going to
be binary the ones and zeros yeah it's
always ones and 0.5 no there's not so
pulse pulse width modulation is measured
in duty cycles and duty cycle is going
to tell you how
many times it goes from on to off or off
to on this can be anywhere between one
hundred percent duty cycle which means
that would be on a hundred percent of
the time all the way to zero percent
which would mean that it's all all the
time off so that this would be like
fifty percent duty cycle if I'm doing
that yeah right we're just like half the
time it's on and half the time it's off
yeah exactly and if you do it like where
you're you're off most of the time but
you're on for like a split second it
could be like you know twenty percent
duty cycle or whatever it might be right
the cool thing about the arduino stuff
is they actually take care of a lot of
this they come up with like values like
brightness to kind of like break it down
to like a human form with very values
between 0 and 255 so that you don't have
to think about what it's actually doing
so speaking of that and while you do
that I'm going to grab the thing to joke
so basically you have a couple of
different examples with the code that I
showed about two weeks ago if you have
an LED that's at 255 brightness that's
the biggest 8-bit number that you can
get to 55 would be on pretty much all
the time that's the highest brightness
that you can get it would be a hundred
percent on so it means that it's a
hundred percent of the photons per
second that it can actually light up or
release from the LED so that means it
would be a hundred percent duty cycle
now if you have an LED that's on zero
brightness in your code or off then
it'll be zero percent of the time zero
photons will be given off from the LED
so it's zero percent duty cycle so if i
started my LED at 128 which is about
half that would be fifty percent of the
time fifty percent duty cycle and then
there's a lot of really complicated math
involved in there but i just say look
that up because i don't even it's still
really cool in fact i've got an example
here and we'll be talking about this a
little bit later on we get into the
drone goodness so you can't see it with
your eyes but it's changing no this
shows up on the camera you can so what
this is doing is it's fading in and out
you can totally see that on camera and
i'll just set this down here for you
Paul but this pulse width modulation is
fast enough that you're not going to see
it go back to off any of that time while
it's fading from zero all the way to one
percent right and you know what's
interesting the reason that that works
is in this
comes to like a totally different
discipline and you can see how they're
all totally intermingled something that
Paul is keen on when it comes to the
video of things and that is a theory
that is persistence of vision and it's
the reason why we have things like 20 of
a frame rate of 24 frames per second in
film or 30 frames per second on
television if you're here in North
America or maybe 25 frames per second if
you're in Europe it's also the same
reason why CRT monitors you remember
those old big things we would love to
land parties for real I think so well it
might be in the Attic we gotta hook up
on a free e-cycling place but anyway uh
that 75 hurts was your typical but even
some people could see like a 75 hurt
like refresh rate and a monitor the way
that they would display this especially
if it's interlaced and and that's why I
like the higher the refresh rate is
usually like smoother that's why you see
TVs now touting 60 hers 120 Hertz 240
hertz so the higher your hurts the less
you're going to see that difference in
the pulse width modulation right i mean
the theory is that for moving images
that the human brain will be tricked or
you know the the flicker fusion
threshold as it's called is something
like 16 frames per second now that does
not mean we're about to start uploading
hak5 videos of 16 FPS because you will
all get sick but you know it comes into
like a lot of different things like
fluorescent lights how they I don't know
what the frequency is of those maybe it
is 120 hertz but I guess different
different you know light fixtures
different you know disciplines like you
know videography and light and all of
these other things rely on this exact
technique that you're talking about
pulse width modulation and even
different species like pigeons I guess
supposedly have like a higher
persistence of vision or a higher
education threshold than humans this is
one of those it's it's easy to
understand once you see some examples
like the fading LED but it's it's
surprising that this is used all over
the world for all sorts of different
things like once you understand it
you're like oh there's some there's
something you don't know about that and
you know what
I love is yes it is fantastic that
Arduino does you know breaks it down for
you so that you can quite simply do
which is like the abstract adhere of I
want the brightness of my led to be
fifty percent or 128 if it's between 0
and 255 and that's a fantastic thing but
there's really happy that Aussie klutz
was like hey hey hey let me explain this
for you jealous baby Zach oh that makes
so much sense once you break it down
like that and the thing that I love
about that always is it's no longer
magic no it's not I i I'm no longer
looking at my code and being like oh
well 255 means it's on now I'm like well
that means it's a hundred percent duty
cycle like I get that although i will
say in technology there is such a thing
as voodoo magic because the other day i
was i was working on a transmitter a for
RC system and I for some reason couldn't
get the ailerons to go below zero it can
get to 1000 but not negative 1,000
played with it all night left it picked
it up the next day and everything just
magically worked that is so you all know
you know so let's not mythbuster spooky
spirits within the machines and they are
that magic smoke that we shall not let
out but thank you so much for thank you
much for sending in the explanation and
I love just kind of geeking out about
that stuff yeah I did you really really
be so cool and it's so much easier to
understand when somebody's like drawing
it out for you as a poster just reading
it on Wikipedia and don't understand
that stuff half the time I read it
uh-huh just keep reading it until you do
uh-huh and then click all the links and
read all your head first and then
nothing you know you're like wow
humpback whales wow you just keep
clicking on Wikipedia I don't wait where
do you end up let us know feedback at
now five dot org there's some good stuff
there could be really bad yeah let us
know in the comments below your favorite
time sucka Wikipedia article maybe it
leads to Kevin Bacon I don't know and
with that we're gonna take a quick break
but when we get back I'm droning on
about drones see what see what I did
there
it doesn't matter if you're into pulse
width modulation or pulse amplitude
modulation or you don't like to modulate
at all it doesn't matter because domain
com they don't discriminate they just
find you the website they get you the
domain name that you want really quickly
they've got a domain discovery system
that makes it to super simple and their
checkout process is like no BS you're
like klum website up and running no time
and that's why I keep telling you guys
because I'm huge fan of theirs because
they just they've got reliable service
they're easy to use their a fun place to
do business you can tweet them at domain
com and see what I'm talking about those
guys are kind of RAD they're huge fans
of hak5 so they want to hook you up then
put together a special coupon code that
you can use to take fifteen percent off
your next order at domain com that
coupon code of course is hak5 that
spells hak5 like it's fifteen percent
off at domain.com so when you think
domain names think domain.com it is now
time for the trivia question of the week
so last week's trivia question was to
whom was the first patent for a
technical invention awarded and the
answer is Philippa Brunelleschi I hope I
said that right if I didn't don't
correct me in the emails he was an
architect and an engineer from 1421 he
devised a barge with a hoist to be used
for bringing marble blocks up the river
from our no to Florence for the queries
at Carrera and he was the first one that
actually got awarded a patent for that
now this week's trivia question is how
many of the first Apple computers were
built you can answer that over at hak5
org slash trivia for your chance to win
some awesome hak5 goodies
six when it comes to the gear I guess
you could say I have the technical us to
think it was saying earlier that is one
of actually the determining factors of
why we even started the show because we
like to play with the equipment and Paul
will attest to that so I get a lot of
questions about you know quadcopters
UAVs drones we've done some series
before on building them with open sores
flight controllers and cool stuff like
that and then rather large but
considering that we are going on a or
you will be joining me on a trip that I
love to dub hack across Europe every
couple of February's who like to do this
I am super excited to be bringing with
me one of my fun new hobbies which is
the droning or the you know model
aircraft or the RC helicopters or that
whatever you want to call them
quadcopters right and I get this
question so much so I thought I would
just spend this segment instead of going
into like SSH tunnels and things of that
nature i thought i would answer a
constant question that i get which is
you know what are you packing as far as
your quadcopter or your drone and i want
to show you guys something special that
i put together because i just love the
the okay so another way to put it is if
i ask you what is your best camera right
now or what is your best camera when
you're traveling and and the answer may
be that you know you have a nice little
DSLR somewhere on the shelf but chances
are when you're out and about traveling
you don't have a giant DSLR in your
pocket what'd you do have as your phone
and that's why a lot of times your phone
is your best camera and so in that I've
kind of made some trade-offs and come up
with I guess what you could say is the
netbook of fpv quadcopter Xin that it is
the go everywhere do most things pretty
well kind of system and I guess I'm
excited to show you two things actually
just not just that but also this is our
new our new tactical elite kit that's
part of the Wi-Fi pineapple stuff it's
new in the hack shop I've been rocking
this for quite a while and this will be
my only tech bag in hack across Europe
so I'm excited to basically be living
out of this thing here and you know it's
large enough for like is mentioning the
netbooks
you know carrying the netbooks and
whatnot but i want to show you this kit
that have put together because i'm kind
of proud of it in that basically
everything is compartmentalized into a
few couple of different cases here so
that right there is it and then put the
bag down now this is my entire flight
system and so within the RC world there
is a lot of discussion about your a UW
or you're all up weight and that what
that means is it means the weight of
your craft when it is fully loaded and
actually flying so you may have a
quadcopter but you also have the battery
that goes in it and powers in you may
also have the camera systems that are on
in the video transmission systems and
all of the components that go into that
and I find that that's really
interesting that there's a lot of
emphasis within this community on you
know the weight and size of your craft
when it's all flying but a lot doesn't
go into the entire ground station
everything that is on your head in your
hands and back home to recharge so your
your goggles your video receivers your
transmitter and your battery recharger
zai all taken to a the equation and i
don't know what the right term is for
this all all up weight but for me as i'm
about to go backpacking it's really
about being able to take everything that
i love with me so that i can like
hopefully capture some beautiful shots
of i don't know the rhine river or or
whatever have you on on these trips and
you know there's something so surreal
about the perspective from the sky and
being able to put on a pair of goggles
and feel like a bird so i kind of want
to take that with me as i travel and so
for that i want to show you a system
that have put together that I've been
playing I've been tinkering with this
for the last year I've never really
talked about this on hak5 I'm not sure
how much of this applies to hak5 but if
we want to get into more of this later
on we can do a whole series or even spin
off some other stuff but basically this
is the kit so this this right here
contains the entire system so i have my
quadcopter i'll come back to that in a
second as well as the batteries even
more batteries my video system and the
antenna for it and the transmitter I
have my battery chargers and my cameras
for actually capturing the HD stuff I so
I'll just go over some of the things
that I like to bring with me this is a
mobius camera and it's got a nice wide
angle lens this guy here takes video
that's 1080p and kind of akin to maybe a
hero gopro hero2 kind of esque quality
still pretty good this is an 808 number
16 camera it kind of looks like a key
fob and has what they call the deal ends
on it this lens right here is 120 degree
field of view diagonally and it takes
720p video that's quite acceptable it's
also ridiculously light weight and with
a little bit of velcro kind of goes
everywhere otherwise the rest of the
system is I've got a video transmitter
here that's a 600 TVL fatshark camera
and it's actually just zip tied on to a
250 milliwatt 5.8 gig of IDEO
transmitter and the reason for that is
just that it's so light and it provides
really good video quality and that's
that's all there is to it that in a
cloverleaf antenna and we can go into
like antenna design and another show but
essentially this provides the best kind
of all-around experience and what this
does is it gets just velcroed on top of
the quadcopter here and then the flight
cameras to actually record the nice HD
video gets velcroed on to the bottom so
the quadcopters really were it's all
about so this right here is a modified
RC logger I one extreme and as you can
see what's pretty sick and modified
about it is this carbon fiber folding
frame so typically it's a plastic
quadcopter and it's actually one that I
highly recommend after you've learned on
something like an inexpensive $40 toy
like the hubsan x4 which is a great
beginner one once you've graduated from
that and you actually want to take the
next step that leads into the much more
expensive and kind of ridiculous fun RC
world the I one extreme by RC logger
does a great job of bridging that gap in
that it actually provides something that
will be that can be you
used with a typical you know big like a
transmitter like a spectrum or a futaba
or some of those others that we talked
about with Peter esten before when we
did our drone series it's cool because
you're not limited to just being you
know using some little toy transmitter
which is kind of fantastic it also has a
huge community behind it and as such
this carbon fiber frame has been
designed specifically for it by the guys
over at phoenix flight gear and I've got
to give props over to those guys and
Tony over RC drones calm and the guys
that put this together because it is
really a six set up I've had this is
probably my second yeah this is my
second I've had their first gen of this
and this is my second and what I love so
much about it is the RC logger I one
extreme it's really unique in that it is
a brushless system so these motors here
are brushless they that's really
fantastic and it's got a single PC board
that does the electronic speed
controlling it does the transmission and
you know it does the the you know the
receiver for the controller and it does
the flight controller and it's just a
basic flight controller it's got your
accelerator accelerometers or gyroscopes
in your barometers it's and I'm GPS so
this is very much a manual craft in that
sense right but it is super stable and
it's just one pc board so there's not
just a ton of stuff going everywhere as
you can see it's just that one board and
a couple of wires going to these motors
and these are upgraded t motors with
some carbon fiber props here so the
whole system basically starts out as
like a hundred dollar plastic a toy from
RC logger and then the frame i think is
like 70 or something like that but you
know you can just keep adding on but
what I get out of this is something that
I can you know take one of these
batteries plug it in here and then it
can pop on my video transmitter and as I
showed you this just fits in this tiny
little what looks like a CD case you
know if you remember what those are and
there we go you know I can I can go
ahead and fly this I can actually now
take my video transmitter and just plug
that in here and just velcro this on to
the top and that's just
tapping into the the battery lines here
and what's kind of innovative about the
RC logger system that I haven't seen in
any of the other stuff don't get me
wrong I love the open source ones like
the the nays and i love the multi way
and i love the CC 3ds and there's a
bunch of other flight controllers that
are kind of RAD except they don't do the
entire system on one ship which means
that you've got a bunch of other
components which means a lot of extra
weight and more specifically they don't
do something really innovative and that
is these battery systems so this is just
something that I hugely geeked out about
and this is basically the reason why I'm
choosing this system because when I talk
about the all up weight things like your
transmitter and maybe your video goggles
those aren't going to change much but
what you can really save a lot of weight
on is your battery system considering
the fact that typically you have to
bring a lipo charger which is a big
piece of equipment with a giant battery
but with a with a giant like Walt brick
and they're not convenient what's really
cool about these batteries is they
actually this is the charger this is
just a USB dongle and what I think is so
cool about this is this is not a while
this while this quadcopter runs I guess
you could say to sell or or eight point
4 volts these are actually two single
cell batteries bonded together and
that's why it's able to be charged by
just a regular USB 5 volt charger that's
because these are two three point seven
volts right so they kind of merge when
you get them into the quadcopter know
what it means is ridiculous space
savings in that this is all I need to
bring instead of a giant piece of
equipment so that just basically allows
me to between the carbon fiber and the
folding and the innovative batteries it
really allows me to bring together a
system anywhere just in this small
little guy of course the rest of the
gear that I'm bringing along our pair of
fat shark goggles these are pretty
standard throughout these are I think
the Dominator v2s they've got a built-in
DVR so
actually go ahead and record onto an SD
card in their same antenna same
polarization so it's right hand circular
rejects a lot of multipathing
interference and you end up looking kind
of badass i think i don't know maybe not
but they get the job done pretty well
they're pretty small and then the last
bit of kit and this is actually where
i'm doing a lot of research right now is
the transmitter and so this is the stock
transmitter that comes with the RC
logger and you may look at and laughed
and say that's a toy it looks like a
PlayStation raimo and you're absolutely
right it is it feels like a playstation
remote but it fits inside of a little
GoPro case with a couple of spare
batteries and extra parts and that means
it goes everywhere I will say however
and this is something that we're
probably going to follow up on there are
some tiny controllers that also accept
open source firmware that can be modded
to extend their range and other good
stuff like that so expect me to be
talking about some things in that nature
coming up if this is something of
interest I know I'm just geeking out
about gear right now and that's not
typical on hak5 but I am super stoked
because it is what I've been working on
for the last couple of weeks as I get
ready for this trip and I really want to
you know capture some cool area of
aerial videography and you know I want
to feel like a bird wherever I go so let
me know what you guys think because this
is something that I've totally gotten
into and if you've been following my
video blogs you'll see that it's got a
lot of stuff on there about flying and I
want to do this in in a way that we can
bring it in to act 5 we can maybe teach
builds and responsible flying and things
of that nature so yeah with that I'm
going to go ahead and drone on but you
guys let me know what you think in the
comments and I'll catch you guys later
okay full control padded Norton here
Shannon's partner on tech thing
wondering what's coming up this week
it's awesome the perfect pc toolkit 3
mail apps that make iOS better Raspberry
Pi model to a little help unlocking your
phone so come check it out at tech thing
dot-com back to you guys that just by
wraps up this week's episode of hacked
by Butler a pop-up book that's the name
of the show but i can't pronounce it
because it's only been ten years I
probably shouldn't do this hey sorry
that's all I was gonna put my name in it
our new table is a cutting board don't
put on it guess what I did wait past
weekend we're gonna go with this take I
i went to a gun range Oh what she um
ar-15 I think with all the call of duty
you don't know a ar-15 is fiction I
don't know it was a it was um it was
totally created by Robert Herron so he
completely modded this thing to his
specs and he was like I spent a lot of
money but it's great then so I shot one
of those and then I tried a couple of
pistols I was like this is really cool I
thought it was awesome to just go to a
gun range and understand the safety of
using the gun and the proper etiquette
to use it at a gun range there's a lot
of rules involved whatever you go to
those places that's a bit weird really
cool we're just talking about pwm in the
a block and how like the different
disciplines that that applies to and
it's like it seems like whether it's
delicate or not telecommunications it
like hey you know ham radio operations
something that we're both keen on right
now or drones or shooting or even
hacking there's like definitely a
there's like the rules there's the you
know their etiquette there's probably
there's a proper way to do it i love
that i do too i'm glad that my first
time actually going out and shooting
guns involved going with an actual
instructor and learning everything from
you know how to just flip the safety
switch to how to actually load it and
set it down so you weren't just like
holding the AR by your waist and spin
around for two people I wasn't even
allowed to pick it up off the table
pretty much they were like you said it
on the table and when you're done and
your little thing is empty you send it
to
nanostation is next time b-roll b-roll
yeah everybody wants to say you might
have got foolish out with check well I
might have gotten somebody yes good
stuff cool um that that definitely is a
techno lost tickler oh you're the guns
