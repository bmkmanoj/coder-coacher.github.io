huge problem this morning I woke up my
alarm I had to go to work is horrible
not the work the alarm dude this thing
it just beeps that's the point of metal
are there no no no what I'm saying is
like 2005 and my alarm is just beeping
so I figured I'd take a break from
hacking the gibson and put together an
alarm clock on my computer ok they don't
know what you're going to do this they
gonna do the whole music thing I'm gonna
wake up to my music yeah that's really
cool man oh come on do you really think
I'd do something that lame it does play
music but it's way better than that what
do you do after you wake up coffee
breakfast email email news digs slashdot
you know check it out yeah everything
okay so why not just lay in bed and
listen to you RSS feeds and what we're
going to do here with some pearl and
some vbscript we're going to hack
together a little batch file that will
do this all for so you know play a
little mp3 to wake us up and then bam
get to lay in bed and listen so just a
Moroso so it's a listening part i'm
using the Microsoft text-to-speech
engine or you could use festival on
linux or mac or whatever just GTS is
building net right right well you know
it's built into windows and this will
work on 9895 whatever swedish to run 95
please just just you know I'm sure
there's a linux distro out there so we
head over to speech and on text of
speech i've downloaded an additional
voice and michelle and she sounds well
she sounds better than microsoft sam way
better than sam sounds horrible yeah
whore I don't know why they even put
that in there yeah okay so now what
we're going to do is we've got the alarm
batch file up and up here there and you
know it's good morning and then it runs
this perl script and what this perl
script does and have modified it a
little bit this is a RSS to html5 and
it's going to download the RSS feed from
digg and then append it to alarm dot txt
so just garbage the RSS right it does
the same thing to the slashed RSS feed
and then appends it here you know after
saying these are the photo or a second
when you get an or assess when you get
xml so yeah we'll get all the nodes and
stuff what this perl script is actually
doing is converting it to a format where
it can actually be read by our text to
speech engine it's not actually HTML can
strip the HTML so
all the tags out nice text yeah pretty
much awesome dude that's really cool so
you know goes through there and just
blend blowing and then we delete any
alarm file that was there from the
previous day and then we run this
awesome vbscript that i found text to
wave and you know do you give it the
text file that you want to convert and
then 35 is the option that makes it a
44.1 killer stereo 16-bit sound file and
they wave and then wait to leave the
alarm texts we don't need that and then
we go ahead and start the alarm m3u now
the m3 you is really simple here we go
we've got i'll just type it yeah i mean
that's just your basic em through you
that's a playlist and it will run in
itunes and windows media player and
winamp which my favorite so let's go
ahead and give it a shot alright what
i'm going to do is schedule it using at
so we'll schedule at at let's say 630
but all this all this command line stuff
can we do in the GUI you can do the same
thing you're doing the command line just
by heading over to control panel and
scheduled tasks and the same exact
things we have the same way to your
music more sinus my files cool so we're
going to do at six-thirty every Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday
we're going to run alarm access alarm
dot bat there you go so it's scheduled
let's go ahead and run it all right I'm
not that so making our announcements and
access food creating the wave file that
would be cool now it's scheduled so
right so it's gonna happen every morning
exactly it's important can wake you up
okay you know a lovesac will get out of
bed but what you want to keep in mind is
to make sure you change that song
yeah he ever listened to the same so no
not at all or else you'll end up hating
the song so I've gone ahead and given
like 30 seconds of the Love Shack to
wake me up and then i'll head over to
the RSS feeds that's sweet totally
honest I like that workouts yes sir to
fade out of it you just do that we'd
audacity top five stories from there
this morning are still don't arrest him
for Fred and excrement zombie invasion
wait okay the zombie and a division oh
we gotta watch a nice i gotta read that
yeah election a canister that wonder why
Kevin will talk about acting I hope said
it sounds pretty cool man oh um XP
leverage in next chips anyway you get
the idea it's not the greatest voice in
the world but it's a lot better than the
default one that comes with Windows it's
a much better you know you'll get used
to it so this will go ahead and wake you
up in the morning with some RSS feeds
you know maybe after that you'll check
out the newspaper if there's something
you heard that you like maybe it'll be
in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
