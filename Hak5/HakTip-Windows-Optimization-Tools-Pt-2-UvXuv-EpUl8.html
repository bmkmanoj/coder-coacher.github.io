Netflix welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers gurus and I teen
ninjas i'm your host shanna morris now
you guys sent in a ton of ideas for
Windows optimization tools after one of
my earlier hack tips today I'd like to
take a brief tour of some of your
favorites I'm listing these in no
specific order so here goes number one
is Bravo uninstaller matt says like the
name says is a program that uninstalls
programs ha but it goes beyond that too
before you uninstall anything it creates
restore point scans for files and
registry entries that the program uses
and it launches the program's
uninstaller when it's all done and
installing rev 0 checks again for the
files and registry entries if it finds
them it asks you if you want to delete
them this program also comes in a
portable version I love my portable ones
what can I say number two is disk mask
over at Kashi John calm Andre says one
thing that killed a lot more useless
files and somehow speed things up a lot
more than the others i think is disk
mask by Kashi John which i use on every
pc in the family because they are
getting ugly slow ugly slow I kind of
like that slang number three is smart
defrag Francisco rights in with this one
and he says I would like to recommend
smart defrag as another utility to keep
your computer optimized for optimum
performance that was kind of redundant
but it works number four was sent in by
Bryan and it also comes from the iobit
com website he says another great free
utility is advanced systemcare for which
was also sent in by Alex thank you I
hope it has free malware removal free
defrag free file shredder etc tons and
tons more and it's all great and it's
all free or you can go old school with
the disk cleaner for a quick and easy
clean and you can find disk cleaner over
at disk cleaner mmm sonic calm number
five is enough
cleaner sent in by Pete he states I
think I found a few tools that can belly
up to the competition the first is a
cleaning tool called F cleaner I found
it to be a better tool so far compared
to see cleaner I'm going to have to
check that one up it seems speed up my
computer a considerable amount that's
awesome thank you number six was sent in
by Nick he says just wanted to recommend
soluto which is one of my personal
favorites to speed up startup times it's
a time brilliant program Sean also sent
this in stating this is an optimization
software which gives you insight into
the internal processes of your Windows
PC with this program you are notified of
which programs plugins and services that
are slowing down your pcs boot time and
your browser it has a fresh interface
and it shows promise and future releases
I love it when programs get updates
that's great it's time for a break but
afterwards I'll let you guys know a few
more really really quick and easy
optimization tools for those cruddy
windows pcs with more than 23 million

hak5 and sign up be sure to use this URL
so that they know we sent you I'm back
with a few more of your user picks first
up is Benjamin DS choice he says use ms
config personally i find ms config to be
one of the best and only good tools that
windows has built into the machines for
as long as i can remember with it you
can choose what programs can start up on
boot and you can control the programs
that are running in the background
another simple tip sent in by william is
open a DOS prompt and delete the
temporary files type in CD backslash for
change directory and press Enter
and then type in de l for delete star
TMP for the temporary files and for /s
for everything it's a great way to clean
out all of that junk and you can also
create a scheduled task in your windows
box to do it for you a lot more were
sent in by you guys like us logics boot
speed ultimate windows Tweaker tweak
nail power pack 2011 and network
utilization just to name a few but alas
