service spoofing in metasploit with our
friend moob Ock's playing doom on the

and an alternative disk space reporter
all that and more this time on hak5 this
episode of hak5 is brought to you by
domain.com your next big idea starts at
domain.com go to assist express support
smarter with go to assist express and
dice calm the career hub for tech hello
welcome to hack by my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse sports your
weekly dose of technical is how are you
guys I'm doing good no I'm asking about
them oh okay are you guys doing I hope
they're doing boy ok John you know
what's up yeah all right no I'm checking
I hope they're enjoying the extra
technol us that they're getting this
week on Mondays and Fridays now tip yeah
with Mondays and Fridays I've had a lot
of fun we've upgrade the motion graphics
we've been doing a lot of fun like you
know putting together some I'm enjoying
those graphics that I've seen thank you
ok fine we're gonna have a diversity of
awesome stuff and it's going to be just
like we're gonna teach you something
right now and that's it I'm gonna be fun
it's gonna be awesome about linux and
what also today and all sort of IT stuff
but at the same time I'm having fun like
breaking down some software like one of
the first ones i had a lot of fun
talking about piping and linux because
we get a lot of emails over wow like i
love all of this stuff but i don't
always follow all of the you know I
don't maybe have the fundamentals or i
diced and some of the theory and it's a
great venue for me to get into some of
that furious I think that is an
excellent idea is we do get that's
questions a lot we need to know and I
camera on the sinus or no camera on the
ceiling because then we can do more
white board stuff like I did last season
that's fun yes yes fine alright
excellent sure for you guys this week
our good friend muvek Swizz here just
not too long ago and we did an excellent
segment on netbios spoofing so we'll
have Lou system won't ya next time I
know and that's actually from the old
studio so that'll be up
mashup but I think right now is test
time to kick it over to the headlines
now I was going to report on how Android
devices prior to version two point three
point four will neural to a side jacking
attack due to the fact that they
authenticate with HTTP rather than HTTP
s and well similar to you know cookie is
the auth token or of the calendar and
contacts apps whether they sink that
service was actually good for up to two
weeks and not necessarily device
dependent so or device agnostic and that
basically means that security you know
so you know attackers could steal that
and then in person at you and
potentially grab some stuff well just as
security researchers broke the story
Google went ahead and this is a great
story plug the hole Google spokesperson
said in a statement the fix requires no
action from the users and will roll out
globally over the next few days poor
unencrypted HTTP Madison it's not
getting as much love as it used to ever
since fire to keep them saying oh so sad
yeah along with the whole Android thing
there's been a bit of trouble brewing in
the Android Marketplace 11 apps that
were in the Android Marketplace were
embedded with some malicious code that
trickled triggered a text message to be
sent to three premium rate numbers in
China those text messages signed up the
mobile user for a paid subscription
service without their knowledge or
approval google has since taken down
those apps but there could be more
malware like this has been growing on
the android platform four hundred
percent since last summer that's crazy
talk and this is just another hiccup and
the whole security issues with the
android apps yeah they're going through
a lot of trouble right you know what you
get when you're open though I mean yeah
that's true you know it's growing pains
at all get sorted I'm hoping I'm sure
they will sort it out i'm also i'm also
hoping for sony gets a break here since
we have consistently top their hacker
headlines and while i'm happy to report
that they have reopened the playstation
network blue and it's finally rolled out
it hasn't been without its setbacks just
two days after the service reopened
attackers went after the password reset
function which supposedly only required
email and date of birth so
you know while this isn't a full-blown
say remote exploit sony has disabled the
function on playstation com and the
curiosity outcome sites so in the
meantime you can actually still login to
the PSN from your playstation portable
or your ps3 oh well that's good at least
you can log-in somewhere yeah no joke
but in awesomesauce news Allah is
awesome me too okay so there's this
twitter vigil em day that found the guy
stolen laptop using a program that we
had discussed tons of episodes but back
in the day and it's called pray pray
silo pray yeah the one where you can
like if somebody's on your laptop you
can take a picture with the webcam and
it will get emailed to you along with
like GPS location data via the wireless
network that they're on all sorts of
crazy stuff so this guy named Sean
powers his laptop was stolen and after
just a few days he was able to score a
webcam photo of the thief using the free
tool cops wouldn't help him so he went
to Twitter of course I mean who doesn't
go to Twitter right so a follower Sean's
and also a complete stranger went to the
bar confronted the stranger and he got
the laptop back because he was the the
stranger or the guy that stole it was
last seen at that bar with the laptop
and he was able to get the picture so he
confronted the thief he got to the
laptop back and all is good so hooray
for social networking and free programs
hello us that's good news see happy
stories that makes me happy this video
just started making its rounds and it's
bringing so much happiness to my heart
so I'm just gonna go ahead and take the
liberty of your elect directly quoting
terrible org electrolytic capacitors are
constructed using an electrolyte soaked
piece of paper between two strips of
aluminum foil one piece of foil is
oxidized and this ultra thin coating of
aluminum oxide becomes the capacitors
dielectric because this layer is so thin
and has a high dialectic constant a
large amount of capacitance can be
squeezed inside of a small space even
more so when the foils rolled up tightly
electrolytics have one flaw though they
are polarized when a reverse voltage
greater than 1.5 volts hits the
capacitor the aluminum oxide starts to
reduce
its insulating properties are lost this
destroys the capacitive effect of the
device and essentially the capacitor
short circuits which allows a lot of
current to flow a lot of heat is
generated heat which boils the
electrolyte and causes the pressure to
build inside the capacitor and it goes
boom and that's awesome that's the most
fun part yeah I'm kind of excited I'm
kind of enjoying the second one that
would oh I've heard lots of stories of
older mother's words that were just like
either least pass udders or boom
capacitor no good anyway so occurrence
of that yeah to her computer oh no one
of them just kind of blew up utterly
that was checking with Kirby and find
out about her Star Trek captain of the
week
as an alternative to windirstat which I
explained a few weeks ago you can try
out J discs report this freeware tool
enables you to understand what files on
your drive take up what amount of space
this tool can help you figure out what
files or folders are just sitting on
your hard drive taking up room J disk
report features a size prospective pie
chart for easy viewing a size
distribution tool modified size
distribution view file extension type
size distribution and a top 100 list of
your largest files to use go over to Jay
Goodis calm and download the tool and
you just have to go over to the download
page as usual and choose whether you
have win windows OSX if you want a web
start version or Java Java must be
installed for this to work and it will
want run on Windows or Mac open j dis
report and choose scan a file tree and
this will scan all of the files inside a
chosen drive since I've already done
this once on my computer before it
already opens up C colon slash user
slash snubs since that was the last one
that I decided to scan so I'll go ahead
and open up a new one I'll do Shannon
again
so this is going to scan all of the
files inside my chosen drive and after a
few moments JJ's report will display an
easy to navigate pie chart showing me
which files take up soap on my computer
you can right-click to open and explore
and browse to those files so that you
can go through them and edit or delete
them or whatever you need to do you can
also choose things such as excluding a
directory for the scan under the
Preferences menu on the filter tab for

goodies calm and tell me what you think
do you have an idea for a tip share them
with us at tips at hak5 gorg and now a
word from our sponsor your assisted min
or tech consultant you know you've got
to have your own side business I know I
do providing various remote support
services and the IT consulting services
let me tell you it's easier than you may
think to get started now of course the
first step is getting the right domain
because trust me writing a business as
chmod 755 @ aol.com just isn't going to
most professionally showcase your
talents thankfully domain com has
everything you need to quickly and
easily put together a professional and
modern site to showcase your talents
free for the first 30 days domain coms
instant website hosting is the fastest
way to get an SEO friendly page that
will look great on pc or smartphone and
with fully hosted email starting at just
a dollar ninety-nine a month there's no
reason not to have named at your
professional domain.com and when you're
shopping for that perfect domain at
domain com go ahead and use coupon code

when it comes to managing a whole bunch
of machines on a land you don't want to
remember a bunch of IP addresses know
that's what names are for and mu Bix
you're here to show us some
vulnerabilities and netbios no it's not
really a vulnerability it's exactly how
it works it's exactly you know what
those are the most fun ones when we
really just exploit the inherent trust
that the machine has with the machine or
the human with the machine or the
machine with the human and so for those
not familiar with netbios though what is
that so netbios is how was one of the
ways that a windows machine looks up
other machines on that network so it's
it's before DNS it does it and it's just
like hey where is sort of like art so
this is the what we're going to be
showing you today is is a way to use
something like karma mm-hmm okay
something like art to man in the
Middle's right so I I guess the idea
here is that your machine is set up with
a netbios name the me the name of this
machine right here is Darren TAC 10 ATT
because 1830 t cuz that's the model of
the notebook my you know desktop rig is
Darren tak I seven right and I name
these and everybody does names or
computers with some cute little scheme
and then on the network they're
constantly saying hey I'm Darren Takei 7
and you know no computer over here no
it's not it doesn't it doesn't say that
it doesn't say hey I'm here but when
this guy wants to connect to Darren I
haven't say like I've got a shared
folder on there you having SMB correct
and I need to get a file off of my
laptop my laptop won't it use netbios to
say who is Darren Takei yeah just like
art just like art so it'll say hey where
is where is Darren tech i7 tell me okay
so it just sends that to the broadcast
yeah and and sort of okay and then so if
you don't have like a wins server
running does it i interfere with its
back into the Wednesday's that this
actually started up yeah in fact I've
noticed that most of the time when i try
to do like VPNs netbios is the first
thing to go ya know so it's kind of an
older protocol but you still see it in
many lands yeah so etsy host is on
windows right it's the very first thing
that gets looked at very
at the beginning right and that's you
know in Windows typically in system32 et
Cie drivers drivers EGC hosts say that
way and then after that it doesn't
netbios after that it does dns local dns
and then does like non recursive Deena
so that's why I always just use the IP
address of the machine because it seems
like netbios isn't quite as fast as if
you just can you know pull up your run
command and go backslash backslash 192
168 1 dot 43 and like boom there your
files right but so we're going to take
advantage of just the protocol in
general how right so what to medan did
was he created a and I'm probably
pronouncing that wrong I apologize Tim
at Tim medan m.ed I n on Twitter right
got him right here so he created a
Metasploit module that was essentially
like karma it and accept like the
pineapple where it says hey I'm Matt are
you any time it sees like a netbios
request saying hey I need to get this
share one yeah it says yep I'm sure one
nice so what do you get by saying you
know saying hey I'm share one nothing
unless you set up other things so what
it happens is it's just like karma again
you get that traffic right you brought
them to you writing the new something
right yeah so like why I like to like
off from like a phishing page or
something like that Robin internet and
Mexico Andrew yeah ssl strip and sniffed
the package you want to offer them what
they're expecting most likely SS
SMB share right so show me how you do
this I know that this has been in
metasploit for a while now I'm since 12
193 revision and there the rusian today
I think is like 12 or 1300 they just
came up that in asking that and it's so
yeah it's not too old yeah you need to
be a little up today but it works for so
update cuz you're gonna want this show
us how to do it so let's own my machine
here okay so all we do is start off by
myslef console now i'm going to show you
a really cool trick that I learned from
the devs that isn't published anywhere
that I know of okay so oh you got the
keg o cow out you not mg that means
everything is going to work
oh wait one take so color falls the
reason I turned off color is when it
when you do a script so if you're doing
a pen test and you want to keep record
of everything you do a script color
actually goes in as their their codes so
it really mess up i always turn off
color just so you know like the like the
tick like back in like quake three days
when you'd have like tick 14 to have
like a different dealer cyan or
something else so use is how you use a
modular dot star it is a secret sauce ok
dot star that's a wild card where am i
actually what am I using so dot star is
saying anything after this look it up
anywhere in the modules and if its
unique automatically throw it in it so I
don't have to remember / auxiliary slash
this slash that right so I did dot star
n BN s because the only module that has
n BN s in the name ok netbios time
server and there it is wicked okay cool
let's use it what are our options two
options so spoof ID is your IP or
whatever you want it to send to it so
evil server that's going to be sniffing
your packet so when I point it to that
so if you had like a pineapple and had
metasploit on it running this and you
wanted to actually send it to a windows
marks or linux box that you could do
stuff with it yeah you could say
anything else so also the regex matches
to whatever computer name so if i wanted
to only target a single computer i would
set up the red regular expression Caray
so if i wasn't trying to like throw off
alarms and stuff you know if the network
administrator can't get to the you know
backup share then like all of a sudden
he's going to start looking around for
trouble but if you're only looking for
that you know person in HR or accounting
that's trying to get to the backup
server maybe snipe their data right okay
so the thing well you're you're the
regex is for what it's going to apply
for also serve share one or what are
here okay um the important thing to say
here is like this is not as intrusive as
our art spoofing well because when you
say an armed spoof i'm particularly all
safe hey Paul I moved to take Paul and
move it a polym let's move I'm Paul on
Paul moves I'm Paul
and like anyone can just notice that you
know right and things go down like if
you do our Sufi know on it like on a pen
test yeah you're taking things down
because you can't do that much traffic
mm-hmm right so this is a really lot
more subtle way attack because you're
never saying anything until you hear Oh
what did you say you wanted the backup
server I got that right over here right
exactly so it's a really sniper way of
doing stuff alright so let's point it at
our interface here said spoof I do to my
local one ok so I notice you're on a Mac
machine here I'm on a PC hi I'm a PC and
you're not running a samba share are you
so if I try to now this is actually a
virtual machine River Junction ok sorry
but button right I'm not on top of so do
you need to like have like a samba share
for me to actually go to how does that
work well let's let's run it and see
what happens first and then we'll set up
things a year ok great so it run I set
the spoof IEP run and it's going alright
so it's just listen and say ok and what
is the regex what server are you
particularly looking for so right now
it's just dot star so you're already got
stuff so another name is anything right
it means anything ok so this is working
for workgroup Darren I seven new pc and
saying hey I'm hey I'm it hey em yet
great so you're already in a machine
right that are already set up in theirs
and 18 30 but it's not actually doing
anything everything's coming to me but
you're not offering any I'm not offering
so connections turning out or so let's
start offering something because then
I'm sure the tack gets a lot more
interesting game so you start actually I
don't think there's an will do for so
auxillary server capture this is where
you really want to look at for anything
that's going to be a service that's
going to capture data for you double tab
and see all of stuff there's FTP HTTP
i'm at pop3 SMB smtp gentlemen the
things that this is going to help x baby
the things that this is going to help
with is SMB and HTTP so people go to
HTTP server one right over to order that
a lot of times right where they just set
it up that
so it's easy like for the users like oh
just open up Internet Explorer go to
that bookmark maybe I sharepoint server
so where this really works the
SharePoint servers it works really well
on share printer so what you do is just
to observe a server capture HTTP
underscore ntlm has the module and it
will say give me your you know ntlm
authentication and ie6 automatically
does it with that even without even in
without effort without a restaurant that
user friendly you know ie7 and ie8 it
has to be in the internet or in the
local zone to do it so if you are local
and doing this which you should be it
should do it there you know figure it
out for yourself I'm but it works well
even if it just pops up and says enter
your password great so which so we're
going to just do samba right now mm-hmm
all right so use our very servers
capture SMB yes okay so a lot our
options here oops show options alright
so if you've ever looked at cannes LST
files that are inside of the king folder
where it's stored where it stores all
the hashes that it gets in a lot of the
times it's that's the only way to import
stuff and it's a pain in the butt
because it's tab separated ok so the SMB
capture module actually makes it easy
for you it does the tab separating when
it got have to write a little script a
finesse the log file I can bring this
right into Kane and for John there's
just a wrapper okay great so we're going
to set both those up right now just in
case we want to do either or not have to
fiddle with those logs okay use king
whoops set king temp keen log set John
camp John dot long said log file to tent
awe SM be long
and run all right so now you have an SMB
server that's just set up sharing a
folder and I guess I can just go ahead
and get attacked now right yeah so I'm
just going to be Joe user and here we go
i am presented with prompt here for my
username password but i already got your
password hi what no i I'm just gonna
give it an auto center what oh so it
doesn't even matter that I'm sitting
here trying to login no like I mean now
I got it cuz now it's saying oh hey I
couldn't login oh yes so weird man the
backup server is not running but i
already had it i need to get to my files
though okay well i stop I'll stop it so
let's help me get to my files exit
server stops got it and we just want to
crack that real quick yeah let's crack
it in John mm format so John the regular
John doesn't have the mt on v2 or net LT
ntlm so what you have to do is get the
jumbo pack it's an open wall or go so we
just need to convert it to a format that
it's going to understand no it knows you
just have to get the right version of
John okay format equals net until ntlm
be too done and what's the password Bob
yeah that it's about very great I mean
we should have ended like a magic trick
and I should like hold up the password
for everyone feels like the password is
Bob little vixen get it you know so it
was I mean we set that password up easy
so yeah backpacks but you can get it to
the point where now I've got your
password now I can log in or do PS exec
or pass the hash all right path but PS
exactly or possibly or just past that
has to an online cracking service yes
but you have to pass it so there's no
online cracking service for a net ntlm
bummer because it requires the challenge
oh but since you have the challenge
because it's salted with that
essentially I can well you know you just
send some big hardware at it you know oh
you're so ladies so John or King both of
those can actually both of those can
actually set a dictionary against it or
do perforce or there's actually tables
out
for how Mike how metasploit does its
challenge to one 1 two 2 three 3 four or
five six seven eight eight eight nine so
that's its challenge that it sends
acrostic so there's actually rainbow
tables away board it was for those yeah
just like those rainbow tables for like
linksys and d-link and all of those you
know WPI keys that is so wicked you know
I absolutely love how this is
essentially doing you know what like the
pineapple does there's so many other the
most beautiful hacks or this most
simplistic one where you just basically
abuse the trust that the protocol has in
the way that it's formed it mean it's
like smtp back in the day before even
required authentication you know so few
weeks thank you so much for coming on
board up right people can find movies
over at room 362 calm or the pen tester
extraordinaire now over a rapid seven
for meta you know the metasploit folks
yeah i love having you down here so
thanks so much you gotta come down more
alright take it easy oh and now you have
two real quick before i forget ever jan

last week I showed you how to install
ding x a version of linux on to your
dingo digital today I'm digging a little
bit deeper into the world of the danube
by setting up a game and an emulator so
let's get started first of all check out
non gnu org slash freedom and download
the complete iwog from the download page
and extract that into pretty much
whatever fuller you decide to extract it
into and you'll have a nice little wad
called doom 2 dot wad copy the doom 2
dot wad file to your mini SD card that
has DX on it I have that one as
removable disk f and you'll need to copy
it under local games PR boom as doomed
to dot WOD once copied you can plug the
SD card into your dingu digital make
sure that it's turned off any time you
remove or put the SD card in the slot
because it'll freeze if you take it out
while it's cut on if you don't want the
free doom version of doom you can also
try the original doom and to do that go
over to do mark I've calm over here
under resources go to doom shareware and
download dhoom one watt zip and then
you'll want to extract that again to
wherever you want to you on your pc and
you'll have doom 1 dot wad now copy the
doom 1 dot wad over to local games PR
boom again on your SD card and renamed
oom2 dealt wad from the free doom com
site because if you decide not to
renamed to wad when you boot up doom on
the DX it will default to the free doom
doom 2 dot wad doom 1 dot wad I know
it's kind of confusing now that you have
you two versions of doom installed and
you have chosen which one you want to
boot you can go ahead and put your SD
card into your dingo digital and hold
down to select while pressing up on the
power button so go ahead and do that I
am my nice little SD card in here my
micro SD card I'll put that into my
mini SD and I want to turn it off so it
doesn't freeze
and I hit select and power up and it
should boot DX now once I'm booted into
DX i can choose the topmost version of
doom which is right underneath the games
icon press a and I have the freedom
version now if I did want to play doom
one got wad I could always just change
the name of that and continue on to play
it so I can go ahead and start my game
and hopefully not run into any crazy
zombies while I'm playing this is so
hard to do at this angle I'm running
into a window okay so i'll go ahead and
reset this okay reset and turn that off
now i can install my emulator plug that
back into my pc continue without
scanning silly windows so i went ahead
and chose my emulator already I've
chosen super mario world because well
it's awesomely epic so why wouldn't you
want to choose super mario world so you
get a super mario world rom from pretty
much anywhere online that you can find
it it should be called super mario world
smc you copy this file over to local
emulators and put it under sne x 9 x and
just copy I copy it over a super mario
world Iestyn see you can also see here
that I have a final fantasy 5 wrong as
well yay alright so I chose my emulators
I'm done with that I can exit out of
here and take out my SD card rawr the
little micro SD
and plug it back in my dingu which if
you wanted to you could always just put
all of your emulators and roms and wads
onto onto here without putting it back
into your Dean do digital every time you
want to do something else on it you
could just do everything at once on your
pc so you don't have to go back and
forth but I wanted to give you a good
example I hit select and power on go
back into DX okay so once I boot I can
go over to emulators and shoes and SSN
the X 9 X and I have my final fantasy in
Super Mario World roms I hope it starts
because I really like playing super
mario world huh yay it reminds me of the
90s oh this is so exciting okay so can
go ahead and start my game and it plays
exactly like the old SNES video games
it's great so tada you have awesome
games at your fingertips to play for
your next subway Wyatt right or bart

the show where I say that just about
wraps up this episode of hak5 but before
we get going we got some awesome no I'm
on e 1 M 2 I knew it was a bad idea talk
about your son shows them that you want
on the show darren has always got a jump
on the machine she's talked about
freedom for you doing is the best so
cool because everyone covering i wad i
know i love i love freedom I love the
fact that you know everybody's like hey
open source engine let's make a table
Graphics Pack why not tell me we've got
some awesome emails we do I think Dewey
yes okay we do so Connor right hey hak5
I know you get a lot of emails so I will
keep this to the point Thank You Connor
thank you very much I am new to the
computer technology world and find it
hard to follow parts of your show I'm
not asking you to change the script but
I'm simply asking where are the best
resources are the really the best way to
break into this and get caught up I have
an interest in technology and I know
that it might take some work but really
any general direction would be much
appreciated thank you in advance we get
this email so much from every night you
know we could start like an entire other
show on that kind of stuff in fact
that's one of the reasons why hacked
everything into hack well yeah I know
right wow that's not bad snubs register
that right now you know made up but um
that's one of the reasons why we're
tackling a lot of surprises yeah and the
fundamentals and stuff at on hack tip
which was twice weekly which means that
we're going to know and as we're going
to ramp that up allows us to talk about
a lot more of that stuff and like I said
at the top of the show even in like one
of the first hack tips talking about
explaining what it is to do standard
input and output in UNIX and pipes and
redirection and stuff like that so I
hope that should be a good resource for
you but really like where I began I
don't know it's different for everyone
but there's a great thread over a hak5
org slash forums where you can find it's
called under the Security section
hacking where to begin a lot of people
have poured some amazing resources in
their ebooks just regular books video
series stuff like that where you know
you can go and get your foundation
and one of the other things that I
always say is learn a programming
language I don't care if it's see I
don't care if it's Python or Java or
what have you understanding programming
gives you as much bigger yeah that's
right you started in Java yeah yeah
except you know come on hello world yeah
in like 14 line pickup Python it's easy
no I'm joking anyway JS sample bombs
here and he's like he's like rooting for
Java but with all of that said I hope
that if you guys have some advice on
where you know our friend here can find
some other resources go ahead and plug
them into this wit hacking where to
begin thread on the hak5 forms or just
you know what shoot us an email feedback
at hak5 that org would love to hear from
you yeah definitely that you know I i
started mostly with Java and college and
then back in middle school I think it
was learning how to build websites using
HTML yeah but honestly just read lots of
books watch watches shows no reason
we're doing this podcast is the reason
why I know what I know yeah well I also
have to say like when when I started it
was all basic and I didn't really know a
lot of basic right but qbasic came with
das 33 on my old IBM PC XD handle and so
if i wanted to play some video games
that's all I had so I like just you know
decompiler not decompiling because you
had the source code so just going
through the source code of say nibbles
and the one where you're the monkey and
you throw the bananas at the you know
i'm talking like it is so great to uh to
just when you start to grok the source
code of other people's stuff and then
you know take those functions that
you're learning and stuff and putting
them in your own I think that's a great
way to start absolutely you can tell
that we're very passionate about this
stuff I know it we weren't just knowing
about technology we wouldn't be doing
this show is so true ok you know like
people are always like Oh what you do is
like so long CENTAC and you're like
drinkin beers and show then I got like
my name I like Stein here Thank You
Baltic and um anyway just yeah it's
that's a that's what it's all about just
you know treat yourself and being
passionate about technology and warm
fuzzies what I bodies everywhere all
right
okay another you know onto the other
email of this episode Aaron writes dear
hak5 what is the best free open source
of virtual virtualization system for
Linux love hak5 there's two big ones two
main ones and the and it's the reason
why I like virtual don't know dang
what's the name of it we've been using
parks box oh the approximate makes it
easy to use these two systems openvz and
kvm and we've talked a bit in the past
when during those episodes about what
the differences are those are two good
ones as far as desktop stuff is
concerned I you guys know I love
Oracle's virtual box so that's another
good one to check out but there are so
many great engines you know like Paul's
a fan of qemu you know there's there's a
lot of systems out there and so those
are a couple for you to dabble with I
don't know there's one that's the best
it really depends on like what it is
you're trying to do if you you know if
this is an enterprise thing and like you
know your eye officer like a big concern
maybe you want to like look at VMware I
don't know you know maybe there's a
there's something but if it really
depends on your implementation is all
I'm saying but we'd like to hear what
you guys think of course so hit us up
and there's always great virtualization
discussions going on in the forums cool
yep and as you guys know we always end
the show with our technology o of the
week we've kind of good one this week we
did yes so am or am not sure which way
you pronounce it there he wrote in and
he said a client bought a new machine
and I'm glad they did I just had to nab
the hard drive from this biohazard
because it was massive dust bunnies
seriously that thing was so huge it does
look like a biohazard like are there
viruses growing in there I I have to
learn okay but if you guys have photos
