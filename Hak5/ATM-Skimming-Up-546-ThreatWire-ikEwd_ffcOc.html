we have problems and wearable internet
of things probably worse than a thumb
drives they have so much potential all
that coming up now on threat wire
greetings I'm Patrick Norton and this is
threat wire for May 2nd 2016 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom thanks to
everybody that supports us on
patreon.com slash threat wire you keep
the show coming commercial free every
week oh my goodness people watch out
skimming attacks where a hacked
automated teller machine or cash machine
harvest card information every time it's
used are at an all-time high as in up
546 percent between 2014 and 2015
quote the number of ATM compromises in
2015 was the highest ever recorded by
the FICO card alert service which
monitors hundreds of thousands of ATMs
in the US criminal activity was highest
at non bank ATMs such as those in
convenience stores where 10 times as
many machines were compromised as in
2014 now we found the news that Krebs on
security who also links a story he ran
earlier this year Krebs did about
cameras and quote skimming devices
plugged into ATM network cables way more
difficult to detect than the old-school
gadget double stick tape to the front of
the machine me I still basically walk up
to an ATM and grab the place where the
card goes in yank it up and down I try
to pry the keyboard off crabs pretty
much says to avoid the ATMs and 7-eleven
convenience stores quotes I've heard
from multiple banking industry sources
who say they've seen a spike in ATM
fraud targeting cash machines in
7-eleven s and other convenience stores
and that the commonality among the
machines is that they are all operated
by ATM giant card Tronics
apparently machines in 7-eleven
locations made up for 17 point 75
percent of car tronics revenue last year
so what do you do well hey remember
cover your hand when you're entering
your PIN number the card data ain't so
useful without a PIN number and little
tiny cameras aimed at the keyboard are
hard to detect so put your hand over the
keyboard to prevent people from figuring
out what your PIN is and seriously you
might want to stick to using only ATMs
attached to banks and one last time
the hand our internet-of-things
developers aware the third industry is
considered a giant security hole in the
making I think the answer is yes
check out Evans data corporation's
latest survey of 500-plus IOT devs Evans
data they drop eight reports a year on
quote overall global IOT trends IOT and
mobility IOT in the cloud and IOT in big
data the layest IOT survey found that
quote 31% of developers active in the
IOT space believe that the greatest
trouble spot for IOT security lies
within the software or firmware for
their connected devices which makes
sense because all too often somebody's
building an internet-connected whatever
and they just grab some hardware some
firmware comes with the hardware they
slap it together they probably don't do
any significant security testing and off
the market it goes we've seen this in
other places like routers 22% of those
developers surveyed we're concerned
about exposing data to mobile clients
well just under 17% had concerns about
the transmission of data through a
network or cloud would suggest they know
about things like oh I don't know HTTP
VPN or other internet security stuff
most my excellently nobody really had
that many concerns about the physical
security of devices which makes sense if
the IOT device is you know locked inside
somebody's house I just wish that more
than 55% of the developers surveyed
thought that security was extremely
important to their organizations half
roughly half thought that security was
extremely important to their
organizations 32% said it is quote
somewhat importance I'd really like to
see like a hundred percent saying it's
incredibly important I mean please while
I'm on an Internet of Things fudge
survey roll let's talk about Spiceworks
latest survey of IT pros an Internet of
Things devices and quote how seriously
they consider the threats pretty
seriously in fact they found that quote
the presence of wearables in the
workplace is nearly doubled and they're
expected to be the top source of
security breaches among Internet of
Things devices the top concern expressed
by IT pros 84% was over the fact that
IOT devices create more entry points
into the network Spiceworks noted that
quote about three-quarters of IT pros
are also worried the Internet of Things
manufacturers aren't implementing
sufficient security measures C story
above the survey included 448
Pros North America Europe the Middle
East in Africa and seriously IOT
security is going to be a growth
industry for a while take note if you're
in college or looking for a new career
path got a great link from the Sophos
naked security blog almost half of
dropped USB sticks will get plugged in
so says a study run by researchers at
the University of Illinois who sprinkled
297 drives around the campus and quote
the first drive phoned home to the
researchers in less than six minutes
after it was placed yes so yeah one
don't plug in strange USB drives to
encrypt your drives in case you lose
them because somebody might plug them in
and three pen testers you know what to
do with this information couple more
things before I go threat post scourge
of Android overlay malware on the rise
says to watch out for overlay malware
basically it sits on top of legit apps
making it easier to steal your login
info for say um your bank flashpoint
Intel looks at the hacking for Isis the
emergency cyber threat landscape that
big dense well report basically says Pro
Isis hacking groups are growing they're
merging about the aren't particularly
skilled yet in no small part because
Isis doesn't have an official hacktivist
arm
so while pro Isis attacks aren't
sophisticated right now they have the
potential to seriously suck in the
future and one last thing tell your
dentist not to use the flash drive the
American Dental Association sent out the
one that says CDT 2015 dental procedural
codes
it's got malware on it another tip of
the hat to Krebs for that one thanks to
