by go to assist hello and welcome back
five my name is darren kitchen I'm
Shannon Morse and we're at the Consumer
Electronics Show we're still alive too
yes we're still alive and it's almost
the last day it's close to it and we
survived we survived CES so we invite
you to join us as we talk about some of
the technologies that allow us to
survive CES as well as and later in the
show some really interesting stuff with
our friends from qualcomm atheros you
guys know how much we are Paris talking
about some of the new innovations in I
Tripoli a 22 dot11 ad where ad not AC
that's again oh so it's better it's
different it's 60 instead of you know
two point four or five point eight kind
of stuff ok yeah it's the new fun
licensed spectrum basically goes faster
but not as far and really cool stuff so
we're going to talk about beamforming
cuz dude why not yeah so with all that I
guess we'll just see you on the other
side no just checking ago I was saying
like this is so cool that you know the
low latency of it the 60 gigahertz and
to pick me yeah yeah go yeah good let's
uh there we go
get backed into the track basically now
we are playing and using the accelerator
from the tablet and so what's on the
tablet and what's on the display is I
mean I can't see any lag what's the lag
like so right now the lag is about a
couple of milliseconds right so it can
probably be around 10 milliseconds
that's probably the lag that we are
seeing now the thing that was you know
blowing my mind is how just fast it is
right and how small this this antenna is
over here at first when you were talking
about all the different beamforming
technology you can do and this was up
here I was like oh okay so you've got
like 30 of these in the end in the back
of the display right it's just this yeah
it's just this so if you look if you
look here these small squares these are
the antennas so here we have an array of
32 elements so there are 32 elements in
this small board so this is all what we
need when you said when the frequency
goes up that the antennas get smaller
you were not joking no no actually no so
the other thing I was saying is yeah
yeah physics is good this thing is you
know I'm saying like this is fantastic
now I went like everything in my home to
have this in it but then at a certain
point is just going to become like 2.4
gigahertz again it's going to be a huge
cluster right that now the good thing is
that when we are using beamforming
vertically we are narrowing the beam so
the beam in this case with 32 antennas
is about 10 degrees so basically if I'm
talking to you the transmission will be
10 degrees and then the noise on the
other 350 degrees will be very very low
just totally fall off if I if I hooked
that into a spectrum analyzer I would
only see where I'm actually pointing my
beam like it'd be like having a
parabolic antenna right exactly
disappear it's 30 parabolic antennas
this size and we are changing the B we
are changing the direction of the beam
by steering the beam so each of these
little each of these part of the array
are actually slightly curved
to look at a different section no
they're all actually in this board we
have antennas that are looking to the
front antennas are looking to the back
and antennas are what we call and fires
that are looking towards the edge or
like inside the PCB or what it's between
the layers of the PCB exactly that is so
cool do I mean how many do you think you
really need to be able to kind of like
beam form your living room so that
nothing's really interfering that much
so we will use all the all the 32 and
basically there are some modes that in
order to reduce the power consumption
will just reduce the number of antennas
that we are using but we can use all the
32 that is just amazing how small that
is and how much power you can get
through it yeah and and the good thing
is that you might have today if you take
Wi-Fi for example and you have two
access points and two clients one
connected one client to each access
point and they are close enough
basically you will divide the throughput
between the two networks I mean
essentially yeah right if they are in
the same channel now here because of the
spatial separation you can have multiple
setups running at the same Channel at
the same time and each one of them
running at full speed you don't need to
share the media anymore it's not like
say for example 802 doll 11b where
you've got you know channels 1 through
14 ish well 14 in Japan and there's
essentially only three channels that
don't overlap in this case you're saying
it doesn't matter don't think about
channels don't think about overlapping
just think about forming the beam so
that your not interfering with your
neighbor over here right we still have
three channels also in 60 gig
non-overlapping channels but even if we
had only one we can reuse the media
today the wallace media we are used that
the wireless media is a shirt medium so
if one talks all the rest has to shut up
now this is not right for 60 we can all
talk at the same time as long as I talk
to you and he talks with someone else
and we don't interfere each other right
so this is the cool thing now we can
have dense deployments that everybody
you don't need I don't need I don't want
to share my throughput with all the rest
specially here is at CES right with all
the rest of the people this
so much sense for the like the Urban
Development I mean this is where you
know 2.4 gigahertz even 58 really sucks
is you know you go to like apartment
buildings in New York City and it's like
yeah try to get a good signal even if
you broke out a spectrum analyzer all
you see is that the noise floor has been
written on every single channel yeah and
you can look at as an analogy for
example when the wired Ethernet moved
from Fast Ethernet to gigabit ethernet
it was from assured media not only speed
because it was like like on a hub
exactly from assured media to switch
media this is exactly the same you might
have an access point that has links to
the clients a full speed and then the
backbone of the access point will be the
one that will carry everything so if
attitude 11 ad though with the
beamforming in the 60 gigahertz and of
course the range you know just the
physics of it if if the underlying like
you know media access control stuff
doesn't really change then I'm assuming
that all of the fun Wi-Fi hacking stuff
that's capable with your existing you
know two point four and five gigahertz
stuff really applies here except the
difference would be now I need to not
physical access but I need to be damn
close if you need to be like between the
beam to actually do like a
man-in-the-middle to actually do like
when you okay so in the lab when you
guys are actually setting up your
sniffers to like test stuff you
literally have to like make sure it's in
between the two pieces of the test gear
well not necessarily because there are
modes that are kind of omni modes right
or we have patterns that we on purpose
we want to hear or for example beacons
are we need to avoid hidden nodes so
beacons are either sent in different
directions or sending omnidirectional
mode right so there are things that can
be done in order to hear what's going on
but remember that the chipset will all
the time be looking for the best path
between the transmitter and the receiver
so the path is moving trying to hack
that will be a challenge it will it will
be a challenge thank you so much you
really appreciate it
every year we make the same resolution
to spend more time with their friends
and family last time at the office but
that can be so challenging when you work
in IT and that's why i recommend go to
assist by Citrix it gives you three
essential tools in one easy-to-use
cloud-based tool set you've got go to
assist remote support which lets you do
live or unattended support any mac or pc
you've even got mobile device editions
for the ipad and android devices so you
can stay productive from anywhere and
best of all you can track all of it with
the go to assist service desk I know
when I worked in IT having go to assist
and having a wireless connection meant
that I could actually have a social
event now believe it or not sign up for
your special 30-day free trial today
