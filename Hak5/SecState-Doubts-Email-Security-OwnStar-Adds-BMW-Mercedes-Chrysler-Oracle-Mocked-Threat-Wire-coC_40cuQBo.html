email own stars expanding to other car
manufacturers Oracle's EULA gets mocked
and the NSA loves AT&amp;amp;T all that coming
up now on threat wire greetings I'm
Patrick Norton this is a threat wire for
august seventeenth 2015 your summary of
the threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom oh my goodness just to
start Monday on a perky note when asked
by CBS News if he thought quote Chinese
and/or Russians are reading your email
Secretary of State John Kerry replied
it's very possible and I certainly right
things with that awareness see that's
technically incorrect which brought the
quote to my attention observes but if
there's now an assumption at the very
highest levels what hope is there for
the rest of us well for the most part
i'm pretty sure nobody actually cares
about my wife and I bantering about the
glories of potty training and our
camping trip later this summer but hey
it's a good time to remember and remind
everyone for mere mortals such as you
and I unless you're the rare person that
uses encrypted email services everything
you write an email is insecure like back
of a postcard insecure and mr. secretary
it's time to get serious about security
going forward please way back on Friday
Oracle's chief security officer Mary Ann
Davidson's blog entry don't just don't
which pretty much sold Oracle customers
to quote please comply with your license
agreement and stop reverse engineering
are cold already because apparently the
EULA makes security research against the
rules if it involves reverse engineering
the code and that everything when Oracle
products should be blamed or secured
before questioning any Oracle product
and that quote we find eighty-seven
percent of security vulnerabilities
ourselves security researchers find
about three percent and the rest are
found by customers I mean look at some
level it was an attempt to manage
customer panic and fud around security
but as Krebs on security noted it was
thoroughly mocked online leading the
glorious mean photos and tweets such as
at small data's quote the city of rome's
eula stipulates visigoths cannot recruit
consultants who know about some hidden
gates to gain entry props to brian krebs
for that link the article itself pulled
down by oracle quotes as it
does not reflect our beliefs or our
relationship with our customers and
quote if you want to read some
interesting thoughtful responses to that
blog post check out security week coms
industry reactions to oracle CSO rants
feedback Friday bunch of really good
information and things to think about
their wikipedia is amazing it's an
online collection of knowledge edited by
volunteers but you ever wonder how
trustworthy Wikipedia is can paid
Wikipedia edits help say a medical
device manufacturer keep making billions
given the efforts of PR teams campaign
employees individuals and large
corporations the answer is probably a
lot less than it could have been in the
sense that how accurate or trustworthy
Wikipedia is it's a really good article
up in the Atlantic quote Wikipedia
editors for pay it's a really good read
and ends on the observation that even
unpaid editors bring bias for example
quote a volunteer Greenpeace activist
may not be the most impartial steward of
a page about the coal industry unquote
look in my case being married to a
librarian type it's all about vetted
resources online I'll take the Mayo
Clinic or the CDC / Wikipedia for
medical information and quite frankly if
we're talking about any subject of
controversy I take what's on Wikipedia
with a grain of salt because the battles
over content on Wikipedia are ongoing
and never-ending 24 hours a day
worldwide another cheerful news
ProPublica reports that quote the
national security agency's ability to
spy on vast quantities of internet
traffic passing through the United
States has relied on its extraordinary
decades-long partnership with a single
company the telecom giant AT&amp;amp;T I gotta
change my wireless carrier this
information according to you guessed it
new documents released by Edward Snowden
a charming if somewhat depressing read
and ARS technica reports that the own
star Wi-Fi attack now grabs BMW mercedes
and chrysler cars virtual keys Samy
Kamkar has quote adapted the tool to
target applications for BMW remote
mercedes-benz embrace and Chryslers you
