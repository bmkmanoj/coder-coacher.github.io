go further with that five I'm Shannon
Morse coming to you from CES 2013 and I
have just started off my day and I
started it off with the most adorable
things I could find on the show floor
and i'm here with christy with noetic
now you have these adorable little
electric friends cut electric fans yes
this one right here is thinking the
Panda wait so you're telling me they
have names absolutely we have four
different of these models we have a dog
which would be choo choo the dog and
then we also have Kiki the cat and we
have crack crack the duck the gallery in
love with the Russo Q now I'm assuming
this is for a target audience of
children correct most definitely but the
funny thing is is even adults love up
lots we worry about living in on their
offices I'm at home oh that's so cute no
how much did it cost and are they really
loud yeah they have a great sound
quality and they're gonna cost 59 99
nice that's not bad at all okay so sixty
dollars for this little guy and it looks
like you just plug it in via USB does it
also a septum iPhones cuz i have an
iphone at home absolutely actually it's
bluetooth so any device that would have
bluetooth i mean even zone the tablets
with the bluetooth so you can definitely
connect to those and the USB is gonna be
for USB charging for on the go that's so
good no how does it work i'm guessing
let's say okay so controls over here and
then are these the volume but absolutely
so we have touch touch ears to go up and
down and all you would have to do is
simply turn the unit on and pair your
bluetooth device with the can use your
skip buttons your pause buttons and
you're ready to go it's pretty simple oh
no how did you come up with this this is
available it looked at the speakers or
the eyes but it's painted so you can't
really even see them in there yeah
really basically there's so many speaker
systems out there and they're the
regular everyday you know it's your
office this you're at your home Haim but
what about the kids all the kids are
getting a hand me downs are
them of all the nanos and different
things like that so why not create
something just for them that's perfect
and I absolutely love these little guys
now you also have some it looks like
some bodyless ones back here we do we
have the brand-new electric friend minis
these guys are so much fun so we have
just these little ones and they also
have names too oh that's cute okay so
what's this one's name this one would be
easy the unicorn it's one of my favorite
super cute so we do have my boy friendly
ones and girls so we have effort both
anybody really so you're just done
through auxiliary so you would just
simply plug out the retractable cord and
you would connect the device and you're
ready to go now that these have blue 22
or just they'll nope just the other ones
up bluetooth these ones are auxiliary
only so anything with a headphone jack
you're able connect now how do you
charge them do you have to plug them
into row or do you have to have
batteries in them he's one to have three
triple a batteries otherwise you could
charge a USB charging oh that's not bad
at all yeah USB charging see Sarah I
told you USB charging it's coming it's
almost everywhere almost now thank you
so much what are these going to be on
the market and how much are those ones
going to cause they're gonna be spring
coming up real soon and we're all
looking forward to spring and they're
gonna be 24 99 that's great oh my gosh
for 25 bucks i get a little buddy list
unicorn that I can sit on my desk at
work and freak everybody up does it get
really low because I see it's I don't
know these speakers look a little
smaller than the other ones they are
small but actually the sound kind of
blows you away whenever I play them
everybody's whoa is that coming out of
that little to anything that's adorable
alright so let's play some music on this
little guy and you guys can find some
more coverage from revision3 at revision
3.com think it's about helping keep you
connected while on the go one of the
most useful features rsync is its
ability to control what you listen to
and sync applink gives you the power to
control apps like pandora and slacker
radio with your voice sometimes
listen to your own tunes well sink makes
it so easy it gives you hands-free
control of your music files for your
digital music player USB Drive or other
compatible devices and even better if
you ask it to play similar music sync
even uses your own tunes to make a
playlist thanks again to Ford for
powering this hack five CES special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
