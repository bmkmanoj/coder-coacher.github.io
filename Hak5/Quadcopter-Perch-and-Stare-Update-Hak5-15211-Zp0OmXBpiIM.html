by domain.com hello and welcome to act 5
my name is darren kitchen my name is
Shannon Boris if your weekly dose of
tech tell us that's right it is welcome
to 2014 2014 is awesome welcome so far
every day has been the best day of the
year today was amazing
what's your new year's resolution Oh for
real yeah yeah yes my Frio resolution is
yeah bigger and don't give so many keep
them all to yourself I hope you bleep
that does you want to keep them for
yourself unless you feel in like in the
giving spirit in which case give all the
light no what's your resolution uh 1280
by 800 because it's 640 / I I'm doing a
lot of oculus rift buy more cats Paul
got a kitten let's let's cut two kittens
that was amazing
he's so cute okay hey what did people
tune into too they turned into hack five
what did they tune in for segments
that's right and we've got some great
ones this week don't we Shannon you are
taking two you're taking a lot of bits
and pieces even from Jeff and putting
them together you maybe we're wondering
why I have a Mac I'm sorry for everybody
who hates Mac's but honestly if you go
to DEFCON everyone uses one and there's
a reason and I'm going to be explaining
why it's important to not leave your
computer on your desk whenever you have
to go make number two there you go
that's why you tuned in to hack five I'm
actually going to be doing a follow up
here on the segment from last week the
failed drone perch and stair thing where
we tried to put a pineapple in a place
where it shouldn't be and get it back
very easily well hey you know what I
think we have solution okay I have a
cold meds
I took some meds so everything just goes
into this segment thanks for watching
you see Paul I think it looks much
better like that
you know do not attempt to adjust your
television set this one's just crooked
Paul's doing upgrades on the set and I'm
just playing around here I'll put that
right back to where it was cuz otherwise
we're all like it's like Voyageur
getting hit with photon torpedoes that's
not why we tuned in we're talking about
drone stuff and the set still under
construction so let's grab some power
tools and head our way over to my office
because I'm having some fun uh actually
just a real quick update if I haven't
done this update recently or not or
whatever have you I'm doing fun stuff
with Tom Merritt on the daily tech news
show
so daily tech news show calm and that
was really fun and I'm hanging out a lot
in IRC anyway point being I want to take
a quick moment to do a little recap
about some of the drums stuff we've been
talking about some of the follow up and
feedback from you
some of the future plans that we have is
this is a work in progress series and
then next week I'm actually gonna be
bouncing back over to the other mash
Network project you know it is multiple
projects at the same time it's good
stuff actually no I that's not the case
because next week we'll be in Las Vegas
for the Consumer Electronics Show and
I'm sure you will all be tired of it
after the first couple of days and some
Oh week but until then let's talk about
drones I was so excited to see this clip
here on YouTube from Peter you guys know
Peter he's been down in the studio
before from the quad shot just brilliant
brilliant guy and he was actually got
the huge opportunity to speak at the
Kaos communications Congress I mean the
CCC it was their 30th the CCC in Hamburg
and I'm so bummed that I missed it but
anyway we had a little shout out there
as people were talking about drone
security so let's take a quick listen
one more from the internet please okay
how secure are the solutions you
presented for controlling a drone
against the text so how easy is it to
take control over drone that my yeah my
peril is controlling right now so this
is what I mentioned also in the talk it
is a problem currently it's like it's a
completely non encrypted it's like
basically we are at this stage like the
internet started out a practically is
still it's like all unencrypted stuff
running everywhere around it's like you
ran yeah there was a great example from
the hack five guys just again few days
ago there was a great video where Darren
kitchen okay it took like an hour on and
I think DJI other quadrocopter put a
pineapple on it flew to the air drone
and overtook its Wi-Fi and controlled it
from there so it's it's obviously bad we
have to work on this now but yeah that's
really necessary to do it's like we need
to secure this that was really freaking
awesome because Peter actually does some
amazing work in the world of drone at
odd autonomy autonomy it's a word with
the paparazzi project another
open-source project as far as drones are
concerned was emailed in by David who
mentions that I should check
the a PM 2.5 by 3d robotics he says
they've got a full range of drones the
source code is open and can be modified
for what you want he wanted us to check
out these two drones so let's take a
look at those really cool hexacopter
what's awesome is 3d robotics is right
here in the Bay Area in Berkley and so
I've gone ahead and contacted them and
I've signed up to get some of their gear
in and I can't wait to play with it
because they do seem to have some really
nifty stuff that might be more better
better more good or two for this
particular purpose that is perch and
stare pop a Wi-Fi pineapple on a drone
put it on a rooftop listen when you get
bored or you got your target or whatever
have you come straight home but no doing
this with sticks and so that's that's a
pretty nifty opportunity there and
another feedback email that I thought
was interesting was hear from Andrew who
wanted to say that he loves to the Wi-Fi
pineapple drone segment test and in one
is wondering if we've considered
experimenting with creating a mesh
network by using a drone to actually
drop using an electromagnet to drop
pineapples on rooftops we're working on
a solar rooftop pineapple thing for mesh
networking goodness I think is a little
too heavy for drone deployment not even
sure of an electromagnet would be the
right delivery mechanism but furthermore
we're actually working with some
open-source drone guys not 3d robotics
but some other open-source drone guys to
come up with a pineapple in the sky kind
of draw anything that will talk about
warn future but yeah I just wanted to
give you that feedback and kind of give
you some idea of where we're going and
take a look at some really cool app
stuff that I probably should have been
aware of before last week's I wouldn't
call it a failure but attempt and you
should all just just attempt to just
keep attempting whatever it may be
just keep doing more of that so let's go
over here and try more gooder stuff so
as I mentioned last time the major
element that I'm focusing on at the
moment is actually the cell phone that's
going to be going on our drone because I
want to use something that's super
simple for the pineapple to gain
internet access from and any cell phone
that can create its own Wi-Fi network
the pineapple can use its second radio
to piggyback on and that also lets us
use the phones
you know features to give us cool real
I'm data back whether it's just from the
camera or also from GPS and other
sensors like that so I'm just trying to
you know use a inexpensive
general-purpose device for something
that can benefit all of the other
greater systems and as you guys know we
initially attempted with this horrible
horrible prepaid phone from t-mobile
called the prism - I got it because it's
jellybean him because it would run
hangouts more on that in just a moment
but and mainly because of its size and
because of its light weight Ness but
it's also like a 1 gigahertz a toe tip
for a processor or something anyway it's
it's 128 grams so it's not too heavy but
it's just horribly slow to put that in
perspective the drone that just
off-the-shelf drone that we're using at
least for these tests before we get into
the more cool autonomous open-source
stuff is this DJI phantom and I know
that it has the payload capability of
lifting at least 120 hundred and 30
grams because that's what the camera
module that comes with it weighs so to
put that in perspective 130 grams for
this for this essentially a Wi-Fi camera
that records onto a micro SD card it's
kind of like GoPro quality that's on the
phantom vision to put that in
perspective to some of the other
hobby-grade stuff that's typically used
in what's called an fpv or first-person
view
setup and and that is to aid the or in
this case to aid the pilot me in
actually landing it on its target now
later on will probably remove that or it
won't necessarily be a primary system
because it will be mostly autonomous
what the hobbyists use are a really
simple C CED this is actually a Sony CCD
that's in most security cameras along
with a transmitter this happens to be a
900 megahertz transmitter and then of
course we've got a you know a 3-cell
battery here to power it all and then
we've got a mess of dung league goodness
to tie it all together that comes out to
175 grams plus on the back end you end
up with a nasty receiver like this and
then you've got to carry around a video
screen like this and you can already se
see why on
more towards just using a cell phone on
the device or on the drone and a cell
phone on the base station because nobody
wants what's this is yeah and also
there's the benefit of course of using
either a powerful Wi-Fi network that we
use or to go even further range use a 4G
system so for that since this phone does
not do 4G to big changes right now and
as we progress through this project
first of all I'm using a note three
happened to have a note three laying
around before this gets shipped out and
it is obviously much faster than the
prism to and what I initially intended
to use was just so I didn't want to
reinvent the wheel
I wanted to either use um RTC for web
broadcast real-time communications on
html5 it's really fantastic
but it wasn't supported by Chrome I will
note however the beta of Firefox on
Android does support it and so you can
actually use those chat applications
that way it's very similar to Google
Hangouts I ended up going with Google
Hangouts the frame rate was horrible but
what I didn't realize is that obviously
I'm not the first person to think of
this kind of stuff and there's this
fantastic app called Wi-Fi fpv or
first-person view and so this is the
Wi-Fi fpv app here for the i guess you
would call it the client which is
actually the drone and you'll see it has
you know just it just opens up the
camera it's got some real basic settings
where we can change things like enabling
OSD aha the OSD or the on screen display
will actually give me bearings it'll
actually use the accelerometer and the
GPS in here to actually show me what
direction I'm going and give me some
orientation control which is kind of
nice
it also since its what it's essentially
doing is it's running a streaming JPEG
server and so I can actually adjust the
quality here so at 100 the quality looks
really good but of course it uses more
bandwidth I could actually drop the
quality down here to one or i'ts and now
let's go back and start our stream and I
can pick it up over on the viewer app
let me just there we go and I just pick
up the URL so it's just streaming on
port 8080 and we're both on the same
Wi-Fi network my idea here is that phone
will be obviously connected to the Wi-Fi
pineapples so now I just need to be
within range of that pineapple so with a
nice yagi antenna I should have some
pretty good range on it I'll go ahead
and start that and as you can see I have
an absolutely horrible image but it is
low bitrate and that means that I'll be
able to have faster refresh rate which I
think is more important to me and you
can see as I tilt the phone I actually
get bearing control and I can rotate it
to see my different you know what
direction if I'm pointed west or north
and that's gonna be really helpful so
there we are that's my update for this
project the direction that we're going
and of course this is one of those where
I really want to get everybody involved
in so if you have some awesome ideas
like electromagnetically dropping
pineapples from the sky
hit me up feedback at hak5 org stay
tuned next week we're going to be at CES
and then after that it's back to drones
and mesh networks and whatever have you
I will see you there doesn't matter if
you're a curved 4k display or flexible
wearable Underpants when you have that
great idea you need a domain and hosting

yes I know a lot of people sent in other
things that mean EC oh but I was looking
for one specific thing and then answer
was an electron coupled oscillator super
geeky yay
now this week's trivia question is what
TV show first introduced virtual reality
as a plot device and I know the answer
because it's a super awesome show and I
love it it's amazing even though the
newer version is so much better so you
can answer that over at hak5 org slash
trivia for your chance to win some
awesome swag swag swag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
