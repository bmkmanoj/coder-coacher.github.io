the basics with terminal environment
customizations and this episode of hack
tip is brought to you by Atlassian
welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I am
Shannon Morse and today we are learning
about the terminal environment and how
you can customize the environment to fit
your needs now when you start up your
terminal window bash is going to read
startup files to figure out your default
configurations these different startup
files are all written in bash a
programming language and they hold all
the configurations for the terminal
session this tells the computer what the
default environment is going to be and
what kind of customizations you wanted
to do for that environment any program
that you run in the terminal will
usually have some sort of configuration
file but sometimes those programs can
also be customized with settings saved
in the environment it gets a little bit
confusing now these are called
environmental variables or environment
variables and shell variables so do you
remember aliases we covered that way
back in the spring time or last year
it's been a while go back to my previous
hack tip to learn about aliases but an
alias is in setting that lives in the
environment so shell variables are from
bash and environment variables are
pretty much everything else that can be
customized so if you want to see what
variables are being stored in your
environment let's go over to my computer
you can type print env and you can also
do that print env in a tech stock if you
wanted to but if you scroll up and down
you'll see that this shows you what
variables are currently set for the
environmental variable so you can also
type something like let's see we have
log name over here so I could type print
env log name and that should print out
snubs so it shows me exactly what that
variable is up here you could also do
the same thing for user for display log
name like I mentioned pretty much every
variable that's set in there to get a
specific variable alternatively if you
just type set
this will show you the environment
variables and shell variables in
alphabetic order as well as some code so
here way at the top of the set command
are all of those variables set in
alphabetical order which is actually
pretty nice
now aliases are a little bit different
you have to search for those separately
from set or print env for print
environment because neither of those
will show you aliases so if you want to
search specific aliases for your
computer you can type alias and that is
going to show you any aliases that you
currently have set for your computer so
for example I have one here set for
alias internets and that is going to
scan specifically for this network
variable okay so you remember how I
mentioned startup files so back to their
startup files to view a startup file in
their custom variables you can go to
your home directory and you can type LS
tak a so LS tak a will list all the
files including ones that are hidden so
ones that are hidden usually start with
a period at the front so if I did that
in my home directory I'm going to see
dot Adobe bash RC dot profile along with
a whole bunch of other hidden files but
if I just type LS I'll just see the ones
that are generally viewable to the user
if I type cat dot profile so I'm cutting
the profile file that's going to open up
this profile file and I can see what the
startup file looks like and how it works
and this is all in bash ok so now that
you have a general idea of what the
environment is and how you can actually
access those startup files we're gonna
take a quick break but we will be back
with modifying startup files in just a
little bit so stay tuned today nearly
anything is possible and if we can dream
it
teams can build it so how do you bring
everyone together to create what's next
the solution is teaming up with
Atlassian the makers of collaboration
software that lets teams work and
communicate better together instead of
separately it makes sense
you can assign track and manage tasks
for any project no matter how complex
that's the clarity of JIRA create and
share content organize results and bring
team
is up to speed with the flexibility of
confluence instant message or video chat
with your team from any device with the
freedom of HipChat and test review and
manage code in real time that's the
power of bitbucket you know that we do a
lot of coding around here I've used
bitbucket time and time again especially
with learning how to use bash for
example to share code snippets back and
forth with my coworkers because they
have been coding a lot longer than I
have so it's great to get their feedback
and I can make better segments for you
guys whenever I'm doing my hack tips you
can visit Atlassian comm to learn more
and see how JIRA confluence HipChat and
bitbucket give your team everything you
need to organize discuss and complete
shared work
Atlassian helping teams everywhere team
up to create what's next Atlassian comm
we're back and it's now time to start
modifying those startup files now you
will most likely be changing the dot
bash RC or the dot profile file now you
can use a text editor to edit these G
edit is one of them by nano or just a
few of the text editors available on
Linux machines and any of them will work
if you want to edit a startup file now
to edit the dot bash RC file first you
want to create a backup with the CP
command so CP is copy if you remember my
previous hack tips about the Linux
terminal and then you want to use your
favorite text editor to open it in the
terminal so for me I'm gonna use Nano
because it's easy so I'll go over to my
computer and you'll notice - if I hit LS
a I've already created a backup file
here so I'm not gonna go over that
because you should already know it and
I'm gonna open Nano dot bash RC and I
you can do tab complete if you want to
okay so now we have our bash RC file
open and I'm just gonna page down all
the way to the end and I've already put
my edits in here when I was testing this
out but go ahead and write this example
to your bash RC file at the bottom type
umask space zero zero zero two and then
export space hist control so history
control equals ignored oops so it's
ignoring duplicates export hist size
equals one
so the reason for this is because if you
go into your history file generally it's
only going to save the last 500 lines
that you've completed as commands in
your terminal session so by doing this
you can actually customize how many
different lines that you're going to see
in your history command so for this
example we're using a thousand so back
to this file alias l period equals so
I'm making a new alias and this is going
to Elias l period to LS tack d dot
wildcard so it's gonna look for any
hidden files and then the color is going
to be Auto and then alias ll is going to
be a l'Estaque L color equals Auto and
let's go ahead and save that with
control o file name to write bash RCS
enter and control X to exit so that
first line is going to give the file
read/write permissions for user in group
and then everyone else just get read
permissions I already went over the
second line about duplicate commands and
then the third line about history the
two aliases are going to be changed now
once you save out of your document you
want to type source dot bash RC to make
bash review the new changes because it
will only read that bash RC file every
single time that you open up a new
terminal session so I'm gonna try up
source dot bash RC hit enter I won't see
anything on standard out but I can test
this by typing ll or L period and it
looks like they both work and then I can
type history and you'll notice here that
I really haven't done much since I
reinstalled and wound two but I'm
getting there
I'll let you know when I get to a
thousand so I have used some of the
source material for this hack tip from
the Linux command line published by no
starch press it's also available online
as PDF I don't go over every little
detail of how these work and exactly
what the environment is so if you are
new to the terminal I highly suggest
getting a copy for yourself it's a
really really great read and kind of
geeky I just I love it it's a great book
now let me know what you guys think you
can send me a comment below or you can
email us
at hak5 org and be sure to check out our
sister show hack 5 for more great stuff
from just like this we just made an Open
VPN segment it was really really fun and
with that I am Shanna Morris and I will
see you on the Internet remember to
