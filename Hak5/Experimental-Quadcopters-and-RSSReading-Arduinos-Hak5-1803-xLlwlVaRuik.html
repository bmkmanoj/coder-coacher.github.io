by domain.com hey everybody and welcome
to this week's episode of hack 5 this is
your weekly dose of technology my name
is Shannon Morse obviously there is no
Darrin kitchen here but we have been
graciously accepted as cool enough for
Greg the dinosaur to join us as my
co-host today so Greg is here he doesn't
have a segment for us but he's going to
be chilling over here and he'll ask
questions if he what was that yeah so
Darrin's gonna be back next week Greg
you are correct he'll be back next week
he's currently in London I believe so
we'll see him of course he does have a
segment that will jump to later on but
first off I did have a question for you
guys before I get into my first segment
I found this thing over on Amazon it's
called the Stanley removable compartment
professional organizer so I've been
getting into all those different Arduino
segments and I've started to build all
this really cool circuitry and all these
different like boards and everything so
I was curious what you guys think of
this cuz I'm thinking about getting it
to organize all my different pieces for
my Arduino segments and it looks like it
fits pretty well so yeah let me know
what you guys use to organize all your
Arduino stuff because this looks pretty
interesting so moving on I'm having a
lot of fun with my Arduino of course
I've been doing a whole bunch of
different experiments and stuff and
today I decided to experiment with this
new step where I actually get the
Arduino to get the Internet to talk to
it and I know that sounds kind of weird
but this is actually one of the several
different tutorials that you can find in
getting started with Arduino now that's
it's a really really good tutorial it's
in Chapter six in here it basically lets
the Arduino light up with a bunch of
different LEDs that start blinking and
changing color depending on how many
times a different word is mentioned on a
website or an RSS and our example so
when I was reading through the chapters
I found that there were a couple of
different steps that I felt like we're
missing from the book and I think the
chapter was pretty much written for
somebody with mid grade experience
somebody who's been working with an
Arduino for quite a long time
as well as c-code so I decided to kind
of take a step back and start at the
beginning so everybody can understand it
even if you haven't done that many
builds so first off I wanted to talk
about actually building the Arduino
circuitry so you can get this to run so
what it looks like of course I have my
breadboard down here I have my art away
no of course you're also going to need
whoops there we go
you also need three different LEDs
there's gonna be one red one green and
one blue and you can line up those in
whichever way you want it doesn't really
matter you also need a button and that's
right over here and you'll need an LDR
which is a light dependent resistor and
of course you'll need your Arduino your
breadboard a USB charging cable which I
have plugged in over here five 10k ohm
resistors and several several different
wires for connecting because it does
take a lot of different wires so
basically the goal is to have my
computer pass code to the Arduino that
tells it how many times we have the
words Arduino drone and hack H a K
naught H ACK on our RSS feed from hak5
org so the code is going to reset every
10 seconds as it reads the RSS so we
should end up with a whole bunch of
different patterns
now fYI when you first start that start
this up whenever you actually start
reading the code from the internet it
may take several minutes for it to
actually start lighting up depending on
the RSS and the words that you choose so
you'll notice like mine isn't lighting
up right now but we did get some awesome
b-roll so I'll definitely include that
in the show so the little light
dependent resistor that's on the
breadboard that's gonna tell us how much
light is coming into the Arduino and
it's gonna be filtered from the room
whatever light is in here so you don't
really need it there but it's there the
button turns our lamp on or off of
course and then we gonna we're gonna
also show off the code a little bit but
first off I wanted to check out a couple
of different websites for you guys that
I found extremely helpful so of course
you can find the website over here for
the book shop O'Reilly comm processing
org that's going to be an important
website in just a few moments and
Arduino playgrounds so this is a really
really good tutorial it's a good little
setup about what we're doing in this
segment so moving on I'm gonna go ahead
and open up the Arduino code so my
Arduino code looks like this it's gonna
be working away with reading the inputs
from my buttons and my light sensor
while lighting up the LEDs in the
correct pattern depending on the words
from the RSS so if we take a look at the
different code for this this is in the
arduino ide as usual first up we're
gonna set up a whole bunch of constant
ends up at the top and these are going
to be matching certain pins of course if
you ended up putting your green LED and
two pin 9 you can switch those around
that's perfectly fine and then i have my
button set to pin 12 now we have the
value coming from the sensor we're just
storing that right there and then we
have all these different things down
here so button lo equals off old button
equals low again lo equals off I'm gonna
scroll down just a bit and this is kind
of important right here to a byte r g
and b r g and b are going to be our
different LEDs each one is set to zero
so that just sets the value for each one
and then we're gonna go ahead and set up
the serial port to the computer so this
basically means that the arduino is
going to be able to take that
information from the light sensor and
from the button and send those back over
to my computer's so i'll be able to read
that input on all that information next
up we have the sensor information down
below so this is going to read this
sensor and print the value to the serial
port now an interesting thing about this
i'll show you what this does real quick
down here you see this thing called
light level and i'll get into more about
this box in a second but the light level
right now in this studio it has a pretty
big box right here a pretty big white
box but if i cover up the light sensor
with my finger so i'll just cover it up
like this boop now if we look at my code
if i take it off it turns up take it
down and then it just covers up the
light so it doesn't see any sensed light
from the arduino from the breadboard or
from the LDR now on to
a little bit more about the code if I
scroll down a bit more we're going to
read the incoming bytes from the sensors
and then if marker is found the next six
characters are going to be the color so
this is going to turn the color into a
hex we're gonna accumulate six different
characters in a row store those in the
buffers so that the computer is going to
be able to understand what we're
supposed to be explaining in this and
then move the pointer forward by one so
it's going to be reading everything from
the Arduino and then moving the pointer
forward by one point or one by each now
we have three different numbers stored
as hex numbers we need to decode them
into three bytes are g and b so we do
that with a little bit of multiplication
and then reset the pointer to zero so we
can reuse the buffer again so reuse all
that memory storage down below that we
read the input value and store that from
the button so that's either on or off
this is pretty obvious we've done it
before we basically are taking the
button either on or we turn it off no go
ahead and skip down a little bit farther
and then if the lamp is on we can turn
on the different colors sent by the
computer from the code so this is going
to turn on the red green and blue LEDs
depending on the words from the RSS else
if the button has turned the lamp off or
the LEDs off then it'll set all of them
to zero and down a little bit lower
we're gonna wait 100 milliseconds
between each send so that's 10 seconds I
believe and then convert one hex into a
number each time we do this and that's
about it for the Arduino code and I'll
put that up in my github as well so now
for the weird part that I'm gonna take a
little bit more time explaining there's
another development environment called
processing and this is also another
programming language as well so this is
over at processing org what you're gonna
have to do is go over to download
processing and you can donate if you
like if not you can just click no
donation and click download and this
will bring you to either
Windows Linux or Linux or Mac depending
on what kind of computer you have after
you've downloaded this this is the IDE
that you're going to use for a second
bit of code this code is big is going to
be looking at the RSS and this is going
to be what's transferring the
information over to the Arduino so it
lights up all the different colors so
this is from the Internet to the Arduino
so basically what we have to do and a
lot of this wasn't explained in the book
so I wanted to break it down a little
bit
first off up at the top we have a bunch
of different libraries that we have to
include first off processing serial this
is going to be the information coming
from the Arduino so the input values
coming from the Arduino serial we also
have the user java.net Java dot util and
Java dot IO so these enable my computer
my Windows 8 computer to open up this
little box and show me information
basically in human language yay
so string feed equals and then this is
going to be your RSS feed or whatever
website you choose to get information
from down below that we are going to
retrieve every one minute and last time
is going to be the last time we fetched
content our three words are found here
and this is just setting the values of
those as well as light equals zero so
this is the light measured by the light
dependent resistor the info we want from
the Arduino is going to be coming over
serial so we need to include this
information and then below there we want
to include accumulated characters from
the Arduino so this is what's going to
turn the lights into something that
matches up with the RSS below that is
just a bunch of information to create
this little box so we have the type of
font that's included in our box so I
just use this one that's included in
processing as well as the font size Phil
frame weight and the size of the box and
then we scroll down a little bit more
this is serial dot list so more
information for the serial connection
this connects to the Arduino the new
serial this Arduino port 9600 is the
rate and below there we're going to
start looking at the code information
so this comes in every ten seconds I
believe millisecond - the last time that
it came in and it refreshes each time
and we're going to build a color based
on the three different values that we're
getting so we're looking for hack drone
and Arduino and throughout all this
information down here all the different
text information we're going to be
including that information to light up
the different LEDs on the Arduino we
write the color string to the screen
sending in light level those are the
inputs and then we fetched our data in
milliseconds and then down here we're
gonna check if there is data waiting to
be sent in the buffer if so we read one
byte if the byte is not a new line so if
it's not the end of a line you just add
it to the buffer once a new line is
reached we process the data and we make
sure there is enough data to actually
process so we make sure that there's a
full word like full Arduino before we
actually process that information at the
end of this we chop off the last
character if it's a carriage return
which is the end of a line of text and
then turn the buffer from a string into
an integer number so or integer sorry so
with that we take a word and turn it
into numbers once we're done down here
we clean up the buffer refresh and clear
any extra data waiting to be sent out
and then at the very bottom we zero out
the different counters for hack drone
and artery are do we know every time we
refresh and we have the URL set down
here so this is what brings up the URL
and prepares a connection for the URL
and connects to the website the data is
read from the URL one line at a time so
hence all the character information and
each line is read from the feed the
stream token a tokenizer excuse me
breaks down all the extra information
that might be in the RSS then we have
our chunk of data which is made lower
case so if HACC is capitalized it's
going to lowercase that and then we
count so if it found HACC if it's
greater than zero drone
greater than zero Arduino greater than
zero it gets incremented by one each
time
now at the bottom we set 64 to be the
max number of references that we care
about for each word so HACC dronin
Arduino has to be less than 64 and then
we multiply by 4 so that the max is 255
remember LEDs 255 increments which comes
in handy when building a color made out
of four different bytes and then of
course if there is an error for some
reason print it out from the RSS then it
also go ahead and stop the sketch
completely and we'll be done yeah all
right so I know that's a lot of
information but once you have that ready
and once you have your Arduino segment
ready you can go ahead and upload your
script to the Arduino and you can hit
run for the processing script the
processing one will open up the little
box and the box will start refreshing
the RSS every single time it wants to
actually bring up some new information
so once it actually starts reading the
RSS it'll take a few minutes but it will
start lighting up your different LEDs
which we have some b-roll of because it
looks awesome
you know that it's working because your
Rx and TX lights on your little Arduino
those will start flashing not sure if
you can see those yeah there we go so
these two lights will start flashing Rx
and TX letting you know that you have a
connection to the data running through
there so I also wanted to mention for
some reason in my case when I did the
processing segment it didn't start
counting how many times had Ronen
Arduino were found on the RSS but it did
start lighting up my LEDs I'm not sure
why I wasn't receiving the count and my
little Java applet down here so if
anybody out there is like a super genius
with C code and can't explain to me why
that's not working please do feedback at
hak5 org I would love to figure out why
that's not working when everything else
seems to so I hope this walkthrough was
fulfilling and super fun it took a whole
bunch of what we've already learned and
kind of incremented everything into one
nice tiny little package so super fun I
have a whole bunch of LED string lights
on order for a segment I'm gonna do next
week this waterfall type thing so we'll
see if that actually comes in
time I'm really hoping it does otherwise
I think that's about it so yay more
building with LEDs and fun light sparkly
things hope you liked it
stay tuned we got Darren coming right
after the break it doesn't matter
whether you're from the Cretaceous age
or the digital age when that killer idea
hits you you need to snag a domain name
and web hosting fast and with domain
coms quick domain discovery system and
easy checkout process you'll have your
website up and running in no time
I like domain.com because they're super
affordable they're reliable and they're
easy to use plus domain comes active
social media presence at domain.com on
Twitter and they're great support make
it a really fun place to do business the
guys over at domain.com are huge fans of
hack 5 and they want to hook you up you
personally use the coupon code hak5 at
checkout and get an extra 15% off and
when you think domain names think
domain.com there's two amazing projects
going on at the same time I mean a mate
two mating flights right so this micro
and this V twin and how much I mean this
is just like a regular day here at
London aerospace just completely new
crazy stuff it's so tiny so this is the
spectrum one has been selling it so yeah
I mean it's got all of the standard kit
you would want wide angle lens a
cloverleaf antenna here
yeah I can kind of see through funny oh
I see you're just getting your first
layer done now his point of fault it's
actually underpowered
oh is this it right here sure it doesn't
it was great as a copter but with the
fpv gear on it how was it like 65
percent right cuz you're adding this
much weight to it this thing is really
just down to the gram yeah I literally
know we're gonna switch to eight no
motives first and then we're gonna
switch to like the eventual idea is to
build a smallest possible brushless
motor point that's fpv zvvy I think a
lot of the thinking now is that the
smaller motors are not actually a good
fit for microwave peeping I really you
can't vote full of them rather so you a
lot of people are moving to six but
there are making little micro hexes so
micro hexans yeah but there aren't any
Alec I'll toast
micro opt-ins yeah well that's the thing
the ailing we it currently is a cord but
it's coming out with a hex version yeah
I've been seeing the alien ways too
tough to get one of those right now yeah
because it's they're basically they're
they coming up with a hex version of it
so anyway you could join a hex or joint
equals fly close together I wouldn't try
that yeah
so the idea is what you keep using the
crappy motors it comes with and just put
more of them on there to generate more
thrust or upgrade the motors to the
better motors now but I think brushed my
twins yeah they are everybody's
basically moving away their whole reason
the 250 size became so popular is
because it's the smallest possible point
that can do everything yeah the
technologies come on now so smaller
cords can do everything yes this is uh
this is probably actually 75 or 80 to 85
millimeters Wow I've got this suspicion
that the 250 class took off because you
could put everything on a 250 cells
point yeah my suspicion is that when 250
we race to a few things but we still
have to go to Hackney Marshes mid enough
space cuz these things are so fast they
can move so far so quickly yep my
suspicion is that when you get to a quad
that's small enough to race around the
backyard
right you can have a decent race too so
as soon as like now that technology's
reached a point where you'll be able to
have a smaller cord that can still do
everything and so that everything and it
and it opens it up to so many more
people there's so many more places you
can fly you can fly oh that's a good
point even though this you know nano VTX
here may only be say 25 milliwatts or
something because it's it's so tiny it
doesn't matter because if you're racing
in the backyard you don't need you know
500 meters video range you need yeah not
even 100 we have a lot more fun with a
250 than we do we'd like a 650 is an
hour oh yeah
myself as well it's like where are you
gonna fly your 650 can't fly it through
the trees or anything you're gonna hover
at a high altitude and say look at the
ground it's so brown d so we can hack on
the code and experiment like okay this
is it
listen that is so cool oh wow so what
are what's this here for the camera yeah
then I go children yeah no nice I like
how the batter just slides through there
and then this is made for the six
millimeter motors yeah so now this is
just makes me a potion that's right
so tell me about London aerospace so
we're 200 so 200 people are members in
the last just a year of starting just a
year yes and we regularly get probably
30 people on a weekend confluence fly
recently I like most weekends we're down
in in Kent last weekend bracing data
forests and then the weekend before that
we went to basically every weekend
there's something that's the middle of
winter and come summer we open the
backyard up he's laying there in the
compact back here finding something what
would your answer be because you know
simulators notwithstanding what somebody
asked you what needs a good open source
like quad pop the simulator and there
isn't one right now listen there's ones
that are designed to teach people to fly
airplanes some of them have a quad
copters built in there there's one
called eros MRC which is not terrible
that the world really needs like a
really good like they're all designed
for like you can learn to fly a
quadrocopter the way people fly balloons
you know like video platforms that go up
and this is a stable and they rotate and
readjust things and you know they're not
the same kind of racing that we do
they're not designed to teach people to
race like 250 so important yeah through
the tree is raised in flight proximity
and stuff and fly a crow and a crow Plus
yeah so this is an aero stem RC yeah but
you're saying this is just not with the
times then yeah so what's the the go to
craft that you recommend men people we
tell people to start off with a micro
something about that size and just like
learn to fly around your house and get
comfortable with like you know going
forward and backward and flying tail in
and then you've got a choice you can
either you can either like if you can if
you
have the brain plasticity to learn to
fly like nose in and fly like actually
inflate yeah we're left becomes right
and right becomes left because the craft
is now pointing toward you
and you can learn to fly and Hosey quite
hard because I'm a very short amount of
time to react or you can learn to fly on
something like Aris MRC which is how I
learned it took me 17 months suppling
hours to go from not being able to do it
and then area Marci has like training so
it's like go forward go back go left go
right go forward go back and then tells
you okay rotate 90 degrees and go
forward back with their fright and like
it's really hard going down yeah you
know your brain has to think relative to
the craft instead of absolute from your
perspective yeah if you do that you
follow the tutorial you're playing box
patterns and then figure eights and then
eventually a point will Carmen where
your brain goes trick and from that
moment on you can do it you just like
it's the weirdest experience and it
really for me it was it was their day
that I got it the day that I went oh my
god I can actually do this now like
there was something in my hair there was
something about not trying to fly in
there not trying to hover nosy but like
saying okay I'm always gonna go forward
in Michigan if you're moving this off
and always like it's like when you learn
to snowboard like at one point you
suddenly realize that yeah you can lean
on the front foot and you will turn and
it was something about like forcing
myself to always keep going forward
behind this in a simulator and then I
went from the simulator back to to
flying my 250 quad and I could just do
it it was really yeah but I'd already
been flying if he leave before that so
you can go from flying her a small line
aside
Micro boarded and then if you want if
you're quite brave you can go build
yourself a 250 new first-person view
court and you can fly that fpv but I
think a lot of people say you shouldn't
do that other people say you should
learn to fly line of sight no Z inverse
because you never know when you're going
to want to you know pick one up and fly
it back or you should be able to handle
especially it's like your your goggles
go out if you lose video signal and
you've got the craft now facing towards
you yeah yeah and there's something
there's something you I had never
actually seen my quad fly like really
flying except hold on because I I
couldn't find anybody I get this one
the club there's no one else about a
quadrocopter here and we didn't I didn't
have anybody else who could fly my phone
for me so I could see it being flown so
I didn't really have a good sense of how
it flew now I would thoroughly recommend
people who learn to fly either a small
like that size its quad something that
you can not break too easily or get a
simulator and learn to fly and oz9
simulator before they go in the other
250 but most people have ignored that
advice and they've turned out fine for
them so what's your favorite micro yeah
I mean they're all proprietary you know
but they're all toys yeah so the alien
way that one to fight is a 32-bit
processor on a tiny little like brushed
motor besides this is a brushed motor
right so you don't need an electronic
speed control of one of the if you just
basically dump DC voltage and it's been
support weight it's only you know
positive negative on that lead anyway
yeah so the two kinds of quads brushed
motor pods like this like the hub sounds
and and the blade nano QX and then you
go up to the slightly larger size which
are brushless I'm not a huge fan of the
brushed motor quads although if you do
want to learn on one the blade Nano QX
is a really good little brush motor boy
this was a blade nano QX now I are
upgrading the print just finished okay
so we're we're gonna we're gonna start
modifying the frames this will be a this
will probably be a bit too heavy to fly
but it's just to to make it a bit
stronger we could drill it out I've got
a name Wow
this is gorgeous that's fine this is if
it doesn't fly just the cccd on it and
3d and everything about CC CDs runnin
clean plate yeah
and I have a costume mixer that works
for a clean plate by try transparent lab
- Tara laughs which is what the brain
FPV uses and they didn't go so well so I
know there because this being a v-twin
you've you've got some different
characteristics of Lights though using
torque differential to steer the yaw
oh good car you're lecturing using
directions lost so you need to Oh weird
okay so normally with the quadcopter of
these were not a V yeah to rotate you
would do just between the motor so right
because either clockwise and those are
counter clockwise if you want to turn
right you'd spend these up more and it
cause it to turn that way I'm vice versa
if you want to
it's the same principle that makes a
helicopter spin as it spirals out of
control in the action hero movies when
they get hit by the missile yeah yeah
those are tails because what the tail
does stops the chemical rotation yeah so
how does this actually turn then it
spends off with one of the rear mores
just pushes it yeah and because it's not
it's a lot more efficient because of
that because you're actually using
directional but the fact that you're not
falling on your own wash all the time
yeah and the props means that you're
gonna get much smoother flight this is
just sickest build I love this what's
the plan armor tone menu link yeah yeah
and then this board is the brain that's
the brain ash TV yeah yeah with the OSD
built-in yeah that's really cool
this is the future of like building
quads to like have these stackable -
right and so everything becomes 36
millimeter yeah it's just become the de
facto standard yeah that's pretty cool
what are these for you Eddie foldable
yeah okay what about these um so why
just as I just don't do one screw and
they fall forward
yeah if it does spray I'll just print
another one yeah I got Tonya wants to
know oh wait no the wait does it matter
that your flight controller is tilted to
the right just a bit oh yeah oh sorry
area where it's uh what is it it's a
half the height above the the length of
the blade where it what is that place
called the ground effect yeah so the
