talk about streaming audio absolutely
now why would we want to stream audio
and what is this going to do for us
definitely going to allow me well I'm it
worked better listen to all the music
that I want right I leave you know we've
talked about this before i leave my head
my ipod at home all the time when i
leave it and you know i want to be able
to listen to music at work i'll be at a
party i want to get access to my music
whatever wherever you are as long as
there's a pc what about access it yeah
now and there's a million ways to do
this and we touched on it a little bit
last episode when we talked about the
VPN which i believe is one of the best
feature wise ways to get access to your
music because you get like all the cool
features of actually being on the
network right so you set up a VPN and
you know you set it up with itunes to
connect your music collection great a
couple of problems well one if you're
doing with windows XP the VPN connection
the crime yeah one concurrent connection
that could be a problem if you want to
have your friends get in on it right the
other problem is a little tricky to set
up you know it's not something that you
would give to your friend yeah I don't
even your mom or something like my mommy
when I did she need access to my VPS
yeah it gets a little ridiculous it's a
little too much well there's a couple
other ways to do it a easiest way i
think is ftp absolutely Sapa lousy
server with filezilla or some similar
bulletproof yet and just be able to
setup a ftp drive to your music very
easy to access and you know it's a
little quirky but with this little
utility from novell yeah i can actually
map a network drive to an ftp location
will have all the links and everything
in the show notes for that and that way
you know you just go to my computer and
bam you know it's it's right in there
and as far as you know winamp can tell
it's just arrived one of the cool
benefits of that is i could give you
write access you know different user
accounts i could give an account john is
a right you got write access going to
send me some stuff yeah yes you see so
legit if it's click creative commons
yeah another way to do it oh well you
know what back up ftp the con seriously
that's really this but that's not
something i'm going to call my sister
and be like yeah sure you just
accessibility and this
program do this do that let's drive now
I would know you want to upload okay
well I've set up permission grants place
you had a party just want to set
something up real quick not still not
the thing to use I think the easiest and
this is something that I've been using
for a while is I've already gotten
apache server running on my machine
right so why don't I just alias to my
music folder so then you know it's just
an IP address it's you know security
through obscurity or you could just put
an htaccess file in there if you want
some security and the cool thing is you
get a directory listing of all your
music and just go in click the mp3 it
plays a couple of cons though finish its
playing you have to go back and choose
another one is right instead of
playlists it is really you can
fast-forward I mean that yes that's the
good thing you know in Firefox with
quicktime it just streams it right there
and her eyes or got a lot of pluses I
like that except for the you know the
drawbacks are you can't upload music to
it you know you got to click one file at
it today so you showed me the most
awesome application and then pretty cool
oh it's by slim some devices all devices
it's called slim server this thing is
gorgeous and I just got him oh it's just
what's pretty exciting about it I got
him on and I've been telling about it
for a while he just keeps ignoring me
but now he finally it's cool hacker okay
so let's go have your works for me right
somehow I somehow found this this
software basically load it install it on
your computer really easy next next
finish neck legs finished catalogs your
music how to lotion missing just like
iTunes so you know you can do sh onra
you can do all that work everything
artwork cool art works here flavor I'm
finding music I didn't even know I had
in my collection because I go to the
artwork thing and I'm like you know as
long as you got the album art when you
download your music at the album or put
it in the folder it shows up and I'm
like wow what's this CD and stuff I
hadn't listened to in years yeah now now
it's there and it's pretty funny because
your action is pretty funny like you who
is this i don't even know I had this CA
and the way that it works is you
actually connect to a stream and the
cool thing is you don't have to use like
any special software if you're using
windows media player itunes Winningham
whatever it'll connect to the mp3 stream
right and it's just one stream and then
once it's changed on the server side
that's all it matters it's just one
stream once the change got a port
forward not a big deal so then you use
the web interface to control the stream
so they're just a really cool black goo
browse create a playlist of right and
then it rescan whenever you
like add music to your list or you add
possibly if you want you can do the
FileZilla set up an ftp and add a whole
nother folder now you can do both you
can do all the even do all of them sort
of kind of together and I like this
because i can give you access to its got
permissions and accounts inside i can
give you access he can listen to his own
stream i can have my own stream or i
could have one stream and like be DJ for
all my friends right it's a really
amazing piece of software i love it i'm
going to start using it like crazy
that's the coolest this is a really
coolest part it's got different
interface it's got a different interface
you can change the template on it and it
will be handheld template this will
allow you to use possibly what what type
of friends could you use for them I've
got a treo 650 it's a palm phone where
you could use one of these smart phones
that you run windows mobile or a symbian
phone and anything with a web browser
you'll be able to like control your
music from it and if you've got a phone
that has like a media publication or
yeah media player but I think you can
listen to it on the go that's amazing I
which is really really cool and it's
just a really it's a light really light
software he doesn't take a whole lot to
run I'm going to set it up on my stereo
and use it to control the stereo yeah
it's like a little remote like some
order yeah all the time alright so that
pretty much wraps it up those are a
couple of ways to do it we know there's
a million others so sound off in the
forums and the show notes let us know
what you think what you use and we look
forward to hearing responses so all the
fun tweaks and how to do it client-side
server-side all that show notes hak5 org
so go get your stream on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
