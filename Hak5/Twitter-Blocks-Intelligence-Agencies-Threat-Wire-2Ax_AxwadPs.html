Equifax is targeted in the W to hack a
security researcher starts early in
turns ten grand and is the FCC going to
side with the people all that coming up
now on threat wire greetings i am
shannon morrison this is threat wire for
tuesday may 10 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security our privacy and
our internet freedom first off if you
haven't checked out our patreon page yet
take a look since this show has no
sponsors it is completely supported by
our viewers so thank you very much to
all you guys all of our patrons our
first story comes from twitter now it
probably doesn't come as a surprise
there's a company called data miner that
mines public tweets as they are posted
to find data on current events in media
outlets law enforcement and more paid
data miner really good money to share
this information with them whenever you
are trying to be ahead of a storm or
trying to break worldwide news it can be
well worth it and well worth the price
well twitter has a five percent stake in
data miner which is a private company
and they've decided to ban intelligence
agencies from receiving that data
twitter has a policy banning third
parties from selling surveillance to
government agencies but data miner has
been selling data to the US government
for two years so why now why ban them
now while news outlets suspect it is
because twitter doesn't want to be
perceived as being in federal agencies
pockets and the most twitter has said is
to wall street journal quote data is
largely public and the US government may
review public accounts on its own just
like any other user could now according
to John Inglis a former deputy director
of the NSA this would be hypocritical of
twitter since data miner is still
selling data to private outlets such as
news agencies now much of the data has
been used to spur quick reaction the
terrorist attacks and large upheavals
worldwide but will this dismissal by
Twitter have a negative effect on the
safety of citizens or will the
government just end up finding a
different way around it when I was ten
years old I was playing the mist video
game which I believe came out in
nineteen
three nowadays 10 year olds are winning
bug bounties for several thousand bucks
at least that's what happened when a
finished boy discovered a bug on
instagrams API that allowed him to
delete anyone's comments without even
being logged in which he can't really be
logged in anyway cuz given his age he's
not even supposed to be using the
service Facebook who owns Instagram paid
him ten thousand dollars or paid his mom
now while you may think that's a lot of
money for comments the API bug may be
much deeper and have much greater
consequences than just deleting them
yani the boy who found the problem wants
to become a computer security researcher
once it gets older and I say props to
him in a surprising turn of events it
sounds like the FCC and the FTC are
working to better protect consumers
mobile security by ordering mobile
carriers to provide information on how
they issue security updates to phones as
well as questioning their processes for
reviewing and releasing these security
updates a longtime problem in the mobile
smartphone industry and tablet industry
world is having a huge delay between
when a vulnerability is discovered and
how long it takes a carrier to implement
a fix for phones on their system
sometimes it can take months or you may
not even get one at all some devices
never even receive a patch making them
completely unprotected from possible new
hacks that are discovered now while no
fix has actually been disclosed the
FCC's letter to the press does state
that responses will inform discussions
with the industry about possible future
solutions Equifax is one of those big
credit bureaus that keep track of your
credit and because of the default codes
allowing employees to use their site
through a portal many w-2s are thought
to have been stolen from at least one
company kroger who employs over 400,000
people at their grocery stores the
default code get this it's the last four
digits of your social security number in
your birth year not very hard to get at
all especially if the social security
number was discovered through i don't
know maybe a health insurance hack that
previously happened for example the hack
was most likely used for tax refund
fraud since w-2s have a lot of the
information needed to file fraudulent
tax returns now this isn't the first
time
equifax has been scrutinized for their
security either in April of 2015 Equifax
sent letters to some users notifying
them that they're personally identifying
information may have accidentally been
set to the wrong people and in March of
2013 many celebrity accounts were also
accessed through this site oh boy
Equifax now thanks to everyone who has
