coverage with hak5 I'm Shannon Morse
coming to you from CES 2012 and I found
the Leonardo booth hey Zach how's it
going guys are you doing all right over
here I I am doing more than all right so
what are you working on I have no idea
what do you want to call this I have no
idea what this is this is it's a 3d
design program that I'm doing it looks
like a dragon from Skyrim kind of let's
go with that if this ends up in Skyrim
I'll be happy okay so this looks really
cool and actually looks kind of easy and
it's in 3d so tell me about this
technology what is this software well
first off this is the Leonardo this is a
brand new technology that just came out
here let me take my glasses off yeah so
this is a brand new technology that came
out about a year ago and it's just been
flooding the market to give you an idea
of how awesome this is
that guy was a circle uh maybe four
hours ago what are you kidding me yeah
feel the level of detail and and
intensity that you can get from this
kind of a program at at you know with
with knowing very little it's just
unbelievable let me let me give you an
example of how freaking awesome this
program is okay would you say go ahead
and go and watch this guy for me okay
this guy okay so we have a we have a
sphere that you are creating sphere and
here we go oh my god okay so it looks
like it has hair Oh couple of eyes
alright and and we have a nose a little
mouth oh it's it looks like a tongue or
maybe a very large chin
oh it's Jay Leno exactly it's kind of
like oh what's that game you play with
your friends when you're really drunk
and you act out stuff and you can't say
anything
that's charades there you go it's
charades with 3d basically the greatest
thing is is that if you look here at the
wireframe here for any of those modelers
out there you know that the level of
detail in something like this and
something so free-flowing like this
takes hours upon hours upon hours upon
hours I just did that in just what five
ten seconds something like that what I'm
familiar with with 3d like graphic
simulations like this is you have to
take every single point and move them
separately and it seemed like you were
just able to press one area and
everything kind of floated in together
if you look here each of these each of
these lines on here has a vertice at the
center of it and that's what you're
talking about you grab the point you
pull it got the point you pull it can
you imagine how long it takes you to
make this by grabbing once I'm pulling
it I would pull my hair out and I
already have none so you know so I mean
it's it's just it's it's fantastic the
Leonardo software brings the organic
artistic nature into a digital world and
it's it's a 2.0 stage right now and it's
already exploding so you can expect huge
things from this software that's
incredible and I think this this model
right here has more polygons than the
Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time video
game completely combined so is this on
the market right now if you're like just
consumers to buy or universities or what
have you
yeah actually um to be honest Lee I'm
actually not an employee of thenar of
Leonardo I am a student at the
University of Iowa right the Ergo Hawks
and so I'm in the 3d design department
and basically what happened was is that
as soon as we heard about this product
we were there we're like hey we want
this we want to get on it and we got it
the first day we sat down we got about
three hours of teaching and the next day
we came back and we could all make stuff
like this you know I'm a junior in
college I've had about three classes to
teach me 3d design and I've already made
you know things like my dragon guys so
you know it's just like it it's
unbelievable the amount of detail that
you can get from something so simple you
know so so revolutionary and again like
I said it's just you're gonna see so
much out of this you're gonna be seeing
so much out of this because you can get
so much detail for so little knowledge
and it's so free-flowing and artistic so
yeah I can see how this is going to be
perfect for like anybody that wants to
develop their own video games or create
their own 3d models
I saw you printed some out over there
they looked incredible so how much does
the software with the I don't know what
this thing is a bird it looks kind of
like a bird the painter yeah yeah tell
me about it
so so basically you've got your your
setup is you've got these three little
things on the screen here and they track
when you wear the glasses put these on
will go super geek you take these yeah
you take these glasses and they have
sensors in them and it tracks the
sensors so if I'm Square to the screen
here and I get my adder and remove tool
and I just pull the alien thing out of
his chest which you'll see here in a
second the way it works is that the
sensors on the screen here they register
the the placement of the glasses in
relation to the screen so let's say you
know I can't see the back of his leg
somewhere or whatever I can move my head
up and now I can see the back of his leg
you know so not only do I move the
actual camera I can move my head as well
and it's all about bringing the organic
and natural sculpting feeling to the
digital world and and by far the
Leonardo company has accomplished this
Wow okay so we have sculpting we got
augmented reality 3d creativity graphics
developing video gaming yeah
gonna see some new Final Fantasy
characters on your shirt shortly I'm
very soon okay so how much does it cost
right now I believe the retail is 1350
it is a little expensive for consumers
but that's all you have to do point at
it and say I'm sold this is gorgeous
where can people find out more
information the Leonardo website switch
all right so the Leonardo website it's a
le Leonardo comm and there's a three in
there somewhere so Google it all right
you heard it first Leonardo comm with
the three in there somewhere thank you

the software it's incredible and I can't
wait to get my hands on it and get
creative with some Final Fantasy
characters all right if you want to find
