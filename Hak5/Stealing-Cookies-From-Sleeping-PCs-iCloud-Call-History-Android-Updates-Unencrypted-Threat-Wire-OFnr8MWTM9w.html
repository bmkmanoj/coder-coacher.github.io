privacy three million Android devices
are vulnerable to hacks and you can
steal cookies from a locked PC with a
super cheap device coming up now on
threat wire greetings I'm Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for Tuesday
November 22nd 2016 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom
good news for patrons over at
patreon.com slash threat wire we are now
offering an exclusive patreon only audio
feed of threat wire and you can copy our
RSS link into your favorite podcasting
app to listen to our show offline so you
can listen to it on your commute and you
don't have to worry about your data you
fund the making of the show so thank you
this is a gift to our patrons for
letting us bring you security news every
single week our first story is all about
Apple if you own two iPhones and you're
using the same Apple ID for both of
those yeah chances are that your call
history is being stored in the iCloud
without your knowledge for up to four
months in a recent report by forensic
tool maker
elcome soft people that called you when
they called durations of calls missed or
rejected calls and a history of such are
stored in a user's iCloud account if
they use two or more iPhones on the same
Apple ID and they are set up to sync to
the Apple iCloud this information isn't
easily obtained by the user themself but
they can be extracted by police by Apple
or a third party that gets your Apple ID
and the password and they have the
capability in tools to extract data
which to be honest are pretty easy to
come by if you use two-factor
authentication haha you would think that
you would be safe but that could also be
bypassed by extracting the iCloud
authentication token to fix this problem
Apple recommends not using the same
Apple ID for more than one device or
disabling iCloud syncing completely but
in some cases like if you want to sync
your photos your calendar and your app
that's not necessarily a really good fix
if you do have a family with iPhones and
they're all on the same ID Apple also
recommends
it's not using the same Apple ID and
recommends turning on family sharing but
if you own one for work and then another
one for personal use this may not be a
very good answer either hmm unencrypted
updates they are definitely not a good
idea especially when they can open up
your Android device to man-in-the-middle
attacks from a third-party attacker
researchers at Anubis networks
discovered last week that over-the-air
updates on about three million Android
devices are completely unencrypted and
they could allow for just this kind of
attack to happen
the Chinese former agent Tech or Reagan
Tech group created the over-the-air
implementation used in these devices and
it works similarly to a rootkit an
attacker could gain root privileges on
your phone and then run fatal commands
to take control over the device vendors
for the phones have been alerted to the
problem but many of these are
inexpensive phones sold at retailers
like Best Buy so if a family member uses
a phone from blue studio Infinix Dukey
or leagoo they may want to be careful
with updates other than blue none of the
other manufacturers have fixed the issue
at the time of recording in a similar
hack to the one that we reported on a
few months ago Samy Kamkar has created a
device called poison tap that can allow
an attacker to install a persistent
backdoor onto a computer and all that
computer needs is to have an open
browser window running in the background
or on the forefront obviously poison tap
runs on a raspberry pi zero it's a cute
little five dollar device and the code
is freely available on Kamkar site and
it works by tricking a computer into
giving it a new a thern ette connection
and it steals HTTP requests from a
browser session this includes cookies
from open sessions which allows an
attacker to hijack accounts that also
have two-factor authentication turned on
to protect yourself you can hibernate or
you can turn off your computer when
you're leaving it you can close all your
browser's you can clear a browser cache
and disable your USB port or you can use
an application that allows for full disk
encryption and deep sleep mode or you
can just stick glue inside your USB
ports so that you never have to worry
about USB hacks again but I don't
necessarily recommend that last one so
don't yell at me if you
that glue in your computer thank you
again to all you find people for being
patrons of threat wire you can
contribute over at patreon.com slash
threat wire to get your name on threat
wired net as well as your own fair baby
in the show and not only that but you
will also get access to that patreon
only audio RSS feed of course if you
can't contribute you can give the show a
thumbs up and you can subscribe on
YouTube comm slash hack 5 there's a
little subscribe button down below and
there will also be one right after I
talk now let's see if we can get our
channel up to 280,000 subscribers I
would love for that to be my next goal
and you can find all of our episodes you
can find links to our social networks
and other ways to contribute over at
threat wired net and with that I'm
Shannon Morse and I will see you on the
Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
