by domain.com all right here we are in
downtown San Francisco having a little
bit more fun with the birdhouse project
and oh hey look I found some friends
we're actually look out for just just
look out for hak5 on british TV soon
that should be fun if I could ask you
guys to maybe hold this while we get
right into it so last time when we were
working on the birdhouse project
basically we're talking about the you
know the concept of it and I didn't
really get too much into the software so
let me show you what's actually running
on our mark 5 here basically this will
become an infusion soon but for right
now it's just a command line program
that requires monitor mode so airmon-ng
start wlan0 so we're going to just use
the aircraft sweet to bring up a monitor
mode interface and what that means is
that our realtek radio in this Wi-Fi
pineapple is going to be basically
listening to anything on well it's going
to do channel hopping but it's going to
listen to anything around on Wi-Fi and
we're going to then only listen to
certain frames of the the Wi-Fi spectrum
we've talked about management frames
before and as we know there are a bunch
of really interesting ones and one that
only gets leaked out by devices that
we're interested in are called probes
and probes can either be you know
probing for a specific network saying hi
is linksys around or they can be probing
to broadcast saying hey who's around and
those frames they only come out of
client devices like laptops and
smartphones and tablets whereas when
that whereas access points or what's
considered a base station they don't
send probes so it's kind of the easiest
quick and dirty hacky way to just see
clients in the area as long as they are
probing now yes we are going to miss a
few clients in the area that aren't
probing and maybe later on in this
project will you know actually seek
those out as well but the quickest and
simplest way to actually do that is to
just pull up
monitor mode interface and then listen
to that traffic and then filter out for
only management type 0 for right the hex
is 0 for and so that's why this program
is actually called experiment 802 11 04
and we just specify the interface and in
this case Mon 0 and immediately what
we're going to see here is on the left
our time code now this time code is in
UNIX epoch which is in seconds elapsed
since some arbitrary date in the 60s or
70s I don't remember exactly but it's
the quickest way to keep track of time
and then in the right column we actually
have the bssid or we colloquially know
it as the MAC addresses the media access
control address and that is specific to
that device and what's awesome about
these is with the caveat of them being
self administered they're mostly unique
we're not going to see two devices with
the same mac address in fact on most
smart devices these days like phones and
tablets there's no real convenient way
to even change that so for normies this
is going to pick up a ton of different
devices as we've seen already so
essentially what we're going to do for
our first bit of capturing is quite
simply since this is just a
proof-of-concept thing the quickest and
easiest way to get that into a file is
to do standard redirection into a file
I'm going to call this San Francisco 1
dot log and then I'll do an ampersand to
run it in the background and now I'll
tail tak F to follow that login / SD /
San Francisco log and we can see now
it's the same data except this time it's
actually going into a file that we can
later process and so what we'll be doing
with this data to make it available for
everyone to be able to play with at home
is we're going to anonymize these mac
addresses because while they don't
really tell us who a person is it is
specific to their device and so i really
value everybody's privacy and i want to
make sure that we're being respectful so
what we'll do is using some text
processing we're going to split that MAC
address into the two parts the first
three octet of a mac address are unique
to the manufacturer it's called the ouy
and that is you know basically you can
look up in a database and see these
three octet so the mac address are for
xerox corporation or for lucky gold star
or from motorola or for samsung or apple
or HP or whoever and these manufacturers
they register to get these oh you is and
now we can based on this information
glean interesting statistics for example
what the percentage of odd or no iphone
or apple users there are on this street
corner here in san francisco now that's
second half of the mac address that's
unique to that individual and so what
we're going to do to keep it unique is
rather than what we typically do
shorthand style in the hacking world of
just you know replacing the mac address
with a bunch of x's we're actually just
going to md5sum that because it's a hash
it's going to be unique and it's going
to be simple and quick to do so what
we'll end up with is time in UNIX epoch
the oh you I or the manufacturer as well
as a unique md5 sum or a hash of that
individual that won't be easy to reverse
back to who that individual was so we'll
be maintaining privacy and also building
a pretty good set of data now of course
this is all into a flat file right now
which isn't going to be very easy to
process so down the line we're actually
going to talk about putting this into a
database which is going to be fun
because we haven't dealt with postgres
or my sequel databases on hak5 in a very
long time and then of course we will
make that database available for
everyone to have fun crunching the
numbers and you know cleaning
interesting information from so just let
I would give you a quick update on the
project thus far and what we're doing on
the software side I will see you guys
next week mmm you smell that I need to
make lemon flavored mustaches this is
the case this is totally fact how it
works is now available on the broad
bands for which you too can have a
brilliant ideas because when you get
that idea you have to search for it fast
and what's awesome is that domain com
they've got this quick domain discovery
system making
their checkout process and everything
super simple to get you set up in no
time at all fire up that web server
because we're about to get creative
that's a brilliant idea told you guys
before I love domain com because they're
reliable they're affordable the easy
news but most of all you'll realize that
it is super fun place to do business as
we have realized as we tweet them at
domain.com and realize wow these people
are just crazy enough to do business
with us they like lemon flavored
mustaches like brand new from the minds
of the domain place where they dig up
the domains it's so great but you know
what else is crazy the savings if you
use the coupon code hak5 at checkout
you're going to get an extra fifteen
percent off from your mind into the web
domain name website you're up and
running so when you think of main names
think domain.com
it is now time for the trivia question
of the week last week's trivia question
was what was apples code name for the
ipod and the answer was dulcimer this
week's trivia question is what quick
spreading virus found to have begun
around May of 2000 relied on recipients
curiosity to propagate you can answer
that at hak5 org slash trivia for your
chance to win some awesome hak5 goodies
hey everybody I'm back this week and I
found a cool little tip for you to check
out which may end up saving you a little
bit of time hopefully it will you've
probably not already got netcat on your
computer up and running if you've been
watching my heck tips so say you need to
send a friend a really quick text file
or you want to create a quick command
line version of paste bin for example if
you've used pastebin a whole lot you
know what it is it basically just sends
people a whole bunch of text and a
little link that people can share so
there is a tool available called term
bin and you can find this over at term
been calm it looks like urban but it
really is tournament calm this tool is
basically used to turn your command line
text into a shareable link so here's how
it works all you need to have on your
computer is netcat yay and everybody
already knows how to install netcat so
i'm going to skip that part once you
have netcat actually installed you need
to find slimes some sort of text file or
some kind of information that you want
to send out in a link i have created a
little text file called kittens because
why not and it's available in My
Documents folder so i want to send this
over to say my friend sarah so if i just
have cat kittens txt which i can
actually use cat in my Windows machine
and I'll show you how to do that later
kittens dot txt you'll see this really
really nice long summary of kittens yay
because I love cats so I just get the
text in the terminal yeah a big deal i
can't really share that with anybody but
you can add this extra little bit of
command line text to the very end and
you'll be able to send it out like a
link so to do that i would type in cat
kittens txt pipe that up and down arrow
and
see term oops term bin dot-com 9999 hit
enter and it'll take just a little bit
of time a couple of seconds and it gives
you back a nice little link so now if I
take this link so it's term been calm at
X 3 p.s so term been calm / x 3 p.s
should give me back there it is so I get
all the texts into a nice little
document that I can then link out to my
friends as just a regular HTML website
very very cool so basically what this
means is you are piping the catted text
that file in the terminal over to term
been calm via netcat which is probably
already installed on your computer on
port 9999 and the output is a basic link
in your browser you'll see your text at
the link so very very simple now you can
try to do the same thing in the command
with echo or LS so if I wanted to type
in something like echo I love hak5 pipe
and we're going to pipe this to NC turn
been calm and same port 9999 let's see
if this works should work since it's
just an echo of text in my command line
okay so this time it's six SMP so I'll
try this one six SMP an effect five yay
it works and I could also do the same
thing with LS so if I wanted to send
over I don't know my whole terminal
listing i could do LS tech la pipe same
thing and see term been calm 9999 let's
see if this works okay so this is VG p 3
p gp3 see if that work hey work oh my
god look there's kittens dot txt yeah
it's so excited this is awesome okay so
all that just works just peachy keen now
if you're wondering how I use a lesson
cat in my
windows prompt this is pretty cool too
you can actually change those it's kind
of like having aliases in terminal I
guess you could say that's also a hack
tip that I did over on hack tip hak5 org
so I want to change my directory over to
windows so I'm going to go over to c
colon backslash windows so I go over
there that's the first thing that I need
to do now i can type in this thing
called copy con so to do this copy con
first thing I hit is CLS to clear my
screen so it doesn't look all like
garbage and I'm going to change my
directory over to the windows directory
so C colon backslash windows now in here
i'm going to type in copy con and then
whatever I want the actual command to be
so cat I want to be able to use cat CMD
hit enter and it will let you type in a
bunch of extra information down on the
next line down here you're going to type
in the windows command so the windows
command that kind of correlates with cat
is type and then I want to use let it
use several different variables after it
so one two three four five variables hit
enter and then hit ctrl Z enter one file
is copied so now if I go back over to
i'm going to go over to my users /
shannon / documents i think that's where
the kittens file is yeah kittens txt
okay so i'm going to type in cat kittens
txt hit enter and there we go so I can
still do type kittens txt and I get the
exact same thing so I'm able to use both
of my different commands now in my
windows command prompt instead of having
to memorize all those stupid windows
command prompts because those are really
really annoying so that works you can do
the same thing with LS if you want to
use LS instead of dir for example for
that you would just type in copy con el
SE md hit enter and then type in dir hit
enter ctrl z enter and then you'll see
one copy filed so now you can use both
of those as if they are bash command so
cool so there's a couple of tips for you
this week that's all I got for you this
week because we are
crazy over here trying to move into our
new place maybe we'll see watch last
week's episode very very important
information so let me know what you
think you can always send me an email

about wraps up this week's episode of
hak5 our place is a mess hopefully it
won't be so messy soon but first before
we head out I wanted to share a techno
lyst photo of the week it's been a
little while that we got a really cool
one from Marty he said so here's a photo
