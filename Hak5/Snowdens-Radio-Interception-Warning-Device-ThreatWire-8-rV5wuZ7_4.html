warning system for your phone's radio
DMCA is under fire by the e F F and the
DNC was hacked - all that coming up now
on threat wire greetings I'm Shannon
Morse and this is threat wire for July
26 2016 your summary of the threats to
our security privacy and Internet
freedom if you haven't checked out our
patreon yet please do so we have lots
that we want to do for the show but we
can't do it without your support
patreon.com slash threat wire is the
place to support threat wire and the
link is in the show notes now one of the
longest-running problems in recent
history with privacy is well cellphone
interception and how a state affiliated
attacker could easily use your
smartphone against you to combat this
Edward Snowden who is very famous for
his leaks of the NSA's prison documents
along with others is working with
hardware hacker Andrew bunny Wong to
design a device for iPhones that would
monitor electrical signals going to the
phones and tenez this would be able to
check if a phones radios were
transmitting get this even if you put it
in airplane mode or in a signal blocking
case which may or may not work like it
should a privacy device such as this
could be used to protect journalists and
dangerous areas protesters and more now
the device looks kind of like a battery
case but it uses the SIM card slot to
wire straight into the iPhones internals
and then track the radios it would
signal the user with an audible alarm or
a message on the built-in screen if a
radio is turned on when it shouldn't be
now by doing this a journalist could
still document the action on their phone
through the camera or through audio but
they wouldn't have to have their radio
on which would thereby give away their
location yeah let's just keep the
locations secret now while the idea has
been tested by snowden and hwang they
have not built a prototype yet they do
want to get this idea on the ground
running within the next year and the
parts are very common in china now
funding may be made through the freedom
of the press foundation though nothing
is set in stone yet with regards to
manufacturing and supply their entire
research paper can be read in the link
in the show notes under Section 1201 of
the dish
Millennium Copyright Act in the US which
was created in 1998 yeah it's a little
old it states quote no person shall
circumvent a technological measure that
effectively controls access to a work
protected under this title
now these technological protection
measures or tpms include D scrambling a
scrambled work decrypting encrypted work
as well as avoiding bypassing removing
deactivating or impairing the
technological measure without authority
of the copyright owner now according to
an e FF lawsuit filed against the US
this works against security researchers
free speech inability to get their work
done because it's basically restricting
reverse engineering technology it's not
uncommon for a security researcher to
reverse-engineer code used in popular
technology to find any kind of security
holes which by and far is really good
for citizens only to be held under fire
by the company with the threat of
lawsuits the e FF hopes to change this
by giving security researchers the
ability to work on technological devices
without the threat of lawsuits over
their heads over the weekend about
20,000 emails were leaked to WikiLeaks
from internal DNC communications this
happens just says the DNC which is short
for the Democratic National Committee is
holding their 2016 convention in
Philadelphia from July 25th through 28th
now within these emails are ones from a
consultant named Alexandra chalupa who
saw warnings via her get this private
Yahoo email accounts stating that her
account was likely targeted by
state-sponsored actors chalupa was
working on opposition research against
the Trump campaign chairman Paul
Manafort at the time chalupa emails were
the first discovered to pertain to
private email accounts and devices and
after an investigation of the DNC's
network by security firm CrowdStrike the
DNC believes it to be the work of
Russian state-sponsored hackers Russian
involvement is unconfirmed at this time
