starts with a great domain domain com
there are plenty of apps and abilities
on your iPhone that apple doesn't want
you to be able to do and AT&amp;amp;T makes you
pay a buttload of cash to be able to do
anything so here are my top apps that
you should have that aren't on the Apple
App Store my first be my 3g when you're
on 3g you can't really make skype calls
without paying and there's no facetime
whatsoever and there's no downloads / 20
megabytes which is kind of a pain if
you're big into podcasts like I am so we
have my 3g which makes your phone think
that it's on Wi-Fi so you can access all
sorts of things I've tried this out it
comes with a short trial but it does
cost four dollars after the trials over
and I was able to download some podcasts
/ 20 megabytes I was able to call Darren
on skype and the only thing I haven't
tried is the facetime but I don't have
any friends that have iphone 4 so we'll
wait we'll wait and see how that one
goes my second choice is my Y
four-point-oh see what happens when you
don't have Wi-Fi for your laptop and
you're out and about well usually you
end up tethering to your phone or
something like that my wife or point oh
let's your phone turn into a Wi-Fi
hotspot and share the 3g connections as
a wireless connection to your pc and
this is really really handy if you have
an ipad and you don't want to pay the
hefty charges to AT&amp;amp;T that costs like
monthly for 3g it's really really
expensive so if you want this it works
with jailbroken iPhones and iOS four but
keep in mind your data plan you really
don't want to go crazy if you aren't on
your unlimited plan AT&amp;amp;T does charge $45
per month for tethering and this one is
one-time charge of 1999 honestly I'm
sold I'm going to get it even though its
twenty dollars for the
app it's perfect and great for tethering
to any device cool my third choice is VM
see if you need to record what's going
on in your iPhone and you don't want the
bad lighting in the hand movement when
you're trying to record onto your camera
use VNC server with VNC server you can
view your iPhone on your computer just
like a normal VNC which is great it's a
little bit tricky the mouse pointer can
be a little bit slow in the videos a bit
delayed but it does give you access to
everything on your phone right from your
computer even some of the physical
buttons and BMC is free my fourth choice
is cylay apple offers this program
called mobile me and it's for sinking
security you can sink like calendars and
contacts and stuff like that but it
costs like a hundred dollars per month
or per year or something like that it's
crazy expensive and honestly I you
couldn't afford it so I just I just went
you know what yeah I'm gonna pass on it
and maybe have to buy my own iphone
again if mine gets stolen yeah that
sucks so luckily there's a new app
that's called cylay and it offers
protection kind of like prey which i
reviewed for your laptop it's basically
this all-in-one security suite if your
phone gets lost or stolen you can set
off this alarm send a text you can lock
it keep it from turning off you can even
take a photo from the iphone camera
front or back and it uses the gps to
track it and you can even erase all the
data remotely and send the data over to
your gmail account oh cool cylay comes
with a free trial so i'm trying it out
right now and it is 1999 per year which
is I gotta say a lot better than a
hundred dollars for mobileme yeah my
fifth choice is sbsettings it's just
plain useful it's a built-in app that
gives you instant access to services
like GPS Wi-Fi airplane mode all sorts
of different things you can even kill
background processes and choose your own
specific icons to add it's one of those
stupid simple things that should have
been on there already in well luckily we
have sv set
to add it to it to your iPhone and
luckily it's free my last one is side
delete if you're tired of having a whole
bunch of different packages from the
cydia app store that's the jailbroken
app store you can uninstall oh those
applications with this application hmm
that's kind of meta isn't it it works
just like Apple apps you can hold your
finger on a nap until it shakes and then
you press the X that appears to delete
the app and luckily seidel e is free so
what are your favorite jailbroken apps
my personal favorites are the top six
seven that I have right here and I
there's still a ton that I haven't even
checked out yet and I'm super excited
now that my phone is jailbroken it's
gonna be awesome email me over at
feedback at hak5 org with your choices
and let me know and we'll be right back
after a brief word with our sponsor as
many of you know I do a lot of IT
support for a company back east and
while I would love to provide in-person
support for all of my clients really
just the time and the cost of travel
make it absolutely not feasible that
said go to assist Express has become an
indispensable tool for me especially
using it exclusively over the last six
months to support my clients and I've
gotta say well having used a lot of
different remote support solutions over
the last ten years of being a systems
administrator nothing has been easier
than this but figured why did I show you
a few of my favorite features and first
of all getting started is the easiest
it's simple as one click and you can
create a new support session and either
instantly email a link to your client
where they just click through follow the
instructions and connect to you or you
can just copy the support URL right into
either an instant message or if you're
already on the phone with them send them
over to fastest support com give them a
nine-digit key and you know instantly
you can see their screen and control
their keyboard you can control their
mouse what's also really nice about it
is whether it's updating a printer
driver you're even installing a
full-fledged office suite the file
transfer function makes it super simple
to just go ahead and get that pile over
to them which I have to think about oh
if I put it on this ftp or if I drop it
in this Web dab none of that also what's
really cool and I love this is the
ability to read
with their computer or reboot into safe
mode which is great for removing a lot
of bloatware without losing your
connection they stay right there on you
and as soon as their computer comes back
up instantly connects back to you you
don't even have to think about firewalls
or port forwarding or them downloading
anything it just works and that's why I
love us so much and I encourage you guys
to try it out it's fast it's secure and
you can get yourself a 30-day free trial
if you go to go to assist calm / act 5
and for the special offer you do have to
use that special URL go to assist calm /
hak5 so you guys know I love Android
programming but I really want to get
more people in Android programming and I
thought the perfect way to do this is to
reduce Android scripting it's Android
programming without having to set up
your whole SDK and by our Clips SDK
environment it's really simple to get
started all you need is a free account
over at the website right here the
Android scripting website and the app
the free app from the android
marketplace and the free app from the
android market place is called I program
so right there and once you have your I
program apps sync to your scripting
account you can go ahead and start
scripting so I thought I would take a
look at the Android scripting versus the
Eclipse SDK bur the Eclipse XDK the same
code you know just to show you here's
the script here's the code this is
really what you're getting and it's
really powerful I mean we we have the
Wi-Fi scanner tool which will get to and
you know it's pretty cool so let's take
a look at the hello world code let's get
started at a hello world so for basic
hello world I just pulled the examples
straight off of their site and it's
pretty simple i mean we're looking at
the code right here it's bar scroll
equals scrollview new object and all it
is is just say hey tie off the
scrollview to this object scroll or the
bar scroll and generate a new one for me
to tie it off and that's new object
doing the same thing with a text view
and then they're sending the text hello
world just as you would with the /n
which returns the line so the next thing
you add or can concatenate to the string
of tetas
contained inside of text view it'll be
on the next line or displayed on the
next line then they're just setting the
scroll view is the main view just to say
hey this is your main or your content
view and the scroll view dot add view
text so it's going to add the text view
to the scrollview to make it show hello
world so let's take a look at what that
looks like on the device itself so it's
pretty simple open I program after you
save it on the site and then sync it and
then you have it right there hello world
really straightforward really simple you
know like I said this is for somebody
who really just wants to either get an
android programming for the first time
just play around with it or someone
who's looking to do a quick tool and
they can just do with be a scripting and
it's pretty simple JavaScript or
JavaScript language not so much
JavaScript then let's take a look at the
same code done in Eclipse let's first
start out by looking at the XML layout
they're defining a linear layout instead
of a scroll layout it's with this month
with this little content it's irrelevant
then all they're doing is just put in
the standard parameter so that it just
fills the parent and then they're adding
right here they're adding the text view
instead of manually doing it it's just
because it's nested because the XML just
adding the Android text view and setting
the string to hello and this is actually
going to show up once you head over the
Java inside the main content you by
doing set content you really simple but
again you know this is done in the
Eclipse version or the standard Java
code as opposed to the JavaScript
scripting language that's cool I mean
age it's really simple I mean it looks
the same for except for the fact that
you know you don't get the APK you can't
really generate an APK you have to use
the i program line VI program tool to
launch your scripts but you know like i
said it's just for starting out let's
look at something a little more
complicated let's look at the Wi-Fi
scanner tool we did a cut a few episodes
ago and let's go ahead and put the Wi-Fi
scanner tool into the scripting language
then looking at the Wi-Fi scanning code
it's pretty simple i mean it's similar
to the hello world except for we're
using the Wi-Fi objects
so go ahead and tie off it goes ahead
and ties off same scrollview same text
to you you know because we're just going
to post the same data there and then it
goes ahead and does a wife I'm are you
know Wi-Fi new object so it's just
creating a new Wi-Fi object and then
what it's doing is is Wi-Fi enabled so
that we can check to see if the Wi-Fi is
enabled so that we're not pulling and
caught crash in the phone if the Wi-Fi
is not enabled so again it just creates
the same you know just sets up the
scrollview in the same way it did for
hello world by setting it as the main
view and then adding the textview to it
then what would you is the textview set
text again using the slash in to repeat
on the next line first and Wi-Fi to
label it if the Wi-Fi is enabled it's
just a simple if statement if en which
is stands for enabled Wi-Fi dot start
scan it's going to start sweeping the
area then it's going to store the
results and then for it's a for each
loop so for each item in the loop it's
going to return each SSID and resulting
a level and just append them one after
the other straight to the text view
that's already added to the main view
really really simple stuff and that's
what you get when you run this script
after you save and sync up again right
there really straightforward really
simple it looks identical to the
application that we did a little ways
back for the Wi-Fi scanner and again i'm
setting up you know just adding a
textview doing a Wi-Fi manager checking
to see if it's enabled if it's enabled
grabbing the service except for the fact
that in the eclipse java version of this
it's a little more complicated because
you have to register for a receiver and
that's kind of a it's basically a
protocol that says hey notify me when
this service gets gets announced because
there's a background process that
basically says hey if you're doing all
of this have you doing this you know
notify me and it's just like a pub sub
publish publish-subscribe model so
you're basically saying
r8 android apps subscribe to this note
of type of notification and the type of
notification we did was scan results
available so that means the Wi-Fi
scanned new results available so when
the new results are available just call
populate method when it calls populate
that's when it basically pulls apart
their request and the scan results and
you know ties out the SSID and I do a
little bit more here but you can easily
just do the SSID and the level or the
frequency and then it just appends to
the existing view and then starts the
scan all over again against things you
could all really easily accomplished
inside of the scripting tool but
scripting tools got a lot easier all
you're doing is new object and you don't
have to you know subscribe to the new
route the the new results feed it's a
lot simpler to get started both source
codes are available up on the show notes
weren't opposed both of them if you have
so many questions email me Jason at hak5
org I'd love to hear your feedback on
the android stuff or if I should do more

definitely so next question we are gonna
do okay so Alexander says he just
watched the latest video with streaming
to android phones and lately been
interested in trying to figure out how
to do some real time transcoding to
downsize videos on the fly and play them
back on my android phone um I actually a
review I've reviewed an app called
doubletwist which is a web and mobile
application which basically replaces
itunes but what you can do it hate
itunes so much we all hate yeah
especially android people you know like
that yeah it's all yeah the reason we
got an android so if you go check out
appjudgment doubletwist i think it's a
dream com or something yeah um so what
it is is basically it replaces itunes
