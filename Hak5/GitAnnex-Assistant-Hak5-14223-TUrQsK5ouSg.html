by goto assist this week I decided to
check out an alternative to Dropbox this
is kind of cool it's called get annex
assistant it started as a Kickstarter
last year and it raised well over there
funds on the first day it's kind of
exciting now this is a good alternative
again to a company owned file sharing
service similar to Dropbox get annex
assistant will let you synchronize a
folder on to each device of your
choosing whether the contents are on a
folder on the same location a USB a
different computer or where have you now
I did mention that this was based on git
it's also based on get annex if you go
to their website they basically say get
annex allows managing files with git
without checking the file contents in to
get while that may seem paradoxical it
is useful when dealing with files larger
than get it can which get cannot
currently easily handle whether due to
limitations a memory time or disk space
so basically this is telling you cool I
can actually upload things like you know
my mp3 files or or my hack five episodes
or what-have-you now for me to install
this first I had to get the precise PPA
version for Ubuntu everything is on
their website so they make it pretty
simple
you go to install and you choose the
file version that you need now first off
I did try just getting doing apt-get
install git annex but if you click into
a boon to you you're only gonna get get
enix with that one
now what I wanted to do was get the web
app for the assistant this is what I
really want to check out for this
segment today so I had to use sudo
apt-get repository get the PPA update
and then install git annex now when I
did that it actually gave me the web app
and a very easy way to get to it yet
annex
this is going to automatically open up
the web app
so the first thing you need to do is
create your very first repository the
default is in slash and annex are on the
desktop in that desktop directory then
from there you can start creating
folders and other places such as a USB
Drive another place on your computer
another computer or up in the cloud if
you want to I created a second one on my
computer in the home directory so now
I'm gonna go ahead and let you see how
exactly I did that so on here you can
see that I have one which is Shannon
shared files and I can also choose to
add another repository configure and
also see down here where I can restart
the entire daemon whenever you restart
it this is basically going to let you
restart the syncing it's going to pick
up any kind of syncing capabilities that
are going on in the background any files
that are currently being uploaded would
now be seen so I'm gonna go ahead and
restart the daemon
okay so now we see I have both here
Shannon shared files that is my home
folder and I also have Shannon Ubuntu PC
which is the desktop slash annex I
actually have a physical folder right
here on my awesome sailormoon wallpaper
desktop and in here I have one file if I
close that I'm gonna go into the home
folder
you
the shared folder which is my second
repository I also have 1412 - snubs so
both of these files are the exact same
thing I was just able to drag and drop
into my shared folder and that
automatically synced on to you the annex
folder on my desktop now if you wanted
to do the same thing you would go to add
another repository so this gives you the
option and I'll zoom in right here this
is going to give you the option to add a
repository from a removable flash drive
which will actually backup every time
that you plug the flash drive into your
computer you can share it with other
other devices including Android devices
which is really cool you can share with
a friend on another computer a local
computer on the same on the same network
that you're using or add a completely
different repository it also gives you
the option to use box rsync
s3 or remote server glacier and internet
archive now of course I haven't gotten
into those so much but what I will do is
go ahead and add another repository onto
my current computer my little laptop
that kind of works sometimes and kind of
doesn't so I'm gonna add another
repository down here and this is what
you'll see it's going to say add another
local repository where do you want to
add this you can choose your folder so
for me I have documents shared folder a
bunch of other ones in there so I'll do
another shared get older
make repository and it's going to ask
you if you want to combine it with your
existing one or if you want to combine
the repositories or have the files
placed in two separate repositories and
not actually sync with each other
obviously I want them to sync with each
other so I'm going to combine them
you can name it shared tooth a
description files yeh repository group
so this gives you a group that you can
put them into since you could make
several and several repositories this
will give you some kind of organization
to all those different ones so when you
get into it you don't get completely
screwed up on where all those different
folders and directories are so this is
client a repository on my computer
synching is enabled and you save changes
so now I have all three here syncing is
enabled in each one
I can go to settings and edit if I need
to I can disable them and remove them
I can also restart my daemon now I'm
gonna open up my home folder
and go ahead and open up that new folder
that I just created
shared get so I want to share with
myself I'm gonna say 14 13 some really
old show notes so right now that's just
right here 14 13 if I go back
it's currently not in there quite yet so
go ahead and restart and obviously this
will be a little bit faster in the
background if you just left it running
in the background eventually it will
sync all of your documents but since I'm
doing this for hack 5 I want it to go a
little bit faster so I go ahead and sync
and I'm going to refresh
so now I have 14 12 and 14 13 and all of
my different folders and these both
should also be shared with my annex
folder and it is so there's my new file
so now you know how to use get annex
assistant which is a very easy to use
web app with get and get annex as the
background on them so it's very simple I
really liked it and it's also a very
great alternative in case you don't want
the entire government seeing everything
that you're doing on the Internet's you
can just use your own repositories now

you like about this segment and tell me
what other options you use do you use
own cloud for example that's another one

year it seems like everyone is trying to
spend some time away from the office for
their vacations or just enjoying the
warm weather or hacking across America

you work in IT if you're a net
administrator or cysts op if you will it
