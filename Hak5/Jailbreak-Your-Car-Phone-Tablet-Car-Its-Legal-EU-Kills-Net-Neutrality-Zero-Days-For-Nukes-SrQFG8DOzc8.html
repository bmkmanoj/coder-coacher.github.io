sells out the internet in Europe the
Senate sells out the American people
online Facebook's got your back if a
nation states hacking you and hey the
librarian in Congress beat back the DMCA
a tiny bit I'll explain in just a second
welcome to throat wire greetings I'm
Patrick Norton this is threat wine for
October 28th 2015 your summary of the
threats to our security privacy and
Internet freedom I got to drop a big
thank you out to everybody that supports
the show on patreon calm / threat wire
we are more than halfway to our next
goal of two episodes per week and if you
want more Darren's face right up here
instead of mind please support us on
patreon calm / threat wire I thought we
start this week's episode on a mostly
cheerful niche I got this tweet from
cory doctorow a full-on activist for
Internet freedom and a really nice guy
quote the librarian of Congress grants
limited drm breaking rights for cars
games phones tablets and remixers as in
the librarian of Congress says you
should be able to repair your car put
any operating system you want on your
phone or tablet break drm to fair use
remix content from DVDs DVDs DVDs or
blu-rays and yes thanks to section 1201
of the digital millennium copyright act
in case you didn't know every three
years librarian of Congress gets to pass
ruling on what things justify breaking
the digital rights management put on
stuff not to make the stuff to break the
stuff though as mr. doctor who puts it
quote the Copyright Office believes at
section 1201 of the DMCA prohibits it
from allowing the development of
jailbreaking tools so all they're
granting us permission to use random
anonymously produced tools that you find
somewhere on the dark net or widdle
yourself at your own keyboard keep that
in mind as you read the coverage of the
Copyright Office is ruling they've given
you permission to do the stuff but not
permission to get a tool that makes that
possible and then Corey says it gets
worse example your mechanic does not
break in your car only you are allowed
to do so example you only jailbreak
games that require a server to play them
and only pc games no consoles and that
doesn't even begin to hint at the
extraordinarily ridiculous process of
petitioning for exemptions what
pretty much comes down to big money
corporations firing up the attack
lawyers try to make sure you can't say
fix the stuff you own quick not on the
Hat i fix it here it's interesting
there's a lengthy article on boingboing
you really should read it because it's a
lot more complicated than you think and
it should be a lot simpler as you
probably mention that the DMCA thing is
pretty much the good news this week
because if you're over in the EU well
they kind of voted against net
neutrality excuse me they voted for
specialized services on the internet or
as barbara van Shrike the professor of
lawn director of Stanford Law School
Center for Internet and Society told Ars
Technica UK quote if established
companies can pay so that their content
loads faster or does not count against
users monthly bandwidth caps than those
who can't pay don't have a chance to
compete boy I hope I got her name right
because he is awesomely smart in theory
of the bill is supposed to end roaming
charges in the EU which sounds good
except well the German pirate party mep
julia rey de told ARs surcharges will
only be suspended up to a fair-use limit
beyond which they still apply and
continue to hinder the breaking down of
barriers within Europe so if you said a
little net neutrality for a cheaper
phone rate well I'm in Switzerland ya
got screwed way to go EU lawmakers yeah
you politicians kind of suck as much as
US senators who pass sisa aka the
cybersecurity information sharing act
because hey why wouldn't you pass a bill
to improve cybersecurity that's opposed
by an astonishing list of US tech
companies like Google Microsoft Facebook
Apple reddit Twitter the computer
communications industry association
dozens of civil liberty groups there are
literally dozens perhaps even hundreds
of the biggest names in technology and
protecting your rights into technology
wired says I love this even the
Department of Homeland Security Kirby's
pissed about this way by the way I just
as Kirby Kirby's angry in any case wired
says even the Department of Homeland
Security itself warned in a July letter
that the bill could flood the agency
with information of dubious value at the
same time it sweeps away privacy
protections Homeland Security is like Oh
too much data and it's there's no
privacy oh wait cease is going to allow
companies to
share data the department homeland
security who can then well share with
other government agencies yeah and you
know what the OPM showed us just how
good the US government isn't protecting
your personal data right maybe the
Senate and House won't be able to
resolve their CC bills and the whole
rotting mess will go down in
congressional flames a few brief notes
before I go the registers John laid
reports users of whatsapp need to be
aware the popular messaging service
collects phone numbers call duration and
other information according to new
research that's a quote by the way and
hey pen testers Scota aka supervisory
control and data acquisition box zero
days and the tools the vector ax men are
available for sale you know what just go
read Thomas Fox Brewster's story once
some nuclear power plant zero-day
vulnerabilities yours for just eight
thousand well eight thousand and the
three grand for the tool they run on
actually know somebody could probably
use the stuff at work he tests security
for his company they they do things over
there to secure the things it's a good
thing I hope by the way the register
piece good read links the show notes
wait did I say there was no other good
news I got to give a shout out to
Facebook this might be a first in my
life did you know that facebook quote
will notify you if we believe your
account has been targeted or compromised
by an attacker suspected of working on
behalf of a nation-state facebook ads we
do this because these types of attacks
tend to be more advanced and dangerous
than others and we strongly encourage
affected people to take the actions
necessary to secure all of their online
accounts think about it well my beloved
Senator Dianne Feinstein is figuring out
better ways to turn the entire internet
over to three-letter agencies for
storage and scanning Facebook is trying
to protect everybody that got nuked in
the OPM attacks from China way did it go
man way to go did you find something new
and useful in this show we would love to
bring your threat wire three times a
week 52 weeks a year rotating Darren
kitchen Shannon Morse and myself and we
want to do it completely independent and
ad free if you want to help make that
happen check out patreon common sense a
picture of your favorite animal not just
the cute ones I say send in the picture
of the iguanas and the angry gila
monsters we'll put it right here hey you
