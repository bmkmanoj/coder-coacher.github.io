maker revolution at Maker Faire 2013
this segment is brought to you by Full
Sail University with hack 5 I'm Shannon
Morse coming to you from Maker Faire
2013 and I have leave felsenstein Haile
how are you alright fine thanks now you
just gave a talk all about the Oh how do
you even describe it you have to tell me
all about this talk well I'm an old
revolutionary and in fact I got into the
whole area of personal computer
technology as a result of my
participation in a revolution in 1964
and I see of course that I got involved
in the personal computer revolution and
now I see the maker movement and I can
identify it as a revolution
unfortunately most of the people almost
all the people involved won't be able to
do that until afterwards they look back
and say geez we made a revolution why is
that
well the biggest and the most important
effect of a revolution is its aftermath
it has unintended and unexpected
consequences hopefully they're good
consequences so for instance the 1964
Berkeley Free Speech Movement that I was
involved in did not think of itself as a
revolution but it wound up overthrowing
an existing order which was the order of
in loco parentis in which the university
acted as in place of the parent for the
student and it had vast consequences in
terms of the counterculture it unleashed
an awful lot of forces and a lot of
people who decided forget about this
university thing I'm going to the Haight
Ashbury and try to build a community
there that I can live in now so you must
be from the Bay Area can you give me a
little bit of history about yourself I
was born in Philadelphia and I left in
1963 at the age of 18 to go to Berkeley
University of California in electrical
engineering I finally graduated in 1972
but that was after a hiatus of four
years I was here in for the 1964 at
Berkeley Free Speech Movement
participated in it tried to implement
some technological solutions to some of
the problems I saw there failed in most
of it but communication structure that
grew within that event and it was like
they both grew at the same time
and I could see non hierarchical
communication handled by telephone
mostly and then also higher you could
call it hierarchical but anyway it's a
mimeograph try help run the memmio
machines and I could see people offering
resources and placing requests for
resources I want I need this somebody
else has that we need that somebody
offered haircuts for those who needed it
and that all worked the in the aftermath
when we won in one big the university
basically caved and adopted our approach
which was that the US Constitution
governs speech on campus nothing else
and the analysts at that point said you
know what happened was that a group of
like 20,000 strangers who was the
student body suddenly had their barriers
lowered for communication with each
other and they could communicate with
each other where there's previously they
would have no basis for it and that
communication I could see he was right
had allowed this group of strangers to
become a community for at least the
duration of that struggle and community
is a very very attractive thing I wanted
life to be like that all the time so I
asked the question of what technologies
would be necessary and useful in
furthering that goal that led me through
the underground press that led me
through an investigation of media a
non-hierarchical media and I ran into
some other people who are making the
same explorations and had come up with a
computer in 1970 I just realized that
computer a network of computers would
get me what I wanted but then I said
where are you going to get a computer
which led me into
personal computers so that by 1974 I had
been involved with a the first social
media that computer that those other
peoples had rounded up a mainframe I was
the engineer and I tried to make that
work without adequate knowledge and we
put terminals in public the community
memory system as a bulletin board and
fortunately we did not restrict its
categories they were open categories so
the usage exploded it was tremendous
license this is it this is this is what
I saw back in 1964 but we need better
hardware so my might that's what I do is
hardware so I put together a
specification for a computer terminal
that would attract a computer Club
around itself grow a computer Club
around itself this was assisted by my
being introduced to the ideas of Ivan
Illich IL li CH philosopher who talked
about tools for conviviality that was
his book just the year before so that
meant that I basically designed a
personal computer published the
specification in 1974 in 1975 the Altair
was announced which was sold as a mini
computer and it sure was mini and it was
just barely a computer but what I could
do is design the rest of the circuitry
for a terminal put it on the board and
plug it in which created a new animal
that's it's a a computer which had its
terminal built in and shared memory with
its main memory so access to the
terminal was as fast as access to the
memory that allowed computer games and
it also reduced the price radically of
the system so we were off and running
now that must have been inspiring the
the whole fact that you were a part of
that revolution when so many people were
getting involved in computers well you
know I didn't really feel odd at the
time but but I did know something big
was going on and I could participate I
mean I knew there was a phrase is
something about that Buckminster Fuller
I'll start
yep Buckminster Fuller was interviewed I
think in 1975 or before and he was asked
what the year of 2000 would look like
and he said we don't need to think that
far ahead even all the important
decisions will be made by 1985 yes and
that sort of struck me and it's oh we
have a responsibility here and I tried
to fulfill my end of that so it's not
like I went around completely in the
dark no I knew something was going on it
was a whole lot of work and I loved
doing work especially that kind of work
and everybody sort of took a slightly
different approach to it but moved in
the same direction and you know I can't
remember being struck dumb by awe but
nonetheless that first view of the
exhibit floor at the West Coast computer
fair in 1977 came close
I believe my dad went to that before I
was even born
I agree at home about 1985 that's the
year I was born so it was a good year so
tell me a little bit about the
relationship that you're starting to see
between the computers of the early the
60s and 70s and now with the maker
movement
well the maker movement is a kind of
generalization and expansion of the
whole idea it all stemmed from I think
mostly Buckminster Fuller but through
the whole earth catalogue which marketed
the concept of hands-on technology why
that was important and that's not what
we were being told by all of our
institutions we were being told our
wiser heads than yours and maybe you can
become one of those heads and tell us
what to do they'll tell us what to do
the the motivation as far as I could
tell behind the personal computer
revolution was just that we had to get
our hands on this technology and
tainment and
in taming it its taming us in effect we
have to achieve a symbiosis with it and
very few people were actually saying
anything like that
there were excuses like I want to use it
to balance my checkbook and keep recipes
for the little woman yeah but doesn't we
all knew that was a lie
the maker fair the maker movement not
just the fair that's just an event the
maker movement is that same tool as toy
kind of methodology expanded to all
forms of technologies there isn't
anything that's that's off-limits here
and the level of participation and
interest is really inspiring to me I
know you look at this and they say ah
we've had an effect because people
expect to do this they expect
open-source designs they expect to be
able to learn how to do it you can't
just say well that's you know for you
know better people than you to know and
that's it don't come bother me little
bit no no this is open technology that's
getting more open and these are people
who weren't technologists becoming
technologists these are people becoming
citizen technologists that is to say not
as their primary role and not as their
economic role but as a role in which
they get to again mix play with work mix
tools with toys confused tools and toys
and to do it all in a an environment in
which it's it's fun it's legitimate to
have fun
I completely agree I don't know about
you but whenever I come to Maker Faire I
see things that maybe I don't quite
understand how they work and it just
gets me so excited because you you see
how excited the people are the inventors
and it just makes you wonder like what
else can I do with this that's the point
what can I do with it not just these
people right I completely agree now
where do you see the maker movement
going
from here I see that it will have a
significant impact I mean it's a
revolution in its own right and the
impact will have to be judged in
retrospect but I think that's going to
be in reestablishing craft production in
localizing economics to a large extent
as at least this production Gris grows
in local communities and the the money
goes with that it's not all the money
there's still going to be a lot of
infrastructural stuff that's produced
overseas and designed outside of our
communities but I think that
increasingly to an increasing extent not
totally our products will begin to be
defined more locally to us not simply in
the US but in our local communities and
our local regions let's say now maybe
stretching it a little bit but that's
fine you asked for it and the the fund
raising the capital acquisition the
capital accumulation for that gets
distributed we are already seeing this
with Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and the
other crowdfunding events
I think that's exceedingly important
because yes you do have to follow the
money but the money is now following you
in that sense I will probably attempt to
participate in that myself I've got a
product that I'm developing for it's a
stem product for education and I don't
have any funding
I'm just investing my time in the design
but when it comes time to start selling
it we've got the media and we've got the
means of raising money it's not like I
snap my finger and get all the money I
want but I can get a shot at it oh darn
if only we could right right I think a
lot of people what we're going to see
because crowdfunding is now kind of
recognized with this whatever they call
the JOBS Act I don't know why that's it
but
the there's going to be a certain amount
of scam and so forth there always is
when there's something developing well
do you have any more insight that I can
share with my audience about the maker
revolution well I would say learn as
much as you can I'm looking at a sign
saying learn to solder yet okay that's
right there and there is going to be
more coming along I mean it's you
haven't missed it it's still on the
rising edge I think it's still being
born right now well yes and then
everybody involved everybody who wants
to can be involved it's it it there's an
awful lot of things that are of less
less usefulness interest in fun well
what do you say let's go check out the
expo hall and find out what cool stuff
we can find Leah was wonderful to speak
to you and let our audience know where
they can find more information about you
we'll have a website Lee felsenstein
dot-com and they have to know how to
spell my name to be at that
FAL sen st ein i'm that's the best place
and there's a lot of stuff there i'm
gonna try to keep putting more maybe
that hopefully the recording of this
talk that just gave and the slides for
it so that's the best shot great thank
