go further Brock 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 you know i'm always
looking for that next awesome little
tiny thing just the tiny things right
sometimes it's just the little things
are going to make all the difference and
i know i am like everybody else who
always picks up with my right hand the
left ear bud or tries to plug in the USB
the wrong way well it turns out with
this we now can't plug the USB in the
wrong way here's a traditional USB and
if i try to plug it in over here like
this it's just not going to go and you
always do this you always go like uh and
then sometimes you do this and you're
like wait and spend a while and then
finally are like alright great well this
is an adapter that you can just plug in
line with any of you USB cables and it
doesn't matter you can play it in that
way spinning around plug it in the other
way makes no difference this is the
actual part as you can see it would fit
any of the packaging if you were to put
this on your own PCB and inside what you
have is basically a very thin PCB with
all four i'm sure they'll reverse on the
other side so it all works out in the
end and I'm here actually with the
patent holder Joe how are you Joe oh
yeah no nice thank you thank you very
much and so uh what inspired you to do
this is just the frustration of the
plugging in the wrong way it is you know
after like a maybe 16 years of a
frustration I say finally maybe also try
to go to the market buy something and so
what has it been your you know what has
been your difficulty and kind of
bringing this from your brainchild to
market oh I feel like a you know I
started you know keeping away to my
friends you know everybody saying that's
that's a great so let's say maybe we
should have machi this thing you know so
you know that's some opportunity there
and so what does this mean though for
like certification because I don't
understand that you know there is a the
USB Alliance and whatnot how does this
how does this kind of mess with that the
u.s. pi/4 they have spec this is
designed by engineer not by real user so
you know it's a it's time to change and
we still like to get the USB I've 222 m
the new spec and hopefully are you know
more you more user can be benefited for
using the flipper and so is this for USB
to USB 3 sure yes USB 2 in the USB 3 and
so where can I get this now is this
something that has to be licensed by
other developers to be put into
technology or can I just go and get the
replace on my cables today yes yes West
will be available you know won't walmart
and also the purpose of getting popular
in Japan right now the u.s. somehow just
we're starting this year right you heard
it look out for the reversible USB
flipper for all things CES related head
over to revision 3.com I'm here at the
Ford booth at CES 2013 with Ed how you
doing a Darren housing on and we're
checking out the TDK what is it TDK I'm
just do an SDK we're ready to DK TDK is
a technology development kit that
developers can get for you know AppLink
enabling their apps instead of you know
buying a vehicle or if they already have
one they can use an existing one so this
is a TDK you basically have all the same
interfaces as you would a normal vehicle
you got the screen you got a center
stack with all the different buttons
pretty seibon scored back as well as
some car simulation toggles so you can
turn the car off open doors set it to go
forward and reverse have it parked or
not park so what kind of partners have
you guys teamed up with to enable apps
to come to port right so I mean
everybody knows you know a lot of the
music streaming apps like pandora radio
slacker and PR we also did some
navigation base f scout from TeleNav we
have our own sink destinations
be at that I'm a whole slew of more
coming out you know every every few
months awesome working our hackers find
a developer network to start coding up
some awesome stuff they're pretty easy
just like everything else developer for
calm there we go all right and with all
of that I want to thank once again Ford
for powering our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
