go further Brack 5 I'm Darrin kitchen
here at CES 2013 and I had the pleasure
of being here with the environment how
are you Dave I'm doing great I ran into
you guys Fulton innovation maybe
2008-2009 the whole idea of wireless
charging was still kind of in its
infancy what's changed since then
well we've really taken the concept of
people thinking wireless power is
impossible to driving it to actually the
controller chips the infrastructure the
the coils and the parts to where anyone
can go buy the parts from digi-key now
and put them in products you just nailed
you just hit the nail on the head d
anyone can go any hobbyist any hacker at
home can go and just buy it off digit
key that's huge how do you get to a
point where like I mean obviously you
guys are like working with the wireless
power consortium there's been several
different technologies how do you get to
that point where your technology gets
implemented in such a way that any
hobbyist can now use this well for us
it's been a tremendous amount of work
because we've had to prove this
technology with automotive companies
with all the major OEMs like Motorola
Samsung HTC Nokia and now they now
they've implemented using one of our
partners called Texas Instruments so
getting it into a chipset that that they
can just sell that anyone can buy that's
been the process and it's been a long
process getting it proven getting it
implemented and in solving all the
problems so that it the typical
hobbyists can actually implement it that
is a great line to say be able to say
one of our technique you know one of our
partners Texas Instruments so so concur
Congrats on that where has the
technology been improving and and how
far has it come in the last couple of
years
sure so when we first started we had to
prove it as a power supply and everyone
was looking at doing that in a simplest
the most basic way and what we've done
since then is expanding it so that it
has a further range now you can mount it
underneath a table for example I'm
expanding the the tablet size so you can
have a single coil but now char
you know many devices and then the next
range of it is actually going from low
to medium power and being able to switch
between and have multiple low and medium
power devices on one surface and not
worry about what devices go where
because you want that to be seamless I
want that to be seamless and so what
would a medium power device be a laptop
our medium power pretty much goes from
five watts to 120 watts that's awesome
now when you start going up in wattage
to you what what's the challenge there
do you get bigger coils or or does it
have to be closer to each other or
what's the challenge is there no so the
challenge is I mean we're doing a
vehicle where we have over six inches of
spatial freedom and we're able to charge
at kilowatts so the real challenges are
more about safety robustness a laptop
for example when it spins up the drive
the quad core kicks in and the display
lights come on all at the same time
really dramatic power supply changes and
so your control has to be very fast in
order to handle that I have thought
about that because it's saying you know
as opposed to like traditionally wired
power you don't have to really think
about the fact that you know if you can
supply me three amps at 19 volts and I
just asked for it you're gonna give it
to me right so you actually have to have
a controller that changes what the
oscillation of the energy through these
coils or how does that work
so we're actually changing the amount of
power that's transferred and at times
the tuning of that you know in order to
make sure that we're we're staying
consistent with what the device needs so
there's a variety of different things we
can change and/or do that and the
control system makes those up on the fly
it determines what are the best levers
to control so you had mentioned safety I
want to know is it been difficult when
it comes to the regulatory stuff I mean
you've got to get you well at FCC and
all of those other things to be able to
bring this to market to be able to have
like a Texas Instrument put together a
package that you know any om can
implement in their products how is that
been so it's actually been pretty fun
because what we've done in the wireless
power consortium well what we've done be
coupled for the wireless power
consortium is we provide transmitters
that can work in automotive so the the
real regulatory issues are what does
automotive want and what are their
regulatory standards and what is the
home want and what is the you know
what is the office want and what are the
all these different Fernan like the
furniture manufacturers so providing a
technology that's versatile enough to be
able to have to meet to have and to meet
all the regulatory requirements and all
those different infrastructure
requirements that's been the fun thing
and if you look across the from the
wireless power consortium booth you'll
see that we've done that in every one of
those spaces so you guys haven't tackled
medical yet and I'm sure that's a lot
more fun so we actually have but
medicals longer right so some of the
things that we've done in medical is
actually making coils that actually go
in your vein so an any intervening
sensor that will actually monitor your
your blood pressure and your blood flow
so I could literally lay down in bed and
dock at night that's pretty much it yes
my mind's blown that's really cool all
right well it has been a true pleasure
and I wish you guys the best so for
anyway for continued coverage of all
things CES be sure to head over to
revision three.com I'm gonna get myself
juiced up here NPR has a great public
radio app that is compatible with Ford
SYNC athlete this means that when you're
in your car and you're on the go and you
don't want to touch your phone you don't
have to you have all your favorite
playlists all your favorite NPR shows
right on your phone ready for voice
commands hourly news I'm Louis Cavalli
House Republican leaders are challenging
though if you want to listen to your
favorite shows like Morning Edition and
all things considered you just have them
right there in your new Ford car thank
you again to Ford for sponsoring this
