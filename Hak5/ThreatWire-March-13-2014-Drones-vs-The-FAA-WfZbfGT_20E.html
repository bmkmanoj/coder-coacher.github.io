books hello and welcome to threat wire
my name is darren kitchen to sue summary
of what's threatening security privacy
internet freedom and today I'm going to
be droning on about drones the TLDR is
that a lot of people are freaked out by
them and all not a whole lot is gonna
stop the fact that they're coming a trap
ii AKA Rafael Parker you may have seen
him in the news he is a Swiss RC
enthusiast may know him from his amazing
videos with the team blacksheep he's
traveled the world doing some really
amazing stunts videography stuff and
it's really cool really neat attracted
the attention of the FAA here's ago the
FAA find him $10,000 flying over the
University of Virginia and this was
because money for he was actually
commissioned by the University of
Virginia to do some aerial photography
it's recently actually does the over the
weekend a judge from the NTSB or the
National Transportation Safety Board
ruled that commercial drone use is in
Eagle the FAA saying otherwise ever
since seven the judge actually is quoted
saying time of respondents model
aircraft operation no enforceable FAA
rule or far regulation application
little aircraft or for classifying the
model as a UAS me and is a as we
understand does these things called the
FA are the Federal Aviation Regulations
right and they don't actually have a way
for modelers to classify their aircraft
as a UAS which is an unmanned Gill
system oh
would actually invalidate the FAA's 2007
ban on commercial drone use and actually
foster such innovations as we've seen
recently with say or mostly egg that's
with Amazon and their prime dribble
delivery drones or later the FAA
appealed the decision so it's going to
stay for the moment and I guess we'll be
following this one covered a whole bunch
of stuff and I figure that we she had
actually put into some sort of context
seeing that I'm an enthusiast of this
kind of thing and it's very relevant
when we talk about privacy it's a little
bit round when we actually talk about
model aircraft times well actually how
do me of that MIT or a club if you will
and it actually dates back to nineteen
twenty-three that was actually the date
of the first model airshow perspective
the FAA who no air safe or whatever
actually was created by Congress in 1958
and I was following a mid-air collision
between to your Airlines and canyon dick
a good guide not very cool gated that
agency was created with the mandate to
your traffic never the formation of the
FAA did they ever addressed model air
not until nineteen one in fact at the
FAA Iser e advisory AC and any 157 I may
yeah UAV pilot myself and actually keep
this in my wallet and basically what
this guy states is you know recognizing
the voluntary guidelines set forth by
the modeling clubs that basically say
you know stay a safe distance with
uplift areas that they recommend let's
see not operating model aircraft in the
presence of spectators until we've
designated the flight as air worthy and
recommending not flying higher than 400
feet I guess the the common wisdom there
is that the minimum flight level of a
small plane in an unpopulated area would
be like 500 feet and a commercial one
would be a thousand so there's still a
whole ton of buff
that is of course not during approach
and descent and take off and whatnot in
fact that it's actually mentioned here
when flying aircraft within three miles
of an aircraft notify the airport
operator or when an air traffic safety
you know basically stay away from
airport so you're going to be by them
let them know all of these guidelines
nothing in these guidelines did they
actually specify an imam safe distance
or you know what stay away from
sidewalks and trees and other things
that trap he was flying around I'm not
sure if it's because of trapeze previous
videos where he's like flying past you
know flying through the Golden Gate
Bridge or over the Statue of Liberty but
whether or not it seems like he's gonna
be Yuri the FA seems to be trying to
make an example out of him regardless
hey in a current-gen ends that there are
three types of UAS or unmanned aerial
systems okay glee bro what we're talking
about here are we have groans classify
public drone as ones used by for
instance our military in Iraq alone
there are actually more than 700 these
in use for servants and weapons
deployment Simmons and Border Protection
used them patrol the us-mexican border I
mean a lot of the stuff is you know the
bitter drone b95 you can believe it or
not i think this old bird but I'm still
picking pretty well when it not armed
with missiles which is kind of like a
weird subject not sure how I really feel
about that but regardless let's use
there's also civil youth right and some
examples of that would be agriculture
real estate land surveys firefighting
you've got property in an equipment
inspect you could be like coaching in
other countries this is actually being
practiced as remind you that in the
United States were like decades behind
on on drone stuff traffic monitoring of
course videography I mean Hollywood is
going to do some amazing stuff with it
when they can legally
and a PA actually addresses one of her
third UAS essence our model use and then
they go on to say that you know users
are it is to mind their noise especially
like you don't want like a loud drone
the hospital or churches or something
advised not to fly in the vicinity to
spectators until they know the bear
after they're worthy you know they are
advised to stay below 400 feet all of
these things are all interior grades
right and FA expect that the hobbyist
will respect that kind of stuff well ok
so that I've heard in the way they were
the disc on down is essentially five we
had you know domestically things kind of
changed we had Katrina right really bad
lots of people no good wouldn't it be
great if those Predator drones that
we're using you know in the Middle East
could be I don't know looking for
survivors and doing some actual good
here in the states and so they were
actually weren't able to be used in
Katrina because there was no sort of
mandate to allow that kind of public use
here and so Congress pushed the FAA have
acted in pushing them because they're
supposed to be coming up policy by 2015
that is going to spell out how all of
this can be used but until then we're in
this kind of rocky grey zone and now you
know Swedish people are getting fined
but regardless 2007 the FAA set forth a
policy that would actually allow public
drones in certain uses likes for exam a
predator who's didn't a California
wildfire and fact that at sea thousand
seven from the FAA even addressed model
aircraft as not impact more importantly
though we actually this little provision
where it says that none of them unmanned
aerial systems these drone could used
for commercial purposes without a
certificate airworthiness certificate of
airworthiness and this regard is that
none of them have chewed don't be a way
to go about getting one so if I'm a you
know civilian drone operator right now
and I want to
start a business doing you know aerial
photography or real estate photography
or land surveying or any of that stuff I
have no actual way to go and get that
CoA it actually has been technically
issued like twice and but only for the
Antarctic and it was kind of weird but
let's to sing here about been in this
2007 thing which is what cases at odds
with right now between the FAA and
trapping is that essentially this this
policy from 2007 is just that it is
non-binding it as a policy it is not a
law a law requires notice and a comment
it must be voted on it hooks becomes a
regulation a policy is nothing more than
an agency saying this is what we would
like to enforce well that's good on you
if that's what you would like to enforce
but you can't enforce you yet because
it's not a law okay so what kind of
gotten everything stirred up right now
between FAA and trappy and it seems like
a win or the moment it has been forward
what we're going to see is um fÃ£ is
even on a no faq last month it's
outlining some of these things between
what is a model use and what is a
commercial drone use they are expected
by sep tember 30th of 2015 to put out
more you know standardized rulings
saying this is what can and can't be
done with our airspace and stuff
something that they've actually never
regulated in the sense of unmanned
aircraft remember this is the
organization that was put forth in the
50s to protect civilian air travel you
know people on a big shiny silver thing
hurling through the sky and so it's a
little weird when we start talking about
these you know it's typically pieces of
farming carbon fiber and plastic buzzing
through the skies so we're actually
expected to see a couple of different
rulings for example there's the FAA's
said that there will be you know some
sort of definition for drones under 55
pounds ultimately like a lot of this is
because of public perception if you said
the you know say the word drone to most
people they think oh that's one of the
is big honkin evil-looking things that
flies over the Middle East and bombs the
crap out of people and for the most part
that that's one side of it yes and so
there's absolutely a public perception
thing with that and I feel still feel
like um but there's a sense of unease
when a new technologies learned
something completely foreign people are
scared of it at first that's just that's
typical right and the the first thing
that comes to mind is how is this going
to violate my privacy and I respect
people's privacy to the utmost in fact
when I fly my little quad copters and
stuff around the neighborhood the number
one thing that people asked me is does
that have a camera on it and so it's
it's understood that the public is going
to have this perception because of
military drones because of drones with
cameras and and that is absolutely going
to be a concern but it's just
interesting to see how the fÃ¡Ã¡Ã¡ is
out at odds with this and how this is
going to shake up I mean right now the
FAA is sending cease and desist letters
to would otherwise be doing some really
innovative stuff with drone you know
whether that's in use of videography or
land survey or agriculture or
what-have-you so there's still on the
one hand some really brilliant uses for
some amazing technology and on the other
hand the need to protect people's
privacy and so that's why I bring it up
in the regards of threat wire not as
this is what's violating your privacy
today and the latest software patch you
need to worry about but something that I
care about and I'd love to hear from you
guys what you think so let me know in
the comments right if I say drone what's
the first thing that comes to mind what
do you think the FAA should do in this
case seeing that now they are they
tasked with the with the sense of
protecting America's airspace from
unmanned vehicles what would you do let
me know in the comments and welcome back
it's it's still in beta I'm still trying
to figure out how to do this it's very
much casual at the very moment however
we do in fact have a sponsor this week
so that's kind of weird also let me know
in the comment tell you feel about that
because I don't know either but
