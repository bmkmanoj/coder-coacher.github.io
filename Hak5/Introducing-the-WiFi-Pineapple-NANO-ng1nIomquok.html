routers and access points but it's
neither and it's not a client device a
monitor rating it's all these things and
so much more and it's grown so much
since its humble beginnings from karma
on the farm to the pine ap sweet and an
entire ecosystem software and hardware
we looked at the ways that people were
using the mark-5 and thought what if we
could completely reinvention the entire
Wi-Fi pineapple experience so we did we
said to make the Wi-Fi pineapple goes
with you and integrates with your pen
test workflow we made it smaller nearly
a third the size and higher throughput
with exceptional components all around
we made no compromise on what's inside
and completely reinvented the way it's
used the new modern interface is
intuitive with a straightforward design
one tap and it is exactly what you
expect that works seamlessly with the
devices you already have we think the
new Wi-Fi pineapple is essential in any
pentesters arsenal that's why we're
excited to announce the new Wi-Fi
pineapple nano continuing our six banana
well we think you're really going to
love the new Wi-Fi pineapple the Nano

get them in pounds learn more about the
new Wi-Fi pineapple nano at Wi-Fi
