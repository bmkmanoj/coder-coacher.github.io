order the new mini TV from the you
advertise just sticking on to the phone
line it's on I'd like to get chaffed it
out they have things we're busy filming
episode 4 but we're just having a blast
and there's so much great stuff going on
that we thought you know why not throw
in some extra content we're not
promising like any weekly releases not
every Wednesday but hey you know why not
we're having a bunch of fun so here's
some goodies so what I wanted to talk
about Harrison is sandboxing and what
that basically means is running
something in a virtual environment and
this is very useful in a couple of
situations say like you're John and
you're running some custom code say like
you're developing a new application
you're using some windows API s or
something that you're not very familiar
with you're afraid that it's going to
crash your system you're gonna lose your
work well test it out in what's called
sandbox a virtual machine that way of a
crash is you've only crashed the virtual
machine not your actual you see of
course there's also the other situation
that I know everybody everybody has run
into where you leave your computer for
like five minutes and you come back and
your girlfriend's been on it and like
this all sudden pop-ups all over your
screen and things that really shouldn't
be well you know it's and just like the
thing where they're like you know I want
to play this little game right we're
like you can you know understand when
you say oh no it's just this all ActiveX
thing I think I'll click yes and I like
you're trying to explain to them why you
know maybe they shouldn't and okay okay
just save your hard drive save your
marriage follow these simple steps it's
really easy to do so you know I work I
use Microsoft virtual machine because we
have a license from Microsoft right yeah
I'm familiar with you know a few more
workstation but there's no way I'm gonna
pay 200 or 400 bucks that's pretty
expensive so if you want to do this at
home and you want to do it on the cheap
a simple solution is using some
open-source software and there's a lot
of great ones out there like box there's
n right yeah thanks
yeah then
monitor there's also cue EMU alright and
then I guess we should mention why and
even though it's is not a not an
emulator wine is not an emulator but you
know it's actually a program for Linux
that'll allow you to run Windows
applications in Linux it's not really an
emulator for mentioning that yeah so
anyway those are something you should
check out we'll have them in the I guess
WAP show notes for this no it's not
really ice shows yeah why not yeah oh
that's right if something quick but but
anyway okay so what we've got here yeah
what we've got here is I've got Windows
XP running inside of Windows XP isn't
that nice um and not really okay well
what I'm gonna try to done by it if
you're gonna demonstrate so yeah okay
apart than one I use Windows exactly
well you know what I want to do is
demonstrate here Windows crashing in a
virtual machine and it not affecting the
host operating system now when is is
easy to get the crash but I want to get
its crash on camera so I'm gonna have to
make a little changes to the registry
there's actually a really neat kind of
hack I don't know if it's really a hack
it's kind of a developer's thing so that
when people that are developing for
Windows we're developing the operating
system want to crash Windows on-demand
they can make a change to the registry
with a few keystrokes get a blue screen
of death so this is like built in the
windows yeah it's you know if you ever
wanted a blue screen I can't really
think of too many times I've wanted to
crash windows on demand I'm trying to
crash it for the segment I know I'm just
saying it like I mean it's a cool little
feature yeah it is well okay so first
thing you're gonna want to do though is
in Windows XP they changed it so that by
default you don't get the blue screen of
death it gives you this it just restarts
the machine one man the blue screen of
death is the whole best part about
crashing your machine well I know you
know what the most fun you ever like
whipped out the digital camera just to
get a picture of like your third BSOD at
work you know what's even better is when
you go to the airport and they've got
this oh yeah that's a good yeah there's
a bunch of websites that I probably why
they changed it so that it automatically
restarts or like receive a login screen
yeah so anyway what we're gonna do here
is going to show you real quick how to
change it so that instead of restarting
you get the blue screen death real easy
right click on my computer I'm gonna
totally waste all my friends can you
know computers and
like oh by the way you know there's a
secret code remember remember telling is
a no-no remember telling your friends
back in the day like the secret code not
iddqd in like doom scroll Alt Delete
yeah that's a good one over on IRC to
hit all f4 okay so we head over to the
Advanced tab and we just go into
settings under startup in recovery and
I've already done here all we have to do
is uncheck this box that says
automatically restart ok ok so now we
actually get the BSOD in all of its
glory nice we're gonna close out of this
we had to make a registry change here
and this is pretty simple we just head
into regedit and go into H key local
machine system currentcontrolset
services I 804 to PRT slash parameters
we create a new D word value and that is
crash on ctrl scroll and we give that a
value of 1 restart your Windows XP
machine yeah well hey you know restart
your Windows XP machine for that to take
effect and then whenever you want you
can just press you can hold down the
right control button ok and press scroll
lock twice so let's go ahead and do that
you get controller control and scroll
lock twice
nice BAM blue screen on demand I don't
think it's any better than that
I like this so we do it all the time you
know and it's also great when say like
you're you know you got some I don't
know a peer-to-peer up or maybe an
application that converts HTML to PDF or
something and you think it may gum up
the works spyware who knows whatever
you're gonna use this program once
you're gonna throw it away
maybe the uninstaller won't work maybe
it's gonna leave some dll's whatever I
don't know virtual machine yeah just one
of the virtual machine get the job done
delete it whatever sounds good so that's
pretty much it we will see you guys on
November 5th yeah episode 4 which so
hype today will be a full episode yeah
this is just something because we were
having fun well yeah full episode
November 4th November 4th gold released
no realest candidates here so
yep did you know what the most fun is
what to take Windows XP run a virtual
machine to run Windows 2000 and then
inside of that leaky 32 megabytes of RAM
to each operating system ago recursive
operated well I mean come on what is uh
what is wine why I'm gonna steal it's
not a no that's a recursive acronym like
like GNU James on UNIX so yeah that
sounds like a good afternoon of fun just
running all the VMS again you know it's
a be perfectly honest that sounds like
it get out of hell for me you know
whatever floats your boat I guess so
your boats that never live in line this
is a gorgeous please hang it up full
screen this is a really good that's a
good
absolutely gorgeous blue screen I hope
they don't take it as Longhorn maybe
they should make it black screen I don't
know but I'm definitely I'm definitely
gonna be Ryan virtual machine stuff now
my girlfriend's using my computer screen
and showing another difference no
totally now it's alright capturing this
Oh big shout-out Ignatian to Hashem
shout out to the IRC group what is it f
net love on IRC channel yeah we're
hanging out there maybe some people it's
been a lot of fun
how's that file yeah contact on there
all the tiny like an addicted to it yeah
like on it for five days straight and
I'm like wow I don't want to do this for
another three years I'm like see my yeah

journey you hear like 30 seconds of a
song is really cool and you know when I
