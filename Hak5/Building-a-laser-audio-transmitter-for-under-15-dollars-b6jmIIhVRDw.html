a few weeks to go back when I was having
a party is that I needed to play music
from my computer to my stereo that way
anybody could just walk in and click you
know song in the playlist without having
like burn a CD or a whole bunch of CDs
and keep them like next to the stereo
there's a couple of solutions but I
wanted to do it wirelessly that we want
to run wires all the way across my
apartment eggs I'm a neat freak and that
will not fly in my apartment and be
because the longer the cable and in this
case would be a really long cable the
worst of signal degradation gets so i
went out i'm a sucker went out and
bought airtunes which plugs right into
the state of the stereo receiver and I
can play music wirelessly from itunes
the only problems this sets this sets me
back about a hundred fifty dollars so
Wes kindly reminded me that I'm a noob
and there's a leader and much cheaper
way to do this it's really cool because
it involves lasers like the weather's
what is the device that involves lasers
okay basically what we've done is take a
pen laser pointer and using amplitude
modulation will be able to carry our
audio signal from our source to our
receiver across the room okay this is
like direct line of sight yeah
absolutely okay um well where'd you
first hear about it picked it up on I
hacked calm but the original article was
from a website that side choice calm
made by a guy named Simon field okay
well I see a lot of little parts here um
do you think you could explain to me and
the viewers what they are and how it's a
call so we can get them sure all right
starting off we actually picked up the
laser pointer here from think the
thinking thank you say something good
registered yeah awesome thank geek comi
ran about ten bucks there okay so we've
got that and then I've relocated the
batteries from the laser pointer into
this box here this came from rat shack
okay radio shack and now you can run
these parallel though we just chose to
give battery pack to make it easier to
wire right yeah this just makes life a
lot a lot more Sunday cool and I have to
ask this question yes it's not the full
laser pointer you just hang on oh no
this is it there's a whole barrel that
goes behind this and that's what the
batteries were originally stored in but
this was a part number 270 3398 be okay
and then
we've got a miniature audio output
transformer this is part 2 73 1380 okay
and this is this is all for the actual
transmitter half okay then when you do
receive yeah and then for the receiver
we've got one of these cad cadmium
sulfide photocells cadmium cadmium
photocells this is 276 1657 double a
battery because this is more like a
resistor it's not it's not like a solar
cell that actually creates electricity
this will just very how much is going
through so we need a double a battery
Josh and poses are plugged into mic
input well ones are our source which
would be like a headphone jack and then
one would be an input gotcha like I
might have a little switch here yeah a
little toggle switch that I've decided
that I wanted to pick up for this
because you like switches I do like
switches and the flow i saw on this
man's original design was that once it's
all wired together the lasers just on oh
okay so you don't have to like unplug it
and plug it back in whenever you want to
use business well I mean it yeah you
just switch on/off gotcha done cool well
I guess we should just head out into the
heck and shows how to do it yeah so
starting off we've hacked up the laser
pointer here and what we have to do is
run our wires and different directions
okay we come we're going to come
straight off of the hot line of the
battery pack here and then this will
just get attached directly to the laser
pointer itself okay so for the time
being we'll just kind of twist it on
right here i'm going to solder all these
connections here shortly that just gets
tied on to anywhere that there's you
know the positive is okay gotcha and you
just have to pay attention to how that
is per your laser pointer alright so
that's just a direct line and then from
there we take our negative side and that
runs to one side of our do transformer
right here just like that and then the
other negative gets bridged from the
battery pack to the transformer and
we'll just twist this connection
here I know it looks like a tangled mess
you can take a lot more time and make me
make it neat stick it in a hobby box for
housing right yeah get a hobby box from
radio shack and make it look pretty
catching let me take a look at this I
can follow you yeah take a look at it
this way I mean there's that's just a
really simple thing right there okay
there's our continuous loop and then on
the other side on our now there's two
sides to this there's a thousand ohm or
excuse me a thousand milli ohm something
like something like that I can't
remember exactly and then there's an 8
ohm side to this so this is the this is
the output yeah this is the output and
this is the eighth own side okay and
that's aside with only two wires are red
and white okay right there easy though
yeah and that just goes to a standard
Jack like this you can take these up for
me inside of this little red housing
they can it's not positive or negative
this point out you decide Oh as long as
far as I could tell yeah as long as you
keep all your side straighten it uniform
then it won't be any problem very good
and I've got all those connections
inside of they are soldered it takes
about maybe 15 20 minutes depending upon
how fast you work to get this side done
okay and then our receiver over here is
of course our double a battery as a
power source then we've got the little
silver film the photo salad or so photo
cell right here could just like you
solar cells in like powerhouse often
right if we have like a million yeah so
anyway that you know and this this
polarity doesn't matter on this side
either okay so you just run one line
from the battery pack to the photocell
photocell to your jack your plug and
then back from that Jack to the battery
over here yeah I mean that's all there
really is to it and then you can wire
the switch in on the hot side over here
that's not an actual phone that's an
optional thing you know i'll do it for
my own purposes later right gotcha well
should we test it out is it ready to go
as it is right now yeah pretty much is
all right well we haven't have not happy
to have we put it here ahead of time
yeah purposefully
hey stereo say yeah let's pull it up and
I will let you take it over from here
all right so we've got our stereo right
here go ahead and turn it on CDs the
best thing no CD know right extra sound
going on so we will plug in the music
coming from the ipod yeah all we got to
do is soon to be it's playing right now
so now we just line up our laser line
laser sight hit the little button Oh
turn the volume up see if our listeners
can hear that there we go I hear it
so in this case you have two very steady
hand but it wouldn't be too hard to make
a mount for it if you know it was and
had some binoculars to know um now
that's pretty good I mean sounds good
sounds great it's okay the only downfall
is that as opposed to you know something
like airtunes but so you have some make
it yourself and you have that line of
sight problem but this is much cooler
than your tunes because can do other
things like blind people if you really
wanted it to you know yeah you know if
somebody starts happening with you you
know your music you just turn is a good
play and bind them yeah exactly that's a
really cool feature I mean this would
you know be something for you know I
mean it's not gonna replace airtunes I'm
sorry no but not at this point it's it's
for people that want to do things like
this for fun like we do all the time
yeah that's really cool thanks a lot for
showing us is there anything all the
pertinent information will be available
in the show notes and x5 org slash forms
yeah I guess that's it cool music and I
think that sums it up thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
