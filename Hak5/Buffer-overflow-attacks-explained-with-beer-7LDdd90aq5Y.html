overflow attacks
now buffer overflow attacks are the most
popular method for attackers to perform
arbitrary code execution now arbitrary
code execution in case you don't know is
where like let's say he has a script or
you know some code knife some code I'm
gonna send my code to his and basically
like make some shit happen so before we
talk about all that though I'm gonna go
ahead and well let's break it down and
make it simple and start off by
explaining what exactly a buffer is all
right a buffer is basically allocating
memory that a programmer creates and
uses so he can store and manipulate his
data
oh yeah well so let's talk about this
from the hackers point of view basically
we got this buffer now we're gonna fill
it up and then continue to pass data to
it until it overflows and data that
overflows has to go somewhere so it goes
to an adjacent or you know the next
memory slot and what that memory slot
now we have access to run our own code
possibly pass in some of our you know
some assembly or some C right that's a
so function that's assuming that the
next memory slot contains a function
call or executable code that's what I
just said yeah what is but you want to
make sure you want to make sure that you
really you know have a good idea of
where your code is going maybe it's not
the simplest thing in the world to do
but yeah let's think of a real-world
example so we have for example a
firewall and it's firmware okay so the
firmware has to accept the password and
make sure that it's valid so we're going
to write a piece of code or some
software that send some sends the
password fills that buffer up then
continues passing data to that buffer
and after the password is is is filled
up assuming that the developer didn't
make a write a program to check you know
the size of the password we can write or
inject our own machine or assembly code
to manipulate what the program does from
there so we can get root access or you
know change users modify users change
the settings that sort of thing now to
bring a great up example of you know
what languages do you actually use to do
these type of buffer overflow attacks
and I guess we'll go into lower-level
level languages which is you know
probably the best way to do it with
assembly and see that's and that's keep
in mind that's because see and assembly
C++ lower-level languages require that
the programmer managed the size of the
buffers and it doesn't necessarily make
them bad languages because they're very
powerful and very useful it just means
that they have to be very careful to
manage the size of their buffers right
but yeah this language is like you know
Lisp Lisp and Java and Perl okay great
examples of programming language that
actually allocate the memory through
compile that's like runtime checking and
static analysis exactly so so I guess
we'll go into a live example of this
isn't actually do this this is an
example that we can all come we can all
can relate to because it has it'th beer
so let's assume that this glass right
here is a buffer and this is a buffer as
well now john is the malicious user
Mallory right you and Mallory they're
malicious user I'm Mallory the malicious
hacker I'm gonna be Bob okay ugly
function hey come on don't be too hard
here I'm the function that is gonna be
calling this memory so what the data
that's in this memory slot so however
however okay this is the actual buffer
that we use for the actual login for
example so this is the login this is oh
this is the buffer that takes the
password right so so we're gonna go
ahead and pour some enter enter our
username and login and password blah
blah blah and then event categories blah
blah blah we're gonna use a blah blah
blah okay then we're eventually gonna go
ahead oh passing some extra variable or
extra extra input and give him a little
bit of extra seam if thing is not only
that he spilled beer on my fingers but
he also passed data into my buffer so me
being the function call in this buffer I
have to read it and see what I see you
know see what see what's in it
sorry so now this is when I actually
take control of them and he doesn't
really realize it so wow that tastes a
lot like assembly
yeah well I made this kids table
drinking it it's so good so what'd she
get to be drinking yeah see this is
where I started to take complete control
over I mean he he basically has to
listen to everything that I say
now why it's let's shut up what is this
shush and basically you know I'm gonna
take complete control of them and this
is or not is shut up and this is our
normal buffer he's drinking up that
assembly kid or some C code are you
enjoying it it's so good god I love
assembly I don't I don't know what to
say
good good I'm glad you're enjoying it
how about I give you some more mmm
okay go for it we're gonna inject some
more code into them and I really love to
have some root access oh gotta drink up
buddy
Wow access granted
come on in why don't you just go ahead
and change whatever users you want you
can modify my settings I don't care I'll
just keep drinking you know and that's
the basic overview of how a buffer
overflow works hope you guys enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
