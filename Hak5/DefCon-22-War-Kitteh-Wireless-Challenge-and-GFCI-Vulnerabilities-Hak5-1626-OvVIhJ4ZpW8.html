by domain.com hello welcome to hack 5 my
name is darren kitchen i'm shannon boy
it's your weekly dose of Technol us and
we we do not have a Def Con hangover do
we no not at all as you guys know Def
Con is definitely conventional at it is
a fantastic conference nation's largest
I believe hacker conference in Las Vegas
we'd love to go every year and meet the
peoples and sell the pineapples and talk
to all the boss yes lots of pictures of
people's faces blurred out because of
course you have to be very respectful at
conferences such as these so we have a
great lineup of interviews for you guys
all taken in of course the ominous white
van as you know I have a I have a little
interesting fact that I learned this
year about you know how you're not
supposed to take pictures of people
without their permission
well doesn't really work so well if
you're a podcaster so I noticed while we
were standing behind the booth right
random people would put up their cameras
really high and just start snapping okay
the trick letter is the DEF CON photo
policy has not been enforced for years
there's quite there's if you go to the
different forums you can find more than
you ever wanted to know about opinions
on it but essentially the gist is you're
supposed to be respectful at a hacker
conf it's not just DEFCON you're not
supposed to just snap pictures of people
even though you're in a weird way in
private but those people did ask but
whenever they didn't I just be like
thank you for asking
Shannon you're a public figure being so
old caster I'm still a part of the you
know same crew you know at DEFCON and
everything everybody yes I took selfies
with fans Anders awesome I did too and
it was so fun especially at the pool
party yay we actually don't have any
throws or anything from DEFCON as
there's too many people around and we're
trying to do that so we don't have any
way to do like in film there's like
geometry and doing like an establishing
shot to kind of give you a sense so
maybe we can flash a picture and you
guys can understand that we're doing
awesome interviews in the big white van
and yes that was fun hey you know what
if speaking of like you know recording
and stuff and the big white van as we
took a we found great parking in the
vendor area and we were looking for a
cab and to bring it to Def Con to sell
awesome stuff like pineapples and
duckies and allow us to continue having
more seasons of hak5
I found something in my dirty laundry
which was in one of the overhead bins
from yeah yeah found the lost camera I
found loss cone which we'd be roll from
the tour camp episode little late it's a
bit late it's a bit late but we've got
great little snippets like this and like
that one and you totally missed this one
too like look at those those are great
clips and I could have shown during the
we're gonna have to yeah way to go
Darren so we're just gonna redo those
episodes not no poor Darren yeah we're
gonna redo all of them yes actually
let's do a director's cut just start
back on Episode one okay okay no so we
have some really really cool segments
this week I talked to a girl named
Maggie who exactly hair dryers are
involved seriously it's pretty cool we
talked to a dude that has a cat which
was awesome
and also you chatted with the wireless
village yes yes I talked to Russ from
the wireless village so we've got
wireless cats and hair dryers coming
right up stay tuned
yeah so I love cats and dogs everybody
knows this and gene Bransfield from tech
nasty it's nasty so you have a talk
coming up on Sunday all about cats and
dogs and GSM and tracking so I have to
know what's going on because there's two
cats at home and the idea of making them
do things for me it sounds really really
fun research indicates that you can't
make a cat you anything you want them to
say let's feed them treats exactly so my
talk is called
weaponizing your pets the war kit a and
the denial of service dog so your
weaponizing and does that mean I'm gonna
stick a gun on top of my cat no other
lasers no it does not
that is a Wi-Fi snipping solution
basically similar to wardriving in a
form factor that will fit on the collar
of your cat and you send the cat for a
walk about your Flex stuff when it comes
back and they'll actually wear it they
will wear it what oh yeah one of my cats
caught a mouse while he was wearing yep
okay so tell me about how this works
okay so earlier today I had the idea
because I do a lot of information
security briefings yeah to people who
are not technical in nature so when I
start getting least bit technical they
start glazing over and start thinking of
jujubes or whatever it is they think of
unfamiliar and so to make things more
interesting I started including funny
pictures of cats and stories about cats
became notorious for giving briefings
like that and somebody came up and they
offered me a cat collar they never
delivered it but they offered it and it
had a GPS component and had a cellular
component and it would track where your
cat had been if you got nervous you can
send it a text in it
why do you with where the cat was yeah
they're great if your cat goes outdoors
might get lost we go back so so me being
the guy I am I thought well now I needs
a little Wi-Fi sniffer and I got wore
kitten
well the Wi-Fi sniffers I know they're
kind of big yes they are but I was
messing around the stuff my first
thought was to strap a cell phone onto
the cat because I just downloaded legal
to a very small Android phone
jab cat and send it out on a walkabout
that ended with mass disaster I lost my
cell phone and I never got it back cat
didn't come back for quite a while we
were worried about it so we needed
something smaller and more dangerous so
a friend of mine suggested why don't you
use an Arduino and get the small very
small chips that's a form factor it gets
a little bit of power consumption does
exactly what you needed to do and no
more and you'll probably fit on a cat so
I started going back okay I ended up
using a spark poor chip which is a their
Kickstarter company sparked on I owe a
great cool stuff yeah and got it down to
the four factor that I had an ARM chip
on one side a Wi-Fi tip on the other
side that has a GPS a small GPS antenna
and an SD card breakout board and we're
good to go we have to put the solution
right here so was this code written
anywhere oh hell no okay not everything
that people posted the libraries were
not readily available on SPARC do when I
got there they are now but people were
posting it to the forums and there was a
very robust and very responsive
developer community associated with
SPARC data oh yeah and the only thing
that I had to code up was the GPS and I
was able to port that over from the tiny
GPS plus plus drivers that were online
available for Arduino so what language
did you have to rate that it's in C++ C
question yes the a decoding expert so
there's the way that works with Arduino
exactly the true code people would be
like snot Realty plus plus sorry I
worked for what I needed it so and
everything else was written out
the libraries were being libraries were
available I had to download them compile
them make them work specifically with my
stuff you messing around with variables
aside and I finally got it working it
took months and months but it finally
got ok so while your cat is out and
about and your Whiteface snipping and
how do you get all that data back it
records it to an SD card that's in the
collar and you recover it when it comes
back ok hopefully it comes back yes do
you have a battery built-in as well yes
I used a small leaf light battery which
people used for their drones floating
around there and my buddy Ricky Hill
hooked me up with that and I've had this
similar it had enough it had enough
power in this form factor that would fit
in the collar so that's what I went with
so how long did it last it depends on
how quickly how frequently you gather
information and if your cat goes and
hides under a bush so in my testing if I
did collections every 30 seconds and
lasted for hours if I did it every 10
minutes at last 8 hours well I went with
5 minutes and that lasted about 6 hours
when testing and only did three hours of
collections probably because cats kept
going under Bush did you have any
problems with your cat going in the
water anything like that no cats
generally avoid water I do have
everything wrapped up an electrical tape
inside here to prevent the weather
getting to it and also the spark is
rather flashy and I didn't want
bird-of-prey to be flying over to see a
flashing light and take care of my work
your tail hold number zero as I don't
want to harm the cat that's what I did
everything I did tried not to hurt the
cats at all ok now so we know how that
works is this data available anywhere
have you put it out which do
the code for this as well as nobody ever
asked I came here thinking that nobody
would pay attention to this doers out
there gonna be Mike I want to do one too
so if you go to spark on the spark I Oh
on the forums there there's plenty of
this code floating around you could
probably download it and throw it on
your spark tip so good luck with
soldering I enjoyed it yes for people
who hate themselves
I have little fingers I'm able to do it
very easily I knew that I was not okay
so tell me about the dog collar dogs not
a collar it's basically it's a backpack
and I made up patches that say denial of
service dog and the crazy part is when
people look at the patch they don't read
denial of they just see service dog but
think it's a service dog and let you go
wherever you want to bars stores things
like that and I had a Wi-Fi pineapple in
the butt in the dog backpack and I got a
Adafruit tv-b-gone kit and I soldered
wires to it and ran the wires through
the dog backpack and had a button in the
leash handle and you go somewhere hit
the button and would fire it off and it
would turn off televisions if they were
appropriately configured that's bloody
brilliant I'm assuming you have the
antennas hidden inside of the backpack
yeah the only thing I'm sticking out of
the backpack were the IR LEDs okay yeah
works worked rather well
and did you run into any problems with
other people whenever you took your dog
out - no in fact we did all the testing
and we had a waiter who was props to the
waiter about the third time back dealing
with us he said so why does it say
denial officer he's the only guy he did
pay attention but it took him three
trips to ask and then we didn't really
answer him and he didn't ask again so
that people are trying to be nice nobody
suspects the cute little dog no in fact
they do then the dog in fact was a
Doberman fence area and a very non
Doberman Doberman they need
and the guy was walking around he had
the leash in one hand he had his
backpack by the handlers and the dogs
like love you love you everybody was
nice doggie it's a very non service
service dog just mainly to control
people and yes there's no socially
redeeming qualities whatsoever about
service dog well thank you so much
Jeanne for talking to me about these I
think it's super super awesome I can't
wait to play with my cats at home where
can people find out more information
about you and what you do on Twitter and
Geum Ran's field well thank you so much
Jeanne thank you very much Janice thank
you it doesn't matter whether you use a
hair dryer to look this good or take
down a power grid when you've got that
killer idea you need to snag yourself a
domain name and web hosting really
quickly and get this domain how come I
got a very quick domain discovery system
and a very easy checkout process you
know what that means you will very
likely get your website up and running
in no time and I told you guys before
how much I love domain.com and it's
pretty brilliantly simple why I mean out
of only are they affordable reliable and
easy to use well mainly because they're
a fun place to do business they're
active on social media you can tweet
them at domain.com and see why it's just
they're fun guys and the guys over
domain to come get this huge fans of
hak5 and so they want to hook you up and
get this they have this coupon code it's
called act 5 I know it makes so much
sense and it will save you an extra 15%
off so don't forget to use the coupon
code hak5 at domain.com to check out and
when you think domain names think
domain.com
it is now time for the trivia question
of the week last week's trivia question
was what is the name of the command used
to add a user to OS X or OS 10 box and
the answer is util ni UTI L hopefully
you guys got that one right and this
week's trivia question is Apple's
firewire cable was designed to be
influenced by what alternative cable
from the past
you can answer that at HK v org slash
trivia for your chance to win some
awesome back five B's
Rus it is so good to see you man again a
lot has changed since MOOC on you you
are rocking a year with the wireless CTF
we're here at Def Con and I know that
you guys are doing like a two phased
Wireless CTF yeah we actually have a lot
of crazy things going so we have the
raspberry PI's came back with pi FM and
we're doing representative transmissions
that represent what you would find in
the real world but we're doing it and is
M bands and ham radio bands so
interesting so for example you we talked
about this a lot when we started getting
to our SDR stuff where you know you can
pick up say ABS B beacons on 1090
megahertz but do not transmit on that
channel or you know go to jail yes so
your ting stuff like that except over
I don't know 904 33 other legal channels
exactly you got it so that people can
see the stuff and mess with it in a safe
way safe way but the the final purpose
of everything is to be able to get
people to mess with this stuff and get
back into ham radio and get back into
learning what it means to demodulate
something and how to demodulate
something right I mean we're so used to
like you know the higher layers of OSI
where everything's kind of done for you
especially is like Wi-Fi hackers we deal
with like packets maybe we go down to
frames but we just kind of expect that
all of that dsss stuff all of OFDM all
of those acronyms that are the amazing
little things that make it turn from you
know budget you know amplitude and
frequencies and and turn it into
BET's its yeah so we have some so the
challenges that we had like for instance
on that one was a motion detector for a
home automation system thing so that
something like this something just like
that because that is it whoa and how is
this RF so it's a wireless motion
detector and every time it's very very
very sensitive so every time it picks up
motion it burps out a packet but it's
not just like you know on-off on-off
sort of stuff it uses Manchester
encoding so you have to learn different
modulation techniques and how to
actually deconstruct it into actually
being bits and bytes on a wire that's
interesting so if you're as I guess
you're through the wireless but if so
what you're saying is if you're capable
of actually learning this you know the
Manchester encoding that you configure
what those packets are and you could
potentially then tune in and be able to
tell when someone is in a room yeah
every one device Sena and moreover you
know depending on the scope of the
engagement you could potentially legally
transmit and make the alarm system
believe someone's in a room maybe send
all the security guards to one room when
you're actually infiltrating another or
disrupt the system that is actually
receiving the packets like a DDoS attack
without actually jamming so for instance
it is possible with this particular
system to saturate the receiver so much
not through like just making noise but
sending packets that it cannot receive
legitimate signal but that's a talk for
another time that sounds ridiculously
awesome thank you so the we actually
demonstrated replay attacks over at
b-sides Vegas we had a two-day class
over there and well in order to easily
demonstrate that I picked up you know
those little keychain things that help
you find where your keys are you press a
button and it makes a sound so what I
ended up doing was recording recorded
that transmission and you can replay it
and what you end up getting are these
like little tiny annoy-o-tron mm nose
makers when no one's actively pressing
the button now the the reason why that's
possible is it's a dumb device
who wants to attack something like that
but it's a great demonstration of being
able to use these tools in order to do
something that could potentially be
offensive and this is the fun thing
about software-defined radio it's like a
whole new realm of hacking because we
find that so many devices that had
previously you know had security only
through obscurity now that we're
actually able to in the software realm
with tools that were used to like you
know Wireshark and things of that nature
actually dissect how these things work
and find out that there's actually in
most cases no authenticity checks
whatsoever correct yeah and that's so
with that as an extension the injection
attack that violates trust was on the
wireless keyboard so Travis Goodspeed
did this excellent paper regarding the
Microsoft wireless keyboards and their
predictability of being able to decrypt
them and also inject so we had he
rewrote the firmware for one of the hope
badges well we had hook badges with
firmware on them so that people could
snip the keystrokes and also inject
keystrokes whoa that is part of the
challenge so it's you could just as
easily do it with any of the other tools
as well but you know for practicality
sake and just and we only have four days
we came prepared with all that sort of
stuff well tell me about the RF case of
doom and what is yes what is happening
here so we have five raspberry PI's each
pi is transmitting on a different
frequency and with the and each
frequency is a flag on its own and then
there's also encoding and modulation
that's occurring with each individual
one that's representative of the real
world sort of stuff so with two of the
PI's I have an RTL
connected into them so the purpose of
that is that it's transmitting you have
to transmit back to it in order to
progress on the challenge interesting so
there's like several like gates you
unlock as you go through the challenge
exactly because RTL is well not our SD
are still a very new thing people don't
seem to there's a lot of interest but
there's a lot of struggling regarding
how to progress personally what do you
what do you think that is do you think
that's because we like a lot of hackers
don't have the fundamental knowledge
how RF works through like same you know
decoding the modulation or do would you
say it's a lack of toolsets
or we're growing it's okay yeah I know
shiny thing so the easiest way it's the
old new shiny thing is the fun thing
about it so the the way that I describe
a lot of these processes is like the
joke of you know how to draw an Al draw
to construct concentric circles and then
draw the rest of the damn house
step1 step2 there there's like this void
somewhere in between and the community
is coming forward and documenting so we
just need to fill it in exactly so what
we're doing in this is having people
learn through doing through actually
going through the capture the flag
process of learning how to get from
point A to point Z and documenting their
animating and so are you also teaching
at the end of the wireless CTF like how
to complete the challenge yes we have an
after-action but also before the
Wireless CTF we had a two-day class on
wireless essentially it's really where
was that that was over at besides Vegas
oh nice I had the entire Wireless CTF
team as the instructors so yeah they
learn from the horses themselves whether
or not they actually brought that
knowledge to the table was entirely up
to them but that's we'll be doing the
exact same thing again over at um Derby
con and so many winners yes we had the
first place prizes were more amazingly
was new on and Great Scott gadgets
donated a hacker F and blade RF
respectively but there was also a whole
bunch of there was a whole bunch of
other sponsorship that came into it as
well from prizes to cash to helping us
get here and do this this is awesome so
you guys are doing a fantastic job I
love that you're bringing this into the
forefront of the community and the
hacker cons is the greatest place to get
and get that exposure so where are you
going next with the you know evil RF box
of doom after I get through the airport
yeah that's a whole different story so
the the guarantee next spot to find this
will be over at Derby con and then after
that we'll be at various conferences and
the East Coast because that's kind of
where we're all centered sure where can
people find out about the the stuff
you're doing with wireless ETF's I'm
putting the wireless CTF is WCT fqs and
then regarding this particular write-up
I'm putting it on a SDR ninja awesome
SDR ninja thank you so much for having
us and of course thank you to the
wireless village at Def Con for her for
hosting it absolutely I think we had a
fantastic time
the biggest success that I think I heard
of was that the ham radio exam was the
biggest ever Wow not just for Def Con
ever or most people taking the exam at
the same time so I consider that a win
and I hope that we were a part of the
interest for doing it it was very cool
thank you again Ross thank you cheers
Cheers okay we're gonna go a little
girly geek here but still it's pretty
hardcore game so I think you guys are
gonna enjoy this I'm here with Maggie hi
Maggie how are you hi I'm good Shannon
how are you I'm wonderful thank you sexy
I'm really really tired but that's okay
it's DEFCON if you gotta have fun yeah
and get tired that's it so you did a
talk
just this morning I believe about what's
the culligan GFCI GFCI so what does that
stand for
it stands for ground fault circuit
interrupter ground fault circuit
interrupter I am so new to anything
having to do in ways like you know that
kind of genre please only like the
introduction of what this is absolutely
so I'm sure you're familiar with a
little black box that's on the plug of
your hairdryer yes yes hey you do I hate
it cuz the trip sometimes yes yeah so
there's a red button and white button
and essentially what it's meant to do is
to it's supposed to protect you from
going into electric shock like if you
ever drop it into your top with you or
for some reason you touch it and you
would ground the stick good think of the
circuit as water so water gets pushed in
and then the water has to go somewhere
so it comes back out and it measures how
much current goes out and how how much
current goes in and how much current
goes out if it notices a little bit of a
difference I think it's about between 5
and 30 milliamps
that's enough to make your heart go into
ventricular shock where your ventricles
instead of contracting normally they
just kind of spaz up right so and it has
to do it quick enough it's so that that
doesn't happen which is between twenty
five hundred forty milliseconds so I
found a way to in some cases just trip
but the GFCI is on the 90 degree
built-in plugs actually I can melt them
and make them spark and smoke generally
yes oh my gosh okay so how does this
work
so I found out really by super chance
and mistake really yeah I I really
really love that I could start my first
Def Con talk with so I was doing my hair
the other day that's all so you never
hear that addict right right and and it
seems like like the audience dick did so
I was pretty happy so you were doing
your hair one day I was doing my hair
one day and my significant other thought
that we it would be a brilliant idea if
we communicated through RF we'd save
millions and cellular and whatnot so we
bought a couple walkie-talkies and a ton
of batteries and we lived in neighboring
complexes so we thought it might work
and we never really sank tester when we
were gonna use them but that day I was
doing my hair and I thought I heard the
radio in the other room someone talking
through it so around to the room grab
the hell over there was anyone there
nothing so I went back to the bathroom
there I was doing my hair and I hit the
call button you know to make it sound on
the other side yeah and when I hit it
the GFCI that the plug of my hair dryer
vibrated out of control made a horrible
sound and sparked and sucked
so I'm so that happened from the radio
frequency that you were sending out what
the little transformer inside captures
and somehow resonates with the frequency
that I'm sending and the solenoid inside
if there's a little metallic what should
we count like a bullet that that's
supposed to just trigger once hard and
break the circuit oh but I'm doing a
really high frequency so it's it's it's
smaller waves so it kind of goes in and
out in and out that's what causes the
vibration and then it overheats the
plastic melts and it just never works
again the problem is that it's hardwired
oh yeah so the device so it works it's
just no longer protected there was a
news article a few days ago where a
little kid died execution because of the
GFCI malfunction because of their hard
wired shut
I mean yeah it's hardwired so
frequencies exactly does this work on I
I'm trying not to say I'm trying not to
do a how to do something horrible my my
guitar these how to smoke your things
you guys are people will figure it out
yeah I gave a list of suggestions as to
what to do and how it could be a bad
thing how it could affect because if you
just say you could interrupt someone
from doing their hair or yeah and you
can find these things also on the plugs
have you noticed like in your bathroom
or the kitchen where they also have
buttons yes so this is only shows things
yes so how can I protect myself from
this happening you can do one of the few
things what I thought the test cases
where I thought it would be really bad
if these things because the AFC is a
different kind of circuit breaker the
ones that are in your garage are also
vulnerable to RF just different
frequencies yeah that's true so and the
bad thing about RF is what on earth
could be our radio frequency
interference could be either intentional
or non-intentional so and the thing is
that it's wireless and it's fingerprint
free right so but that's the danger in
it right but it could just be an
accident or something could be trying to
do something against you
and what if an old lady lives on her own
and depends on a respirator being
plugged into the wall yeah that's the
kind of thing that I've been worried but
that could be really scary that makes
sense yes or this little kid who doesn't
like right now so it's the kind of thing
that if you never need it you barely
notice it's there but if you need a bit
better work yes
so my suggestions were if you have a
loved one that depends on a machine then
make sure that there's batteries or
manual overrides and maybe a power
generator in the house so that you have
time a wiggle room to assess a situation
update to newer patents the the ones
that I noticed our most vulnerable the
wants to fire up and sometimes I would
get a piece of component like a flaming
piece of component fly out Oh be a fire
hazard Wow so those are order patented
items yes dewers oh oh okay but for some
reason I keep finding me everywhere I
came to the Rio and tried the first
thing I did was try on there on the wall
and the hairdryer here already well my
house
vulnerable everything I buy on the store
is vulnerable so if we know about this
and it's fixed
