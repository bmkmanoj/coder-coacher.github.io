Netflix hello and welcome to hack tip
the show where we break down the
concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm your
host Darren kitchen and today we're
turning exhaustively long commands into
shell scripts with minimal effort now a
shell script is basically a set of
commands written for your computer's
shell or command-line interface so if
you're running Windows and that's going
to be say the power shell or the
Microsoft DOS command comm and these
aren't compiled programs so for those
look for more powerful languages like C
or Perl but for getting the job done
quickly and easily
sometimes a shell script is all you need
now in our example we're going to be
using bash or the born again shell it's
it's one of the more common shells
you're going to find out there in UNIX
operating systems though to stave off
bunch angry emails already gonna go
ahead and give a shout-out to the C
shell the Z shell the corn shell and
there's billion others but anyway last
week you may remember that we built a
command using ping and date to give us
nice little time stamps for our ping
replies and what I'd like to do now is
turn that long string of commands into a
nice-looking shell script and so to do
so I'm going to actually bring up that
command in my shell here we go I've got
it right here and what I can do is
actually pop that into an editor with
the nifty keystroke control X control e
and there we go I'm in nano well I mean
my editor of choice could of course be
vaio or Emacs or whatever you set it to
be we could also do this with the FC
command but we're going to come back to
that powerful command another time
I like this key combo I think it works
great we need to pre append our command
with a Shi bang ji bang is sometimes
called a hash bang and it's a sequence
that specifies which interpreter to use
when executing the script the she is
supposedly short for sharp or hash as in
a pound sign and the bang being a
exclamation point now this is followed
by the path to our interpreter so since
we're using bash that'd be in slash bin
slash s
H alright so our first line is pound
exclamation point slash bin slash SH and
from here we can go ahead and pretty up
our script if we want by you know say
replacing these semicolons here with
some carriage returns there we go Oh
doesn't that look so much better already
I don't know this is where you could get
really complex with your script if you
really wanted to now here in nano we can
actually save the file out and give it a
name by just doing ctrl o and I'm going
to save it in slash route slash I don't
know let's call it date ping SH for
shell script it doesn't have to be dot
SH I just like to do it that way and
I'll say yes and there we go now in just
a bit we're going to go ahead and finish
up our script test it out but first
let's take a quick break with Netflix
the world's largest subscription
streaming service you can instantly
watch thousands of TV episodes and
movies to your Microsoft Xbox 360 the
sony ps3 console the Nintendo Wii
console and your computer for one low
monthly price no late fees no due dates
and for a limited time hak5 viewers can
get a free 30-day trial membership at
Netflix calm / hack 5 sign up now and be
sure to use this URL so they know we
sent you now that our file has been
saved we can actually go ahead and quit
the Nano editor with control X and we'll
actually notice here that our script is
going to go ahead and begin executing
which is nice but for this example we
want to run it our newly created file so
I'm going to go ahead and ctrl C stop
that guy over here clear the screen
alright now we're already in our home
directory if we learnt a CD to navigate
there and if we actually look for our
dot SH file with LS tack L star dot SH I
can go ahead and see that our file isn't
executable I can tell this because I
don't see an X right here that would say
has execution privileges and I can also
tell and it's quite obvious in this
shell because it hasn't been highlighted
in green like my other scripts here now
to make the file executable we're going
to want to use the chmod command to
change the mode and we could probably
spend all day talking about the numeric
representations of modes in regards to
users groups and everything else but
since we simply just want to make this
executable for ourselves
what we're going to do is just use the
plus operator along with the X operator
for so plus is to add and then X is for
the execute mode so chmod date ping or
I'm sorry its chmod plus X and then our
file there we go
so now if we reissue LS tack l start at
SH we can see that not only is a green
but it has our X's so it is executable
and finally with our file all ready to
go it's just a matter of invoking the
complete path and file name and since
the file is actually in our current
working directory we can go ahead and
just use the shortcut period or a dot
followed by a slash and then the file
name so that's let's say a date ping and
there we go Bob's your uncle Roberts
your mother's brother and there you have
it this of course means that that I'm
looking forward to your feedback I'm
looking forward to hearing what you guys
use what programs what commands what
scripts rock your world hit us up tips

comment below and be sure to check out
our sister show hack 5 for more great
stuff just like this I'll be there
reminding you to trust your techno list
i'll programs there kind of as an
implied script</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
