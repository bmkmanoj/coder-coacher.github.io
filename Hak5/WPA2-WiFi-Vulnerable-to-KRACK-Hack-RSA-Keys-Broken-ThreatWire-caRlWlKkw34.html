their IRS contract and an RSA crypto key
is vulnerable to being reverse
engineered all that coming up now on
threat wire greetings I am Shannon Morse
and this is threat wire for October 17
2017 your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom if
you haven't checked out our patreon yet
please do so we have lots that we want
to do for the show but we can't do it
without your support patreon.com slash
threat wire is the place to support
threat wire and the link is in the show
notes and also real quick I just wanted
to let you know that I am giving away a
Nintendo NES classic over on my texting
youtube channel all you have to do is go
over there to youtube.com slash tech
thing make sure to comment on the most
recent episode from this last week and
make sure to subscribe so you know when
we announce the winner and now on to the
news on Sunday night I just happen to
check Twitter to see a whole ton of info
SEC professionals talking about a
rumored new attack against wpa2 people
said that it was legit but no sources
were given publicly it turns out it is
true and wpa2 is vulnerable
wpa2 is the de-facto Wi-Fi protocol that
is suggested for securing your home
networks and businesses if you rely on
wireless uses wpa2 has better encryption
than the much older WEP and it requires
you to know a passphrase to login to a
Wi-Fi network hence the name which means
Wi-Fi protected access a flaw dubbed
crack for key reinstallation attack was
discovered in the security of wpa2 by a
security researcher named Mattie Van
Hoff and presented at blackhat Europe
and the computer and communications
security conference I'll provide the
links below to their write-up as well as
the cert and CC information for wireless
vendors down below in the show notes so
basically you can assume that you're
vulnerable to this attack if you have
implemented wpa2 on your router or any
of your client devices that you own be
it your smartphone your laptop or your
Internet of Things devices
researchers have found it affects
Android Apple Linux windows open
est MediaTek Linksys and a ton more
vendors the attacks work on both access
points and clients so updating just the
access point will not necessarily keep
your client devices protected so what do
cracks do well if an attacker is within
wireless range of their target they can
use the technique to steal private
information such as passwords emails
photos credit card numbers and a lot
more in some instances it could also be
used to inject data into the network as
well how does that happen well all you
have to do is log onto a wpa2 protected
network which requires your device to do
a handshake with the router you can't
see this happen with your own two eyes
but both the router and the smartphone
or your laptop for example agree and
pawn and encryption key that only works
between those two devices it lets you
log into the internet and get on
Facebook within a few seconds sometimes
unfortunately for some reason the
handshake won't complete so the wireless
router will restart the message that it
sends to your device until it eventually
connects if it has to restart the
handshake at reasons the same encryption
key and that's the big thing here in the
case of cracks the handshake is
manipulated and replayed to the victim
which restarts the session between the
two devices the attacker reads the
handshake manipulates it then sends it
on its way so this is an underlying
problem with WPA protocols not any
specific vendor and by the way it
affects all versions of WPA
implementations in similar ways this can
be really scary because an attacker
could decrypt packets via the TCP
sequence part of a connection and if the
user is using TK IP or GCM P which are
both encryption protocols used in WPA
the attacker could decrypt and inject
malicious packets on some clients
specifically some versions of Android
and Linux the attacker could force the
client into using a predictable
encryption key so basically just assume
that if you are depending on wpa2 to
encrypt your traffic it could possibly
be read by a third party now with that
said though they cannot steal and read
your WPA password and they cannot inject
packets on AES CCMP encryption protocols
now
since they don't need your WPA password
to use this attack that also means that
if you change your password you're still
going to be vulnerable now luckily once
vendors start sending out updates you
will be patched and in the clear
unfortunately though some devices may
take months to receive a patch now this
is also scary because Internet of Things
devices are prone to never receiving
updates if any which means that they are
going to be vulnerable for a very long
time potentially or vulnerable forever
also while you are probably already
using something like HTTPS Everywhere on
your browser and that's a really good
thing you should definitely keep doing
that if somebody was targeting your
network they could still create phishing
sites on HTTP being incredibly mindful
of your browsing and using HTTPS on
sites is definitely crucial here so what
can you do use antivirus obviously even
something as simple as Windows Defender
will help in case of an attack if the
attacker actually targets you and
installs something malicious make sure
that your firewalls are turned on and if
you can switch to a wired connection
instead obviously you can't necessarily
do that for your smartphone for example
now if you have a VPN that you can fully
trust a VPN that either you've created
or one that you can trust that will help
too as well switching to LTE or mobile
data instead of using wireless and as
soon as you see an update or a patch
from your device manufacturer make sure
to install those immediately and ZDNet
has an update list on their vendors and
their responses linked below
now some including Microsoft has already
released patches so definitely get those
installed and turn on those automatic
updates and the biggest thing to take
away from this is just not to panic and
go buy routers that you don't need again
the attacker would have to be within
Wireless proximity of you and
downgrading to WEP is not an answer to
this problem so do not do that if you
have to use wireless for your devices
which we all know some devices you have
no choice with keep them with wpa2 and
wait for that patch or just stick
everything in a dumpster fire to that
would definitely work as well big shout
out to Eric who shared this Equifax
update on the patreon community tab if
you are a patron share your favorite
security stories as well in
shout out a few on the show last week I
followed up on the Equifax story with
information detailing the contractual
agreement Equifax had made with the IRS
that would help verify taxpayer
identities for the agency the IRS the
IRS awarded Equifax the 7.2 million
dollar contract which is quite a bit of
money but since then the IRS has chosen
to suspend the contract instead and go
into a crucial review of the company
systems and security this news just
happens to happen right on the heels of
another Equifax security problem last
week where the Equifax website was
redirecting visitors to an adware
download of a malicious piece of
software called adware dotty arezzo
which would show you unwanted ads while
you browse the web in this case the
redirection alerted users of a new Adobe
Flash update but it was actually add
we're targeting visitors according to
security researchers this problem
occurred because of a malvert izing
campaign in which Equifax was hit due to
third-party code running on their
website the code was serving up the
malicious content
TransUnion was also affected and both
companies have removed the code that was
redirecting visitors now it's not
necessarily clear whether this malvert
izing campaign was the reason that the
IRS suspended their contract but given
how the last few weeks have turned out
for the credit reporting agency it would
not be surprising if this was one of the
many reasons and seriously at this point
I feel like I should create a drinking
game or a brand new show all about
Equifax hacks special thanks to corey
for the story in for his own comments on
it over on patreon first off a couple of
things that we need to understand before
delving into this story that he posted
number one public key cryptography it's
widely used for encryption and to prove
that a message indeed came from who it
says it came from and did not get
compromised during that transmission so
for example when party one like Darren
wants to send me an encrypted message he
would encrypt it with my public key and
his private key and then I would receive
that message and I would decrypt it with
my private key this encryption technique
has been used for years to encrypt email
to encrypt logins and even more and the
public key is just that it's public the
private key is my secret so nobody
is supposed to know that private key and
part to some countries and companies
around the world have used this
encryption technique for national
identity cards for software signing for
trusted platform modules or TPM for
short in a lot more different ways
the encryption passed rigorous tests
with the National Institute of Standards
and Technology in Common Criteria and is
used for government identification in
some places it is trusted now a flaw was
discovered by researchers who are
presenting their paper called the return
of coppersmiths attack practical
factorization of widely used RSA moduli
in November during the ACM conference on
computer and communication security and
the method for this flaw is not being
released until after that presentation
they discovered that an RSA library
version 1.0 2.0 1 3 developed by
Infineon can actually be reverse
engineered with just the public key a
little bit of money and some time
worst case scenario is basically that a
hacker uses Amazon Web Services 76
dollars and 45 minutes for a 1024 bit
key or forty thousand three hundred
dollars sounds like a lot and 17 days
for a 2048-bit key now if a
state-sponsored attacker needed to do
this that's actually not a lot of money
the keys have been generated since 2012
invulnerable Infineon RSA keys are
currently used by Estonia in Slovakia
for electronic identity cards at least
10 different laptop vendors using
Infineon TPMS and at least 237 github
submissions thousands of PGP keys used
to encrypt email and even at least 15
used in SCADA equipment that means
infrastructure in industrial equipment
it only affects smart cards or embedded
devices using the Infineon library for
RSA encryption now companies that have
implemented the Infineon key encryption
have already started using public
statements including yubico he uses
YouTube's F authentication which is
unaffected others unaffected include
open ssl RSA keys PGP compliant programs
elliptic curve cryptography and
RSA keys on ship RSA keys could be
affected in consumer devices so the
researchers created a tool where you can
simply copy and paste your public key to
see if it's factorizable and I have
included the link to that in the show
notes if you do use a key that is
vulnerable replace it as soon as
possible thank you again to all of the
fine people who contribute to
patreon.com/scishow excited about that
for this set as well as open up a live
video Q&amp;amp;A just for patrons each month
and it's each and every one of you
patrons so there's no limit I have also
