BitTorrent sync this segment is brought
to you by Full Sail University you guys
know I love my file-sharing services
especially when it has to do with
anything up in the cloud and today I got
a new one for you this one is called
BitTorrent sync so BitTorrent labs
recently released a file-sharing
application called BitTorrent sync it's
basically a competitor to Dropbox owned
cloud and sparkle share as well which
I've checked out pretty much all of
those in the past it is closed source
though so that's a really really major
con of this now was designed with
security and encryption in mind files
are transferred using AES 128 encryption
the session keys are generated using
perfect forward secrecy and the keys
which I'll get to in a moment are
randomly created using dev random for
Mac and Linux and crypto API for Windows
and of course files are transferred
securely but security must also be in
effect on each of your machines as well
because the files won't be saved in
there they'll be saved in their
unencrypted state basically now it does
work similar to Dropbox in that it syncs
one folder from one computer over to the
next pretty much seamlessly and it can
also be used via mobile as well which is
a definite perk syncing is really fast
it's really efficient and relatively
easy to set up as well now BitTorrent
sync runs on peer-to-peer protocol the
same protocol used by utorrent and
BitTorrent and it lets you transfer
really large files really really fast
now there's no central company server
all those files are just directly synced
between one PC and another there's
nothing going up there up in the clock
cloud for example in its cross-platform
you can use it on Windows you can use it
on Linux on Mac Android iOS I checked it
out on all of those and each one was a
little bit different but each one has
its perks so I'm gonna give you a little
bit of a demo of Windows Linux and I'm
also gonna mention a little bit about
using it on my phone as well to give you
an idea of what you can expect if you
want to check out a BitTorrent sync
yourself so let's go ahead and start
with my windows box
okay so I have BitTorrent sync pulled up
over here it's a very easy download it's
obviously a very nice
it's very simple to use basically what I
did is create a new file over here that
I wanted to sync called BitTorrent sync
I also created one called
BitTorrent sync Linux so that I could
make sure that my Linux box was syncing
correctly to my map my windows box as
well so if I open up this folder but
torrents sync I have this picture in
here of me and my friend Dale we're
singing having a good time so I just
wanted to make sure that this would
actually transfer over to other devices
when I set up syncing on my Linux box so
I have that file we're all ready to go
and then I went over here and decided to
create a new folder so you can add a
sync folder or you can remove down here
very easy if you want to add a folder
first thing you do is generate your
secret code so this secret code is what
you can share with your friends or
family or just with your other machine
for example if you want to you know
share that file amongst other people
other than yourself
so I generated a code and then folder to
sync I browsed and I chose the folder on
my desktop and it'll probably tell me
that it's already sinking it's like
folder and then I hit OK yeah folder has
already been added so once that folder
is added over here I can go ahead and go
to my other device and share with that
secret key on that device with my
windows box if that makes sense and then
hopefully I'll be able to get into my
files on Linux as well now on my Linux
box I also decided to create a
BitTorrent sync backup on there as well
I put a picture in there and I was
hoping that I could sync it to my
Windows box that is BT sync Linux so
under here I decided to sync this with
my Linux box I never downloaded this on
my Windows machine but there's a picture
of me trying to steal ice cream from my
brother
during his Air Force basic training that
was good times
I really liked that day it was quite
funny so it obviously downloaded just
fine on this machine the GUI is really
easy to use you can also see which
devices are syncing so snubs aspire
that's my Linux box it shows you
transfers if anything's happening the
history of file changes so everything
that's gone on today
you can also change your preferences so
you can have it start up when windows
starts blahdy blahdy blah so I'll go
ahead and cancel out of here and move on
to my Linux machine so this one gets a
little bit interesting and that it
actually runs in the background and runs
on the web so you have a web UI instead
of a GUI a front-end like you do on
Windows so in the background here I've
went ahead and started up bt sync which
I downloaded onto my desktop and then
over here on my local host which is on
my local machine in this very easy UI
I just went to my port 8 8 8 8 click
enter and hopefully it should connect
automatically to beat BitTorrent sync
which is running in the background so on
here you can see that I have a couple of
devices already connected so these are
two folders that I'm sharing from my
Windows Device device back to Linux now
if I wanted to add a new one I could
just go up here and click add folders so
it looks a little bit different so it
still asks you for a secret that you
will generate so I just generated one
and then it asks you for a path and this
path can be you know whichever folder
that you want it to be so if I want it
to be my home folder I'll click on that
and click Add aha folder is already
sinking so that's because I have a
folder from my desktop already sinking
onto this application
once you have that set up it'll show up
down here and it'll start syncing with
whatever machines you have shared that
secret code with so since I've already
shared it with my Windows box it's going
to try to sync whatever images I have
available on to my Linux machine so if I
open up my windows sync I should be able
to see there's that picture of me and
Dale hanging out and having a good time
singing together so cute so it works now
I also wanted to mention yes you can use
this on mobile as well you can send
files from Android to iOS or vice versa
with a QR code in the app and you can
also download a backup of your phone
onto your computer and you can view your
files from your computer onto your phone
so I downloaded this on my iPhone it's a
really simple app to use it's very very
easy and customizable if I open it on
here I can not only see the files that
are shared from my Linux machine right
now
because I generated a QR code on my
Linux machine to pick it up on my phone
there's also one last thing I wanted to
mention which is sending files back and
forth so that's basically sharing mobile
to mobile so earlier it Darrin had his
Android phone available he downloaded
the BitTorrent sync app which you must
have on each phone to be able to share
files back and forth you click on send
files or receive files if you choose to
receive files you'll take a picture of a
cute QR code it'll bring up BitTorrent
sync on your phone on the application
and then you should be able to see
whatever images or downloads that you
want to be able to view so I was able to
view a cute little picture me and my
little brother it works fine it's very
fluid but again this is a closed source
application now I do want to check out
one more it's called C file a lot of
people emailed me about that one I
haven't checked that out quite yet but
I'm thinking I might do that one next
week or the week after that so let me
know what you think and what your
concerns are about C file as well as
BitTorrent sync other than it being
closed source are there any other
concerns that you might have and coming
up soon we'll check out what's new in
that shop but first a quick break

goes well with these yeah so if you
didn't see my segment last week it was
really really fun and I basically took
Raspberry Pi and turn it into a
raspberry lap top yes
Raspberry Pi lap top these cables are
ridiculous I just love this it looks
like it you can do the same thing with
like an ankh 8:02 or any of those little
Android pcs or like I don't know your
phone we apply of these available yeah
just have a few but we stuck them up
there for you guys if you have a
Raspberry Pi at home and if you want to
have some fun with this we also have the
cable in the store so that you can
connect them with no problems I have
