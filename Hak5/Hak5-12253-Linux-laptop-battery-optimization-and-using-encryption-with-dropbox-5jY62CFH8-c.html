by domain.com
it's time once again check port 110 and
this week we have a couple of questions
the first ones from Nathan he says I've
been watching hak5 for over a year now I
love the show today i noticed that while
using Komodos secure dns i got a warning
page that prevented me from getting to
hack five org needless to say i changed
the dns settings on my computer just add
them for testing in the first place and
it fixed the problem hmm Thank You
Nathan for the donation I guess all I
can say is don't use eight dot 626 dot
5626 is your primary name server I I go
with eight eight eight eight or for the
fortitude to write what do you use let
us know if you're better talking about
that yeah well doesn't get that a lot
about that the first time Websense
mcafee is to do this or one of those you
should do that ipod cuz we're ah you'll
hacking so you know yeah so the newsroom
any gift okay come on come on come on so
your m says i usually download hack five
episodes via itunes and i watch them
offline is there a way to load threat
wire episodes via itunes IE is there an
RSS if not I I is there a hack or
something looking forward to following
another great show of yours okay your
fire there is a hack and the reason that
you're not getting a regular like itunes
RSS you know download an mp4 file or
whatever kind of podcast from throughout
wires because that show is specifically
what is it licensed by youtube through
discovery / revision3 for their youtube
channel stuff it is exclusive to YouTube
though so so that means I have an itunes
feed that said you can actually there's
a way to do this ah in fact RSS handler
is an awesome piece of code over at code
at google com they can get rid of their
BAM RSS handler right here and so what
this guy does is you run this locally
and then you feed it a URL for a youtube
channel that you want to have as a
podcast it downloads the mp4 files from
youtube and then just generates a local
RSS feed so you would subscribe to like
right like 12 720 does your at once
watch XML or whatever and if you go you
can actually find that there's a URL
that is at what is gdata youtube com yes
/ feed such API / users and then threat
wire my threat wire and what you want to
do is subscribe to favorites the
favorites there these specifies that
you're looking for the favorites at that
that's an account that favorites every
episode of threat wire otherwise you can
you could just subscribe to the RSS feed
for tech feed and then you get all of
the tech feeds stuff there's a pretty
good shows on there yeah in fact you
were just on mark Watson's talking okay
soldiers type battlefield yeah so there
you clone I'm getting a nexus 4 i'm so
excited are you gonna open to it I might
okay I I my dual boot that guy oh yeah I
don't know we should totally try it oh

me about this so he got a lung
transplant because he got the super rare
disease this pneumonia version that
usually kills off like eighty percent or
ninety percent of the people that get it
and luckily the only way you can get it
it's survived from this is to get a lung
transplant so you got the first one
turns out some of his nerves are
paralyzed and stuff from it so he has to
get the second one now and the problem
with that is their Medicare is running
out because we live in the United States
and well our health insurance is
