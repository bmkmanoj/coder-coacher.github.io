by domain.com oh that is so cool and so
since you just you understand the
protocol as the security researcher and
you just fill in the blanks and boom
it's been kismet ified mostly yeah
hopefully it's that simple the uber
tooth plugin uh so with with the
development kismet in the development /
tooth plugin you get all your 802 11 and
your Bluetooth in one network list it's
sortable you can view the details on it
all just as 11 list in the GUI so as a
project is it because like well you've
finished Wi-Fi it's like have you come
to a point in the development type of
glory you're like oh added every feature
as far as Wi-Fi is concerned and now
it's just like got a great architecture
for stuff that does RF or is there more
that you can do with Wi-Fi that's just
still on the list I think there's
definitely still more to do in Wi-Fi um
there's there's a lot of user interface
type things that could be done that
hopefully will now be simpler to simpler
to do we um trying to implement other
things with Wi-Fi tracking to wear it
like tracks time ranges so you can go
you know follow this client and tell me
every network you've observed them
connecting to and it tells you know they
connected this one for ten minutes this
one for ten minutes this one for five
minutes that kind of thing so hopefully
there'll be more idea centric stuff like
that or user user monitoring stuff and
so what brought you from Wi-Fi to zigbee
it's just another another thing um I
think a couple years ago someone asked
about hey what about zigbee and I went
what zigni yeah I pretty much I don't
know and the biggest stumbling block
since then is I don't have any signi mmm
like until recently I didn't even have
any real p caps of zigbee in the wild
that you could I could refer to so and
it's hard to go okay the spec says it's
got this but does it is this is this
like the uber tooth pack where a path
where it's like well why don't we audit
Bluetooth and it's like well do we have
anything that can snip that you know
is it like that yeah it's similar that
there's a lot of stuff out there that
could sniff zigbee but none of it was
easily reproducible for a lot of people
um so is it like kinda like goober to
the Bluetooth probably more like oh this
one specific manufacturer has a
bluetooth dongle that'll do this thing
and you can get these modes but not all
of them is is it like that kind of thing
it was a lot of that and then there's a
lot of the projects using it used like
Travis uses the tilos notes which you
can't get really any more like you can't
go out and buy them at least I haven't
been able to find them easily um his
recommendation at his talk at hope was
to contact professor and because they
were used heavily for research so you
can definitely get them that way but if
you don't have that access you can't and
then Josh was working on Josh Roy was
working on the the killer bee which uses
the atmel USB stick which is easy to get
but then you need a five-hundred-dollar
programmer and so your solution here is
the kids be you don't need a
five-hundred-dollar programmer no um so
the whole board is open source hardware
the software is open-source the farmers
open source the Android app is open
source the revision you're holding was
designed to be hand saw a hand in hand
soldered hand is soldered easily arm you
can do with a hot plate or if I mean
it's 0603 and bigger so if you're steady
enough and familiar with surface mount
and no 603 that's you're talking about
that's the size of these little
components and you're right they're not
they're not too big in fact I guess
you've gotten really good at soldering
he's I take it tell me about your
project it was this was his Kickstarter
or outside of that nope that was just I
put it together um I don't like
Kickstarter for this model because if
one of those chips becomes unavailable
and has a three month lead time which
almost happened to me I was actually
building a bunch of them for for shark
fest the wireshark conference and I got
ready to order them and it the the radio
chip was showing a late July lead time
you know that that's the other fun thing
when like suddenly you know there's more
and more hardware hacking going on like
us hackers learning like whoa what's
what's lead time what's an moq it's all
of these two
from you know things when it comes to
components but I mean at the same time
it's so like heartwarming because this
is like apple 2e kind of like all over
end but for hacking you know well I
guess I was hacking but you know I'm
sayin for like penetration testing and
stuff so what is what does this board
actually do I mean I get it's that it's
a zigbee radio what's the secret sauce
so it's zigbee on one end and then the
other end is USB and Bluetooth so you
can either talk it over USB or Bluetooth
or both some both simultaneously if you
really want arm so you can hook it up to
phones Android or the nokia 900 you
can't hook it up to an iphone
theoretically if you have a rooted
iphone and you could write a custom
Bluetooth app for it I haven't really
looked into it because I don't have an
iphone so yeah it kind of falls him to
don't care book yeah that scratch your
scratchers hack their own itches is what
I was trying to say actually that's a
that's kind of awesome and so with the
USB is that for like host mode to the
Android or do bluetooth to the Android
the main model would be bluetooth to
Android and then just a couple USB
battery pack to it okay to power the the
activity so the USB is just for battery
uh you can it'll talk a USB serial hmm
so you can hook it up to a PC and use it
that way you could hook it up to an
Android host mode there's no code to
support that I wouldn't necessarily do
it that way it's it's kind of clergy and
so I guess the point is you plug this
into your laptop or your battery power
it and hook it up to your android phone
and so is there like a kismet version
for Android that this interface is with
or what does have its own custom thing
right now right now it's got its own
custom thing where it does it's got a
map view and it'll do channel hopping
it'll do gps with the android and it'll
log log to the SD card and then you can
pull it off and turn those into p caps
okay so what I mean basically the thing
that you want to do with kismet you know
you in a search you want to capture you
want to then you know that becomes part
of the one of the first parts of your
process of you know then analyzing it
whether that being like a tea shark or a
wire shark or whatever you use I'm not
super familiar with zigbee as a protocol
I know that it's it's an i triple e
standard I know that it falls within 80
to dot something but can you explain to
me and the viewers that are already
familiar with Wi-Fi as we all know and
love how this relates to that and what
some of the subtle differences are like
like are there even channels like how
does it work so one thing is we keep
calling it a zigbee it's technically
what it that what the kids b will do is
80 2 dot 15 dot 4 which is the the
overarching standard and then unlike
with Wi-Fi where it's all 802 11 802 11
and Wi-Fi are equivalent yeah although
the Wi-Fi branding come well Wi-Fi is
just a trademarked term from the Wi-Fi
Alliance that means 802 11 pick a letter
at ba ng AC yeah and that's been
compliance tested but with 80 to 15 for
that's the base radio protocol and then
on top of that there is higher level
protocols so like zigbee is a
trademarked alliance of companies that
it's so zigbee then is like it's got a
mesh topology in a star topology and
it's it's it's kind of like tcp on top
of 802 11 or like or like mesh
networking Heather there can be like
subtle standards like WDS for instance
actually isn't a Wi-Fi certified or
Wi-Fi alliance certified standard and
yet it does kind of mesh networking is
stuff it are what is part of that are
like the management frames and control
frames handled by the 802 you know the I
Triple E side and then the vendor adds
their own kind of data grams over that
or what zigbee is super limited the
maximum packet size including framing
headers
you guys know how I feel about domain
names they're essential for showcasing
your portfolio your business or blog I
remember my first website it was on my
isp's geo com / my username and I don't
even remember it nobody's going to
remember that what we remember is calm
it's the best it's globally understood
and immediately lends credibility best
part is coms are totally affordable at
domain.com the whole hak5 crew are over
on domain com because they're the best
easy to use reliable they don't gouge or
annoy with ear revelant upsells plus you
