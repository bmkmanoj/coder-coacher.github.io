by Netflix
as you guys know before we end episode
episode 10 11 10 11 you know what that
means
it means we're in season 10 episode 11
give this binary it's another nibble oh
yeah I knew that yeah and then 1 and
then 0 and 1 1 that would be 8 plus 2
plus 1 that's that's 11 yeah you know at
one time I knew binary but not anymore
no this is fantastic you've got to
understand Chen and this is a last
binary episode for 50 years when we do
season 100 episode 1 and I'll put me
next week be like 78 years old oh wow
I'm not aging anymore so I'm good you're
a vampire might be watch my club you'll
understand I Club hey let's get
let's check port 110 oh yeah alright
let's do that email time Oh
Chad's email says I am running a jibon
wireless network through my place I have
a thing I have Comcast for my internet
my speed when tested at speedtest.net is
usually 30 megabytes down keep going and
12 megabytes up so here's the question
at what speed through my ISP do I top
out my G band if you go by the usual up
to 54 megabytes per second transfer data
transfer speed that that isn't that
still above my 30 megabytes per second
down speed why would I want to change it
up to an N network besides an newer
platform I have two computers one TiVo
series - but only Wireless G adapter and
a Roku box so am I really going to
notice any speed difference I was
looking at the Linksys e mm 8.8 ole 2.11
a B G and n but people say mixing
signals and routers kill speed and then
the 2.4 gigahertz 5 gigahertz signal I
don't care about since I don't have
anything that will run on 5 gigahertz so
what do you guys think huh and is my ISP
speed passed the Jeep and the buffet
yeah ok so I totally see what he's
saying here and that is you know he has
a mixed in lots of questions so he has a
lot of questions but they are all very
valid I mean 802 dot 11 n is the
new protocol it's yes it's up to a
hundred and something megabits per
second sign here it actually goes that
well you could I mean there's the new
Roku yeah it's got it um the problem is
if any of the devices on your network in
your 802 11 and at a hundred megabits
something aren't compatible yes now n is
backwards compatible with G but as soon
as a G shows up and then it drops down
the entire network yeah so what's the
point of you're right there's no point
for you to go to an 802 10 11 and
network unless you're going to replace
all of your gear and even then your
local speed on your Wi-Fi is going to be
faster than that that your ISP Comcast
is providing anyway I mean right now
with G you're theoretically getting 54
megabits per second which is still
faster in theory then the 30 megabits
per second that they're selling you and
test because you know they never get
that but true but there's a lot of
factors more than just the protocol to
consider here and we've talked about
this before with like you know what
routers we like you guys know that we
love mono wall smooth wall at any x86
router you can build not some little
plastic blue box you get from the big
box storming those things have like a
Dorito for a CPU so the same kind of
thing applies to your wireless access
point where you've got a beefy wireless
access point with like a real CPU that's
not going to be like you know dropping
tables every single time you have more
than 100 TCP connections to your
favorite BitTorrent server you know
you're resetting the router so there's
that to keep in mind of course now there
are new gaming routers where they do put
higher performance chips and stuff in
them but it's it's combination of all of
those things but I'll still say for you
there's no reason to upgrade to n yeah I
agree there is a lot of overhead that
also goes into this so we're talking in
the going checkout forget what exact
APUs owed number it is of hack tip
though but in the hack tip Wi-Fi series
where we go over all of the different
protocols and basically 802 dot 11b
while it has a theoretical max of like
11 megabits per second since it uses
this one method of protocol encoding
you'd be lucky to get like six really
yeah there's a lot of overhead that
involved so when they say rising it was
kind of like when you go to buy some car
stereo speakers and like 5000 watts and
it's like RMS 50 or something yep yeah I
agree
I actually ended up getting my mom a n
router just because I know she's not
going to update it for like 10 years so
I figured might as well get that now and
then I can you know over the course of
the next 10 years just upgrade all of
her yeah well it's kind of like
balancing your network when like okay so
you just built a new computer yes and
Keith's build a new computer so you guys
are like familiar with the whole you
need to balance your system you couldn't
have like a rock and CPU and a piece of
crap video card yes because one's going
to GIMP the other or vice versa the same
applies to your network it would make no
sense for you to have you know buy a 30
megabit connection from Comcast and have
a DOCSIS 1.0 modem from the 90s I know
your mom had that yesterday she did I
mean you hurt her modem with this she
had a frank drive on it right wipe the
dust off oh that's why yeah yeah so like
my the wireless access point I
accidentally left in my neighbor's house
down the street that I'm using my yagi
antenna to connect to is a Linksys weg
11b which is a very old I think that's
work until 99 it's a B Network so this
is why I'm tapping out I'm having out at
3 megabits per second on this thing and
it's because not only a check because
the administered was a dmin thanks
Linksys but their modem is like a doc
says 1 modem you can tell from the MAC
address and it's like oh yeah so it
doesn't even matter because if they got
it n network tomorrow they'd still have
a piece of crap modem and there would be
your bottleneck so it sounds like gee it
sounds like right now you actually have
a balanced enough I mean as long as
you're rockin like it I mean even 30
megabits adaxes 2 would do it
so as long as you know so that's what
I'm saying is unless you're looking to
replace all of your gear get a new 3.0
modem get a new end router and replace
your TiVo sure but that's not gonna
happen overnight and that's yn is
backwards compatible but just gets yeah
there you go the G thing stick with G
it's cheating I
right our second email comes from
blacktop he says or she says I have been
trying to use aircrack-ng from a virtual
environment where my Wi-Fi is eth0 so I
would like to buy a USB wireless adapter
I looked online and they are all pretty
cheap but the aircrack-ng compatibility
list might as well be in the Arabic and
tiger it type tigerdirect doesn't list
for more specs so are there any ideas on
this yeah absolutely
so you guys know I swear by the realtek
81 87 L chipset I'm gonna plug mine in
here and I don't know if Paul is going
to be able to get this but basically if
I had if config W land 7-up have that
guy plugged in to do it's not W and
seven if config W land eight up all
right
so w land 8 is my real tech 81 87 chip
and it's just a matter of airmon-ng
start wlan0 a new adapter here Mon zero
so I say arrow dump tak ng Mon zero
I'm not going to give any parameters but
suddenly our bayonet here if you will is
sniffing all of the stuff and we're
channel hopping and this is good right
and this is that it was that simple
because we're using a supported chipset
and I totally know your frustration
because I have been that guy that has
gone to Fry's or Micro Center or
whatever big-box store and you've got
like maybe like a wiki that says oh yes
the d-link DL 100 B seven has the chips
that you need
that'll work like an atheros or
something like that right and then you
get there you're like oh cool the d-link
100 b 7 and then it says revision 1.1
and you find out its Broadcom like I did
with this guy I'm serious I talked about
know how the a block how I replace the
chassis by just getting a new one turns
out there was a difference even in the
same model and there was absolutely no
indication on the website really
anywhere that they changed this so when
I swapped computers
not only did have to swap the hard drive
but the atheros chip that I know and
love yeah this replaced with a Broadcom
because it was probably five cents
cheaper that week when Acer made them
thanks Acer you know so yeah I will put
that out there I feel your pain you
would be hard-pressed to find an 81 87 L
that doesn't love any Linux distro
that's modern and in even Windows you
will find problems with Mac the latest
version of OS 10 isn't going to like it
um and all the older ones do and it
isn't going to do like we were just
talking about N and G it's not going to
do n there are a couple of n chips and
we're actually looking up I have a whole
bunch on order then playing with the
thing is you want something universally
supported and the the 81 87 L is so if
you go to the aircrack-ng wiki you'll
actually find a list of compatible hard
where that happens to be the one that I
like and full disclosure we do sell that
one in the hack shop but I've been
rocking this if you look at the show
I've been rocking this chip the last six
years guess it's just kind of the one
you know it's the one you have to have
it yeah it's bad well that's the one
that is like you know all it when all of
the tutorials reference that one ship
yeah are you gonna do that uphill battle
of trying to get some other chip to work
cuz I've done I've done a Rowling take
too much 939 T or 37d and it's like
alright I'd rather play video games but
it'll give you fun we should play some
video games we're getting tired we
should but first we have a cup one more
email oh great we do
okay so this one comes from Jake he asks
with err spoof I was wondering what
happens to the IP forward variable after
you are done sniffing I would assume you
would just set it back to zero but what
happens if you leave it at one sure so
the filing question that he's talking
about actually here el cata it's a /proc
slash sis slash net slash ipv4 / IP
underscore forward and you'll see here
that it's set to a one and if I wanted
to I can just like echo one into it and
now it's a one and what does that mean
that just means simply that I can now
forward packets from one interface or
another it's kind of like it's one
element of the IP tables things that
you're going to need to do to do like
basically internet connection sharing
this is what I do when like I set up a
pineapple and I want clients connected
to pineapple to get on the internet
through like my 3G modem or something on
my laptop like that if you don't set it
back to zero and of course this is what
you would do in a man-in-the-middle
attack where I've told you I'm Paul and
I've sold Paul out on you I would want
to enable forwarding yes otherwise I'm
like hey Paul I'm Shannon you want to
tell her a secret cool what's a secret
and then I don't tell you yeah what fun
is that you know so if you don't set it
back it's just gonna chill that way
probably until your next reboot you know
depending on your network setup it's
probably not gonna cause that many
problems as well it doesn't really hurt
anything you might want to set it back a
lot of programs are automatically do
okay so yeah they're pretty simple cool
yeah that's it for the emails
tuned because we'll be right back with
