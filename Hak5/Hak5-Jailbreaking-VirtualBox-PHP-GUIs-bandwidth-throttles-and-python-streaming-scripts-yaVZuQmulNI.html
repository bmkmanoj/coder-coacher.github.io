front ends tweaking our untangle router
streaming music with a little Python
code detecting bandwidth throttles and a
lot more on today's show this episode of
hak5 is brought to you by dime
incorporated got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain calm
and go to assist express hello and
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen I'm Shannon Morse Shannon that's
so weird you've got the same background
as me in Missouri oh yeah I guess I too
oh wait a second uh-uh you're real I
really flesh awesome we are we are like
a native today sniping up a little bit
of studio space and guess nowhere and
it's so good to see you too yeah it's
awesome to be out here I lost another 7
episode 26 you know that means last
episode of the season Oh what an epic
season it was you get so much so much in
this great show kicking it old school
but let's just right off the bat in the
a block we've been getting a lot of
emails about people want to see the
jailbreaking yeah yeah yeah or you want
to do this lifetime okay here you could
do a live to tape Jeremy and really I'm
kind of scared about this I really don't
want to brick my phone but everybody's
like oh so easy you don't have to worry
about it and I did I did back up my
phone before I came out here so
hopefully I don't screw it up you're
gonna go to one of these cameras and
show it off because that would make the
most sense a little production all right
in the middle of a block live dude
that's a holla I'll go up to my number
here okay echoes so what do we what do
we have to do to jailbreak now because I
heard it is super easy yeah it is you
just have to go to jailbreakme.com on
your phone press go and it automatically
brings you up to this jailbreakme tells
you who it's by and it tells you you can
get tweaks and apps that apple
doesn't allow in their app stores so
it's just like any of the other old
jailbreaks except this one is apparently
super simple I just have to slide this
across and it starts downloading which
might take a while depending on your
download speed so now it's telling me to
sit tight and this is part of the
waiting game this is all right wait now
that is super easy and the Library of
Congress has made it legit now making
DMV exemptions that says it's crazy
exciting for everybody who wants to
jailbreak the phone well I mean we could
always jailbreak it before but now
there's no repercussions if you're not
going to go to jail or but there has
been some new news about this Apple
jailbreak you know Apple has heard about
this so they came back and said well if
you do this it's going to void your
warranty and if you want to send it in
we're not going to fix it for free and
then they also said that they are
working on the security flaw in Safari
which lets you be able to do this in the
first place you got to think about this
what you basically done is you've just
gone to a website hit a button and now
it's like adding some stuff to your
operating I'm a basic this is this is
kind of scary to think about yeah you're
installing a rootkit especially or your
willfully and selling ok I mean not that
it's malicious but any other website
could use the same technique yes to take
over you essentially it's it's a big
security flaw and they do need to fix it
but right now it's awesome well for good
so you know i'm gonna get cydia which is
great so whatever use cydia gives you
everything like you can let's see you
can change your ringtones mms tones
email email tones create cool things
like that there's also apparently a free
tethering app i love that is very useful
because you do get charged for tethering
over like 80 you do have to have to keep
in mind how much data you are using if
you don't have an unlimited data thing
I'm unlimited up 22 gigs of course ok so
didn't you have sitting on your previous
iphone you're like so what was it the
silverback was excellent yes my
silverback gorilla 2g iphone it was
scary this also lets you install apps
that haven't been allowed by the apple
store of course for some reason or
another it might be for you know the
free
for example this did have a couple of
problems when it first came out that you
should keep in mind mms and facetime
didn't work at first but the creators of
the jailbreakme com they did fix this
apparently I'm going to test it out to
you to make sure walk on all right yes I
need to fix it so apparently there's no
bones with it is the most dead simple
hack in fact I'm just going to go ahead
and give you the hak5 award for the
easiest hack ever demonstrated live to
tape because I mean really that makes
Condit look complicated okay so it says
cydia has been added to the home screen
have fun and I'll show the camera this
yeah sweet that's it wow that is dead
simple talking about dead simple we also
have some really cool segments for you
guys this week we're kicking it
old-school doing some stuff with
streaming media using virtual machines
and Linux and some Python and doing it
the the old-school hacker way because we
can because the long way is more fun you
know take the scenic route why not and
then you've got some fun stuff coming up
right in Stubbs reports I do I have this
way of bandwidth testing apparently like
I have lots of problems when i'm
downloading podcasts / you know the
apple store or the web sites themselves
or maybe even BitTorrent where suddenly
my internet slows down to like a
standstill well your internet is in
missouri and and that that's the best
thing we should address here in the last
episode of the seventh season to think
that we've started this season in a
studio in virginia and here we are in a
studio in san francisco so i got to
thank everybody for sticking around
season 7 i know it sounds such a huge
transition but but yeah i'm so stoked
for susan ate meat amp we have some
really cool stuff in store and i hope to
get you in studio a lot more it seems to
work i love coming out here and doing
segments in studio instead of like in my
living room yeah and it looks like we
might be putting together some some
better kinda instead of you know
borrowing stealing anything other
people's studio stuff so yeah yeah yeah
so stick around great stuff coming up
but first let's go ahead
and thank one of our excellent sponsors
taken by registering domain names in
shelton we get only grated isthmus you
were too busy talking Jesus about
anything in the shower then forget the
weaksauce remains get dusty lower sugar
I mix the shizzle dude great idea and
great domain please this is long right
that's right Co domains are now live the
biggest domain sense calm and you can
get them now over at domain.com and
while you're there check out their
virtual private servers they provide
unrestricted root access on Windows or
Linux they're easy to manage with cpanel
in class key and they're capable of
hosting just about any size website you
may have even heard our very own hak5
org is pimped out on a domain com VPS no
matter where you are you're next idea
remember domain com is the place to save
fifteen percent off at checkout with
coupon code hak5 got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com I
don't know about you guys but when it
comes to riding the twisties on a
gorgeous day you need the perfect
playlist and that may change from day to
day and with only 16 gigs internally on
my phone my mp3 player of choice just
not cutting it I mean I know their
services like Pandora and last.fm but
that's just not doing it for me and
while there's other services like orb or
something see important emails already
that could allow me to potentially get
at my hundred gigs of mp3s back home
that's knowing near as fun as setting up
a linux server with some PHP on our
virtual machine mounted on the wall of
me yes so let's just get up and put
together a sweet little home brew system
so that we can access our media from
anywhere now as you guys know from
episode 7 17 we put together a really
freaking sweet wall-mounted VirtualBox
server and let's go ahead and put it to
some more use but first a little
re-engineering because you know it
wouldn't be hak5 without
doing everything now last time we got
into this we were using the VirtualBox
web console and while it's very cool and
I think add a lot of potential it hasn't
really developed much since we last
spoke about it but what has is PHP
VirtualBox PHP being my favorite
language let's go ahead and try it out I
actually have it right here I'm VN seed
into the virtual box and you can
actually pick up yourself a copy of the
PHP VirtualBox over at code google com /
PHP VirtualBox it's really freaking
polished so grab yourself a copy and it
really just relies on the built-in web
server that comes with virtualbox so on
Linux that's a vbox web server in right
there user bin I think and to initiate
that really you just need to go in and
and give it a tack be and then tak tak
your log file wherever you want to
specify that too if you're not just
going to dev null but if you're
VirtualBox web server that comes with
virtualbox is up and running it's going
to make using I mean that will you have
to have it but once you have that going
PHP VirtualBox is a breeze to set up so
if you don't already have on your you
know on your virtual machine server here
running late boon to apache and PHP go
ahead and grab those simple apt-get
install apache2 and lib apache to tak
mod tak php5 there's a million other
ways to do that you could probably just
type in the lamp and get yourself a nice
little linux apache my sequel and PHP
stack but regardless with those two
things set up configuring PHP VirtualBox
is nothing more than checking out the
configuration file here in slash var
slash ww or whatever your w root is you
copy over the package in my case I've
put it in PHP v box and we want to take
a look at the config PHP file so this
right here is where we just pretty much
need to configure the username and the
password and the location
everything else is pretty standard so
I've set that up right here and that's
it so all we have to do now is browse to
it and if I hit it on the localhost
you'll see that here we go we have it
running so let's actually hit it
externally 10 1337 165 /p HPV box and
there you go it should look very
familiar it looks so much like the
natural interface on the the desktop
side and we can take a look and see all
of the stats on our server we can create
a new server I actually already have two
running here but let me show you how
similar it is to the desktop counterpart
so we click new I'm going to make a new
server here you next we're going to call
it I don't know our test server it's
going to be linux debian wahoo next give
it 384 Meg's ram share and we're going
to create a new hard drive for it I mean
have you noticed all I'm doing is
clicking next this is so easy next yes
we want it dynamically expanding okay
we're going to give it an eight gig hard
drive now we'll bump that up to a 36
there we go and finish finish again and
we now have a test server we cloak over
the here we see all of the settings and
we can go ahead and this is what makes
really neat you'll see this console
right now it's not running an rdp
connection at the moment but we can go
ahead and enable that by going over on
the details page to click rdp console
here and here's the settings dialog very
similar to what you would find in the
desktop counterpart we click on remote
display we can enable the server now by
default it wants to be 3389 which is the
default port for remote desktop protocol
but you can't have all of your servers
on 3389 so I've already got one on 3389
3390 i'm going to go 3391 we can also if
we wanted to in here i'll just do what I
normally do come down to network and
instead of Matt I want it to be bridged
personal preference its way I like to do
it and if we wanted to set up any USB or
any additional storage I will actually
come in here to the cd-rom
and you see on my IDE chain I've got
empty well I can go ahead and click here
and I have a drop-down of all of my I
so's and then I can just pop over to
here and if I wanted to add an iso i
could click add and then give it the
location of a file that I could you know
boot off of I'm so I've already got it
set up with what i want i believe i'm
just going to go with ubuntu 10.4 and ok
and there we go if I click on where it
says 3391 it's going to go ahead and
download a file here where it says test
server this right here is a already set
up ready to go rdp file that's going to
allow you to connect from whatever RDP
client you have whether it be windows
mac linux and make it so super easy so
you know you don't even need to come
into this web interface but for when you
need to manage it and the rdp is one of
the things that i absolutely love about
virtual box so with that I'll set up
let's go ahead and hit start the machine
is booting up I'll click over to the
console tab and do it in the web will
click connect we've got this built right
into the little web interface we say hey
look at that booting ubuntu and from
here I could just go ahead and walk
through the installation but I've got
turkey already in the oven I figure
let's just go ahead and move on because
you don't need to watch me set up an
ubuntu box but we do have one with music
and everything already running so the
mp3 server I'll connect to the console
over here and login
and there we go we're on a virtual
machine on our server ready to set it up
as a service to stream us some mp3s now
there's one thing that I am going to go
ahead and do this going to make our life
a lot easier here and that is to set it
up with a static IP address by default
it's just going to be DHCP it's going to
grab whatever IP it can from our
untangle server upstairs and that's fine
for when we r you know testing this out
and whatnot but when I want to actually
deploy this and be able to hit it I
don't want it to reboot get a different
IP address so I'm just going to do it
the GUI way why not so we're going to go
to System Preferences and network
connections you'll see that we have our
Ethernet 0 and click Edit and I've
already set this up for a static IP
address so under IP version 4 you'll see
that I've given it an address down here
and it's really just a matter of instead
of it being dhp CP here clicking manual
double clicking into these fields and
specifying the information at once if
you don't know what to put in there you
could just go ahead and pull up a
terminal run ifconfig and there you go
it tells you right here what your IP
address is what the broadcast is and and
you just give it that information here
in the GUI and you're all set you could
also do that with ifconfig it's just you
know preference so with it set up with
the static IP address and i've already
got it loaded up with some music really
it's just a matter of setting up some
really sweet Python scripts a little bit
of port forwarding and some awesome
stuff that's going to make it easy for
us to access it from anywhere but first
I want to take a quick break and thank

click on dinette to learn more all right
so so far we've got a brand new bunting
machine running on our wall mounted
virtual server here and it's set up with
a static IP address we've copied our
music over to it and we're going to do
some freaking sweet stuff with Python
that's going to allow us to access our
music from anywhere like our phone but
to enable us to actually hit that server
we are going to need to do two things
that is port forward and we're going to
have to set up some sort of DNS thing
that's going to allow us to be able to
easily get to our home computer even if
our cable modems IP address were to
change so as you remember we've set up
untangle so I'm going to go ahead and
log into that and from untangle I'm
going to click config and then
networking so the first place I'm going
to go in networking is host name because
untangle built right in like many other
routers do have the ability to update
whatever your dynamic dns service is now
of course i'm using dime dns here so i'm
going to check this box here and i'm
going to go ahead and enter in my login
credentials and the hostname that I want
this to be now this is essentially going
to allow us to have a fixed hostname or
a DNS name for our home server even if
our cable modem were to reboot and get a
different IP address from our internet
service provider so that's going to save
us if I'm really needing to rock out to
some Duran Duran and it's changed the IP
address that would totally ruin my day
we don't want that to happen so with
that setup let's also come over here to
port forwards so I'm going to create a
new port forward and I'm going to call
it mp3 server and the protocol is going
to be TCP and the port number will
choose other here is going to be 80 80
it's a web server that's going to be
running with Python
it's going to allow us access our mp3s
the listening IP address is going to be
10 13 37 46 that's the IP address of the
virtual machine that we just created so
I'll hit OK and there we go we not only
have reports forwarding and our dynamic
dns but we are ready to move on back
over to our virtual machine here so from
PHP VirtualBox I'm connected to our mp3
server and let's take a look at Edna
Edna is the special sauce that it's
going to make all of this awesome so you
can grab yourself a copy of Edna over at
Edna da sourceforge net and it is such a
simple way to access your media that I
know you could probably just throw a
bunch of mp3s on an Apache server and do
a directory listing but this takes it
one step further allowing you to
dynamically generate m3u files or
playlist files so I can go into a
directory and say give me a playlist
that will use these mp3s as a network
resource so then on my droid I'm like
dude I want to listen to you know
something awesome i said Duran Duran
earlier i'm going to totally redeem
myself and say orgy candy ass and I'm
boom it would just give me an m3 you
file so I could like go through and you
know play stitches and blue monday and
i'm dating myself but awesome right so
it also allows us to do templates which
is going to come into play with the
smartphone a little later so suffice it
to say grab yourself a copy at edna at
sourceforge net and over here in my
virtual box i'm just going to pop over
to my edna directory this is a super
super simple thing to configure so if
you're a nano guy like myself you would
type nano attack w edna calm and we'll
have to go ahead and tweak what the port
is obviously we've set it up for 80 80
so we'll leave that as it is and then we
can tell it where the directory where a
template is or our resources which are
the icon files and we can come down here
and if we wanted to we could set up
authentication so you would have to
login and as it is right now out of the
box just with it configured on a DAT and
pointing it towards our music in slash
home slash user slash music we are going
to be good to go so I'm going to quit
out of this and starting Edna since it
is Python just a matter of running it we
do need to make sure that we have Python
version 1.5 or higher so python tactic
version yeah I think we're quite a while
past 1.5 so Python Edna dot PHP it's our
PHP py there we go Darren py so if I
come over to my smartphone in my browser
here I'm going to take a look at it
already bookmarked it dude check that
out they'll chase did toten hosen good
stuff let's put a little little Dale
chase limit break his new album it's
really good and I got to say one of my
favorites off this new album is who's
your doctor if you are a doctor who fan
you have to check this out so it's
connecting there we go now awesome i
love this so there we go tying together
a whole bunch of different services to
put together a homebrew way to listen to
our music from anywhere and you could do
so much more with this these techniques
we've used before but it's very cool to
just go ahead and tie them all together
because while there are services like
Orban whatnot which will do it off the
shelf you have way more fun getting in
deep with the python and tweaking this
let me talk about tweaking this for a
second will it turn this down Edna is
really neat that it uses template files
you see that unlike zooming in on the
web page to make it look right on my
droid because it's kind of made for like
a desktop well if i head over to the
templates directory here you'll see that
we have a bunch of different templates
that really i've already copied one over
to Darren egt and if I come into that
it's simply HTML and every now and then
there will be a reference here that that
it fills in the gaps so you could go
ahead and tweak this to your heart's
content to make it look perfect on your
device so there you go a lot of stuff
there but I want you to go ahead and let
me know what you think of segments like
and if you have questions or comments
you can hit us up feedback at hak5 org
or find more details in the show notes
so get this you're doing a whole bunch
of downloading of your favorite podcasts
you got your audio podcast and your
video podcast and you're getting set in
the morning ready to go off to work and
listen to all your favorite podcasts in
the morning and it's on your high speed
connection so you know it's going to get
done in time and then all of a sudden
everything just seems to come to a halt
and you look at your downloads and they
say that they're going to take a day
what the frig is that that's not cool
and the first thing you think is oh my
god my isp they must be throttling me
because they think that I'm trying to
download some torn or something instead
of a podcast not cool and what really
ticks me off is when the man takes
advantage of us little guys trying to
download our podcasts and uses up all
that power to throttle us but there is a
way to figure out if this really is
what's going on or if you just have a
crappy internet connection so the first
thing I found was M labs over at Google
uses all these different kind of tests
to monitor their performance or your
computer's performance you guys are
dirty don't think like that and it'll do
everything from like a regular speed
test to a bittorrent specific test where
if you're running BitTorrent it's going
to see if that will slow down your
internet also I found this thing called
the Switzerland method method which is
by the electronic frontier foundation so
we know it's good the Switzerland method
will detect any modified packets that
are traveling over your internets which
can mean anything from throttling going
on to may be blocking of your download
traffic so I went ahead and checked out
these different kind of tests go over to
measurement lab net and click on test
your internet connection choose the
first one the network diagnostic tool
and click on start this test is going to
test your internet connection speed and
anything that slows it down it only
takes about 20 seconds so go ahead and
relax once it's finished click
statistics to see a detailed guide of
your network traffic and how it may be
limited next run the glasnost test this
test is going to look for traffic
shaping when you're using such things as
flash video or a bit torrent now this
one does take a lot longer it takes
eight minutes so go ahead and relax and
you know grab a cup of coffee or
whatever you need to do also make sure
any downloads you have going in the
background are paused for the moment
because it'll give you a much much
better statistic once once it's done the
MPD test is going to find and diagnose
any problems in your end machine that
have to do with network performance run
this one and it'll send and receive data
and then i will show you any problems
that you have in red i have a lot of
problems on my machine paslode to is a
band wit test that's going to find out
what your available bandwidth is for
this test you must download the exe and
run the test the last test through em
labs a sheep or probe a traffic shaping
test it's going to tell you if your ISP
is traffic shaping when you upload
download or both and then it'll also
tell you the max burst size before
shaping begins you also have to download
the exe for this test as well so click
start and wait for the test to finish
and then the next one I found was the
Switzerland test download the tgz or the
dot zip over at sourceforge extract the
files from the folder and read the
install txt for information on how to
install it on your specific platform
okay so according to these tests I'm not
being throttled I'm kind of sad about
that for some really weird reason I just
have a really crappy internet connection
out here in Missouri so I guess it would
be a lot cooler if I could call them up
and be like hey dude I want a faster
internet connection your throttle Amy
and then they'd be like okay and give me
faster internet connection but yeah
anyway tangent whoo email me over at
feedback at hacc cyborg about what you
think of these and if you use any other
certain kind of test to find out if
you're being throttled it's a very
touchy subject I know and we will be
