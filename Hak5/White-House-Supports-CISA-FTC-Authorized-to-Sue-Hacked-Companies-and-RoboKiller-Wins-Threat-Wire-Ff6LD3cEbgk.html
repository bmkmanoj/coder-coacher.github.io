cybersecurity bill the FTC can now sue
companies for getting hacked and robo
calls are being blocked by a robo killer
all coming up now on threat wire hello
world I'm Shannon Morse and this is
threat wire for August 26 2015 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom let's take
a breather from the ongoing Ashley
Madison hacks today and discuss some
other details that are surfacing about
other privacy threats because y'all know
everybody is already reporting on the
hashtag am but what is happening in DC
if you haven't heard of the sysop bill
yet you probably will this bill is
making its rounds in Washington DC it
stands for the cybersecurity information
sharing act and would allow for
companies to funnel threat intelligence
information to many different government
agencies this kind of intelligence
gathering is currently operated by the
Department of Homeland Security so
opening it up could be problematic
another problem with the bill which the
eff pointed out is that it has no
provisions to remove unrelated personal
info before sharing the data with the
government which means if your cell
phone provider wanted to or needed to
share data with the government branch of
their choosing they would be able to in
send all your personal data along with
it in a letter from the DHS to the
Senate quote the authorization to share
cyber threat indicators in defensive
measures with any other entity or the
federal government notwithstanding on
any other provision of law could sweep
away important privacy protections
particularly the provisions in the
stored Communications Act limiting the
disclosure of the content of electronic
communications to the government by
certain providers who the White House
has now given its approval to the bill
and Congress's recess is coming to an
end after Labor Day so we're pretty much
sure that we're going to hear more about
this bill in the next coming weeks as of
Monday the FTC nail has full authority
to sue companies for getting hacked a US
appellate court ruled as such
specifically for the case against
wyndham hotels who from 2008 to 2009 had
more
than 600,000 customers data leaked from
their servers the Federal Trade
Commission AK the FTC would have to
determine if the breach was due to
unfair or deceptive business practices
this brings a critical component to the
consequences of not securing a network
properly and promising privacy to
customers when that privacy really isn't
there wyndham hotels is continuing their
court battle and if Windham does lose
they may not have to pay a fine but
would most likely have to go under the
data protection scrutiny of the FTC for
many years with fines as an option for
violations and lastly in another story
involving the FTC is a new technology
coined Robo killer back at Def Con the
FTC held a competition called robocalls
humanity strikes back in their aim to
block robo calls from telemarketers and
spammers one app called Robo killer
stuck out as in its ability to detect
and analyze robo calls and its ability
to add them to a spam bucket the
creators 125 thousand dollars for the
application and to fund the creation in
research of the technology and the
application a Kickstarter campaign is
currently in process now of course we
love featuring your comments so if you
have any thoughts on today's stories
leave me a note below so here's a
question for you what are your thoughts
on the FTC being able to sue companies
for data breaches do you think that it's
a great thing for a government to do or
do you think that it's stretching that
hand a little bit too far yeah that's a
good one now check out our patreon
