Jen cutter joined us for little Nintendo
DSi XL hacking Rubik's is in the house
with Metasploit 101 Shannon has a killer
tool for your next PC build and none
other than plain old foes oh yeah I'm
dinner kitchen you're watching hack 5
already
this episode of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain calm
go to assist Express and click it or
ticket today guys we have the pleasure
being joined by none other than pro no
bozo himself prana bozo thank you so
much for having us can I call you pro no
well you've got so many great toys here
maybe you could tell us a little bit
about what this equipment does how it
makes them musically what's your
favorite bit of kit ok well what about
this guy here is this analog well that's
I mean that's what I think because it's
got like the knobs and stuff so yeah so
let's talk about your new album hack
wave just finished it a while ago that
must be a great feeling to have that
complete it goes out there and you
listen to that back I don't know how
does that make you feel
know that that's not disturbing at all
Thanks so is there like a like a mrs.

this week's trivia question is
originally running on the pdp-11 and
incorporating elements from bsd this
closed source version of unix was
licensed to manufacturers by Microsoft
yes Microsoft in 1980 enter for your
chance to win a premium deluxe edition
authentic and it made a gift free
creation or some brand new killer hack 5
stickers your choice and good luck I'd
like to thank one of our sponsors today
I'm registering the Nomad monkey calm
and setting up a blog to highlight the
adventures of this plush primate as a
motorcycle across North America and as
you know I am a big fan of domain.com
slow prices and quality service they
really are the easy and affordable way
to get your site online so with my site
registered and deluxe hosting plan setup
I've head over to the hosting control
panel under the my services tab here I
find the application vault where I can
get one click installs of popular open
source software
there's plenty available from blogging
to collaboration galleries and
e-commerce wiki's and more I'm fond of
WordPress so I'll select it and click
install and choose the domain and select
my options like the install URL and
password next finish and there you go my
blogs online and any application vault
software cannot only be installed but
also upgraded in a similar fashion
taking the headache out of platform
management and best of all you can
experience the fastest and solid hosting
of domain.com while getting 15% off at
checkout when you use coupon code make a
5 got a great idea it all starts with a
great domain domain com
all right it's makeup time you guys sent
me all kinds of hate mail saying hey
your stuff didn't work or you did it
wrong or you didn't actually show it
well this is makeup time right now I got
an enterprise set up 80 is only allowed
out 80 and 443 is only allowed out
through the firewall there's only
there's a DMZ you have to that's the
only thing you can hit I have the SQL
server behind the firewall like I had
before the web server on the DMZ the
client host with the domain and logged
in and the domain controller oh just
like you'd have in an enterprise it's
all patched by the way so there are no
remote exploits that I'm aware of on
these windows side I don't have Adobe
installed haha joke there anyways so
we're gonna kick it off with so some
basic sequel injection now this is a pen
test type scenario so I'm trying to slam
a hole pen test week days year long pen
test into like six minutes so I'm gonna
go fast I'm not going to show you is SQL
injection I'm just going to show you the
cool tool SQL ninja so SQL ninja takes a
configuration file for its stuff it's a
really easy you look through it it's all
documented
so I'm just gonna go and hit it after
for the config file M for the mode you
want to hit we're gonna test to see if
sequel injection is there cool let's
rock we hit it
we're gonna hit a Metasploit module now
first sequel ninja has a caveat it does
it executes the payload it pushes a
binary and executes the payload before
it runs multi handler before it runs the
Metasploit handler if you're doing a
minute split payload and that's not the
best way to do things because the the
payload will timeout before it gets a
chance to start the handler so you're
kind of in a race condition there so
what I like to do is actually start MSF
console first also because I like having
control
cecal ninja runs MSFC oh i which has a
much more limited set of tools that you
can or or like things that you can do
you can't background you can't back
around MSFC a lie you can't well let me
take that back there are probably ways
to do things but I don't know them at
the current point in time so let's just
start wealth with MSF console now I'm
made of a lot of resource files resource
files are are simply step by step like
do this then this then this it's
basically a bash script for mass weight
HD put a HD more the creative Menace
weight put out an awesome post about how
to do Ruby scripting in in resource
files but this is the only ones that I'm
using you know other really big are
really basic step by step know Ruby
involved so my first resource file is to
get the multi handler ready for the
sequel ninja payload to do so that's
resource temp and our first one is
handler alright as you can see it starts
up the reverse HTTP hit payload went to
handler it says exit on session to false
because we don't want it stopping after
we get our first meterpreter session
because we want more all right then 135
our localhost local port 4 for 3 like I
said only thing allowed out and the
great thing about this is since the
sequel server and the web server are
disjointed they're not on the same box
I'm actually getting inside the DMZ via
a sequel injection problem in the web
server so I'm stepping through it and
then coming right back out now now that
that's running I'm gonna do my sequel
ninja whoa now I've edited sequel ninja
a bit so that it says reverse HTTP
instead of perversity TCP this is
because of protocol analyzers a lot of a
lot of enterprise networks these days
have protocol analyzers on their
firewall and says if this does not look
like HTTP drop it on port 80 if this
does not look like HTTP
drop it on four four four three so we
get around that using universe HTTP
payload now sequel danger doesn't have
it by default but it's Perl you change
two lines of this thing and you now have
the correct payload you want to use for
this tell it the reverse HTTP tell it
the port we get it going now this takes
a bit because what it's doing is
actually pushing via sequel queries via
the sequel injection about 64 to a
thousand bits of data and I'm not
exactly sure how much but per query it
has to do all these queries and it has
to wait for the responses and then it
has to check them so this takes a while
and even on my local box it's gonna take
a while so in sequel ninja o25 just got
released it's 10 times faster but still
slow so be patient it'll get there just
sticking the cool thing about it is it
writes the a file called a scr or
screensaver you all know what that is
and then it changes it to an executable
and runs it which is just awesome
so we're done cool let's hurry up trying
to get all this in trying to get domain
controller all in one hit here we go
converting script executable let's go
ninja transferring control now it's
saying transferring control to msf CLI
and it's trying to bind to the port 0 4
4 3 but as you can see on the other
other console
we already got a session this is because
it actually cuted the the payload before
it started MSC oh hi now a little quirk
in the and when Perl you probably can
fix it yourself but this is how I got it
done so we have our first session cool
I'm not gonna even go in there don't
have a need because I already know what
what the local IP range is 10
Network now you can do that easily by
going into my server and typing ipconfig
not an issue you can see the local
network and start doing enumeration I'm
trying to condense this in so I have my
resources files already set up now PS
exec I already told you guys about this
one what I did on this session would I
hash dumped found a local workstation
that I wanted to target it and got the
IP and the hash so I'm gonna hopefully
have I know hopefully have the
administrator password the same thing on
all the boxes now this is very common in
enterprise networks where they have a
local admin the exact same password
across the board it's a really difficult
one but hashes don't care still a
big-ass hash excuse my language
let's kick it ah maybe not let's kick it
now bada bing bada boom it's running and
as soon as it says uploading payload you
know you're good so the cool thing about
this one is that we now have meterpreter
payload or motor procession on a
workstation these workstation is more
likely to have someone logged in
probably an admin of some sort you know
kind of the tens of thousands of
workstations you might actually have to
look around for a little work domain
admin but if there are all workstations
with the same administrator password you
should be good so this takes a second to
go alright we've officially passed the
hash we used the hash for the
administrator password and we're on the
second one sessions I - alright next is
token passing to do that to find out
what tokens you have available you use
incognito incognito is a module that
attaches our DLL and patches on to mice
or Peter just like Prive and standard
i/o or STD api standard api these all
are the the modularity pieces of
surfer so in the modular Metasploit in
the modular Palin set stagers there's
also modularity there so this thing is
miscible it's gigantic and its really
great how they put it up so incognito
back to it it's real simple list tokens
is the command you can find out more by
just doing a question mark and hitting
Enter
attack you for users I probably said
list tokens there we go we can see that
contest so jeido is logged in so in
purse impersonate token now you have to
do the double slash because it's Ruby
crazy stuff cool now we are Jane Doe I'm
gonna assume you did some research and
looked around and found out that their
domain admin by some easy neck commands
next I'm going to I'm going to drop to a
shell now you can do that with ex shell
let's see if she'll has options
oops it still worked I don't know if it
uses token so I'm not sure if the shell
command actually uses the current token
though we've impersonated so I'm going
to just use the execute command you can
do either they both do the about the
same thing e for token
so T is token use the current token see
as channelized I is interact with the
channel H mean uppercase H means that
hide it don't show it on the screen for
someone to see as they walk by or or
using the X thing and we don't want J
doe to look so it executes now there are
like there are commands inside of
incognito that tell you hey add user add
group added local group those are
awesome locally but the problem with
them is that you have to specify an IP
if you want to do remote with the net
commands you can stew a slash domain and
add it to the domain without knowing the
domain controllers IP net user Bob let's
do pas SW or uppercase D 1 and domain so
we're gonna add this to the domain and
then we're gonna add it so we're doing
all this on the command line and we're
gonna next ups exec and get the domain
controller hopefully if I can hurry up
let's change our domain from hacker to
do it this is what a resource file looks
like to bob change that hopefully this
hurries up alright cool
we have added a user and their net group
alright our next one is knit group
domain administrators if I can type
right all right domain admins done is
cool now we have a domain admin now we
exit that show drop back load our
resource resource
drama tent directory
all right I had a bing bada boom you
know it's done we have now gone from
only web access to SQL injection into an
SQL Server that's inside the network
popped over to a workstation via passed
the hash
did a token passing deal with the domain
controller to add a user and atom to
domain admins then PS exact with our new
domain admin with our password that we
have so we've gone from I don't know why
that's not working but as you can see it
can come hashes so all the way from
workstation to domain controller using
token passing adding the user to our
domain controller dumping hashes well
sort of cuz this thing failed for some
reason but we'll continue on it worked
we got there we have command execution
on and devayne controller via this small
sequel injection we have only three
connections out there fully formed HTTP
connections and hard to discern between
all the other stuff so that's Metasploit
awesome power and I'm only still
scratching the surface thanks haha now
you can email me cuz it worked well
I couldn't damp ashes
you can even only that feedback at half
time no board fee
guys it's a fact men are less likely
than women to buckle up in fact in 2008
66% of male drivers and 74% of male
passengers killed in passenger vehicles
were not wearing their safety belts
don't become a statistic wear your
freakin seatbelt especially at night
when two-thirds of drivers who dying in
accidents aren't buckled up you may be a
safe driver but you don't know who else
is out there and it's not cool to now
where it now the police will be out in
force over Memorial weekend hundreds of
state local law enforcement as well as
Highway Safety officials across the
nation will be participating in click it
or ticket 2010 for May 24th to June 6
they'll be out looking for you day or
night so make sure everyone buckle up
all right picture this you're building
your brand-new windows box and you've
set up your OS you did installed all of
your drivers possibly with double driver
from a couple of weeks ago one of those
segments I know you remember that
segment right and then you installed
dozens and dozens of programs all those
essentials that you have to have on
every single Windows box no matter what
this consists of going to the website
downloading hopefully the latest version
and then clicking next next next I agree
to some crappy you Ola and then saying
no to the toolbar and then eventually
finishing and restarting your computer
it takes forever
so not anymore and the time it takes for
me to show you this demo you'll have
your brand new box completely set up
with software essentials no next no
yola's no toolbars no headache so let's
check out the tool midnight nana is an
online service which bundles most of
your favorite software packages into
well one big bundle the single setup
package installs all of your selected
software without any nagging toolbars
and without having to click agree to a
whole bunch of you'll is that well you
don't read anyway so what's the point of
that it's fast and easy and it downloads
the latest version of your software
packages in either 32 or 64 bit and
while Darren's on the road on this hack
across America trip going to San
Francisco so jealous God totally want to
go out to San Francisco and party right
now yeah oh yeah we've gone ahead and
set up a tiny version of the hack 5
cloud lab on our computer over here so
let's check out how to set this up using
go to assist Express I've gone ahead and
logged on to my brand new XP VM and
using Internet Explorer I know don't
tell me I know I'm gonna go over to
ninite.com and go ahead and get started
alright so we're gonna check a few
software packages let's see I'm gonna
choose Chrome Skype VLC utorrent of
course I love you guys
teraCopy
cuddy all right now click get installer
and your custom package will begin
downloading
double-click preparing setup ok here we
go
nanite is now downloading the latest
versions of all of my software packages
and will begin installing each one one
by one now there are a couple couple of
little important head bits that I wanted
to add so let's go ahead and check those
out alright important points yes I know
yum and apt do this and more on Linux
but let's face it this is a Windows
machine and anything that makes this a
less of a headache for me is an a-plus
in my book so yeah it's awesome also
there's a pro paid version which comes
with local caching you can do offline
installers and it also has this thing
called silent mode but it's $20 a month
so it might be really good for the
corporate workers who manage a whole
bunch of computers and need to save a
bunch of time and use this kind of stuff
but for me and for everybody else the
free version is great for personal use
in my opinion so what are your thoughts
does it save a bunch of time or is it a
huge time waster is this a good program
or not email me at feedback at hack 5
org and let me know I like to know what
you guys think and yes we do read all of
your emails and last but not least I
