honestly I think she got it for me
because like Benetton I'm not wearing a
ratty bandana but then because I'm like
that guy I go and make sure that we make
like thousands of hak5 bandanas and
bring them to Def Con and that's your
excuse that's my excuse for buying
thousands of bandana
I noticed that over time my hair changes
colors like whenever it fades oh it
looks terrible I know it does you don't
have to comment in the comments I've
seen their comments but I know it looks
terrible I just can't afford the effort
into keeping up the the purple hue
thank you maybe a purple hair out of
effort I should seriously I have my own
personal patreon it's it's for soon I've
seen for the watching the snervous
reports thank you I love it every time
in the Bertil oh yeah the one that you
made it just I need my own graphics oh
what'd you do now like two weeks ago
a musical social network graphics look
you know they're at my home laptop I'm
lazy and I don't feel like bringing them
over here hi welcome to attic 5 my name
is Darren kitchen my name is Shannon
Morse and this is your weekly dose of
Technol us and when our powers combined
we are not Captain Planet I don't know
why we're doing this do anything we have
some stickers from fans it's let's get
into that it's the end of the year we
haven't had eggnog nor rum well somebody
has it somebody what do we get what do
we get would we get so we always do
stickers from a fan and we put them up
on our studio set over here so we have a
slew of them because we haven't recorded
a episode here in the studio in the wild
other than our 3d printer series which I
skipped the stickers for that series so
we have some new stickers from fans so
thank you for sending this in hak5 org
slash address if you want to send more
but I'll get you started on those I love
these check that out good chunk I don't
know that's not going to be in focus but
you get the idea this is from at mouth
share mal share is Aussie seal so here's
the beautiful thing about mal share all
the malware is on mal share calm not
your personal website as I found out
when Darren kitchen got blacklisted from
Google because I was hosting kalki XE
really everybody should have
wow it wasn't up to a Gideon's fighting
it wasn't just a calculator I'm sure it
wasn't
yeah so that's going and I I love the
malware on it it's just so funny
I think this is one a cry of course it's
one cry yeah yeah it's my cry one for
screensavers are the best screen savers
so we also got a letter from John who
says I work in the information assurance
field I also teach at my local community
college as an adjunct instructor
thank you for your podcasts and YouTube
videos I frequently refer to them to my
students for general security
information updates and especially for
the students who are new to Linux great
job snubs thank you so much for watching
those Darin I strongly appreciate your
ability to put complex technical
subjects into context and makes them
understandable do that well with my help
please accept the enclosed patch as a
token of my appreciation sorry we don't
have stickers I also support you on
patreon thank you for supporting
throughout wire on patreon truly
appreciate it if you're ever in Fort
Meade look me up wait a second it's an
NSA patch Oh
nice to have friends I know right
National Security Agency United States
of America so when you go to hey guys
there's two things you should be looking
at one look for buzz cuts to look for
shoes that are shiny
yep that's tranq you I'm I'm really
excited about that it's gonna go in my
bag that's really cool and we also got a
sticker from Oh where'd this come from I
wonder so that one's from David Randolph
who's over at printed solid comm he's
been helping us with that 3d printer
series that you just watched good happen
if you enjoy that I has so much fun and
I have been super enjoying having a 3d
printer around here in the office so if
you want to see more about 3d printers
on the show and on this channel let me
know because I would love to bring him
back and I would love to do more as far
as like packing 3d printers I think
that's really I see a little miniseries
coming on this is a little letter from
Ken who went over to hacker halted in
Atlanta and he supplied us with some
stickers from that so he got one that is
a loot Groot which is so cute we also
got a brain babe one I've heard a brain
babe that's really cool and he also sent
a few other ones go ahem blame the
network that one da a few other ones
there's security cat which is super cute
it's the
the security awareness company.com and I
think the rest of them are from that
same company no I like this one it says
don't click on SH star T I just love
that cute is part of the hacker culture
and that sticker gifting is like a mince
dice you're gifting is too cool yeah
these are a gift that I got in Japan
from wicked someone else's computer I'll
get to those in a second these are a
gift from my friend el Quintero they are
from code blue which is a convention
that happens over in Tokyo the Tokyo
hacker space which was from one of the
guys that came to my my hacker Meetup my
hack 5 meetup in Tokyo and alcÃ¡ntara
also gave me this one it's av Tokyo no
drink no hack which is another
convention that happens in Japan for
hackers so Thank You Alcantara I love
these I have a couple on my laptop as
well these from Linux Academy yes they
are
love Linux Academy yeah so we got a few
of these we also got a little gift bag
from a Linux academy.com so I'm really
appreciate these two and I love the
little Linux penguin he's so cute so
they do a whole bunch of different like
tutorials and stuff on their website so
I thought it was a great website to
support and I am really happy that I
said they sent us some stickers so we
can stick them up on our wall they'll
always be with this and last but not
least is a gift from Iraq ooh I'm
excited about this we actually got this
a couple of months ago but I haven't had
a chance to show it on the show I'll
read you the letter that we got it's
from met mutts
he says nearly a year ago I sent you out
the first edition of hash crack and over
that time I have had much feedback from
many members in the cracking community I
hope this book expands upon the original
edition of hash crack in a useful way
your show continues to be an inspiration
and entry point into the security realm
for many people young and old and
encourage you all to keep up the good
work look forward to one day bumping
into the hak5 team at a security
conference and wish you all the best in
your endeavors for the rest of the year
so thank you so much nut bucks this is
really cool if you didn't read hash
crack and you're into password cracking
this is a really really cool tutorial
guideline as far as how to use different
tools and how
to get into password cracking he has
advanced attacks in hearing all sorts of
information if you're not hash cracking
what are you doing yeah hash crack is
really cool so I think he also provides
yeah there's a bunch of little
note-taking area and a bunch of
information there too right yeah there's
examples there's reference material I'm
like over here trying to get this vine
and what I can finalize right one of the
things that I found about hash crack
that was so made it so accessible yeah
is I'll get to it later that they
provide examples that like get you
cracking passwords immediately and they
provide not just examples of like here's
command lines that they're like oh hey
I'm reading this command line and I get
what it's doing just by what I'm typing
but they provide you with a sample hash
to crack oh this is the og version I
want the new version yeah you're right
yeah it's like you know how it is when
like new books come out and you want to
get the new book so you see look at that
shameless plug there Shannon did you
like that these these are the new hack
five books ah I'm really excited because
they're like rainbow-colored fun books
for all sorts of good hacking that's
cool yeah and they've got common used to
have some of these when I was a kid
except they were about unicorns it's the
same idea except less rainbows well I
think that about wraps up this episode
yes stinkies showed off on the show we
got tons of bloopers I know it's
Christmas week so it's a non episode
