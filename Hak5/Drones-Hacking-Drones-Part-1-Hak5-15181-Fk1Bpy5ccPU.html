by domain.com hello welcome to house 5
my name is Gerren kitchen I'm busy
weekly dose of techno lust and I am so
excited coz we have Stroh its drone
attack time so I actually speaking of
drones attacking things I kind of heard
that a drone might have attacked you in
the face yeah luckily I was wearing
Google glass which protected my head yes
you know what though
today is payback I'm getting down that
pear AR are you okay so this one's the
parrot ar.drone 2.0 I remember seeing
this at CES it's super easy to fly and
everything but what do you have over
here with ten psychotic remote well okay
so this is another drone of by a company
called DJI and this is the vision
phantom this is actually the phantom 2
now and so it's it's kind of a fun drawn
to fly because it's got a well let's not
hammer on board it's got a nice little
gimbal that keeps the camera steady in
its GPS augmented so it just hovers in
the sky and it's awesome it's really
easy to fly and a great platform for
doing all sorts of fun other nefarious
things for later and you have a mark 5
on there I see that's what I did I put a
pineapple mark 5 on this guy because we
are going to be taking it to the sky and
hacking some Wi-Fi two of my favorite
things in the world using aviation and
Wi-Fi hacking with drones okay so I know
that this one pretty much connects to
your camp or your cell phone but how
does how did these work well you're
right like that's the beauty of the pair
air drying it was one of the first kind
of consumer friendly drones that made it
really easy as a toy yeah for anyone to
pick up expensive toy but that this is
about I think I want to say it's about
300 bucks
yeah and the idea is you connect it to
your cell phone whether that's Android
or iOS yeah and then you can see the
video camera on here and then you can
like fly it around and it's really easy
and it's got all sorts of cool sensors
that make it stupid simple and they've
got this big cushy things you don't like
you know
poke your eye out haha and so yes that's
very consumer focused and also a lot of
fun to hack with their SDKs and stuff
this guy is a little bit more prodi-g
guy makes a bunch of
videography platforms but the Phantom is
really there kind of more consumer
focused version it's controlled over a
5.8 gigahertz a gigantic remote control
yeah I mean compared to some this is
actually not that big but yeah it's it's
you know by a traditional RC remote
control right and then the camera here
on the gimbal is actually Wi-Fi relayed
through this repeater here and then what
you do is you take your cell phone here
and clip it on with the rope you can
again see what it sees and have that
first person view experience but both of
these are consumer drones
that one at the low end at about 300 and
this one at the high end at about $1,200
oh okay yeah just a little
it has lifting capacity so we're
strapped wet so I hold on to these
handles and it'll carry me away no not
quite it's it's carrying about 400 grams
of pineapple in a and a 18 hour 12-volt
battery here for the pineapple juice
well I want to see this happen okay so
should we just take to the skies let the
ponies begin yeah let's do it all right
so I have the ar.drone 2.0 right over
here and the first thing I need to do is
go ahead and put in the battery pack so
I can actually get it charged and
powered so to do that I simply take off
the top unhook this velcro and slide in
the battery I connect the two wires and
velcro back on
there we go nice and tight all of that
should fit underneath the main body and
it just checked itself so it's ready and
it's charged next up I'm going to go
ahead and open up the application it's
called a our free flight so I'll click
on that and it'll take a few seconds to
go ahead and get connected I should be
able to get into the Wi-Fi of the air
ar.drone I'll be connected I'll hit
pilot on the application and we're going
to take off so it should automatically
start flying up it's about three inches
or three feet above and we have it going
now I can power it backwards and
forwards to the side right and left and
crash it alright so we've got our
controller turned on we have our Wi-Fi
repeater up we've got the the Phantom up
and operational now in fact I've
connected to the network here very
similar to the way the ar.drone works is
it's named phantom underscore and then
the last four of the MAC address over
there it's ar.drone and then the last
four of its MAC address in fact we did
the same thing with the pineapple which
is strapped to here now I'm going to go
in into camera and I can see what it
sees now in fact there's a go ahead and
hit record and look there's Paul hi Paul
and from here I can see my battery life
and how I've connected to satellites and
so I've got a green connection I've got
seven satellites in the sky so it will
use GPS to the fly and this point I
pretty much need to press in to turn on
my rotors I'm going to wait for Shannon
to get up in the sky and then when she's
going I'm going to flip on my pineapple
and I've set it up with a boot mode to
go ahead and launch my denial of drone
attack so looks like she's flying there
reach down here and flip on my pineapple
and away we go
alright I'm gonna send that right over
to Shannon let's see how it does
so right now the Wi-Fi pineapple mark 5
is just booting up and as soon as it's
done booting I've got the dip switches
set in such a way that it's going to
execute my my drone pwned script as soon
as it does that will do all the magic so
let me get near the AR Drone gonna
attack oh boy I'm scared what is it
gonna do to me please don't hurt my AR
Drone hey hi how you doing I'm doing
pretty good I got an air drone over here
what do you got yeah I've got the
Phantom going how are you your husband
how's the handling on that guy pretty
good there's a little bit of turbulence
since it's kind of windy out here but
that's too bad
I actually find that if I put the
Phantom above the para it'll totally
knock it down
what yeah oh it's ok it's gonna feel
safe it reboots but not for long I say
this is what I was talking about like
that oh I'm not even cool oh man we
should get some insurance seriously I
need some life insurance living here oh
thanks a lot man ok I'll let the script
do its thing
ok all I have to do is be within range
of her drone and the script is just
gonna continually loop her failsafe
brings it back up into the sky but in
just a moment here it's gonna reconnect
and do its magic so I'm just gonna wait
right here
less than 60 seconds let's get in there
oh you killed my drums yes I did man not
cool not cool man I am checked so I
noticed with my air drone every time it
dropped out of the sky it would come
back up after a couple of seconds it
does and that's because I found when I
you know telnet it in and first started
hacking on this that actually has a
fail-safe program so what I'm doing is I
kill the control program and then very
similar to the way that we do it on the
pineapple where you just have a
keepalive script it kicks in and
restarts the program so you're just
using telnet to kill it yeah in fact it
is you know as simple as any other
embedded Linux device it's actually
running in a Theroux system on a chip
very similar to the pineapple so it's
like they're brothers or something and
yet it seeks out the SSID of the AR
drones it connects and associates and
then it just helmets in and kills the
control program I could as well kill the
you know control program respond er but
a figured egg it's more fun and annoying
as a denial of drone attack to let it
come back up only to kill it again
notice that tell them it's pretty
similar to netcat in some ways in some
ways it is in fact you could even use
netcat to control this using UDP packets
the attack you option in netcat allows
you to send UDP packets that's basically
what your phone is doing when you tell
it to go forward you're sending a UDP
packet constantly over and over and over
again with an incremented sequence
number saying go forward go forward go
forward and so that's actually what you
can steal my parent I could I could X
instead of just making drop out of this
guy I could send it the packets to say
take this altitude and go this way or
whatever it's so screwed out Samy Kamkar
actually did approve concept called
skyjacking that inspired all of this he
did his on a Raspberry Pi and he used a
node.js framework to do the control for
it I prefer to just kind of go ahead and
tell him it in and kill the program
because it's just fun to watch it follow
to the sky and
I just love that the the DJI is killing
the parrot but you know that's just me
now I know that all of these depend on
open Wi-Fi at least the aerodrome does
no they both do in fact the AR Drone is
I mean in fact it's highly hackable
because it is an open network you can
tell that right in they didn't lock this
down in any way there's a software
development kit for those UDP packets
they're just 18 commands that you send
to sell through stuff it's super easy
and they make it hackable but um but I
don't but they both use open my pies
they should not be using open wide well
I think the difference is I mean the
ar.drone people these are cool guys at
france that are like into like the
hacking community and that that sense
but they are actually both using in fact
this right here on the end of my
transmitter is an open Wi-Fi repeater
essentially the camera on that guy is a
you know it's basically a wireless
network camera that repeats a signal
over to this and then that's what
connects to this and the reason for all
of this is that consumers have phones
and they're used to open networks and
it's just like built-in it's it's like
you know if you're launching a product
it's super simple to set up a control
mechanism over open Wi-Fi oh that's
terrible nobody cares
well it's yeah its consumer stuff they
don't care about security and you know
if security means that you might
potentially get a support call well like
I don't know how to you know set of my
grandkids drone what's this password
thingy they're just not gonna do it
that's so bad well what I really want to
see is the code behind this you want to
dig into the code yes let's do it
right after this
doesn't matter if you're a whale or
nuclear Wessels when you have that
killer idea you need to grab yourself a
domain name and web hosting fast and
with domain coms quick domain discovery
system and they're using checkout

trivia question of the week last week's
trivia question was if you're a victim
of a smurf attack you're a victim of
what and the answer was a denial of
service attack now this week's trivia
question is what year did Ivan
Sutherland create the first head-mounted
VR an augmented reality display system
and you can answer that over at hack 5
org slash trivia for your chance to win
some awesome hack 5 swag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
