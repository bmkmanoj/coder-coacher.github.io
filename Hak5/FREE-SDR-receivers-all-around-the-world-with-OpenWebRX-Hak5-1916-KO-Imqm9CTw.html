over the world and sharing your own all
that and more this time on hack five
this episode of hack five is brought to
you by domain.com hello and welcome to
hack five my name is darren kitchen
hello my name is Shannon Morse
yes your weekly dose of Technol us
welcome to our ever so sparkly show yeah
that's right I have a deck in the car
the halls we got we got golden
pineapples
did you know tinsel originated maybe
from a spiderweb on a Christmas tree no
yeah it's a thing did you know that
Christmas tree is originated from the
hallmark corporation non make no no that
was way back that's a totally different
podcast you guys tuned because we are
having fun with fun with bits yes this
is a really fun thing about where
computers just make everything better as
we know already software-defined radio
is awesome and basically basically
because I would say no solo that's the
only part I now why do we not have a
Kirby cam oh that's a good idea
I don't we have it see fail we fail as
podcasters but you know we don't fail as
software-defined radio tinkerers
basically computers and networks make
everything better including the
software-defined radios because turning
waveforms into bits means that we can do
with them the same thing we do with all
the bits and that is share the love
share the pens and that is exactly what
a che 7i LM did with SDR hu that sounds
like a call sign I'm going to assume
there would be a hotel alpha7 Indigo
Lima Mike Mike thank you I think it's
Mike too anyway this developer created
this to helped popularize
software-defined radios and I know that
this is something that you have been
doing a lot of lately borrow this Kirby
okay Kirby's like I'm lucky
now ya rtl-sdr so that's the little
$20.00 dongle that we've been using for
ages to do lots of SDR practice and yeah
you can do a ton of things with it and
it's incredibly inexpensive so why not
so it turns out this SDR HU that that
h17 ilm guy he created it's free and it
allows anybody to experiment with SDR
without even needing to actually buy
their own radio you can just tap into
like a wealth of radios all across the
world and listen to radio stations
motherland's it's open source it's a web
service yeah and you know it's like 20
dollars cheaper than buying a twenty
dollar radio I think we can give an
example there's one that's listed here
from and I'll just go ahead and pull
this guy up this is pag 3wg WH it's a
receiver and with that guy pull up and
this is actually from whoops let me turn
down the volume oh yes but this is
actually an up converted RTL SDR that's
in the historic Warburg Netherlands I'm
probably pronouncing that wrong but it's
right next to Den Haag their den haag or
The Hague I'm pronouncing everything
wrong but you know what shout out to REM
space and tecnológica incognita
- awesome hacker spaces in the area
ain't no hackers like another lin hacker
because a Netherland hacker got a hack
hack hack hack hack I'm sorry I'm just
messing everything up
but this particular radio really cool I
now and tuned into a 30 meter band radio
in the Netherlands oh yeah Matt yeah as
we remember that that's just the
frequency is just see where the speed of
light lamda I'm glad you remember that
right well you basically all you have to
do is you take 299 million
okay 790 2458 meters per second and then
you divide that by the wavelength in
meters and then you know in this case
that's 30 and then you're going to get
your frequency in Hertz which is like
how many times per second in this case
it's like ten megahertz or well it's
shortwave there's another way to do this
is yeah you google it you could do that
because I like her help alright so I'll
go ahead and show you the interface
online so you just go over to SDR hu and
you click on receivers and you get a
list of the ones that are currently
online not many online at the moment but
we can just simply click on one believe
this is the same one that you clicked on
but I'll go ahead and show you a little
bit about how to use it
to just listen in so you get your
frequencies at the top a nice little
band of those and then you get your
waterfall down below if you want to zoom
in on a frequency you can just scroll in
and out and that will maximize or
minimize your frequency so I'll zoom
back out now and up here you can click
on the receiver name so I'll click up
here to see more information about it so
if they've included in this case they
included the name of the the buildings
that the picture is hard to pick
depicting in the background and we've
seen some that are like in the Ukraine
and yes we have a place so it's just
pretty cool thoroughly enjoy your radio
stations by the way Ukraine yes like
there's ballet and the weird weirdest
coolest things you can also find a
couple of other additional details about
it there's a status log down at the
bottom this will show you how many
clients are currently listening in so
what there's two what is darren and one
is me and then you have audio stream
output server CPU audio buffer and
network usage and then you also have a
log which can appear up at the down at
the bottom as well and this will show
you if it's connected if there's any
issues and what kind of sample rate
you're currently listening in on and you
also have your receiver specs so I'm
currently listening and at
one-for-one megahertz and I can choose
fm
or I can change over to a mlsp USB or CW
and that's about it so it's very very
simple and really easy to use right and
I should just say you know now that well
this is really awesome what's so
beautiful here is if you already have
your own software-defined radio you can
actually share it with this web service
using open web rx yes it's awesome okay
so tell me how to do this okay so
basically what you need to do is you
need to grab yourself the open web RX
software okay it's open source it's in a
git repository I have it pulled up right
here and so you just go ahead and clone
this from Simon's I can't pronounce your
last name Simon I'm not gonna try to
butcher it but Simon here is awesome and
has developed some pretty cool code
because it works in getting the
software-defined radios up on the web
and that's a really rad feat so do you
need any dependencies yeah I mean it's
Linux so of course yeah alright but it's
actually not too bad it's pretty easy
especially if you're on a Debian based
system like I am it's mainly just a
bunch of app get install foo and it's
probably the stuff that you already have
things like build essentials and you're
gonna need Lib USB you're gonna need Lib
FF w3 you obviously need to get to get
clone in C make to do the making and all
that stuff but it's it's pretty simple
the only thing that's a little
complicated and I say I said complicated
I don't really mean complicated but like
you're gonna need a copy of CSDR and
that is a very simple digital signal
processing library that's also a
command-line tool that's used for
software-defined radios you can find
that in Simon's get repository as well
and that's a cool tool because you could
use it in your own stuff to make more
better awesome things so grab yourself a
copy of both of those and making them is
well it's really easy because there's
make file oh ok so just grab the source
do a git clone CD to the directory make
make install Bob's your uncle
or your mother's brother so with that if
I should mention that if you're actually
gonna be using an rtl-sdr like we are in
this case yeah there's a little caveat
there's a little bit of extra work
involved it's not too much basically you
need to do a little modprobe goodness
you need to add it to the blacklist for
modprobe and you need to unregister the
kernel module in your current session
and basically that's just doing that to
make sure that nothing else is hooking
into it so that it has you know priority
access that device there's a couple of
nitty-gritty commands but I'm just gonna
list a link to the Quick Start Guide in
the show notes do you do that all in
that yeah it's really simple it's just a
couple of you know lines that they toss
into - yeah in fact do I have that
pulled up here yes I do it's right here
so you know this is it I mean you could
pretty much you can copy and paste this
into your terminal and hope for the best
but you know that's that's pretty much
it okay so Dez yes the actual
configuration though even easier I have
to applaud this I love config files that
are well commented yep this is not it's
a config file but it's also a Python
file so again you can think about how
extensible this is I'll give you an
example of just that so let's see let me
go over to open web Rx and you'll see we
have a config file here
that's config underscore web are X and
ya okay so we've got our server settings
and you know this is in my case I'm just
gonna run this locally so my server host
is actually just going to go ahead and
be localhost but of course if I were
putting this on a domain if I wanted to
share this somewhere I would want to
have you put it on some server right I
would probably want to use like a
dynamic DNS or something like that so
people could actually access it and
again like the normal settings like you
know the web server it's I don't know
why port 80 73 that's cool
but if you want you can change that max
clients is set to 20 web GUI
configuration this is actually the part
where we can put in all of that good
stuff I'm putting in hack five Dannan
and point Richmond and I've tuned mine
to I'm gonna say it's nine and we're
using an RTL SDR give the email address
you can even give it GPS coordinates
those aren't correct give it a title and
all that stuff and you know just like
niceties so that anybody listening
little customizations right and what's
beautiful about this you don't actually
necessarily have to share this with the
SDR hu folks you can still use open web
rx if you just want to use it on your
land with your friends or put it on the
internet with your own domain and not
share it but if you do want to share
it's been made pretty easy okay all you
have to do is get yourself a key and
basically you go over here register your
device you get an email and then you
just paste your basically API key up in
there and then you'll be listed that's
awesome yeah the rest of it is pretty
much the DSP settings from the CSDR
library that we talked about and this is
where you can set a couple of different
F of T things like the frames per second
stuff of that nature really all of the
stuff pertaining to your radio is down
here where we actually talked about the
IQ sources we touched on that briefly
with Mike Osman we're talking about like
the raw radio data it comes in a form
called IQ that is slightly outside of
the scope of this particular segment but
essentially it's the data from the radio
that we're going to have as bits and
that those are the bits that we're going
to shovel up onto the web so that
everybody else can enjoy it and not just
a wav file right so with that you can
see that essentially depending on what
radio you use you're going to uncomment
different stuff and these are the ones
that are uncommented for me and it's
your start RTL command and my case it's
rtl-sdr attack s and you set the sample
rate and the frequency and the ppm and
all of that stuff and actually get this
it pipes it to netcat
locally on port 80 88 so if you were to
actually pull up netcat yeah on port 80
or you know yeah you'd see just raw data
coming through on port 80 88 cents
that's kind of fun and then the rest of
it is just the format and stuff but if
you actually dive into the rest of this
you may notice you know a couple of I
noticed something oh yeah there's that
and this is what's so awesome about
well-documented code is hey we're gonna
use a hacker if you need to run this
first and you're gonna need this thing
and you're gonna need that thing which
is awesome you can also do this with a
sound card if you're just using a
front-end a lot of people that's awesome
rather than an SDR you can use your
sound card that's an SCR plug
ID under your sound card and Bob's your
uncle right yeah it makes sense yeah um
so these are the commands you just
uncomment these so as long as you have a
start RTL command and a format
conversion command then you're good to
go and so this has already been the set
up for the RTL SDR the hack RF sound
cards you can do RTL SDR with the RTL
TCP command as well and I love that
there's a actual test signal source you
could just type get this dev you random
which is a pseudo random number
generator up in your Linux you just grab
some bits out of there they're gonna
essentially be random yeah essentially
so anyway if you wanted some noise but
it's so I've just I'm pleased to see
some really well-documented code that's
very exciting it's very easy to
configure this is all you know out of
the box for an RTL SDR ready to go and
the developer was able to add support
for for example the hack RF in just
moments just from what my Cosman
explained to me when he was just down
here he was saying that the developer
came up to me was like hey can I borrow
a hack RF to work on my project he's
like yeah sure here and then it comes
back like half hour later and it's like
okay so I craft networks with open web
rx like so I'm sure we'll see more
software-defined radios listed in here
in the future but yeah anyway with all
of that configured it's just a matter of
running the program okay so you save it
now you run the Python yep we'll just do
Python and it's you can actually see it
here the the executable file here the
open web rx py and there we go we have a
TCP connection established and I'm gonna
go ahead and open a browser and head to
localhost colon 80 70 3 and there we go
cool and I can I could probably turn my
blame up but that's pretty much it so
that's the SDR that you're currently
running right here yeah might help if
it's sitting upwards yeah maybe that was
weird
okay so we have a ghost at the neck live
studio but you're welcome to join us at
any of our open houses like we just had
nobody was that was really we nobody was
haunted from what we understand yeah
yes not at that one yes thank you
everybody yeah for helping us donate to
the EFS we raised a lot of money for
that so that's pretty good stuff anyway
I'm just really excited to see this it
this is the perfect example of a hack
because it's libraries that exist it's
piping things too like netcat and it's
ultimately making something that just
works where you can contribute to it and
I mean obviously I'm not gonna leave my
laptop here set up with the rtl-sdr but
but one thing you could do like if huge
you could just run this on pretty much
any Linux server including a Raspberry
Pi I'm assuming right in fact you just
used a Raspberry Pi on one of your
patreon build videos for for tech thing
yes so as you know it's a perfect
lightweight server this isn't heavy lift
I'd be perfect so you could just like
you could just set up your Raspberry Pi
you don't even need like a monitor or
anything you can just set it up with the
rtl-sdr and let people log into it I
guess you would just need to change like
what your your port forwarding on your
router
Idina setting or - yes a dynamic DNS
through whatever like most of the people
up on this listing have done yeah yeah
so at this time of recording there's
only about ten people that are sharing
their rtl-sdr is on here and they're not
all necessarily online all the time as
you just saw so I would love to see more
people sharing their rtl-sdr s on here
it would be really cool to be able to
listen in two different stations across
the globe I mean I think it's really
cool that I'm able to like listen to
ballet random things like oh this is
nice it's like you can turn into like
Russian number stations or something
that'd be cool though you could probably
pick those up here anyway because
they're on shortwave in the atmosphere
which is epic by the way if I told you
how much I'm thankful for
electromagnetism and this molten core
right it's my favorite thing in the
universe bouncing hey you know what we
should do that we would need maybe we
can do it with a hack RF I know that we
can't with the RTL SDR but we should
pick up some number of stations let us
know in the comments so that's the kind
of stuff that you'd like to see and
we'll be back with those comments here
in just a minute but first we're gonna
think are awesome sponsor domain.com if
you've been watching act 5 for a while
you know how much we love domain.com
they're our go-to places to register all
sorts of domains and lately we've been
having a lot of fun with a new top-level
domain and that is dot Club domain comm
told us about it we're very excited
because so many amazing ideas are very
good club related you may not think so
but we must realize that one clubs are
universally and globally understood it's
not just here in the US and two of you
building a new business or a startup
it's really a perfect name right now
because it is like the ultimate social
domain and what is the internet if not
about building
unity and collaboration so you guys
could all collaborate on a dot Club
about how terrible my haircut is or lack
thereof you could do that right now
because it's a fantastic time to get
yourself a dot Club all you have to do
is head over to domain.com slash Club
and register one they start at 999 years
there's bajillions available already and
get this just because your hack 5 viewer
you get to use the special coupon code
hak5 that saves you 15% off and let's do
a comm know all about it and matter of
fact why don't you tweet at domain.com
and let us know let them know how much
you appreciate them supporting hack 5
for all these years so when you think
domain names think domain.com I just
want to say it's so much fun
highlighting open source projects that
are awesome and I hope to see many many
more contributors hopefully because it's
just so cool curry likes it too she's
like wow this laptops really warm when
you get the software-defined radio thing
going so we did get a viewer question
like we mentioned it's from servant 74
he says do you guys design the
electronics for hack shop and devices
and yes kind of yes well some this
question is a little bit of a shameless
plug but at the same time there's been
so many new viewers lately that if you
haven't been with hack 5 for the full
like 10 year span one you got a lot of
catching up to do like what do you been
yeah come on - don't mind that that's a
that's a hack you know what we should
have an entire show that's just all the
hacks that make the studio happen
because let me tell you this thing is
hacker ethic as many of the people that
came to visit at the most recent open
house determined when they toured the
studio yeah I lost my train of thought
over time we're talking about the show
it was just the hack shop devices which
is that if you're not if you're new to
the show
you may not realize when we talk about
you know if you want to support us
directly a check a shop comm that's us
that's here in this warehouse and that's
actually the primary support for this
show and it's what allows us to bring
this to you so we are so thankful for
everybody that does that and yeah we are
the designers of the
of the Wi-Fi pineapple of the land
turtle the USB rubber ducky we've done
other projects in the past like the
interceptor aka Network monkey we've got
lots of cool new stuff coming which is
one of the reasons why the episodes are
a little shorter recently massive devil
very stressful very exciting
can't wait to launch you awesome stuff I
should mention too if you guys have any
comments or suggestions for things that
you would like to see us carry in the
hack shop we're always open to those as
well because we have like four minds in
here and there's a lot of minds out
there if we're missing like an
electronic or some kind of hack five
swag that you guys want to see us sell
let us know yes we can definitely bring
it in at the same time we should also
mention you know we've been talking
about this software-defined radio stuff
we're talking about free ways to do this
now there's the $20 way to do it with an
RTL SDR yeah and then our friend Mike
Osman who was just on the show a few
weeks ago he's the developer of the hack
RF and the uber tooth one and the
yardstick one and a couple of land taps
that are awesome and so it's just really
cool to see how I don't want to get too
much off track but when I first got into
the scene you know building boxes red
boxes blue boxes things of that nature
that that kind of thing is still
continuing on in this and we've got like
entire lines of like hacker hardware
from hackers it's pretty cool so thanks
for the comments what you would like to
see on the show can be told to us where
we would read it and make things happen
that was like nice jump into shake your
own sentence like that yes what you
would like do it like I'm gonna start
with the end of the sentence Yodo ask
and work backwards I totally called you
a like can you come can you call us out
on the fact that we're off the rails we
always are no no we're not always you've
got ten years of shows to prove that
it's all about 50/50 one episode where
he really goes off oh was this one where
I poured
wine no is bourbon was the birth on my
head there's been so many amazing
moments in that five that was a good one
and Kirby's been there for all of them
haven't a girl okay well anyway for
myself and the cat but and Shannon here
and thank you for supporting us a
hockshop calm thank you for following us
a hack five org slash follow check out
all the other shows over on hak5 to org
and with that we're reminding you want
to see it Kerby his hit she's saying
she's saying crossed your check the last
it's like done you miss me touch me
do you food no don't touch me I'm
Shannon Morse
I'm Karen kitchen dressed your techno
