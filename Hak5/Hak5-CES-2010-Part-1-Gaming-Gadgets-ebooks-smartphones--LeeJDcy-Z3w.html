is the consumer electronics show 2010
I'm Shannon Morse and you are watching
hacks 5
this episode of hak5 is brought to you
by gamefly goto assists express and
domain com got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain hello welcome
to hack 5 my name is darren kitchen and
I'm Shannon Morse and we are bringing
you our favorite pics from CES 2010 I
can't believe I came back for a second
year of this oh my feet are so tired
well we learned a lot from the last year
and we're very thankful to be here back
at the NBC Universal scar oh my gosh
thank you guys so much NBCUniversal you
have done so much for us yeah give us
chips huge huge show this year we're
coming out just very nimble studio 10
pound rig just coming out grabbing all
the stuff that we can find just it was
great this year we're actually able to
see some boots I wasn't stuck editing
live shows every single day i love your
laptop this thing has been perfect for
editing all the episodes and that little
10-pound well set in a bag yeah yeah
it's been great so we've actually been
able to be so nimble and I'd seen them
now a decent percentage of the
conference too much so we've picked and
chosen the the best stuff that we really
liked and thought we would share with
some of those with you now we've got
about six different things this show
here's the thing so much content it
wouldn't all fit so tune in next week as
well because we've got a lot more we got
two episodes but the first thing that
really tackled or techno lost first
night was the alienware m11x netbook /
laptop have you really got to have a lot
of fun fragging with that so let's go
take a look so we are at the dull suite
at CES 2010 and I have tons of new
gaming laptops for you all three of
these are from alienware and we have a
17 inch a 15 inch and this is crazy an
11 inch gaming laptop and seriously this
thing is badass when it plays video
games I tried this out I played some
games oh and did I mention you can
change the colors on it it's
customizable yeah I know it's the
alienware m11x it has an intel core 2
duo su 7300 and intel GMA graphics plus
hydroid mode nvidia GT 355 m it's four
pounds and it's available in early
februari for less than
a thousand bucks everything is on high
it's anti-aliasing off on outside 720p
display the battery lasts for 6.5 hours
per regular in three hours when you're
gaming and again the custom lighting so
I'm going to get myself a less than a
thousand dollar gaming laptop 11 inches
and I'm gonna make it pink that's what
alienware has a for us and I'm getting
kind of excited about februari okay so
that alienware gaming laptop how can you
not say that thing is like girls size
perfect for any video games it looks so
good I know what you think yeah I want
one I'm gonna turn the colors all pink
on it all the lighting oh my gosh you
know the specs are actually very similar
to the ultra I guess you see you lv the
ultralight that I have right now my 13
11 oh that's we said I'd known right
wait I loved it but uh and I can say
that the what is it the SU 7300 well
it's technically a core two duo chip
architecture it's it's it's no T 6600 or
something like that but with that Nvidia
graphics card in yes it can game no
problem three megs l2 cache is really
what helps that out a lot to on the
processor end and when I'm not video
game I like to check out some movies and
some other podcast and we failed
something to help you out with that
let's go take a look so I'm here at the
boxee booth with Avner Abner if not
we're here give you a great big man hug
how you doing oh we're doing good I'm
gonna be tired yeah slept like three
hours haven't had lunch but otherwise
I'm having a great time absolutely
dedicated to the boxee you guys have
been blowing up recently I mean I from
from a little little tiny project like
oh this is need to so my god you guys
are everywhere you guys have had a
fantastic year what has been new this
year yeah so you know the beta has come
out this morning so a year in the making
and we announced the boxee box and the
box remote and we just also announced
that it's inside it's running nvidia
tegra 2 dual core which means it can do
1080p the UI can be really smooth
can do flash 10.1 so almost anything
from the web can play on it so we're
very excited about it I love that
anything from the web because you know
with boxxy it's important to get those
other plugins and applications and stuff
that may use like what about the flash
performance am I going to be able to see
full screen flash video looking gorgeous
on us yeah it's actually we're using
hardware acceleration for flesh thanks
to Nvidia so that means you know how
high definition flesh is going to play
real nice on the box hardware
acceleration is where it's at so tell me
uh this this box what's the price point
and when is it available so it's going
to be less than 200 bucks no monthly fee
obviously and hopefully q2 it's going to
come out and the remote control if you
use boxee on a computer or laptop you'll
be able to buy the remote control
separately as well the Bruno control is
absolutely sick let me get to that in a
moment but but on the box now this is a
d-link partnership right right yeah
thank you know from Taiwan they've been
in the market for a long time selling
network equipment and they have a great
brand and great distribution channel and
when we started working with them early
in the year we're very excited about the
opportunity now tell me is d-link the
exclusive partner when it comes to the
hardware with boxxy know the idea is for
the box is software to run a variety of
devices so boxy the boxee box by dealing
is the first one but then we want to get
it into connected TVs connected blu-ray
players set of boxes any device with a
CPU in the living room we'd love to have
boxing on it when are we going to see
boxing on a console that you'll have to
ask sony microsoft and nintendo yeah we
have to we have to convince these guys
that it makes sense well I hope they're
nibbling I have a feeling that they
might be opposed with their own
ecosystem but tell me how are the
partnerships with some of the other
media platforms doing for you know but
you're you're obviously got YouTube but
uh how's things going with the who Luzon
and all of those with Hulu unfortunately
nothing is going but you know others are
are being great partners for us netflix
has been great Major League Baseball
flickr pandora revision3 so most of the
people on the internet are being very
friendly too boxy and we hope that the
you know the situation with who would
change eventually right now how does
honestly how does it stack up against
something like a Roku yeah I think it's
a very different experience in boxes an
open source software it's a it's much
more elaborate at this stage there's 300
applications there's about 100
developers building apps around boxee
there's all the social aspects behind it
we built one aggregated place where you
get all the TV shows from everywhere on
the internet on on your TV same goes
from movies introduced search so I think
just the different experience and we're
a software company hopefully maybe in
the future we'll be able to around
boxing on roku as well I love that idea
now I tell me this remote is absolutely
sick when can we get our hands on it how
is it being sold separately it's just
tell me about the hardware it's gorgeous
yeah the Howard or was designed by a
company called aster studio it's a small
design shop from San Francisco they've
actually done the xbox 360 and a bunch
of other high-profile industrial design
works so we you know when we started
working with them together with dealing
we told them we want to see something
different than emits quality and that
users will embrace and one of the major
issues was text input and when we went
out to design the remote when I figure
out what we're going to do and can we do
something on virtual keyboards it's
going to work and we came to the
conclusion virtual keyboard suck and you
need something on the device it's going
to make it happen and you know came a
brainstorm came up with the idea of
flipping the remote using the backside
as a qwerty keyboard and it feels great
I mean it will be able to play with it
soon and we so so I rrf what's the the
technology underline there it's our F IR
with keyboard is something that's very
hard to do because you have to point it
and you may lose some key strokes so we
wanted people to feel very comfortable
so so it's just bluetooth there's some
proprietary thing just RF and it's going
to come with a dongle so you can use it
with with any PC or Mac or Linux
excellent because if you've already
built yourself a gorgeous little boxee
box and you just want to get the remote
now is this is the remote bundled with
the d-link box or not yeah it's bundled
with the box by
also would be sold separately absolutely
excellent and I love the idea the Box
less than two hundred dollars it's
really one of the least expensive ways
to build your own I mean you got to
support the homebrew though right you
gotta love that movement but but two
hundred dollars a little less than that
is very compelling when it comes to
something that what's what's the specs
on this what's the chip underneath so
it's nvidia tegra 2 dual core which is a
pretty strong chipset right there and it
can do 1080p and it can do flash 10.1
and it can run our UI really smoothly
and it's not you know it's not a simple
UI to to get done so the partnership
with NVIDIA has been great and they've
been working with us very closely to get
it done and you know we have the
greatest respect for the homebrew
community and we continue to support
them and we also hope that when people
are going to get the boxes are going to
hack it and we're going to try and make
it a curb friendly you heard it here
first the boxee box is hacker friendly
real quick what's coming up in 2010 with
boxxy so we're going to bring more
content into the platform today we also
launched the small but very important
tool a bookmarklet so whenever you
browse the web you're at work school you
see a video that you like you can click
on it and it goes directly to your box
eq so we're going to do more of those
little things we're going to increase
our presence on the web we're going to
launch a billing platform later in the
year so content owners want to charge
for this stuff will be able to do it and
hopefully we'll get some harbor
distribution deals done thank you so
much Abner I love what you guys are
doing ah domain com how I love thee let
me count the ways I mean aside from the
obvious stuff like com names for less
than nine bucks a year or awesome web
hosting for less than six bucks a month
private registration and all the fixings
without the crazy upsells that you you
know might find somewhere else and let
me tell you i absolutely love how quick
and easy it was for me just recently
using got domain com to set up a site
for a client that needed a little
prototype action got an awesome VPS from
domain.com and it's like boom gotta do
name and like within minutes I mean I
don't know like how long it was ago that
it took forever to get a new domain name
but now it's just like damn here's the
name server and whoa look at that like
minutes later and I can like show the
client and it was so great it made it so
easy in this VPS with cpanel and get
them with plesk you can get them with
windows whatever you want makes things
so easy it's also great when you come
down to the movie slate and you don't
want to be using anything on this net
what you want to ss8 tunnel everything
because you know your packets they're
safe with domain com so if you're
interested in their services go check
them out they're super cool and we love
them for supporting hak5 you can even
tweet them at domain.com if you want to
show your support there and get fifteen
percent off all your orders over at
domain.com when you use the coupon code
h AK the number five you've got a great
idea it all starts with a great domain
at domain.com i want one of these so bad
but it's just not gonna fit my stack but
oh yeah room well you could like to fit
in your stack but then everything would
just kind of slide off the top a logo
which doesn't help very well yeah I love
how open foxy is the guys are here are
so great and so embracing the community
can't wait to get one in to really have
some fun hacking around with it and that
remote is killer yeah I would have loved
that back when i was doing home theater
pcs with like a TI RF remote i know they
have that one for the xbox 360 that like
plugs into your controller but i kind of
wish there was something like right on
top of the kanaka three years i really
could just type on it yeah but i always
need to type on it yeah yeah i think it
let me shoot if you can you know type on
a droid or will you even subjected
yourself to the palm centro so yeah I
did yeah it was horrible now you've been
crazy about ebooks this oh my god Eva
since you got that bingo allah means
that again you been
game say it's like it's like a bookworms
Christmas dream heaven here there's so
many ebooks for everybody oh it's
wonderful so you check out the plastic
logic q let's take a look we announced
this product today called the q it's
from plastic logic and one of the things
i want you to notice right away it's a
very thin and light product unlike a lot
of the e-readers in the category we're
really focused on the business
professional so when you look at the
user interface here this was really
designed with the business professional
in mind you'll notice a couple of
features you don't normally see in these
types of devices one that we have your
calendar here because we know you're a
busy professional you need to keep track
of your schedules to this sinks without
look over your PC we have meeting
notices here in emails that have
documents that attach to the product
shows PDFs Word PowerPoint documents
Excel spreadsheets all the types of
material you need in your professional
life in addition to that it's a fully
connected product with 3g and Wi-Fi it's
on the AT&amp;amp;T 3g network so if you had
this with you on a daily basis you could
purchase content from our qcom store
that we also announced today and brought
up live today one of the great
advantages of this product is because
the screen is so large we can show
content and bring through the brand
equity of the content the charts that
graphs the features so i'm showing you
an example here of USA Today the money
section and if you look at it it looks
like the money section you normally see
in USA Today and that's important to us
and also important to the publisher the
other great advantage to it is it's all
plastic so there's no glass in the
product so it's shatterproof very
durable carry this around with you on a
daily basis have in your briefcase
haven't your other case there's a lot of
memory on this device there's 8
gigabytes of memory on the device I'm
holding here which we estimate would
hold about 75,000 documents or 7,500
ebooks if you're thinking of it in that
terms so a lot of memory in the device
very easy to use in addition to reading
on this device you can do annotation on
your documents highlight put notes on
top of the content so that if you want
to store that a later time and transfer
to your PC you could do that as well now
you said it can hold everything from
PDFs to powerpoints and things like that
what are the books what kind of store do
you have on this are you branded with a
certain company a different store so our
store is branded cute this hue sore at
qcom our partner is Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and
barnes and noble our store she sits on
the barnes and noble calm platform we
work very closely with them so we have
their book library on our store platform
so when you hear barnes and noble talk
about the fact they're the largest ebook
store but they have over a million
titles that's what we have on here as
well which is great and so in addition
to books we bring the newspapers the
magazine's periodical type content the
books are in epub format which is the
prevailing format in in in the books so
i have superfreakonomics on here and
other books on here that i'm reading and
then the newspapers are in PDF and we
like PDF for newspapers and magazines
because you can preserve the layout of
the content and the graphics and the
pictures and photos and that types of
well i have to pay a subscription to the
AT&amp;amp;T 3g know you would pay a
subscription to the content that you
purchase if you you have the ability to
purchase a single issue or a single book
for that matter but if you wanted to
provide a subscription to fast company
or some of the other magazines i'm
showing here you would pay a monthly
subscription fee just like you would if
you bought the print version but there's
no AT&amp;amp;T 3g piece excellent so when is
this when will this be available we are
taking pre-orders for this device now on
our website at qcom will start shipping
these in april and they'll be available
from from us at qcom also they'll be
available in barnes and over retail
stores and also on barnes a noble calm
and then after we start an april will
announce other distribution partners as
well and what is the cost there are two
models one is a Wi-Fi only model has all
the same software features as the 3g
Wi-Fi model that model has 4 gigabytes
of memory and it's priced at 649 this
model that i'm holding here is 3g Wi-Fi
it also has bluetooth has 8 gigabytes of
memory and this is 799 excellent well
it's definitely targeted towards a more
business market i don't think i could
afford it at the moment so i think I
better stick with my Kindle but man when
I get that good job I'm going to get one
of these for
myself thank you so much Darren all
right physical media absolutely dead i
think this show is proving it and i do
is plenty we couldn't get a DVD of our
logo for the TV here because that's like
i'll be like that do you eat oh yeah you
know with the the roku and the epoxy and
you know we don't have dvds we don't
have cds let's get rid of the books yeah
i will say like the plastic logic q
although it is amazing 600 plus box and
not gonna go for it really sorry
industry though you know is it's so
focused on your business people like the
people that are gonna buy your really
expensive stuff so yeah I didn't
understand I heard a good point that it
you know if Apple came out with that
nobody would you know same thing about
the price it's true but since its not I
don't know since it's not everybody
cares about the price of course I don't
own any Apple products except for my
iphone and I got that for free so how do
we go so yeah now I was able to check
out some gaming kit that I absolutely am
crazy about you know that we are big
rock band fans back 5 and this one is
one that might actually teach me a
little something about playing the
guitar so I'm here at Game bridge
playing some beatles rock band and I
don't feel like I'm playing a toy
anymore this this plastic instrument
here is very similar to what you would
you know find a real guitarist playing
this is I put them what I understand a
midi guitar that is being converted to
to play with the rock band game so we
have all of the frets here and we can
actually strum and it corresponds with
the notes in the game and I'm excited
about this coming to market next
Christmas to you know feel like I'm
actually may be learning something that
could translate potentially to a real
instrument kind of like the rock bands
drums do but way more buttons here this
is this is one of the burnses that's
already out kind of like a MIDI
instrument thing but scale down and
bring this to market as a gaming device
sounds like an awesome proposition for
or you know gamers that want to get into
actually playing some music so you've
heard me talk to you guys about go to
assist expressed before and you know
that I absolutely love it when it comes
to supporting my workforce because it's
just so simple to send them a link in an
email award just go to a website and
type in a like nine digit code and then
boom I'm on their desktop helping them
with whatever they broke and trust me
they find a way to break it but there's
another feature of go to assist express
that just like saved my day just a
little while ago when I was in Toronto
seems that I went out to a hak5 meet up
and had a blast and I don't know how but
I ended up a prone of bozos house
instead of back at my other friends
house where I was encoding the episode
and I really needed to upload it to
revision 3 so that you guys could see in
the morning and I was not at my pc to
get that going but I was smart and I set
up go to assist express on my laptop
with the unattended support so BAM right
from his desktop i downloaded go to
assist and boom back on my laptop you
know gzip thing hak5 into 20 megabit
chunks and using that beautiful roger is
internet in canada to upload a grueling
one point five gigabytes to san
francisco point being go to assist
express is that awesome it helps you
reduce you travel time my case it was
travel time across from toronto to
etobicoke that saved my butt when I
wasn't in any state to be moving
anywhere and it will totally do the same
thing for you I know that you guys are
gonna love it it it saves the day at so
many times it's so much cheaper than
doing all that stuff in person and it's
totally secure 128-bit end-to-end so go
ahead and get yourself a 30 day free
trial you're gonna love it just go over
to go to assist com /h AK the number
five and that's how you get that awesome
offer it helps support us and you know
just give it a shot you're gonna like it
that's a nice prototype concept I can't
refer to come to market I hope it's not
going to be ridiculously expensive I
hope not but you figure between like the
eye on drums and this here from gam
bridge you know like the guy that makes
it has
making MIDI guitars for the last nine
years I really like how its influence
like taking real musical instruments and
turning them into this thing that you
can use with rock band and like guitar
hero and all that stuff I'm sort of
wondering if a guitarist can actually
plan this when may be better than a
ruffian controller I am sure that if
your guitar is it would be probably easy
to pick up a rock band with us now I'm
not sure about what the compatibility is
going to be like I'm not sure if they're
going to have to emulate different
chords to but and i'll let them flush
all that out but the idea that you know
you could get your eye on drums and and
jörg Ambridge guitars and next thing
you know you know you go from rock band
2 hey why don't we plug this into a midi
controller into the USB next thing you
know you're you know you're the next
orgy the band i'm thinking like mid 90s
glam pop techno growl aren't you always
there no no not always no I found
another ebook reader of course the
sexiest lon I the sexiest one well I
think its sexy because it might be so
you know that I'm a huge ebook reader
fan and I came over here and checked out
this thing called the ekta co jet book
light Jerry and Greg are going to tell
me a little bit about this guy's why is
this hardware so cool compared to any
other one well actually we have the most
affordable ereader in the world it has a
price tag of 149 and it's also the only
one that runs on double-a batteries we
use for double-a batteries we also have
a rechargeable version and all you do
you're in the airport you lose batteries
BAM just plug more in and you're set to
go it reads up to 22 hours and we use a
LCD TFT screen instead of being so you
can turn one page to the next as you can
see Jerry can show you one page just in
sleeved we also have six different font
sizes you can increase fonts decrease
fonts you can use the dictionary
function even look up words get
definitions and since we're electronic
dictionary company we've been
implemented our electronic dictionaries
there so you can actually change them
from find an English word get it in
Russian polish
German Spanish everything okay so you
can do different language books and you
said that it turns faster with that new
LCD screen do you have any kind of
problem with glare when you're sitting
outside or anything like that well
actually it's a reflective TFT so even
in direct sunlight and low light
conditions you'll still be able to read
the text pretty clearly now what kind of
a different can output like PDF files on
it and XL or anything like that yeah we
actually have 11 different formats
available including txt PDF and we just
put barnes and nobles drm on it so you
can actually go to barnes n nobles calm
and download your books they're very
cool I'm really interested in this now
how do i download books on to this all
you do plug it into the computer it
comes with a USB to mini USB cord um
plug it in it opens up as an external
storage device then you just drag and
drop make your own files folders and
you're set will I be able to put extra
books on here after I fill it up yep it
actually comes with 112 megabytes
built-in and then we have an SD card
slot right over here it's expandable up
to 32 gigabytes oh that's nice now are
you gonna give me any books for free
when I first buy this uh it actually
comes with a hundred books pre-loaded
it's usually like popular classics like
Ulysses you have like Time Machine Wells
kind of everything very cool what kind
of software does it run it's actually
linux-based so I know you guys are all
into linux and everything like that
because it's open source so you know
maybe we can you guys can do something
with that Hey so it's open sores I can
definitely get ahold of one of those and
maybe hack a little bit of it we see
that little guy this is very cool so
yeah um I'll see you guys later I love
that inexpensive this is let's just get
down to what it is what do you want to
do with an e-book reader you want to
read a book you want to read a book and
that's that's what it's there for it
doesn't play music it doesn't do any of
that crazy stuff you can browse what it
reads books and to be honest my Kindle
that's all I'm doing with it you know it
kind of reminds me of like how the flip
video
was a great like oh hey pop some double
a's in you record your video right to
the internal you there's there's nothing
to it there's a record button right yes
i like how simple this is and how it's
approaching that $99 sweet spot that is
the clothes or just buy it sure why not
ya know why not I mean she we can
probably do some really cool stuff with
it on the show we got to go to New York
and get the product manager strong can
get them to embrace the open source and
it sounds awesome hey I didn't do it
they seem pretty cool about that so
we'll see if we can even get one on to
have some fun hacking with it now what
else did you find ah well you speaking
of hack ability I've been all about the
smartphone recently with the drawer idea
and oh another one that's particularly
time I technol us that I've been what
just like trying to get my hands on
finally did the nokia n900 let's go
check it out I'm here with the nokia
n900 this bad little boy is running
about five hundred and sixty nine
dollars has been available since just
after Thanksgiving and I'm finally
getting my hands on it checking out the
new my mo five operating system you guys
know that this is linux based it's
basically debian and you can just drop
to a shell and do whatever you want with
it you could even run firefox on here
now it's an ARM processor but that's the
beautiful thing about linux and just you
know fire RPGs you c compiler for
whatever you want their app store is the
OV App Store which isn't available just
yet but for the geeks that want to get
their hands dirty there are SDK is
available and there are my mo apps
within the my mo community and websites
you find that sort of stuff the hardware
itself is a little bit it'sit's kind of
thick but it's also quite the device we
got Bluetooth in here we got Wi-Fi we've
got GPS 32 gigs of memory expandable of
course with micro sdhc 5 megapixel
camera one of the things I really like
about the camera is that we actually
have a cover here on the Carl Zeiss lens
dual LED flash there and this is one of
the features that i haven't seen
anywhere else with built-in kickstand so
you can just go ahead and watch your
movies on the plane no problem not
having to hold it interestingly the
stylus I don't know why this is making a
comeback but then again with a high
resolution display it might be your only
chance of actually clicking on what
you want to click on so definitely an
interesting new idea in the market you
just buy it right from Nokia USA com or
one of their plaid flagship stores you
pop your sim card in it from t-mobile or
AT&amp;amp;T in the US and there you go a little
expensive since you don't get the
subsidy that you would normally with the
carrier but I think it's got some legs
especially as a newcomer with linux as a
phone as opposed to the other tablet the
n810 devices is very going to be very
interesting especially when it comes to
those hardcore geeks that want your VNC
your SSH and all the fixings right there
get your you know its systems
administrators geek phone going on you
know give them the droid a little bit of
run but I want to tell you about gamefly
because if you love video games you're
going to love their service they are the
largest online video game rental service
with over 7,000 new and classic titles
on all consoles and hand able to choose
from their plans start 1599 a month and
gamefly members can rent from one to
four games at any time and keep them or
as long as you like you don't have to
send back when you do they send you
another one if you really like the game
you can go over to gamefly calm click
keep it and you get to keep it I did
this kind of rate best of all hak5 fans
get a free two week trial when they go
over to gamefly.com slash hak5 some
restrictions applies to your site for
details so Shannon tell me is this the
phone for you or not no I mean it's a
geek phone and it's probably really like
hackable and everything but I'm
perfectly happy hacking my iPhone you
got to get a neckbeard in a ponytail and
an n900 you can grow the beard and grow
your ponytail and with your baseball cap
or whatever you want to do but
I'm perfectly fine with no beard I'm
just happy to hear at least this is what
the guy told me that they are continuing
to develop my mo and that this is not
the last my mo device that we are going
to see because I've been healing
conflicting stuff I've been here in like
the Nokia is given up on on and you know
it's like you just release and then
you're gonna give up on that sweet Oso
you've been building for longest time
finally it's realizing a stream where
it's like notice everything is 3g yeah
and everything has a sim card Josie yeah
so and everybody at the top I've talked
to you has been like oh we don't know
who our partners are going to be for 3g
yet they do with AT&amp;amp;T and it'll be 3 to
18 agency for everybody I'll just take
my sim card it stick it in everything
you for the endcard limited data yes yes
one sim card with all the devices what's
gone i won we've got a couple of devices
that will take those sim cards on next
week's show we are taking a look at the
lenovo the new smart book the one with
the what does it call them are fun yeah
yeah it's got easy it's got a its not an
x86 processor forgiving to the
snapdragon asked to write qualcomm so
we're checking that out next week I've
got a roundup of some of the coolest
little pocket cameras that are getting
loads of new features so as you found
ebooks that are getting simple I found
pocket cameras that are getting more
expensive and more bells and whistles
but that's awesome as well as sweet
gaming peripherals that will blow your
mind and a drone to take up the world I
can't believe it it's that drone oh
