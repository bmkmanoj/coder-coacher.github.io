support us directly at H a k shop comm
hello and welcome to pineapple
university i'm darren kitchen and today
we are going to get our Wi-Fi pineapple
marked v configured we have it right
here
newly unboxed and I have my Ethernet
cable plugged into it already the other
end of that is plugged into my laptop
here and I'm actually going to be using
Windows to set this up the first time
and now most importantly we're going to
use wall power so if you say got a Wi-Fi
pineapple with a battery pack this is
not the time go ahead and leave that on
the charger put it there so it'll be all
juiced up and ready to go for when
you're you know ready for your first
employment but for setting up the
firmware which is what we're doing in
this video we want to make sure we're
using the wall adapter I'm going to go
ahead and plug that guy in here and I'm
going to break out the manual so of
course inside the manual in addition to
these beautiful little Wi-Fi pineapple
decals we also find our firmware notes
in fact attached to this is the micro SD
card so go ahead and pull that off and
just pop it in to the side here that's
one of those little spring-loaded guys
who you go ahead and push that it'll pop
right back out
real simple it will not boot without the
micro SD card and on the first boot you
need to go ahead and load the firmware
so the reason that we do this is we
provide with every Wi-Fi pineapple the
latest version of the firmware so you
always get the freshest pic and this way
you know your Wi-Fi pineapple would be
set up and ready to use optimally from
the get-go so just pull that off pop it
in there and we're ready to just go
ahead and power on I'll just provide it
some power here from included adapter
and the first thing you'll notice all
the lights come on the green light
indicates that we have power and in just
a moment that yellow light will blink to
indicate that it's looking for the
firmware files
once it's found the firmware files
that'll begin flashing and will notice a
solid blue light at which point we just
simply wait five minutes so let's do
that and after a five minute wait we can
tell that our Wi-Fi pineapple mark five
is ready for setup on the computer we
get this nice little display of LED
firework goodness here and that means we
can come over to our computer and it's
really as simple as just launching a web
browser if you do the ethernet cable
directly from your computer to the
pineapple it's automatically going to
assign you an IP address from DHCP so
there's no need to mess around with
anything static and simply in just a
matter of pulling up your web browser
and heading over to 172 dot 16 to 42.1 :
14 71 so the address needs to look just
like that that : 14 71 is important we
go there and we'll be presented with our
welcome to the pineapple and we simply
click continue and the first things
first we're going to set a password and
this should be a good one so go ahead
and give it a good password type that in
twice and we accept the EULA and the
License Agreement and set our password
and at this point the pineapple is
mostly finished configuring itself it's
just going to do one last reboot to
initialize the system and then in just a
moment this area right here we'll go
ahead and say continue and at that point
we should be done and we can come over
here and see we are in fact rebooting we
have our blinking blue LED to indicate
that and our solid green to indicate
that we have power so it'll be just a
moment and we've completed booting we
have our amber LED here to indicate that
we're connected via this Ethernet cable
and if I look back over at my web
browser I can see in fact all I have to
do is click continue here and give it
the password that I've provided and
maximize that and there we go I'm logged
in for the first time and ready to start
having so much fun with the Wi-Fi
pineapple I hope you're following along
and I hope you join us at you
Wi-Fi pineapple calm where you can find
more videos and examples and lessons and
all of the links to the resources such
as the forums and the chat because I
will be there as well as the rest of the
community welcoming you and with that
I'm going to say class dismissed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
