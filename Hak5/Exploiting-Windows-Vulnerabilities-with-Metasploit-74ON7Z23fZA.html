I was over your place and after you went
to bed I was kind of bored decided to
play around with the security auditing
tool auditor a lot of good stuff about
it's actually really cool I prefer to
wop it's now because the new op because
is wax based on slackware and I gotta be
honest like I have a die-hard you know
knoppix family a lot Vic it's awesome so
I did boot it up and played around with
it for a little bit and one of the
things I wanted to talk about was the
metasploit framework yeah that it's it's
actually pretty creepy it's creepy how
easy it is to use first place I heard
about it was iron geeks website it's got
some really cool security video
tutorials and stuff like that and check
it out really cool anyhow the metasploit
framework I keep fumbling over that
basically what it does is it sucks down
exploits and it gives you like a list of
exploits you can you can perform with
the payload yeah and you space it like
point and click it's got a web interface
so it makes it like ridiculously script
kiddie like it's really bad really I did
notice that one of your machines is not
Pat's yes I'm okay there's a good reason
okay listen um when windows XP service
pack 2 came out it's just the complete
bastardization boys have you guys
patched up are you guys patched I'm sure
they're probably like I'm back all right
cuz I always patch I mean I will know
listen I patch all my machines with
system administrator keep everything up
to date but this one machine I used to
see this is the show right at the
torrance and to get the best fees on
this torrents you have to be used in
service pack 1 because service pack 2
just kind of met Sarah I know there's an
update I'm actually but they're funny
thing is this one ever really bad
security exploits for service pack 1 as
a matter of fact oh what'd you do oh
well I want to explain a little bit
about the framework first it's actually
got a lot of exploit so you can do like
for example once a target is I think
it's a SharePoint if you're running
frontpage extensions right even like
Oracle 9 and Microsoft sequel service
hardcore seeing like even I think apples
samba server as well it's been pretty
well but one of the exploits is
microsoft windows XP for service pack 1
right and
so you can pull up the web interface and
select you know I think it was the RPC
139th blaster yep yes a one yep exactly
were able to shut down my machine no no
no actually it kind of like takes the
same attack and then you can choose
which payload you want I was actually a
large selection of payloads like okay
for example I selected the exploit the
next page was you select a payload it's
got ones like believe it or not like you
can execute a command yes on the machine
okay also like get a command prompt whoa
yes it's a hardcore really scary okay
and you can also like this is this is a
really funny one okay so don't get mad
but you can also bind the VNC show okay
so uh I got my desktop I didn't get on I
me it's like point click I mean I can't
take credit yes I me I'm just like I
don't think anybody can call themselves
i use their medicine oh this is so so
badly so lazy so it's more script kiddie
than Cain and Abel it's much more sense
it's so badly we got on like desk
terribly oh dude your desktop is hot by
the way like I can't take that really
that was Tom be Tavia forms you like
possum is also i did website was right
that's really all you guys check it out
but getting back on subject yeah it's so
easy to use it's ridiculous so its most
of the exploits on there or alike I'll a
little bit outdated so if you keep all
your systems patch it's only mrs. mattis
play updates or any nice actually it's
funny that you mention that because
there is like an update script on there
Oh your hands I haven't played a round
of it but I think you can actually sync
it up with like security focus ex-boy
tree and package alarm and just like you
can go out and search and find an
exploit if you don't have one there a
particular system you're targeting it's
pretty nasty I also penned I mean like
it was designed at a great application
it makes you got I mean really a lot of
sex auditors but at the same time it's
got a bad dragon city side effect you
know so I mean you know the good
outweighs the bad i think in this case
old elides I mean nobody's gonna call
themselves a heck no no nobody calls
themself a hacker using this shit but
it's it's pretty dead weight it's pretty
it's pretty crazy what you can do with
starts of limited knowledge of like
security and
an ex boy oh okay what's the what's the
moral of the story here the moral of the
story is just don't use windows this
game but you don't know if you're gonna
use windows if you have to use windows
you definitely patch it up I mean it's
like one of those tiny times have we
said that it's one of those things like
if you if your boss is like I don't feel
like updating yeah yeah you're up check
it now you know what do you think about
it now two clicks yeah so its target
it's a lot of fun to play around with
but just don't use it in the wrong ways
of course not of course we would not
promote that sounds like a really nifty
tools and thanks for owning my box I had
to grow up date now I suggest that
everybody else do the same for any of
the stuff that he's talked about here
check the shower Chuck hacker work whoo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
