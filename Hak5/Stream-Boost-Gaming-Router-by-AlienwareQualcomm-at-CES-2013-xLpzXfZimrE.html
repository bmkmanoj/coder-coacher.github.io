go further frack 5 i'm darren kitchen
here at CES 2013 checking out some more
cool stuff with qualcomm atheros this
time we're looking at some products that
are going into alienware routers this is
going to be of interest to our hardcore
networking and gaming enthusiasts tell
me about the the technology that's going
into these products yesterday it's a
technic technology called stream boost
and what it basically does is it
identifies exactly which application is
running on any particular device in your
network and then basically sets a policy
on it so it gives it the exact bandwidth
and networking treatment that it needs
so for a game for example it says hey
look it's a specific game like Call of
Duty it needs an exact bandwidth
requirement and then we make sure and
ensure it has the lowest possible
latency to give the gamer the best
possible experience how does that differ
from some of the quality of service
features that you would find in other
you know consumer routers with some of
the more high-end ones that we find
today so this is an advanced force of
traffic shaping so what today's writers
do is they prioritize one application
but that one application takes up all
your bandwidth there goes your entire
home network what we do is we basically
say hey look it's a particular
application here's the critical
bandwidth it needs and then we make sure
we allocate to as many different
applications inside of your network as
possible so more people can have a
flawless experience in your home network
given the ISP connection you have so how
does this differ from something like
deep packet inspection so we actually
use a statistics base engine where we
look at a different attributes of a
particular flow and we can actually
verify what that is and then we so we
can look at things and tell if it's
encrypted we can still tell what it is
and we can actually quickly on the fly
with very little CPU actually detect all
the different types of applications
running on your network so does that
mean that I need to periodically get
updates with different signatures for
different traffic types so that is the
optimal way to do it so if a new game
comes out or a new application or a new
device what we actually do is we have an
opt-in cloud service that basically is
constantly monitoring traffic and when
something new comes out it basically
detects it and we will send it back down
to that router in real time and the
router will basically be updated to
detect that game or that application
going forward like how you say opt in
cloud service obviously with the show
like hack five people are very privacy
concerned
you shown me some really slick stuff
that the cloud service does as far as
actually mapping the different nodes on
my network and what they're doing well
what do you know what can you tell me
about privacy when it comes to that so
there's two things so first of all the
cloud is absolutely opt-in but second of
all even if you don't even opt into the
cloud will still give you the benefits
of all the different detection and
policy settings we're doing all you
basically have to do is go into your UI
upgrade the firmware and it will include
all of the latest and greatest so you'll
get the benefits of the cloud even if
you don't actually opt into the cloud
itself so you say with these signatures
you were able to you know kind of build
some heuristics I'm like oh this looks
like Call of Duty or this looks like
this kind of traffic and you know give
it whatever it prefers you and you say
that you don't actually have to look at
every single package so it's better on
the hardware but what is the hardware
like you know we're very familiar with
qualcomm atheros chips here what's under
the hood so we basically have a qualcomm
atheros NP you if it's a really cool
part the really cool chips that were
showing here is we have our 11 our vibe
which is the name of it 11ac hardware
running this product so it's a three by
three AC 3 by 3 end product that will
give you you know 1.3 gigabits
potentially of AC with another 450 of n
so that's an AC 1750 router I like the
way you did that ok so so is this a
reference platform right now who are
some of the partners and no alienware
obviously and I mean where is this
product go is this an alienware specific
thing so we've been working with
anywhere for very long time that the
cool part about alienware is they make
these beautiful machines that have the
latest and greatest hard wearing them
but they still are at the mercy of their
network at certain time so anywhere is
forward thinking enough to say hey look
what's best for the gamer but what's
best for the gamer is actually
controlling the entire ecosystem and
saying hey when that packet first comes
into the house I'm going to control it
as optimally as possible to make sure
the gamer has the absolute best possible
experience all right well wouldn't you
say though that ultimately this is a
social issue because if your roommate is
watching Netflix while you're trying to
game obviously you need to kick your
roommate out there's a lot to that
statement right there but the cool part
is with it with a 10 megabit connection
or a 5 megabit connection you can
actually do a lot more than you think if
you organize your network well what
we've seen is with a 10 megabits you can
run a 1080p YouTube a 720p YouTube run
two games run a skype call and in itunes
all at the same time with no problem as
long as your traffic shaping your
network appropriately but with the
standard router today that treats all
different applications like they're
exactly the same you'd never possibly be
able to do that scenario this is really
cool stuff when can we actually expect
this to be coming into our homes so
you'll see some versions of stream to
start as early as spring of this year so
cool thank you so much really appreciate
it for continued coverage of all things
CES 2013 be sure to head over to
revision 3.com NPR has a great public
radio app that is compatible with Ford
SYNC AppLink this means that when you're
in your car and you're on the go and you
don't want to touch your phone you don't
have to you have all your favorite
playlists all your favorite mpr shows
right on your phone ready for voice
commands hourly news i'm louise
schiavoni house Republican leaders are
challenges though as you want to listen
to your favorite shows like Morning
Edition and all things considered you
just have them right there in your new
Ford car thank you again to Ford for
sponsoring this hak5 CES special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
