hungry hungry breadboards all that and
more this time on hack five this episode
of hack five is brought to you by
domain.com hello and welcome to this
episode of hack five my name is Shannon
Morse i'm darren kitchen and this is
your weekly dose of Technol s very
exciting show indeed yeah
many many announcements this is the
actual episode after the warehouse party
announcing the announcement he announced
min of the announcement now that
everything is finalized in legit job
dude so I heard that you you'd been
doing a little show with our friend
Patrick Norton for a while I called a
tech Cilla tekzilla and that ad has run
its course it has but I hear that
there's something new coming yes there
is
it's called tech thing duck doctor done
and there is that the exact word that is
in fact the theme song I don't know
maybe gotten something back I've been
keeping track of my emails wait for that
but all of the other stuff is yeah I'm
super excited for that me too so tech
thing is gonna be the new revision the
new generation of tekzilla we're gonna
bring it back to the old-school sense of
tekzilla where we answer your viewer
questions but it's for a broad audience
this is song to me as crazy as hack 5 is
you know it's gonna be fun it's so yeah
unlike hack 5 it's going to be fun no
I'm excited because you know for the
longest time that has been our sister
show and I got very sad with the rev3
announcement of the getting rid of all
of the internal programming and becoming
a thing and so now I'm like yeah we have
our sister back
yeah our sister is Patrick Norton oh
it's so than you that's weird what were
the other announcements oh right hmm
bringing back threat wire most like
minute pineapple University let's code
um and a bunch of other stuff that's
awesome well I'm excited for all these
new shows and all the ones that we are
bringing back me too and a lot of our
friends are gonna be joining us here at
the hack 5 warehouses we kind of like do
a little art collective thing and it's
fun so keeping it old school podcast
truths through to the heart of the
nature of
keep now how does that work you mean
like creators okay 11 let's not go off
on a tirade Shannon we're doing hack 5
uh so um we're very excited because I
know that you have been diving deep into
the Arduino stuff I have as I saw some
blinking lights in her office earlier so
I'm excited about my light its leaks
that's right I'm you two at home we add
snobs and make her light blink Oh Oh why
I guess I could set it up so that you
know a tweet makes it blink there you go
internet of things just anything ease in
fact that harkens back to like Episode
one of hack 5 where we made your lights
turn on and off yeah I'm so excited
about it so it's it's super simple but
it gives you a great example of how
breadboards work so today I'm gonna be
doing an intro to breadboards I love
that you're building foundation of that
stuff because we've been working on some
pineapple hdk stuff and I know some
viewers at home or building robots for
that and it's going to be exciting to
kind of like - hi all that together oh
we're really working in some kind of
similar infrastructure there and you're
doing some fun steps - yeah speaking of
infrastructure I'm tackling some
virtualization stuff today it's been a
while since we looked at building a high
performance virtualization cluster in
fact one of the nodes is behind me we
did this Katie you're doing it is it
spinning and everything we did this a
couple years ago with proxmox ve and
things have changed so we're gonna take
a look at all the new hotness 'iz and
what we will be bringing to the server
rack and thank you to the guy at the
warehouse party that offered to donate
his server rack with between the 600
mega bit lines that we're getting and
all of that other stuff we're gonna be
having some fun stuff here in fact stay
tuned to the end we've got some land
party announcements used it tuned for
fun things there oh and by the way yes
this is my natural hair somebody once
commented and said that they hated the
curls in the perm and I should not do a
perm but guess what this is natural it's
raining outside
I ain't straightening my hair oh that's
right it's it's the at the bay area a
Hello storm yes it were hashtag hello
storm yes yes it's that's me okay okay
you stay curly and I'm gonna rock over
to our beef
this is so exciting we haven't had a
second set since the hack house gonna
steal this and we're going to talk a
little bit about virtualization so that
machine that you saw on the wall over
there is in fact running our first node
or it will be our first node the rest of
them will probably go in a regular rack
right but it's really exciting to get
back to this because it has been a while
since we built a high performance
virtualization cluster and when we did
that we did it with proxmox ve it's a
hypervisor it's similar to VM where's
vSphere Microsoft's got their Windows
hypervisor there's you know Citrix
XenServer and you know what I liked
about proxmox is that it's mostly just a
beautiful front-end for two really cool
technologies KVM and openvz and it's
been a while since I last looked at
proxmox and since then their model has
changed a little bit now there's an
additional subscription service to get
access to the stable branch it's still
GPL so you can still find all of the
code in there git repository it's kind
of a pain now but you know thankfully
the Community Edition starts at just
four euros they still think they're
doing really cool stuff but it brought
me to wondering okay what other
alternatives are there and so since
we're going to be bringing in a lot of
servers here to the hack 5 warehouse
given that we are about to be receiving
600 megabits of bandwidth and 52 static
IP addresses long story short it was the
only way that we were going to get
decent bandwidth in here so we kind of
had to swallow a monster behemoth of
bandwidth but that's ok because we're
going to fill up ye-olde server rack and
the most efficient way to do that is
with virtualization I mean virtual
machines just do a better job of
utilizing resources they make better you
know they just do better with things
like storage and scalability and I love
backups with just like snapshots it just
it makes life so much easier and so
recapping from last time when we went
down this road of virtualization I was
basically keen on two technologies that
proxmox does a very good job of managing
and that is KVM which is a kernel-based
virtual machine and it basically turns
the Linux kernel into a hypervisor it's
been around since 2007 this
thing is awesome it utilizes the
virtualization extensions built into
most modern computer hardware like
Intel's VTX or AMD's amd-v and anyway
it's great for running multiple devices
like you can have a server and sure
under the hood if there's like Linux on
the kernel Linux kernel in the KVM on
top of that you could have OS 10 and you
could have FreeBSD and you get up Linux
and Windows and all of that other stuff
which will be really cool because we're
going to need that in our infrastructure
the other thing that we're going to want
is openvz
and it's kind of like on the flip side
of virtualization technology I'm really
keen on it because it's more of a
virtualized environment rather than a
proper hypervisor what that means is you
can't run OS 10 or oh s X or whatever
you want to call it or Windows or
FreeBSD on top of it it's just straight
Linux but you know what for shells for
most VPS and things that I want to do
and the things that we're going to bring
you in doing since we're going to have
all those IP addresses Linux is going to
be just fine for that and it also on the
plus side means that openvz the virtual
machines they run on top of that same
Linux kernel so you don't have all of
the overhead of managing all of those
different you know systems and it over
all the whole thing is just dippy unlike
KVM where you have to allocate like
different chunks of memory to each VM
like this Windows Server 2008 box gets
four gigs of ram and that OS ten box
gets two gigs of ram or whatever you can
actually kind of share the memory across
all of those open VM or open SAR openvz
instances which is pretty cool either
way both open via both openvz and KVM
have their pros and cons but really when
paired together I feel like they make an
awesome team and it's why I really loved
proxmox ve and really it just adds a
nice front end management GUI of
Awesomeness so looking for alternatives
the first two that I am interested in
and trust me there's plenty the first
two alternatives that I came across that
look really good
our overt and open node now over is what
I'm kind of running here and
that's what I'm gonna be looking at
today it is pretty cool and that it can
be installed as an all-in-one hypervisor
or you can install it on your distro of
choice so if we're running Fedora core
or red hat or CentOS or Gen 2 or Debian
you can just have like an all-in-one
installation that gets all the
dependencies and everything you want all
set up for you which is really cool and
if you want to test drive it and this is
where this is where the other one didn't
quite pan out you can actually just boot
off of a you knowyou USB in this case
and try it out and there live version is
based on CentOS and it just makes it
really easy to dive in so it feels
really polished so I'll go through it so
I've basically just booted into here and
the first thing you see is you get like
pop up saying hey we're going to do the
all-in-one install you want automatic or
you want to pick and choose all the
stuff and since this is just as a demo
I'm like do automatic and you can see
here it actually starts the engine which
is the hypervisor and all of that it
starts the you know that the disk
management starts the HTTP service I've
got my NFS started I didn't have to
think about anything all of that was
already set up and really all I have to
do now is hit OK and pull up a browser
and hit up localhost so I'm going to go
to HTTP colon s colon slash slash yeah
there it is localhost dot local domain
and of course configure this for your
environment
come on and I'm in offline mode offline
mode and let's try just doing it this
way ok so there's no place like one two
seven two zero two zero two one and in
this case I'm going to go to the
administration portal and yes this is
not a signed certificate which is
totally cool because it's my machine so
I know what I'm doing
thank you Firefox we're going to add an
exception and now we can do this over
SSL username is admin and password is
overt OVI RT by default so you can see
here is your control panel and you can
actually see all of your different
clusters whether they be your different
nodes
of running your hypervisors or even your
storage here they've got plenty of
templates which makes it easy to deploy
things like Windows and Linux servers
it's got plenty of storage options like
NFS and I scuzzy even G cluster FS it
even does USB pass-through which is
something I'm quite keen on that that's
where you can basically just take like
say I don't know I a wireless adapter
and then plug it into the machine and
say hey that device with this vendor ID
and Product ID send it to that VM which
is pretty cool and you can manage all of
this just from this really pretty GUI if
you've ever played with other
hypervisors like you know VMware this
should feel pretty familiar and it makes
it really easy to deploy additional
nodes to our cluster throughout our data
center or we can play with our
networking settings it's got all of that
stuff built in so deploying virtual
machines as easy as you know just
choosing a template or you know just
doing new VM and walking through a
wizard I haven't gotten too far into
this just yet I'm still just dabbling
but I must say so far everything seems
quite polished and it seems to fit the
bill as far as what I'm looking for
which is just like a nice open source
thing to kind of get out of the way and
let KVM and openvz shine the other one
that I'm going to be checking out here
is open node which seems very similar it
has its own management interface that is
its own VM and then it also has a
text-based one which you can always get
to over SSH and then it's done like I
don't know if it's with end curses or
what but it's like a pretty GUI it's a
tui it's a text user interface but it's
all graphical and pretty anyway that
seems pretty cool I'm gonna be checking
that out and I wanted to hear what your
thoughts are as we get into the
beginnings of this project there's still
a lot to do here we've got to figure out
what we're going to be doing about
storage and we got to set up our cluster
and all of our nodes and the network and
it's just going to be awesome so that's
my first take on overt I'll also be
looking at open note and I love to hear
what you guys think so hit us up
feedback at hack 5 organ hey maybe when
we get all this together we'll even
start offering shells and VPS isn't good
stuff like that but until then we're
going to
a quick break and I will see you in a
bit doesn't matter whether you're
interested in running virtual machines
on your bare metal or bare metal on your
virtual machines I have no idea how that
would work but when that killer idea
hits we're gonna need to snagged
yourself a domain name and web hosting
fast maybe you're the one that's gonna
figure out are on bare metal on a
virtual machine and you'll head over to
domain comm and you'll find that they're
quick domain discovery system and
they're easy checkout processes will
have your website up and running in no
time and I've told you guys before that
I love domain comm mainly they're
affordable reliable or easy to use but
mostly because they have an awesome
active media presence on social media
where you can tweet them at domain.com
and see what it's just like a fun place
to do business and the guys over at
domain.com oh those guys they want to
hook you off they're huge fans of hack 5
and so they have this special coupon
code called hack 5 I know it's really
easy to remember so when you're at
checkout to save yourself an extra 15%
off and when you think domain names
think domain.com it's time for the
trivia question of the week last week's
trivia question was which programming
language was designed for managing data
held in a relational database management
system it was created by Chamberlain and
Boyce at IBM in the early 1970s and the
answer is SQL or equal now this week's
trivia question is what widely used an
influential programming language was
developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken
Thompson at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs in the early
1970s answer that over a hak5 org slash
trivia for your chance to win some
awesome hack five beauties
with all the excitement over Arduinos
and microcontrollers I decided I might
want to figure out all the other
different components that are included
with building prototypes that includes
bread boards and LEDs and resistors and
motors and everything else that's
included in a little box of shiny
awesomeness so the first thing that I
wanted to discuss is a breadboard
because there's not really a point in
trying to build your own prototype if
you don't understand why something works
in the first place so it's really nice
to get an introduction so first off
we're talking about these bread boards
aka proto boards so the reason why it's
called a proto board is because people
build prototypes on them but the earth
also the other reason that they call
them bread boards is because literally
back in the day electronic engineers
they would actually take bread boards
the literal bread boards from a kitchen
and they would wire circuitry around
them and into them so that's why they
call them bread boards but nowadays we
have these beautiful super shiny and
lovely little pieces of plastic that
have a whole bunch of pins on them and a
whole bunch of metal on the inside so on
the inside of a breadboard you have a
whole bunch of separate nickel silver
Clips they are conductive they just sit
inside the ABS plastic and they're all
insulated so all of them are separate
except for if they're in a separate
region now regions of are all these
different holes those are divided into
little strips so first off we have a bus
trip if we look closely at this really
tall one that I have here that goes from
line one all the way down to line 64 and
it has a b c d e f g h i j so a whole
bunch of different rows going down we
also have a plus and minus and a plus
and minus on both sides now these are
called the bus strips so these basically
provide any kind of power to a circuit
now you can have one power in one ground
so the power would be the plus and the
ground would be the negative but these
sides aren't connected there's only one
metal strip going all the way down the
plus side and one metal strip going all
the way down the negative side and those
two don't ever touch so they're
completely separated from each other so
first off you have those bus strips
which are the ones just
on both sides and the next you have this
one in the middle and those are called
socket strips so these are where you're
going to hold all those different
components whether those are your fans
or your motors or your buttons or your
wires or your resistors pretty much
whatever you want you can hold into the
middle of these and all those different
pins and I have a few hundred pins on
here that I can actually use because I
can use everything from A to J and from
column one all the way down to column 64
now each of these columns are
electrically combined to each other
they're connected with all sorts of
metal clips now if we look a little bit
closer on here I'll get it down here for
you each of the clips are connected from
one side to the other so they're
connected from A to E and then from F to
J they are not connected from 1 to 2 or
from 25 down to 2 down to 30 or so on
and so forth each one has a metal clip
on the inside and each of the metal
Clips can hold a wire inside of it so
that way you don't have to use any sort
of soldering which is really nice
because for prototypes you might want to
take it apart you might need to fix
something you know something like that
now you also might have noticed that on
my breadboard I have this little middle
rivet where there aren't any pins
there's nothing there there's no metal
this is basically just a rivet that cuts
the breadboard in half so that way you
have two separate sides that you can use
all sorts of different circuitry on and
that circuitry is not going to touch
it's not going to be connected it won't
short itself out because it's on two
separate sides so I guess you could
consider it kind of two separate
breadboard halves now lastly they do
have notches on the sides too for
example this large one that I have has
three notches on the top bottom and in
the middle then one also has notches on
the sides those can be used to connect
this breadboard to another breadboard of
the same size so if you run out of pins
you don't have to worry you don't have
to take apart your prototype you can
just grab another breadboard snap it on
and then you'll have extra additional
pins that you can use now for my
prototype so the one that I'm using here
has a whole bunch of different
connections a whole bunch of additional
pieces to it so first off we have the
Arduino of course and then we also have
the LED which is right here
and third we have a whole bunch of wires
the one two and three wires next we have
a resistor which is found right there
and a push button right here and last is
the breadboard
ah so nice and simple so first off the
Arduino that's your microcontroller the
breadboard is going to be used for
additional circuitry for all your
different components and then we have
all these different wires so the wires
you might look at those and be like why
did she use green blue and yellow I
don't understand why those different
colors matter well they don't really
matter if you're just doing its really
simple prototype like this but when you
get a really really big prototype going
and you want to separate things
depending on their power depending on if
there are 3.3 volts or 5 volts or if
they're ground or if they're connected
to a specific piece of component you
might want to use a specific color in
that matter now these ones I just have
them all set up to go from one spot to
another they don't really matter at this
moment greens going from one place to
another blue the same yellow the same so
I didn't really set them up in any
correct form or fashion but each of
these I should mention are 20 to 22
gauge now I chose that size because
that's the size that will fit into these
pins ah now you know now next up we have
resistors so resistors they're kind of
complicated there's a little bit of math
that goes into resistance because
resistance has this whole electricity
math thing that goes on with them with
ohms I believe they're called so
basically just remember for this segment
here they all have electric resistance
that doesn't change and they all limit
the flow of electricity from one end to
another depending on what specific thing
that you're working on for your
prototype I'll do a whole bunch more
information on a future segment but for
now that's all you need to really know
now let's move on to our code for this
example so for my code for this example
I basically want in my Arduino to blink
every time I press down a button so for
this code this is my example number 2
this is just a little comment at the top
I want to turn on the LED while the
button is pressed if the button is not
pressed I wanted to turn
off the LED so it's completely off until
I actually put pressure on the button
and it creates a constant flow of
electricity to the LED so first off we
have a constant int and this first one
is the LED and this is describing the
LED as being in pin 13 so that is on the
physically on the Arduino board next up
we have the button so I named this
second int button and this one is going
to be physically button seven or pin
seven excuse me and lastly here we have
int value equals zero so this vowel is
the state of the pin so that is
basically the starting point for the pin
itself now when you go down a little bit
further this is where you get into some
more interesting stuff now you might
remember last week when I mentioned
inputs and outputs so an input is going
to be anything that causes an event an
output is going to be what happens after
that events so first off we have the LED
is going to be triggered by something so
it's going to be the output the button
is going to be what triggers something
so it's going to be the input scrolling
down a little bit further and we have
our loop so first off we start with the
vowel Val equals digital read so this
basically means that the Arduino is
going to be reading something from the
code which in this case is going to be
button so it's going to be reading
whatever the button is doing and
depending on whatever code I write is
going to tell the LED what to do since
that's the output so next up I have my
if-else statement so this is my little
if-else down here first off we have the
value equals high and last week we
mentioned that high equals on digital
write is going to be a LED equals high
so now if the button is pressed it's
going to turn on the LED to be higher or
on else digital right LED equals low so
else if the button is not pressed it's
going to tell it to be off and then we
just close our statement with the nice
little curly brackets at the bottom now
what I do after this is I hit verify and
then I can hit upload and it should
upload within a couple of seconds to my
Arduino now once you have that completed
you should be able to do this so I have
my LED right here my buttons right here
on the breadboard you'll notice
press it and the LED goes off it works
yay so I'm going to show you a couple of
specific things on here first of all
over here I have my green pen my green
wire plugged into the 5 volts next I
have a ground pin my ground wire is
going into the blue wire is going to
ground and that's being fed over to my
resistor the resistor is being fed from
the blue pen over to the button and to
the yellow wire the yellow wire is going
to bring whatever I tell the button to
do so in this case pressing it over to
pin 7 and pin 7 is going to tell the LED
what to actually do and lastly of course
the green is the 5 volts and that's
going to tell give me some kind of power
for the button to actually do something
so that's about it and I hope that kind
of explain what a breadboard is how it
works and how you can actually set up
some kind of code combination with your
Arduino and breadboard to make something
happen it's kind of cool it's very
simple I know but it's a good starting
point for anybody who is never really
used an Arduino before I hope this got
helped you actually if you want to you
can email me feedback at hak5 org with
your comments or suggestions and let me
know what you want to see me build in
the future I'll be back next week with
more ardougne toes stay tuned
that's his better wraps up this week's
episode of hack 5 but before we get
going I'm very excited
for what shinu will let you like
yourself some lamb game I love playing
games
oh well with some grants mmm my god just
like just like mom used to make them oh
let's just look if you hadn't noticed
it's about to be 2015 oh man
which means oh there's that and also
hak5 is cuz backs i was born in 2005 i
gosh hatch times gonna be 10 years so
check this out
January 3rd here at the warehouse we're
having an epic LAN so bring your laptop
because it'll probably run it cuz we're
playing it nothing that was played
without noting that let's not red dragon
5 no we're gonna save lor d for the BBS
but we're gonna play counter-strike
counter-strike Unreal Tournament duh yes
match yes and instagib and all sorts of
good stuff there
I guess few teeth 2003 falls under the
category yeah was made before 2005 what
else um Wyatt why am I forgetting Duke
Nukem can't forget that one break out
your DOSBox we're gonna have a little
land party action so the thing is you're
going to want to sign up because we will
fill this one and we're gonna have to
cap it off and say sorry but yeah let's
fill the switch right so head over to
hak5 org slash land party and sign up
it's going to be January 3rd so bring
your hangover bring your laptop bring
bring out your dead okay look things and
that bring out your dead videogames
actually seriously we're gonna be
passing around like the hard drive Oh
videogames oh my god they're all gonna
be old and we don't have barely any
bandwidth hear all the details hacked
org slash land so I guess I need to
carry on wait here that's what it is
well I prefer red bring the level you
know what is easier how web my laptop if
you want to bring your pimp and tower
you've got some house water cooled rig
you want to show me an aquarium bubbles
and everything that's cool bring it
online halo
Paul's requesting halo there have been
I'm really good at halo there were some
requests for Mario Kart oh yeah so we
might
that out on the giant projector yeah it
