audible.com welcome to hack tip the show
where we break down concepts tools and
techniques for hackers network gurus and
IT ninjas
I'm your host Shannon Morse and today
we're cracking down on my Windows PC
optimizing it for the fastest
performance it should be no surprise to
anyone that Linux is faster than Windows
and it's dude one undeniable fact
they're icons I mean come on how is a
flag supposed to win a race the Linux
Mac Scott tux the penguin he has two
feet and thus he can run a lot faster
than a stationary little Windows flood
even the known desktop is represented by
a single foot at least the gnome could
hop faster than a silly flag just waving
around in the air and not going anywhere
and apples oh don't even get me started
on apples I mean at least they're round
and they can roll right yeah okay I
digress suffice it to say if you've been
on Windows for any length of time it's
gotten a bit slow like really slow
seriously slow and today we're speeding
it way back up now you may have
uninstalled several never been used
programs and organized and deleted
several files but you find your computer
still runs a tad too slow for your taste
if this is the case you need a system
optimization tool optimizers generally
support a series of utilities used to
speed up your PC but there are so many
to choose from how do you pick just one
and stick with it I'm checking out three
different ones and choosing my favorite
mmm deliciousness first off is glare
utilities available at glarey utilities
calm this tool has a free rare version
and a pro version for about like 27 USD
oh and what's this yeah there's a
portable version you know how I feel
about those portable awesome glarey
utilities comes with registry and disk
cleaning privacy protection performance
accelerators and multifunctional tools
it can fix any of your dog registry air
it can safeguard confidential files and
maintain maximum performance mmm sounds
nice to me
Clara utilities even has tons of options
in their menus for advanced users my
second one is II cleaner available at
piriform com I'm gonna go ahead and open
up that one too so you guys can check
out what that looks like go ahead and
analyze okay so see cleaner has a
version for about 24 bucks or you can
get this portable version which I got
for free this free word is going to
remove unused files from your PC clean
your registry clean traces and internet
history and online activities to give
you tons and tons more free space and
faster performance C cleaner is fast and
everything is built-in as opposed to
glarry utilities C cleaner lets you for
example uninstall programs straight from
the tool so there's no mean to jump over
into Windows Explorer I like that a lot
and my third option is tune-up utilities
from tune-up com sadly this one has like
a 15 day trial before asking me to
upgrade for a hefty 25 USB yeah but hey
tune-up will still increase your
performance it's gonna maintain your
system customize windows fix problems
give you a live optimization and a turbo
mode which is kind of cool this is the
only one out of the three though that I
had to actually install on my machine
and it's a little bit clunky whenever I
was using it now although tune-up
utilities is a little bit slower than
the other two it did feel like it found
more files during the cleanup so which
one of these is my favorite hmm I'll let
you know right after the break

okay we're back and my favorite of the
three was ccleaner with its easy-to-use
interface and its powerful structure for
more advanced users CCleaner has
everything you need to help optimize
your PC's performance after using this
for the first time I already noticed an
increase in startup time as well as day
to day tasks on my netbook and my
desktop PC at home which seriously
needed out of an upgrade but I will add
that if you're a little worried about
the type of files that ccleaner tells
you it's delete try running glarey
utilities as well and compare them I
have both of the portable versions
available on my PC just in case I need
to double check the files because you
never know thank you to Steve for
studying in this idea what programs or
scripts are rockin your PC you got a
utility I should try hit me up tips at
