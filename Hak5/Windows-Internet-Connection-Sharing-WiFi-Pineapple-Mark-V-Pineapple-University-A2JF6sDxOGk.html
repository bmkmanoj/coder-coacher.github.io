by hack 5 and viewers like you
support us directly at H a k shop comm
hello and welcome to pineapple
university i'm darren kitchen and in
this video we're going to demonstrate
how to set up internet connection
sharing in windows on your Wi-Fi
pineapple mark 5 so seeing that your
Wi-Fi pineapple mark 5 is in fact a
wireless access point one of the things
that you most likely want to do with it
is provide clients that connect to it
with internet access and so one of the
easiest ways to achieve this is directly
connected over this Ethernet cable to
your machine and we're going to
demonstrate right now on how to do that
in Windows and that's actually very
simple so let's go ahead and get started
now I already have my browser set up
here and I'm connected to the Wi-Fi
pineapple at 170 to 1642 one on port 14
71 and one of the easiest ways to check
for internet access is under this
network info here
I can actually see all of the
configuration of my different interfaces
if I go back and just hit this close
right there I can see that I had the
option to show my internet IP address if
you do that it's going to go ahead and
query Wi-Fi pineapple calm and let you
know what your address is if I click
show right now it's going to error out
because I don't actually have a
connection to the internet now this is
because the Wi-Fi pineapple in its
current state is looking for an internet
connection coming from the IP address
170 to 16 42 42 and if I open up my
command prompt here and do IP config
scroll up som over here you'll see that
by DHCP I was I received an IP address
from the pineapple as 172 16 42 195 so
all we have to do is share our internet
connection and then set up a static IP
address with the pineapple so let's go
ahead and do that in Windows 7 here and
go ahead and open my network connection
sharing center and go over to change
adapter settings and the first thing I
want to do is go to in this case my
internet facing adapter which for me is
a wireless network connection now this
could be a 3G 4G modem this could be
another Ethernet whatever your interface
is for your internet on your Windows
machine you'll want to right-click on
that and hit properties then go over to
the sharing tab and check this box that
says allow other network users to
connect through this computers internet
connection select which connection we
want them to be able to go through so in
this case it's the local area connection
because that's what I am directly
connected to by my Ethernet cable to the
pineapples so now anything connected
over the local area connection will go
out through in this case for me my
wireless connection so I click okay and
it sets it up in a way that for most
cases will be correct however we do need
to make a quick change and that is to
set our IP address to a different number
so what we do in this case is right
click on our local area connection again
that's the Ethernet connection directly
connected to our Wi-Fi pineapple we hit
properties we scroll down here to the IP
version 4 tab I hit properties and
you'll see that it automatically added
in 192 168 1 3 7 1 let's get rid of that
and replace it with 1 7 2 dot 16 dot 42
42 we can leave our subnet as
255.255.255.0 and we don't need a
default gateway we would like to provide
our clients to the Wi-Fi pineapple with
a DNS server and so I like to go with
Google's at 888 because it's easier to
remember click OK and we click close now
at this point I can come back over to my
Wi-Fi pineapple web interface I'm going
to go ahead and refresh it
and from the small Network tile I'll go
ahead and click show and now I have the
public IP address that I'm connected at
through this computer this is great
actually because now any client that
connects to the Wi-Fi pineapple will now
be provided Internet access through my
Windows machine which actually can be
very useful if what you're trying to do
is analyze network traffic because I
could fire up you know Wireshark on this
where other you know packet analyzer and
actually see the traffic going through
so let's go ahead and make sure that
this is working on the client side I
actually have another laptop here and
I'm going to connect it to the
pineapples wireless network so on my
boon to machine if I come down here to
wireless connections and I choose the
access point pineapple five underscore
and the last two octet of this MAC
address if you look at the bottom of
your Wi-Fi pineapple on the sticker here
it's going to note the MAC address and
the last two octet swill correspond to
the default SSID the name of the network
that's going to show up by default
change that later
so at this point I just choose pineapple
five and I'm going to go ahead and open
up a command prompt here and do if
config and in this case W land - and
I'll see here that this machine was now
assigned an IP address of 172 16 42 to
23 and if I see if I'm online by say
pinging 808 I'm going to go ahead and
get replies so that's setting up
internet connection sharing for the
Wi-Fi pineapple mark five with Windows
it's that simple now I hope to see you
all at you need Wi-Fi pineapple comm
that's where you can find more videos
like these as well as other lessons and
links to the forums and the chatroom
I'll see you there until then class
