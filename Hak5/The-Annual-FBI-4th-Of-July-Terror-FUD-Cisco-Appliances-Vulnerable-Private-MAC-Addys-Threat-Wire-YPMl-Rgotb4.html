from the FBI and Homeland Security Cisco
security appliances are vulnerable
private MAC addresses are coming and yep
China hack the OPM but it's that really
the problem all that coming up now on
threat wires I'm pattern Norton and this
is threat wire for monday jun 29th 2015
your summary of the threats to our
security privacy and Internet freedom
got Ethernet a wireless adapter then you
have your very own unique MAC address
it's used to send frame to the right
machine on the internet and it can be
used to track your activities online
while linux windows Apple OS and Android
all can randomize MAC addresses there's
no specific I Tripoli spec yet mac
address randomization test took place
back in november and richard sherwin
writes on the register and quote well
i'm going to quote him now the IETF and
I Triple E have agreed that the
experiment was a success along with
further trials at the I Triple E say no
to plenary and a second IETF meeting
both in March what's that mean I suspect
big changes are coming to networking
protocols soon and it's going to be a
lot harder for big government to track
what you're doing online heads up people
if you run one of Cisco's web security
virtual appliances their email security
virtual appliances are their content
security management virtual appliances
you might have major issues Cisco says
these boxes in the words of dennis
fisher on threat post calm quote
contained default authorized ssh keys
that can allow an attacker to connect to
an appliance and take almost any action
they choose we're talking about root
user privileges on your security
appliances this is bad and by the way
apparently this is an industry problem
badly common exploitable ssh keys in
this case apparently Cisco put them in
to allow well you know I called up for
help and they just logged into my
machine it was so convenient of Cisco
well look common exploitable ssh keys
suggests at least one security
researcher quoted in the article are an
industry-wide problem as in showing up
in metasploit modules that's bad people
great link in the show notes do yourself
a favor go read it China hacked the OPM
it's not exactly a new idea but having
us intelligent Chief James clapper
saying that china is a leading suspect
in the theft of millions of personnel
records from the office of person
management gives it some kind of
official cachet the question of course
is whether the White House will use its
new sanctioning powers the ones that
gave the Treasury Department to go
against hackers well Beijing continues
to claim China has been falsely accused
and damien polettis article in The Wall
Street Journal notes that both defense
secretary ash Carter and national
security agency director Admiral Michael
Rogers both believe that the US needs
quote a clear protocol for how it
responds to cyberattacks in part to warn
hackers about the consequences of their
actions meanwhile security on the OPM
networks is probably still a hot mess
and frankly I think that's the real
problem it's way too easy to break into
far too many networks especially those
run by our government let's get this
fixed people and from the sea we told
you we needed all your phone calls
Department the Department of Homeland
Security and the FBI have says USA Today
quote Ward local law enforcement
officials across the country about a
heightened concern involving possible
terror attacks targeting the July 4th
holiday and quote and look lest I sound
less than paranoid enough for a security
junkie the source quoted by USA Today
went on to say that quote there was no
specific or credible threat or attack
beyond quote the ongoing threats posed
by the Islamic state and other homegrown
extremists and quote look I'm hoping the
average person that saw that title and
started stockpiling foods and getting
ready to go to the sticks for the July
4th holiday got to the third or fourth
paragraph that admits that these quotes
bulletins are frequently issued in
advance of major US holidays have an
abundance of caution and concern that
operatives may exploit the timing to
generate greater attention end quote
what's that mean it's a big holiday it's
lots of people getting their party on
celebrating freedom and the bad guys
overseas may choose to rain hell down
upon the USA because hey it's going to
stand out on july 4th more than it would
on your average tuesday look go live
your life well people enjoy your freedom
that's really going to tick people off
before I go and get ready to celebrate
my very own scruffy July fourth I want
to give a huge thanks to everyone who
