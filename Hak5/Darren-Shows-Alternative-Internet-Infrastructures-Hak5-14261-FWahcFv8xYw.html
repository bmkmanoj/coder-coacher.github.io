the coming zombie apocalypse all that
and more this time on hack 5 great this
segment of hack 5 is brought to you by
domain.com
welcome back 5 my name is darren kitchen
and I'm Shannon Morse this is your
weekly dose of Technol excited to be
wrapping up 14 me too you know what I am
so excited so tired from DEFCON it was
breezy crazy fun but it was great it was
very eye-opening with everything that
was going on absolutely it's always a
great time at DEFCON we love that we
have the opportunity to go to the DEFCON
the derby cons to shoe a cons the tour
cons and all of those things that make
this community so great in fact this is
a very special episode as we wrap up
this season because I'm actually gonna
be talking about well I'm gonna be
running some stuff that I have had a
unique opportunity and not just hacker
conferences but going to hacker spaces
yes and you've been to so many this year
I haven't going to continue to do is I
go through hack across America
I was super ambitious with this project
I don't know why I thought for some
reason I could go to there like 1600
active hacker spaces 1600 yeah
all of them right all of them do that
six months now reality the situation is
I'll be 130 by the time efficient I
don't know what the number is but so I
will be continuing to do this I think
I'm gonna take q4 off so that I over the
last three months of the year so that it
can like enjoy the holidays but but then
pick it back up on the East Coast
because there's so many you know there's
hack DC there's so many there's stuff in
Atlanta there's Florida there's really
cool stuff on the East Coast that I want
to see as well so I'm probably gonna
reek hick off that but yeah stay tuned
hack across America calm for the tour
dates because I'm about to go through
like Idaho and Montana and Colorado and
then down through Texas there's three
back to back in Texas so yeah maybe I'll
join you on one of those trips you
should come out to Austin awesome is
gonna be fun yeah yeah it'd be super
cool okay so I should probably set this
up that first and foremost my apologies
for the audio quality if it is
not three and not what you've come to
expect from act five here in the studio
we make do when we go to these hacker
spaces this is a hacker space was
recorded at a hacker space in Los
Angeles after during a hack fight field
trip where we got to go and see the
Endeavour Space Shuttle which was yes
which was like cool I got goose bumps it
was so great and then give a talk at a
hacker space and then go out for drinks
later and it was just so much fun but
but one of the really cool things that
I've felt compelled to do during a hack
across America's offer not just to come
in tour these hacker spaces which is
really cool have a tour of the hacker
space soon but and to bring awareness to
you know the community that there's
really cool stuff in your backyard but
also you know to talk about something
some of the things that I'm very
passionate in and we've seen me talk
it's a noise bridge about Wi-Fi and
things of that nature and I've if you've
got hack across America calm and you
click on you know talks or whatever I
have or speaking I have full list of
these talks that I'm like I'm offering
to give you know this is my contribution
to the community you know I'm not the
best coder in the world but I'm
passionate about some stuff I'd love to
come to you know hacker spaces around
the world and talk about this stuff and
and there's been very receptive and I
must say this is actually a very
difficult thing for me because I have
very first self-censored in in such a
way where I asked nobody to record the
talk as as these things evolve and as
the subject matter is such that I need
been very respectful of that to people
have been and it's it's just because of
the subject matter is something I'm a
little nervous about because I have a
healthy fear as everybody should and
also you know I love those men with the
shiny shoes they're really the greatest
but more but I wanted to talk about
Internet infrastructure for the coming
zombie apocalypse is an abstract that
sounds great but essentially what I'm
talking about is when there's no route
to hosts whether it be you know a
disaster like Katrina or an oppressive
government and as we've seen in Egypt
and Syria and all these other you know
nations with Arab Spring and as the the
recent revelations with not just you
know no route to host but be monitoring
with you know programs throughout the UK
at GCHQ or locally here with the NSA
this is even more more important to talk
about
already doing this talking at these
hackerspaces before the whole you know
Snowden NSA prism stuff broke and then
this this particular one this talk
occurred about a week after that stuff
broke so it's it's very fresh and I feel
like this is really just a conversation
that needs to continue happening
throughout the hacker community so I'm
as nervous as I am I'm very excited to
kind of bring to you kind of a raw and
uncut this is what it's kind of like at
these hackers bases when I go and talk
and this is one of the talks that I give
and I just want to garner feedback so
this is one of those episodes where I
really value whatever you want to send
by what's in your heart about this
because I'm very passionate about it and
it's something that will continue to
evolve and and anyway yeah I set up the
rest of it at the hacker space so when
we throw to that you'll see but um but
yeah well second off I do want to say a
big happy 8th birthday to us I know I
haven't been a part of the show but for
five years yeah you started this in 2005
and we've been going strong for a good
eight years and uh revision3 was nice
enough to send us some cookies these
beautiful fortune cookies missing on
them it was very sweet of them and I
have to say thank you to revision three
forever yeah we should we got three
fortune cookies so Paul you want to just
leave it on main come over here and take
a flip on go hit oh wait that's right we
don't have yeah we don't have the bongo
anymore oh so we have the yeah you got
it you gotta come over here yeah sorry
happy three longest-running wet
employees of hack five of God employees
no boy contractors fortunes in them
about art well I hope so you know that
the fortune cookie originated in San
Francisco oh and that's right it's a
that's the case it's very fortunate all
right mine says Ed admirer is too shy to
greet you and also dongs mine says you
want you long to see the Great Pyramids
of Egypt and also dogs
use your charm or personality to attain
your wishes going thing at DEFCON about
dongs and I don't know just an admirer

and also dog and also it works a lot
better that we stay with you okay
thanks Paul make the cameras switch he
happen yes thank you Paul for continuing
your excellent service to this wonderful
podcast that we like to call hack 5 it's
really funny how we got Paul like social
engineered into the project to begin
with we started saying like we called
out like in the first three episodes hey
Paul fix the camera stuff like that and
it was just a tripod there was no call
we kept on saying Paul's name and I kept
on telling Paul in fact Paul was one of
the first people find out about hack 5
and I was like dude we did this podcast
ago he's so great he's like yeah sure
you got a script it's um it was awesome
yes so finally to it - that's what
happens to every yes doing the show 5
years later and I wasn't even supposed
to be doing it you know five years ago
you're just like you should review this
video game and then I was supposed to be
an extra anyway um October 5th we're
gonna have the big party right now we're
just having a little shindig but
Oktoberfest stay tuned for details it
will be huge it will be our 8th year and
2 month anniversary so um yeah ok we've
rambled enough in a block this show is
about Internet freedom let's kick it
over to crash space and hear all of the
things that I'm scared to say through
the world but ok to say in front of a
group of 100 people at a hackerspace
and I previously asked you know don't
report it prison broke it's all being
recorded in anyway
so yes this is me talk on the
alternative Internet's for the coming
zombie apocalypse zombie apocalypse is
easier to say than you know whatever it
may be impressive government you know
economic collapse no rat to host and
what this talk is about is the internet
its enemies and what can be done to keep
it for you
basically that's that's how I feel I
feel the internet should be free this
talk is not about through a solution for
Internet freedom I don't believe in any
such thing it's not a comprehensive list
of any such alternatives networking
technologies but I do feel strongly
about some of the projects that it will
show here and I'm constantly learning
about new ones see the thing is Internet
freedom is a conversation that is being
that is currently going on and so many
hacker conferences that I go to it's
just this is really awesome how many of
you guys knew each other before you came
there
okay well I hope when we all go out to
get drinks you guys all meet each other
and come back to this space and and
participate in this because this is the
weirdest thing for me cuz they didn't
ask right in this but there's this weird
at hub spoke model and so when I go to
these hacker conferences users everybody
knows me they're all telling me like
we're working on this alternative
infrastructure and it's like did you
know that this other guy is doing the
same thing like but they're not talking
to each other so you know so anyway it's
not a comprehensive list but I I'd like
to kind of interview a sec kind of stuff
I should probably introduce myself I'm
that guy I'm Garrett kitchen.i I started
out on one of these things doing text
files for the phone phreaking seen that
I can see
back in the day I was you know my back
in the day was the 90s when in the 90s I
would ride my bicycle around the
neighborhood looking for ballot lanta
vans Bell Atlantic was before Verizon
and G Keenan video Secada but basically
I would ride around looking for Bell men
and like really yeah okay I'm working on
the thumbs up are you doing a parent
game with pulse amplitude modulation
watch you sit down like simply like what
you know and these guys the third day
was you know the sixties with the blue
box and things of that nature
I got into it with the allure of the red
box and so in the free phone calls but
once the award goes away then suddenly
it's like how did that work and so
that's when the real fun happens not
what that's what led me into getting
interested in the networking and
infrastructure why the internet as
souvenirs here to my car it's a
fantastic example of you know
potentially free and open global
infrastructure and I guess I started
writing at the time with text files
which were traded on multi-core systems
on cantana FTPS on F serves on IRC and
it was really a lot of fun until I was I
have a nice visit from so the line here
is good and then kind of put that on the
shelf for quite a while but then in 2005
I really missed the scene I was working
as a Systems Administrator I had taken
my passion for you know hacking and
freaking and turned it into a career
systems administration but that got
really boring
I had already scripted and automated my
job pretty much I was working from home
with a bunch of batch files and shell
scripts and so then I started this
podcast hack 5 as basically a way to
introduce a lot of the things that I was
so intrigued in to the community to kind
of hopefully foster a new generation of
would be not script kiddies to you know
basically do the same kind of
that variety stuff that I was into in
the text files and of course nobody's
gonna you know with with this new
generation people don't have the
attention span for that stuff and I was
also really into video so let's just put
it all together I've had the unique
opportunity to work with some of these
guys now revision3 is actually with
these guys so that's pretty cool and and
yeah I've just been you know blessed in
this weird way that all just kind of
like it came together never asked I
didn't wake up one day I'll be like I'm
gonna do a show
Partin discovery or anything like that
it was just you know it's in my blood
and it's the weirdest thing universe
keeps calling me and I just keep saying
yes and that's what's led me to lots of
it for saying things including this
space right now another space that led
me was to the ITU anybody familiar with
this organization the International
Telecommunications Union is the
longest-running oldest non-governmental
organization as part of the United
Nations what these guys do is ever since
oh gosh I forget like for last over a
hundred years they've been maintaining
things like satellite orbits
telecommunications infrastructure
interoperability so that you know Japan
can call the United States and vice
versa so that country codes don't
overlap so that you know the calling
system and they're pairing and Darren
puring arrangements work and things of
that nature and it was a really
interesting thing here with this in that
in February or right before time ago I
got a call I got a call from one of
those really long numbers and I'm like
okay well first of all somebody got my
number which all right that's cool and
second of all they're not from here so I
should answer and I answered it man
g-man um what's going on he's like I
need you to come to Geneva and I'm like
all right what's up and you know I know
about Geneva because I used to I used to
when I was in like high school do Model
United Nations that's time to worki I am
right I got to you know play these guys
which is one of my favorite logos
because it kind of looks like that one
but but yeah these guys were having a
conference in Geneva following up with
the conference in Dubai that happened at
the end of 2012 in December which passed
the first the first updates to
International Telecommunications you
know trade policy's at this conference
wicked WCIT you will buy something
something something anyway
Wiki was kind of huge because suddenly
Internet Governance was on the table
okay suddenly these 193 nation states
that are members to the ITU got together
to pass the first updates to these
international telecommunications
regulations that hadn't been updated
since 1988 what's happened since 1988 in
the telecommunications world and
suddenly the internet was on the agenda
which I kind of feel very strongly about
and to have 193 nations and nations only
come to closed-door meetings and not
allow the you know civil society and the
private industry who have built they
commercialized and its internet even
before 1995 when NSF the last backbone
fell and it really
now is the internet for them to decide
this is how the Internet is going to
work this is how we're going to
standardize on monitoring citizens I'm
not joking this is a 1980 documentation
you can read on standardizations packet
captures or you know think people like
the NSA to to trade and stuff for them
to make decisions on how the internet
operates like I really took issue with
and so I was actually very overwhelmed
and totally it was a great opportunity
to actually go to Geneva and take part
in the worldwide telecommunications
policy forum to which the internet was
again the agenda and this is continuing
the and when I say the agenda the United
Nations the ITU they see the Internet
and the governance of the Internet not
as how do we how do we fit into the
Internet Governance model because mind
you Internet governance you know we'll
get into the sec but you know it's been
working like the question for them is
not kind of we fit in but how do you
