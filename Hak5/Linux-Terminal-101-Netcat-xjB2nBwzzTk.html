you by goto assist welcome to act tip
the show will we break down concepts
tools and techniques for hackers gurus
and IT ninjas I'm Shannon Morse and
today I'm checking out net cat
but what is net cat well at first
surfaced in 1995 and it is one of the
most popular and very lightweight
network security tools to date net cat
let's to computers transferred data with
each other via TCP and UDP protocols and
via the network layer protocol IP the
name may have derived from cat which is
a common command that we previously
covered in hack tips with additional
networking capabilities thrown in now
net cat runs as a client to initiate
connections with other computers it can
also operate as a server or a listener
in some specific settings now some
common uses for net cat include using it
as a chat or a messaging server file
transfers you can do banner grabbing
which basically means you can collect
information about a computer such as the
operating system services versions etc
to find weaknesses in a service you can
also do port scanning and even more net
can't can be used in Mac Linux and
windows operating systems as well now
other than the minor differences between
each operating system version of netcat
there are also two distinct differences
in Linux itself now after downloading
and installing that cat which I will
also get to you should have many options
at your fingertips including creating
and launching a shell now if this isn't
available to you you may have a
recompiled version of net cat your Linux
or UNIX operating system may have
recompiled the original net cat without
the ability to perform certain tasks
consider the D gaping security hole
option now this option allows the user
to execute commands using the extra
options under the tacky switch including
launching that shell now while it is
considered safer if you don't have that
it doesn't give you as many options if
your recompiled version doesn't include
the tacky switch so what version of net
cat are you running well it's very easy
to find out if you go over to your
machine that you already have it
installed in type NC
to open that cat tack H and this will
give you all of your different options
and you'll notice if you do not have it
that your tack E is missing but if you
do have it if you go down the list
you'll see tack e exact equals program
program to execute after connect haha so
we do have it we're good to go and we
can show you everything that netcat can
do now after the break I'll go over
installing net ket and all of the
available options we'll be right back
working in I team means constantly
jumping from one program to the next
each issue needs to be solved
really fast and every minute counts so
don't waste your time juggling different
tools and duplicating data entry use go
to assist from citrix the leader in
remote support so you'll have the tools
that you need integrated into one easy
to use platform so you can work faster
and much more efficiently now how does
this thing work well go to assist
includes three essential support tools
that you can customize for your needs

allows you to log incidents and track
the resolutions go to assist monitoring
proactively identify issues to fix
before they become bigger problems and
you can also do remote support providing
live or unattended support to any PC Mac
or mobile device from anywhere I would
totally use that while I'm sitting on
the beach during my vacation to resolve
any issues super quick they don't even
know I'm out of there now you have to
work with a bunch of different programs
at your company you don't want to have
to copy and paste between a bunch of
systems that don't actually talk to each
other and the monitoring is super great
about being proactive and letting you
know when your server really needs a
patch so head over go to assist com sign

promo code hack welcome back now we're
going on to downloading and installing
that cat now this part is really a
breeze there are several sources
available for net cat on Windows
machines and many linux distros already
have it pre-installed for you now in
linux if you want to get the version
with net cat with execution commands
first remove any original version
installed on your operate
system especially if it's one of those
missing the tacky now to do this you
want to use the sudo apt-get remove
command specifically you would type it
in like this
sudo apt-get remove tactic purge gets
rid of all the files
netcat tak open BSD which is the exact
name of the file now you can install
netcat for Linux after you've done that
in the traditional sense it is available
via the command line or straight through
the software manager so honestly it's a
breeze now once you've got netcat
installed on your windows and linux
boxes run NC tech h like i showed you
previously to make sure that you receive
the correct information back so to
remind you it should look like this
NC tak h and that opens up netcat and
all of its awesome commands now you can
also compile the GNU version of that cat
using the following commands in your
terminal now first off you do need to go
to net cat sourceforge.net which
specifically looks like this and type
into your terminal this command now I'm
going to find out which download link I
should get and I chose to download the
tar.gz version from the source forge
page I'm going to copy that and put it
into my terminal so the total command
would be W get and then the tar.gz link
once you enter that it's going to start
downloading the whole file for you and
then you can install this GNU version of
Linux downloading
so while that is downloading on my
machine I want to go ahead and mention
also that you can change your directory
and then LS to find the exact listing
for your new netcat download so for
example on my machine I found it under
here so it's under my home directory LS
and you can see netcat I actually have
two versions of it installed or
downloaded on here so now I can type in
tar X Z F netcat and I'll just complete
that like there dot
tar.gz and then I want to change my
directory to netcat and I want to
configure this alright great once it is
finished you simply type make that makes
the file and then you type in sudo make
install to install the new netcat file
it'll ask you for your password simply
type it in and we're done so now you can
type NC Tech H to make sure that your
new GNU version of netcat has installed
correctly now last but not least I
should mention and map security scanner
which is a utility that integrates ncat
into their implementation you can simply
go over to an maps org to download that
now we won't go into nmap during this
series of hack tips but we may delve it
into it in the future now next week
we're going to cover the basics of how
to use netcat and how to get you guys
started so do you use netcat send me a

show hack 5 for more great stuff just
like this I'll be there reminding you to
