by go to assist express what the hell
inspired you to start a new con why
didn't we have enough cons you know it
would probably do but you know Adrian
Crenshaw Martin boss and myself we all
decided to just get together and start a
small conference for for hackers in
their underwear right now now we're not
we're not going to play that game about
this hackers that are wearing
sweatshirts listening to hack five in
their headphones but uh no I i I'm not
giving you a health where I think this
is great and it's it's a great location
because you think about you know or at
least our major ones like shmoocon and
the east coast or khan and the west
coast and then you know Vegas is well
Vegas is Vegas it's it's good to come
here because we've seen it's been a
great turnout over a thousand people for
your first one Wow and the turnouts been
interesting because it's the kinds of
people that we wouldn't see at the other
cons that are like you know within you
know a day's drive absolutely i mean
there's no midway midwestern her central
type conference that's here so we
decided that louisville for us was
probably the best place I mean the hyatt
itself you know you have the bar in the
second floor which everybody I mean
there was a huge success I mean
everybody was just there socialize and
drinking and then you walk her outside
and you have the biggest party area you
know well I guess the biggest party
removals not the biggest party area
really a lot of the places but I mean
you know bars and food and everything is
all right there so for us it was a huge
success I mean we never anticipated it
being anywhere where it was so I'm blown
away great well what was the biggest
challenge can put this together you know
we never done a conference before you
know we have no idea what it takes the
only thing that we know is we're con
goers and so you know going to
conferences we see things that we would
like to see or see things that are
different or you know cool ideas and you
know and Bruce was was a Bruce and
haider instrumental in getting us all
set up at first you know when they first
started off we started paying them a lot
of around how they do their conference
and how they started off and things that
they've learned and there were more than
willing to help out and aaron and heidi
were just you know my wife Erin going
back and forth and I think it's a
similar type concept with those two my
wife basically handled everything from
from you know
making sure that were organized because
we're you know 80 Dean scrolled all over
the place so you know it was really cool
that it all really came together but I
mean I think some of the challenges we
had were we really had no idea what
we're doing you know I mean so we want
to make sure that when we came here we
did as much as we possibly could to make
sure that everybody was taken care of
and had a good time and try to keep it
as cheap as we possibly could to make
sure that we made up you know for the
conference and went from there so thanks
well it's definitely a community and it
has that vibe and there have been plenty
of great talks I know that you gave one
with kevin Mitnick a lot of people
probably know that you're you know your
payments for social engineering tool kit
as well as fast track I'd love to hear
what the latest is with those sure I
sewn-in Kevin eyes talk I released a new
version of set which was two dot one
which I spent about four months of
development in and and this this this
version for me was it hit home because I
basically incorporated fast track now
into the social engineer toolkit and so
you have all the options you would have
a fast track and inset and and for the
kid that's sitting in his boxers that
doesn't that isn't familiar with with
fast track real quick if Patrick was the
the first tool that I decided to write
you know I had been programming a little
bit here and there but I'm like a man
you know create something cool because
I'd gone penetration test all the time
and I saw things that I could automate
or do things that were really cool that
aren't anything else and started
automate those so that you can actually
leverage them in a penetration test and
make penetration tests easier and so
that's where ever we started with fast
track and the new version is set when I
wrote it I completely recalled the
entire thing I mean there's not a line
of code that's the same in this version
as it was I'm an old version the fast
track I mean fish shark is one the first
programs i had actually really written
so you don't go back and look at that
coat it's pretty bad don't look at my
could either yes but no it was it turned
out really good and then we also
incorporated i rewrote the the java
applet attack which i have something big
bethel to rewrote the java applet attack
to incorporate the shellcode exact
attack which is basically you have your
able to drop alphanumeric show go
straight into memory through the java
applet without ever having to touch disk
now what's the advantage of dropping
your head into memory without touching
the desk what we what we've always
struggled with inset in municipal in
general is you know AV companies are
really trying to hit those payloads very
significant so even with encoders like
shikata or on backdooring legitimate
executables or you know digital
signature stealing or packing or crip
ters I mean they still have portions of
them that are legitimate nature and
executables that they're triggering on I
mean it's kind of in the ass in the
sense that it's like all right we're
here sharing our payloads with each
other and then the you know antivirus
vendors McAfee are all sitting there
going oh cool we like this payloads to
let's just put them into the signature
look oh yeah and you know the metasploit
guys you know kind of kind of came to
the conclusion of we're not going to
continue to just rewrite stuff over and
over and over again for this you know
you need to find your way of going about
and so you know sets kind of had the
evolution of doing different things to
try to evade antivirus and we
incorporate metasploit base payloads as
well as one that i wrote custom for the
set said it's called a set interactive
show and you know it uses a couple of
different techniques like it'll pack it
and then rear and obfuscate the living
daylights out of the executor which has
been very effective for a long time but
again now those are starting to get
detected with a few of them so I think
like four out of 28 now or four out of
43 detected now which so they're
starting to get more popular and so a
shellcode exec the reason why i said to
do that is mature prefer never touches
this there's no signature to do so it
goes straight into memory nothing
scanning it you know and nothing
scanning it so so the antivirus has been
a night in checking memory there's
nothing and there's no there's no memory
checks if you're going any any antivirus
company that claims are doing you know
memory checks are crazy I mean a lot of
times what they're monitoring on is
registry changes or system API calls and
I would see ninety-nine point I / 71 has
some API call monitoring mean yet to
have you know kernel level injection be
able to see everything for that and so
drivers and so you know there's really
nothing out there that has been
detecting in so I ran it through pretty
much everything that I possibly could
and it's been working beautiful and
haven't had any type of antivirus
signatures flag on it so long story
short we shouldn't have to worry about
antivirus and sat anymore so dude that
is fantastic and I know that you've also
been having a lot of fun with the the
teensy could you tell us a little bit
about what kind of you know human
interface device attacks you're using
yeah so this distant run we Josh Kelly
and myself just cause a co-worker he's
doing a lot of work and research on the
10 z devices and he's actually talking
very shortly
what he was able to do with the
Tennessee device and what he's
essentially working on is the ability to
write a small stage or that opens a
comport onto the windows device and then
try and then reinitialize itself as a
calm adapter and transfer all the
information over Viacom so instead of
actually having to type out all of those
things you can transfer you know a 25
meg file in just a couple seconds first
is actually having to worry about typing
it on there anyway right now we're like
injecting things via base64 encoded a
ski or even just hex right into the
command prompt into a file either see
script or PowerShell thing to turn that
into an executable we're looking at the
same thing you know you open a comm porn
it's like boom and you know and you can
do it over other things too Alma josh
has been researching it and I'm you can
do network adapter so you open up you
know it yeah yeah you know it's
interesting about that easy open up with
it network adapter and then you replay a
pcap yeah absolutely indian you can just
have that trigger and have all that
information basically something then
right straight to this so we could you
could have what looks like a web server
but it's actually just an automated like
you know said that he could it out and
you're done is your binary you know I
mean it's and that's that's absolutely
gitelman and so I mean there's a lot
different things were playing with what
we wanted to get out of it was you know
if you're going in you're doing a quick
hit you know going into a machine that
that you want to get into you don't want
to have to sit there for ten minutes as
you're wearing the binary out you know
try that I try that I tried to take the
entire 63 kilobyte netcat on a Windows
XP machine I was like okay sure I'll
just you know convert that over to hex
and then have a tight ball through a 6-3
kilobytes a ten minutes it's it's it's
ridiculous I mean there's no feasible
way you can do it I just imagine the
James Bond movie where he's like ah and
then the good in and then Oh 10 minutes
yeah I get hang on hang on here just
sitting here for 10 minutes and then the
girl from ipanema starts playing yes Oh
had a very feasible attack and so would
jot what josh is working on being able
to plug it in you don't have to worry
about having to have another network
cable plug into it you know and try to
figure out where that sad or unplugging
and plugging in you know so josh wants
to be able to with you won't you know
one USB device plug it in initialize
itself is used be right the quick stager
the initialize itself reinitialized as a
common Apter and then start transferring
information over so it requires a pretty
big rehaul of the audrina based
libraries so we went gosh Ben
Rob Simon and I'm merging the two
together so that we basically have one
you know unique library that we can call
for the initialization Indian didn't the
initialization of those so we got to get
you guys some ducks because we actually
got three you arts so we might be able
to do that without having to de
initialize and reinitialize you know
dual haven't both the same time would be
a lot easier well I got one of them
right now so you know definitely playing
with them as we go the further we got to
get that up in set you know absolutely I
hey it's our it's already done so I'm
gonna start working on the other where
ducky when i get home i start
incorporating the the attack vectors in
the set so i got to ask what's coming up
for der beek on you're going to continue
here yes we're absolutely planning on
keeping in here there's a few changes
that are going to happen we're going to
include an additional tracks well four
tracks and one will be for more newer
people's information secure so it's not
always like the crazy technical talks or
you know whatever's going other people
that are relatively new to the industry
can come and learn in a collaborative
environment but the main you know feel
that we wanted to get for this was you
know we're all here we're all friends
there's no rock stars there's no you
know people that are better than each
other it's really just to come together
as a community and we're all as one you
know so I mean hopefully that message
can clear and it seemed like it because
everybody was in the hallway hanging out
with each other you know all the big
guys in the Nino names in the industry
we're all hanging out everybody are
partying with everybody we're all
wanting there was no you're absolutely
right you've got you know everybody from
the the guy that just discovered that
you can start having your way with
computers to you know kevin Mitnick and
everybody's welcome and have a good time
i also got to say that you in particular
have a lot of heart and and that this is
one of the things that that makes this
con unique in that now there aren't
shmoo balls and we're not putting cement
and toilets or anything like that but
the man hug ticket tell me about the
inspiration behind the man hug ticket
before i redeemed this yeah well so i
actually had nothing to do with the man
hug ticket itself however i did i did
repeat that I would give hugs to anybody
any time because I'm a hugger and so
integral I'm decided to take it himself
to make a magic ticket for the one
ticket good free of a relic man hug and
so I've literally hugged I would say you
know there's over a thousand people here
I've hugged them at least twice or five
times so I've done about five thousand
hugs i would say not just alone in these
past three days so i've been i'm very
happy I'm hugged I never hug out so you
know I can i can hook any time oh here
we go that's good stuff
oh yeah don't be ten minutes a minute
but ten minute we got wavelet NZ to go
out oh yeah okay so base 64 encoded
anyway let's go come to Der Beek on get
yourself a hug one thing one thing I
forgot to mention by the way I did
something with the new version of set
but I'm getting it reviewed by the eff
right now to make sure I don't get sued
why would you gets it so interesting
enough if you look at how Java released
the Java applets you could originally
make about a year and a half ago do code
signing by your own self signed
certificate on it well you have to be
able to self sign how else would you
test right and so what happened is it
when you self sign it the publisher
would show up is whatever you want it to
be so Microsoft Google whatever you want
it to be so yeah I mean we've been doing
that forever but you know it that's just
what he says up in the name field that's
not actually microsoft cert absolutely
right but you know for a end-user you
know when you actually go through and
they go to the Java applet it pops up it
would show publisher Microsoft you know
so for the end-user they had no idea so
after releasing the set after listing
said they released an update to the Java
applets and for the JDK and now it shows
up as publisher as a big unknown so it's
less you know enticing for a bit because
they don't know who it is I still I
still find it like a 95 ninety-eight
percent success rate when I'm actually
doing my attacks and so what I did was
to get around that is I bought an LLC in
the state of Ohio and and basically
purchased at code signing certificate
that was legitimate nature called
verified publisher so as I what's the
name of your company verified publisher
verified publisher so I register the
state of Ohio with verified publisher
and I now have a code signing
certificate for verified publisher when
I run java code i always use verified
publisher they're very trustworthy i
mean they're verified and they're a
publisher but that just goes to show you
that i mean an attacker if he's going
after an organization or company he's
going to spend 30 bucks to register an
LLC he's going to spend 200 bucks to buy
the code signing certificate you know
and he's gonna do it anyway so what's
the point of what we're doing with that
and but but but it's secure because
there was a code signing Authority and
obviously if java or if son didn't want
you to be able to provide your most
valuable clients with
code from verified publisher they would
have given it to you that's right
absolutely i mean they do the corporate
verification where they actually check
to make sure that your LLC's legitimate
and that is it they looked up your Dunn
and Bradshaw actually didn't even have
dnb's you did they just said did a
number and that's it the tax ID
basically so you look that up
everything's good yeah your shirt is
about it's about a week long process I'm
about to go register the phone company
well kevin kevin Mitnick got a good one
too he register coracle java so he
doesn't actually he doesn't actually
have the code signing certificate or
anything but you know we basically I
mean it just goes to show you what you
can write us from you can rent or
anything you want to so why does the eff
have to get involved in me but I
understand how son might be a little
upset but they could just revoke the
cert in that's in debt that could be a
viable reaction to it what I want to
look at yeah I mean that you have you
you're not for you know you have no
right to that sir it's a privilege it's
they'd you know they're the company
that's issued a tuna if they're like now
we don't want to business it's their
choice to not deal it do business with
verified publisher yeah absolutely but
you know they could go crazy and try to
strong-arm e it's removing and Reno over
can't anything you've ever done but what
I'm gonna be doing is distributing it
you know signing it into set with the
Java applet distributing it to the
masses and it is a hacking tool albeit
you know I obviously only want to use
for good I can't necessarily you know
verify that it is being used for good so
I do hope that you know the why I hope
they're authentic is they don't revoke
at all because I mean it's legitimate
application that's registered you know
copyrighted and everything else you know
so it's not like it's you know something
that is a hacker to let someone's using
so I mean hopefully it's a legitimate
sure they don't revoke it but you never
know and you know that if it's not you
doing it somebody else I mean come on
think about it these company names xanga
what so you just go and register a
couple of letters and people are going
to click yes anyway absolutely I mean no
one knows if you go to a website if it's
you know who actually developed the job
app or who he be people in calculus the
unknown did absolutely nothing to reduce
my footprint of how the Java applet work
I just want to make sure that its
meticulous and perfect as you're doing
attack if you have a two percent margin
I can increase it on by you know just by
doing that itself and that's been you
know
its job awesome well thanks for suspend
sometimes I guess it's awesome all right
next year big glam so definitely check
out their begun and we look forward to
it and it will get some sleep alright

+ tab to see it in 3d it's a lot easier
to find them also you can press ctrl
windows tab to toggle this and then
switch around the screens with tab or
with your mouse thanks to Damon for
sending in this nibble and if you guys
have one send it over to hak5 org slash
