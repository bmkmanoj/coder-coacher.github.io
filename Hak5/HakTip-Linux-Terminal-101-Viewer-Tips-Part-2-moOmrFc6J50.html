down concepts tools and techniques for
hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm Shannon
Morse and today I'm checking out more of
your feedback and tips
now what are some of your favorites make
sure to email those at the end of the
show now first off Robert sent in
another great tip he said I keep my bash
history file edited to my favorite
commands options and arguments for
example his would be links tech accept
all cookies links underscore bookmarks
HTML and IR SS I taxi chat free no net
and there's a couple of other examples
that you can check out in the show notes
and of course he can edit all of these
by using his favorite text editor which
is vim dot and bash underscore history
so for the next terminal session he can
simply up arrow to the desired command
option and his argument without having
to type it all out that's a really good
one thank you so much
now this next tip is from Bill he said a
couple of terminal commands to let you
know what kernel industro you are using
first off is type in you name tech are
you named attacker which is going to
show you the exact version of kernel
that you are running so I'm running
three point 2.0 tech 34 generic very
interesting not really but you can also
check out what distro you're running by
typing in cat slash ATC slash release
and you can see that I'm running exact
Ubuntu 12.04 I should probably update
precise ping goal in and a little bit
more information about it
LTS yeah very cool lots of information
thank you very much
now this lets you know what version of
distro you were running and it's very
very nice now this next one comes from
mr. protocol again he said I figured
this would be a cool idea that you could
pass along for your hack tips I found it
over at slash dot and figured that maybe
more people can get some use out of it
it's a web-based version of
Linux the hard way with a good amount of
exercises at the bottom of the page
maybe this could be a guideline to
progress and learning the basics for
people now this list of exercises
includes vim language settings bash job
schedulers there's file systems and
networking in performance and all sorts
of information about kernels now you can
find the link in the show notes and this
is will give you a little example of
what it looks like let's go ahead and
minimize these so it starts you off here
Linux the hard way and it tells you say
hello to Linux type enter and you get
this nice little bash screen and there
are tons and tons of exercises so let's
click on exercise 24 for example go
ahead and pull that up there we go and
it gets you all sorts of networking
information and exercises that you can
try out so you go through all this
information and it's really like crazy
amounts of man page info on here how you
should use it examples in a little bit
extra credit and there are really good
comments below if you have any sort of
questions that you need answered as well
very good thank you mr. Protocol next up
is Pedro he says in the last episode of
hack tips you were explaining some
keyboard shortcuts I know one that's
really helpful many times you're writing
a long command but you realize you have
to issue another command first so it
kind of gets pretty messy
you hit enter with the partial command
issue the other and then go up in the
history or you discard the command and
then have to type it again or even copy
the command selecting it with the mouse
and we all hate Mouse's that's painful
now the solution ctrl Q it sounds like a
quick command but it isn't it Yanks the
current line lets you issue another
command and it auto magically I love
that I love that auto magically pasted
back the previous command on the next
prompt now his example of this would be
our M tack our F
and the file and then you hit ctrl + Q
now I'm going to type in LS Tech la
another line that should give me a list
of files and then it's supposed to
magically appear but it doesn't on my
machine now my question to the audience
is why do you think this does not appear
on my oh boo - 12.04 machine is it
because of the specific type is it
because of the terminal that I'm using
bash or is it another reason now I want
to know what you guys think so you can
email me feedback at hack 5 org or tips
at hack 5 org now he also goes on to
give us another shell option he
recommends zsh to get started you may
want to try it
oh my zsh with a link in the show notes
it's like a framework for zsh with lots
of great stuff mainly for developers as
a simple example was the zsh you can
type RM asterisk asterisk asterisk slash
asterisk dot TMP and for this example
this will delete all the temp files
under the current directory and its sub
directories with bash you may have to
pipe find into RM or something like that
now what do you guys think make sure to
email me tips at hack 5 org with your
thoughts or you can comment below on
what you think be sure to check out our
sister show hack 5 for more great stuff
just like this and don't forget to check
