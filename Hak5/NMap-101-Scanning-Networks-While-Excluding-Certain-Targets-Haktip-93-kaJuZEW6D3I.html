welcome to hack tip the show where we
break down concepts tools and techniques
for hackers gurus and IT ninjas I'm
Shannon Morse and today we are scanning
for random targets and learning about
excluding IP addresses in nmap and we've
already learned how to scan for a single
target or multiples in several different
ways
today we'll check out scanning random
targets with the TAC IR parameter this
looks simply like so you'll type in n
map as you always do and then tak I R
capital R space 3 press enter and it
begins to run
so this basically means n map of course
starts the program the tak or - I
capital R means that it scans for random
R for random haha totally makes sense
and then 3 means I want to scan 3
targets so why would I want to do this I
don't know there aren't a lot of reasons
why you would do a random scan unless
you're using it for some kind of
nefarious reason or you're just doing it
for research now say I want to exclude a
certain IP address from a really large
scan of my net rate my network we can
use the same syntax that we used before
for scanning multiple targets and then
add a little extra command at the end
this basically looks like so I'll type
in n map and then 10 dot 73 31 zeros so
that's for my network slash 24 and we
explained what that means in a previous
hack tip 2 dashes exclude and whatever
IP address you want to exclude so I'm
going to exclude 10 dot 73 30 1.18 for
which I know in particular is one of the
devices on our network so I go ahead and
let that run for a few seconds ok so the
first part we already discussed and the
second part is kind of obvious it
excludes that one IP address and
obviously you can see it's not in my
list now you can also use the same
command to exclude a series of I
keye address and this simply looks like
so I taped type in and map 10 dot 73 31
0 / 2 4 for the whole network - -
exclude 10.7 a 3.31 dot and then
whatever the range is I'm going to type
180 through 190 now I know from up here
that there's also this one 186 186 right
there that is one of the products that
is on our network so I'm going to scan
and see if that one disappears from this
next skin since it has been excluded
okay now that it has completed I see the
very last one on my entire network scan
is dot 163 so we definitely were able to
exclude one eight zero through one nine
zero now that's pretty cool it can be
very useful especially if you want to
exclude a whole bunch of things on your
network after the break we will show off
how to use the exclude syntax with your
text file from a previous hat tip stay
tuned the hack shop is hack 5s premier
store for all of your pen testing needs
including one of my favorites the USB
rubber ducky which looks like a flash
drive and of course it types like a
keyboard and it types very very quickly
like this week's pick from tower party
spot in the forums thank you so much for
sharing this tower party spot now this
one is another prank for your co-workers
making them think that their computer
has died with a few simple image grabs
and then deleting the whole windows
process Explorer and of course he called
it a hilarious pun of tequila aka
tequila which means kill ha I totally
get that and this is of course wonderful
for pranking everybody especially on
April Fool's hmm plans now we gonna do
this show without your support so we
would like to thank you with something
special you can use the coupon code
snubs SN ubs with any of your orders for
your very own signed hacked tip stickers
thank you again so much for supporting
the show who couldn't do it without you
we are back now say you want to exclude
a really big list of specific IP
addresses that you've already added into
a text file I'm going to use the same
list that I made for my last hack tip
which was called list dot txt and I just
left it in my home folder to make things
easy now if I cat list dot txt too
extreme I see that there's two IP
addresses in there so one is one four
five and the other was dot one one six
so I see those IP addresses and I know I
can exclude them so for this example
we're going to use a little bit of a
different syntax it starts out looking
the same with nmap at the beginning and
then your IP address 1073 31.0 for my
network slash 24 - - just like the last
one exclude list or exclude files excuse
me so exclude file is going to be the
syntax that you use instead of just
exclude remember this because if you do
not include file at the end of that word
it will give you back an error of course
so exclude file space and then list txt
or whatever the name of your text file
is you press ENTER and you let it run
okay our scan is complete so I'm going
to scroll up and see alright so we were
looking for one four five and one one
six if I scroll back down one one six is
definitely missing and so is one four
five and I know for sure that both of
those items are on my network it worked
yay I love it when things work right now
what would you like to see next about
nmap I've been getting really really
good feedback from everyone so thank you
all for giving me really good comments
of course if you have anything you want
to share you can email us over at tips
at hack 5 org or you can comment below
and I do read all the comments now be
sure to check out our sister show hack 5
and definitely check out mu byxis show
called Metasploit minute over at hack 5
org of course I'll be all over the place
over on hack 5 org reminding you to
trust your technology
