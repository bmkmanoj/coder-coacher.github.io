versus DSLRs is google TV open source
lock hunter pic pic windirstat vs ftp on
you 12 server feeling documents with USB
dumper huh so much more i'm darren
kitchen you're watching act 5 this
episode of pack 5 is brought to you by
freshbooks online invoicing go to assist
express support smarter with go to
assist Express and domain com got a
great idea it all starts with a great
domain domain com hello and welcome to
hack five my name is Darren kitchen I'm
Jason Avalon and this is a weekly dose
of technol SJC man things come down to
bare yeah absolutely well you know it's
kind of required to move here to come
here to find a plan is that what you're
doing yes absolutely so I'm moving to
the bay area as of I guess the end of
the month nice yes gonna be awesome to
have you down here if I'm excited yeah
sweet and actually I know that there is
a really kind of funny just like a
moment ago Jason literally walked into
the house and I'm like how did you do it
is like you never change the code on the
garage door I I hacked your grudge do
you have a story no I forgot to James go
awesome awesome yes yeah so you know all
you people that keep forcing I'm joking
it's not even public on that yeah
something on the local anyway so yeah I
figured hey why don't we get your
perspective on some things because we
got some questions here cool what you
got for me well I know that we last time
you and i didnae block we were totally
cracked out yes yeah so now you excited
about the whole camera thing yeah and
now we're doing totally much of actually
weren't you hand me one of those from
the the fridge and we'll get right into
a see we can totally chill out the red
ones and and be a lot more um what is it
called chill chill yeah yeah last time
it was like all red bull and now here
you go london pride yeah one of my
favorites where do we get london pride
we can get in california at this place
called bevmo it's amazing all right
that's ridiculous you get like Schmidt
wicks and
and a couple other but you can't get old
speckled know you can get old Michael
ahead and you can't get old peculier
which I wish you could we're talking
about beer now let's talk about
technology yes so last time we were
talking about magic lantern and how we
can use it to to to record video and
advanced features on things like the the
t2i my favorite inexpensive DSLR and
it's what makes connect five possible
yeah well let's get to back because we
got a great email here from George here
George runs a video podcast called the
beta show gr it's a Greek show all about
hacking tips and tricks and stuff like
that I don't speak a lick of Greek so
you could say it's great to me hey and
uh and he writes in to say the reason is
that he wants to know what kind of
camera we use on the show we get a lot
of email of that that and says I
currently shooting with a DV camcorder
is not happy with the quality and he's
things like Jamie camp yeah and these
things by getting a mini HD camera for
around a hundred dollars and what do I
suggest and then he brings a week's
issue with a mini DV camera or mini HD
camera yeah actually Shannon were most
of her early snubs reports was actually
shooting on the creative vado HD which
actually has phenomenal video quality
for the price and am I can't that's the
biggest issue is it doesn't matter how
awesome your video quality is or isn't
what you hear is ninety percent of what
you see yeah that makes any problems if
you go with a cheaper camera you got
agree with an off deck reporting system
there's two hundred three hundred
dollars and then you have to sync it and
that's where the clap comes from mm-hmm
it's true he's talking about the thing
that we do to resync audio not estd so
that'll said i figured that that's a
great way to go if you want to get
yourself an expensive camera that will
do the trick the Votto is good the can
of the kodak is good i haven't played
with the sony that want to know that the
newer version i just got the new version
i actually played with the sony it's
okay like it's not as good as the Votto
it's definitely not as good as the Codex
we've been using as long as you get a
mic in Jack that's what's important to
know that they remove that from the
version of Sony which is real shame but
he also mentions this open source
firmware that he found for the EOS
harking back to when we were talking
about magic lantern it's actually a
canon rumors com I'll have a link to in
the show so it's a little theory yeah
it's a small program now here's the
thing it isn't a replacement firmware
for the camera what it is is a utility
that allows you to hook up your digital
rebel in this case he's got an xsi which
was the version of the canon rebel right
before the t1i where they started adding
the HD video record functions well this
program allows you to over USB record
the imagery that the camera gets on your
local hard drive now is it the actual
imagery from the CCD or is damaged or
from the LCD which is gonna be much much
lower quality not positive on that I
haven't it is in Greek thing or Russian
or something i can't really well i would
think if you're just pulling over the
USB it's gonna act just like a webcam so
you're not right but you're talking
about a webcam with the gorgeous lens i
mean you can get some amazing that's the
field and that's what he was talking
about there i say dude try it but he
says he's only getting 20 to 22 FPS
that's gonna be a huge killer well the
limitation there is not the camera
that's USB you think its USP it's
absolutely USB because you're not gonna
push HD over USB it's just not possible
because you're what 4400 EVPs is USB 2
and assuming that that's the only device
that is USB with real late and see
you're not going to push much better
than that so I hope that answers your
question dude for a hundred bucks you
can't go wrong with the creative vado or
the Canon zi8 or whatever version
they're on no worse bedtime times as
much what are you doing yeah that's
right spend ten times as much get a t2 i
put the magic planner firmware which is
actually would i use to shoot my hack
five segments because with the camp
magic lantern it gives you the
audiometer so i know when i'm
ridiculously loud or not loud enough you
ridiculously loud yeah
well we got one more question here that
I thought you would help us with because
you've been having a lot of fun with the
boxee box in fact i just recently sniped
that hardware from you so i can do some
fun stuff with an atheros chip it's
somewhere and I ok so here it is it's at
its ty here from Georgia he writes I saw
a boxee box bill dev and but I'm wanting
to do a google TV box I heard that
Google Teague will put the software for
free so I can build a big google TV box
and he wants to know you know he wants
to get a board with an HDMI in and out
and also the board the board which is
the AV help with this I don't remember
the exact models it's it's right it's
right here I love it when he does that
yeah exactly oh you work to do an end
anything exactly so the box that that
that we just mentioned the one the same
ease in the boxee box provides you hdmi
out it is capable of hdmi audio and
video through the same port which is
incredible yeah that's not normal not
everybody doesn't know I mean I think
that's one of the only boards I've ever
seen it does that but anyway necessary
here or there the trick is gonna be will
the open welding this software
supporting because it'd be able TV right
i mean cool tonight you want to build my
own now kind of google has released the
source code from Google TV yet all it is
is a branch on the android tree so
Google TV is just its own interface
sitting on top of Android that's go all
over saying since it's based on Android
it has to follow the same license and
therefore it was an open source
absolutely it is going to be open source
but the reason that i'm hesitant here is
because android doesn't run on just your
average pc there is the x86 android
project but it doesn't support a whole
host of hardware all right so he's
supporting something as proprietaries
hdmi where it's all well and good that
it's google TV it should support hdmi
there's no telling who's going to write
the driver fit I'm sure there's a lot of
people that want to do that so you're
saying this is a hack that we should be
keeping our eye on because eventually
we're absolutely wonder how boxy feels
about that you know you've got to be
nervous because if it's gonna be open
source and somebody's eventually going
to write drivers to put it up to hdmi
and you know he's going to throw a
homebrew google do with me because
willing
you get a lot of these you cover you
know how to build the software you cover
the hardware required nature actually I
just I love the idea of having a home
theater media center kind of thing going
on we're like oh yeah I dual-boot google
TV and I'm see you know what they don't
have every service on every platform
that's that's the world we live in we
have the tvs miwa hulu is blocking or
whose block yeah but you just changed
the user agent Rosser and that's how
that it anyway we're gonna long here and
they block I figured it'd be great to
have you on since we had some questions
that you can be helped us with and I'm
looking forward to you getting down in
the bay area because we have some
fantastic stuff lined up exactly nine
it's gonna be great so yeah with all
that we should probably get a move on
yes so I guess with that let's check out
headed over Shannon with some trivia
last week's trivia question was
developed as a school project at the
Faculty of math and physics this
internet rallying Damon has seen a
resurgence in development since 2008 and
the answer is bird if you want to win
some hak5 swag this week into the
following question over at hak5 org
slash trivia since version four point oh
is this open source servlet container
features components such as coyote and
Jasper we'll be right back after a brief
word from our sponsor hey you want to
talk about this way no come on I'm
listening I just feel really bad about
letting you burn I just didn't want you
to make the wrong decision about your
web hosting it's okay i went with remain
calm they have hosting plans starting at
just five dollars and seventy-five cents
of us and the hacked five years get an
extra fifteen percent off when they
check out with coupon code knock live so
when i make their i'm making apology
soup for you watching it well so far
just onions
domain registration and hosting is
nothing to cry over with domain com
hosting plans start at just 5 75 a month
and their deluxe offering includes
unlimited bandwidth and site builder
pages see how easy it is to get
dependable flexible and affordable
hosting at domain.com checkout with
coupon code hak5 and save an additional
fifteen percent got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com a
while back I had reviewed this program
called unlocker it's this tool that
helps you unlock all sorts of locked
files for copying moving renaming and
deleting but if you did like unlocker
perhaps you like lock hunter instead
this one features a whole bunch of cool
stuff it's this really easy interface to
learn it shows you what what processes
are locking your file it allows
unlocking deleting copying and renaming
just like unlocker it allows you to kill
the locking process straight from the
program and remove the locking process
from your hard drive if it's something
like malware for example it integrates
into explore the Explorer menu it
deletes into the recycle bin so you can
restore files and it is supported in
both versions of windows windows 32 or
64 bit okay so it's very easy to
download and install you just have to
download the program from the website
and then use the choose your 32 or 64
bit version run through the installation
run the program and if you have any
locked files you can browse to that file
click editor and it will show you a list
of programs that have locked that file
so in this example this file didn't have
any locks on it so it tells me that
nothing was found it gives me this nice
big green checkmark and all that cool
stuff now in the background I have have
this hak5 theme song playing on VLC so
I'm going to try to delete it and it
tells me that it can't delete it can't
be done go figure because I'm playing it
in VLC but if I didn't know that I would
be able to open the file in Lock hunter
and it tells me that it's being locked
by VLC so from here I can't unlock it
delete it close the locking process
delete the locker from the disk pretty
much anything I need to do to unlock the
file you can also right-click on the
file and choose what's
locking this file and then it comes up
with a with a nice little list of
anything that's locking it in you can
take it from there so my conclusion is
that lock hunter is a really easy
interface to learn and it's a little bit
easier than unlocker in my opinion but
it's really up to you whichever one you
prefer because both of them work pretty
much the same way do you guys have any
other ones that you want me to know
about any unlocker tools make sure to
email me at feedback at hak5 org and i'm
not quite done yet this week we are
showing you three of our favorite tools
that were sent in over at feedback at
hak5 org and my second choice was pick
pick pick pick pick pick yeah anyway
sorry oh god a while back I have
reviewed faststone capture it's the
screen capturing tool for all your basic
needs but if you didn't like it you
might not like pic pic instead pic pic
is used for windows it can be used for
multiple screens cool it's portable
alright that's two points it's
customizable it's for any kind of screen
capturing area you can share to social
media sites like Twitter and Facebook
and you can also share to an ftp it has
a built-in editor a built-in color
palette and picker pixel ruler screen
magnifier and protect protractor on
screen crosshairs whiteboard and lucky
for us it is free completely free if you
use it for home and you never use it for
any kind of corporate stuff which you
don't really need to it's free awesome
another very easy one to download and
install you go over to pick pick dot
visible dotnet and you download the home
version run the downloader open pic pic
and the program options open
automatically you can set all your
desired settings so I'll run through
these really quick quick the hotkeys
those will run certain commands when
pressed the ftp lets you upload to an
ftp really easily in the screen editor
section lets you change file types and
background images etc etc autosave will
save to a certain file and file name
lets you change how many am
are saved and the capture lets you
change any options having to do with the
actual screen capture sweet to capture
your screen you hit the print screen so
I'm going to choose the editor to
automatically open what I do that and
you can also paste from the clipboard
you can zoom in and out view in full
screen hit escape to go out of that like
so and you can also check out some basic
effects like gray scale cool I can
pixelate my photo which is actually
that's kind of neat I like that you can
put a frame around your photo and hue
and saturation so I can make green
awesome you can also resize the photo
and rotate it very nice you also have
options to draw lines and shapes just
like in paint and then once you're
finished you choose file save and then
save your photo okay also there is a
whole bunch of other cool stuff in this
program you go over here and you can
choose the color picker which chooses a
color on your screen to find the actual
code for it there's a color palette like
so there's this magnifier which you can
use to magnify pretty much anything on
your computer that you put your mouse
over and then there's a pixel roller to
find out the exact wit of width of a
photo this is pretty cool like that
there's a protractor to find any angles
on your computer which is very unique to
this program and then we also have this
crosshair we can find the pixel count at
that very spot this last one is the
whiteboard you can draw on your own
desktop it kind of reminds me of when I
was a little kid drawing on my mom's
computer desk I don't really do that
don't tell her okay anyway pick pick
it's super handy especially if you just
need to do some simple edits or photos
or take some screen captures or just
work on a couple of websites and it's
free yeah okay my last choice is
windirstat and you can find that over at
windirstat info it's this disk usage
viewer that shows you where all of your
space went so for example on my computer
when I open it it automatically does a
subtree percentage and it lets me know
exact
Glee how much space has been used up so
I can already tell that some of my space
has been used for some really important
stuff I'm not going to mess with those
but I see this large block of green in
it if I right click on that Oh so
apparently Dropbox has a cache that
saves all of my video files that I
upload to hack 5 that I didn't even know
was there and apparently it's taking up
tons and tons of space on Mike machine
so this has already helped me out a ton
and I just started using the thing so
now I can go in here and I can clean it
up I could delete it just just straight
from Explorer pretty much whatever i
want but windirstat has already helped
me okay my conclusion I love it it's
very very simple very handy and it's
already helped me with in the few
seconds that I had opened it up and
started using it what do you guys think
email me at feedback at hak5 org with
any of your cool software tools that you
like to use that are nice and hopeful
and this week we will be right back from
a brief word from our sponsor if you're
a creative professional or an IT
consultant such as myself you'd probably
rather rebuild a windows 98 box and do
invoicing or at least that's how I felt

taking awesome it doesn't even have to
be your birthday to win so you could do
whatever you want with your birthday
cake like mine
I mean I've always wanted to do this
yeah check out freshbooks hmm cheers yes
actually been meaning to do this I'm

calm / hak5 for a free trial coming to
you from the dogpatch again yep it's the
end of the show and Jackie's back with
us to wrap it up a sink our teeth into
some feedback you can send yours to
feedback at hak5 org and yeah let's dive
right in ya first question this guy Shan
is wondering I want to build an ftp home
server which keeps running at my home
and I want to access the server remotely
anywhere from around the world according
to his knowledge an OS thinking Linux
but I'm confused whether or not it's
Ubuntu desktop or went to server version
he doesn't know which one to choose so
had to uh you could use either the
package that you probably want to use on
Linux one of them you know as vsftpd
it's an ftp demon or Damon or however
you want to say it that that will you
know get your file transfer love and on
the difference between Ubuntu desktop
and server is essentially that the
server version is a lot more
stripped-down it doesn't have your ex
desktop so you don't have a nice fancy
GUI with the mouse and everything you
can just you know sit there with mash or
whatever your your shell of preferences
and when you set up an ubuntu server it
doesn't install a whole lot of crap
which is good because there's less to
maintain and it's actually really nice
because i actually have a splash here of
setting one up where you get to choose
you know if you want
make it a dns server a mail server or
open ssh server it doesn't have ftp as
one of the default options but if you go
to the manual configuration at the
bottom it'll open up synaptic which is
cool package manager hit /type in vsftpd
boom you'll see it right there plus G
enter you're done and there you go so
that will help you set up an ftp server
but I dude I've really got to say ftp is
inherently insecure well vsftpd will do
secure ftp I why don't you just set up
an open ssh server and then you have the
benefit of not only being able to get at
your files through ssh and SCP we can
also do yourself a little tunneling
through we talked about that on episode
6 19 come on Shan you remember that
episode you loved that episode Dan yeah
your favor did it on YouTube of course
you should be somewhere you should you
should you go over there yeah yeah
should go over YouTube now / i-5 and
favorite everything just do that just
describes yeah that's it yeah hak5 that
also subscribed I got all the details
right there for ya well let's finish the
feedback right um he also says watch the
star regularly and it's awesome keep it
up oh thank you so yeah I Darren all
right the last question is hello Darren
although I'm answering is so hello
Jackie looking for a program or script
that will silently copy all doc docx PPT
pptx files from USB thumb drive
automatically after connecting it and it
needs to be free so we have service for
you would as well yeah USB dumper you
must be dumper go google it you must be
dumper it'll just be exactly what you
need copy all your files over silently
so no one sees your crap yeah chair has
season two we did a little tool called
the hacksaw where it's a USB Drive that
will affect machines with the USB dumper
and then basically it just sits there
and whenever if somebody pops their USB
Drive in there it'll copy all the
documents off that drive and then you
can come back to the computer later or
have them emailed to you and just steal
everybody's data but do but just don't
be malicious me curious mischievous but
yeah come on goatey no duh sorry it's
such a yeah anyway I'm all over the
place right now what speaking of all
over the place you can find hak5 all
over the place and subscribe to us
everywhere you want to one single place
that makes it all easy hack five dot org
slash subscribe get all the details ee
and buy all your hack flash lag go to
heck
orange / store just in time for the
holidays Shannon's shipping it all out
to you absolutely and fault at five on
Twitter Michael on Facebook that we're
all over it yes that way you know when
the the next meetup is and we hope that
you will be there beer in hand yes
speaking of which we should probably go
do something are ya until next time I'm
Darren kitchen I'm Jackie dresser Tecna
lessons
hello excuse me I didn't notice you
there watch it buddy aren't you see I'm
