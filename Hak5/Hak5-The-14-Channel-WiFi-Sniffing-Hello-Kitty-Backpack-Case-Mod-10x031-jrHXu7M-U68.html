by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is Darrin kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse
your weekly dose of technolog we have an
epic show for you this week yes we sure
do as you guys may recall back at Maker
Faire we ran into our friend Ben Heck
yeah where you promptly challenged him
to a caseload competition right like in
my case that's like bringing a knife to
a gunfight yeah so the competition is to
be judged by you guys the viewers at
revision3.com and of course that means
that we want your vote and hopefully
we'll win because our mods better
actually it is and it began anew
a world in front of your eyes a million
ways to realize
now I know you're thinking that's not a
casemod that's a girl
and you're right it is a girl wearing a
casemod we see your typical computer
case it's just an ugly box that you
can't wear I mean maybe he's got these
handles here for easier carrying or
maybe you got a nice window so you can
peer inside and see all the fiddly bits
but ultimately it's not gonna win any
beauty awards this guy will
what's more you won't find on other case
mods a let acid battery pack liquid
cooling system suppose 4G wireless
dongle pink adjustable straps 15
antennas 14 for Wi-Fi radios in monitor
mode and a single Wi-Fi pineapple mark 3
development board or even a plushy
kitten face
and while your typical land party
casemod rig will house two or more
extreme graphics cards for playing games
our systems integrated graphics card
coupled with the latest backtrack Linux
can deliver more fun 3d first-person
shooter all from the command line with
all this kit it's no wonder this is the
ultimate in luxury hacking apparel and
if wearing Miss Kitty doesn't suit your
fancy he'll even roll on wheels this
should come as no surprise to any hacker
out there are 14 wireless radio is here
your 14 channels on the Wi-Fi 2.4
gigahertz spectrum you haven't been with
us for quite a while here's how it
basically works when you put your card
in to monitor mode that basically means
that it's mixing up all those good
packets in the air eavesdropping on
emails and instant messages it typically
does what's called channel hopping a
single card will listen on channel 1
then 2 then 3 and if something
interesting happens on channel 7 when
you're on channel 2 you're just not
gonna see it and with 11 channels
legally in the United States you only
have a point oh nine percent chance of
seeing everything stephane interesting
packets that's why we have 14 here 11
for the US two more for Europe and the
14th for Japan this is it I've always
wanted to try this booting a computer
off of a battery I mean it makes perfect
sense this is a DC to DC power adapter
and basically just you know you took a
CLE get one of these big bricks you on
these wall warts and all this is doing
is converting your your AC power ain't
get from the wall here into DC power and
this is what you would use
to stay run here run like a car computer
off your battery car whatever so same
principle is just a 12 volt battery
let's plug it in and see if it works
like that and then just like any other
computer you want to start it with the
biggest knife you have by bridging the
connections here
since bidding
32 gigs solid-state drive not a whole
lot just need to run an operating system
2 gigs of ram was cute about this ram as
its patriot so it's got an actual you
know american flag on there that's good
stuff two gigs otherwise the reason for
selecting this motherboard is because
well it meets the requirements of being
a full ATX case for this mod we have we
have 6 USB on the side here as well as
the ability to with these guys here add
another 8 USB for a total of 14 USBs
what could we do with 14 USPS 14 USB
wireless radios hey it just so happens
there's only 14 channels of the wireless
spectrum
now I know what you're thinking how does
it all work and quite simply really once
you have the rig strapped to your trendy
hacker girl like I expensive tokidoki
purse you can send her off into an urban
environment to clean interesting packets
from the public as soon as the battery
is connected to the DC to DC power
supply the BIOS will kick on and begin
booting backtrack of course our scripts
will go ahead and log into new them
automatically where with the help of
sokka's 3G and USB mode switch a 4G
connection is made back to the t-mobile
network meanwhile the Wi-Fi pineapple is
being provided power over USB and
connects by Ethernet back to the
computer to share out the internet
connection any connected clients will be
sniffed we could have actually opted for
a 16th antenna running airdrop ng to
automatically deauthorize every client
that isn't connected to our pineapples
and encouraged them to connect to us but
we opted for a more passive attack
another script will power up all 14
radios set them into monitor mode and
begin capturing all the packets on all
the channels with airodump-ng now this
all sounds complicated and expensive
that's cuz it is they were always gonna
do this again I'd be using a nano ITX
motherboard like a Atom processor NOT
some ridiculous full ATX motherboard and
water cooling systems are hungry beasts
but alas the conditions of the Ben Heck
casemod challenge were $200 full ATX and
while the 4G modems and and the 14 USB
wireless radios and pineapples and the
water cooling system everything else was
damn near grand at the end of the day it
is actually a full ATX case and the
backpack / / / book bag came out to a
whopping 117 dollars and 40 cents in
fact the couple in Chinatown that sold
it to me were so excited to be selling
the knockoffs and Rio that they even
threw in a free pen now we've got 15
wireless radios and a free pen where's
your pen pen where's your pen you know
Darren you didn't use all of the usb
radios no actually we have hundreds and
had I that would have been crazy power
requirements however that's the one that
everybody's always asking the realtek ad
187a to use on hack tip and just wanted
to point out that they are in the hack
shop now and they're sexy in these all
new completely black cases degree is
pretty cursed a pretty beautiful yes
alright anyway I know that you guys
going to be curious about you know the
software and the whole setup so we're
gonna be diving into a lot more of that
here on hack 5 in on hack tip but for
now we need you to get out there and
vote
so go team high five okay okay
anyway you know who else's team's
awesome Dale chases he's gonna be back
here with a little hacker headline remix
like that yeah like that like that
that's sorry and later I'm going to be
booties off of virtual machines off
physical drives with the bootloader hmm
I stick around for that we'll be back
after a quick break
now it needs to be something more length
straightforward like USB rubber ducky
calm no no it should be more hardcore
like like tactical assault ducks calm
I'm leaning towards programmable human
interface advice.com no matter what your
project is domain.com has what you need
to register host and promote your next
big idea even if it's fugu github.com
domain.com is owning the competition
with cheap domain names and hassle-free

and domain discovery since and make it
easy select the domain that's right for
you and setup your website without
hassles domain.com believe in transfer
your domain name from another registrar
and hook you up with an extra year for
free from mere oh it's actually less
than six fifty when you use the coupon
code hak5 at checkout that's right our
coupon code hak5 will save you fifteen
percent don't forget when you think
domain names think domain.com happy 20th
birthday to linux the open source OS
patterned after mimics the first build
only mean of 386 now how is everything
so ubiquitous I ran the ins ran into
boils from chrome say a Google
certificate was not its own it was proof
where the goof up but did you note or
so-so authenticated that's now the
blacklisted for site scripting
vulnerability found on MSN comm check
the cookie last week
level found a similar thing run an
arbitrary quarter matters from being us
this for judge rules spied on ohio
couple consumed absolute laptop LoJack o
took sexist screenshots gave to 500 no
news and drum fills pista arts Technica
Eleanor Mills gear one time put your
mind I'm still chased closing your
hacker headlines like that shawl like
that show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
