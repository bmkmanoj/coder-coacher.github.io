rubber ducky replacing unity with gnome
x86 routers and more this time on hack 5
this segment of hack 5 is brought to you
by domain.com hello and welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen I'm Shannon
Morse is your weekly dose of Technol us
that's right it is darn tootin oh it's
one of those episodes again sorry I'd
candy again oh it happens we have a
fantastic show for you guys this week
it's a show that's probably been in
development for a couple years actually
but first and foremost we got an email
as we do sometimes and this one came
from
sometimes I check port 110 see what
happens we got an email from Raquel at
revision3 she's a producer and she
writes heyo here's the official tally
Congrats to hack 5 well done Darren team
Ben will officially wear the Virginia is
for lovers t-shirt on his latest episode
and then we have the what does it do to
do to do oh here we go the stats there
were a total of 35,000 133 votes
Wow for the of course we're talking
about okay that Hello Kitty backpack yes
yeah and uh oh look at that
hak5 got 87 percent of the 35,000 votes
that's awesome hmm so we can go hack 5 I
know that sometimes Ben can get a little
confused when it comes to math and
measurements full micro it all kind of
gets confusing so would have done here
Ben is that I've laid this out and this
is to just kind of like give you an
example of how the voting went this is a
hundred pens and imagine these are the
percentage of votes write these over
here those are those are our votes and
these over here these would be your
votes
so since I'm such a nice guy though
since since Ben didn't have the awesome
pen that we got with our casemod I think
that would be nice and send him not just
the 13 pens there's your pen Ben oh
there's your pen you're gonna slip in
the Hello Kitty pen but oh yeah okay
fine I get if it's for a good cause it
is it is for rating our heart our fellow
shows on revision3 that's always good
fun and uh for a good it's all him I had
nothing to do with that I didn't even
know what he was saying before we
decided to record this just needed all
the office pens um okay so you're
switched over to know what's going on
with I have switched over to know I've
done the docq thing it's totally cool
and I'm gonna tell you all about how to
do it really really easily in my segment
later on today wahoo they convert look
at that actually I'm converted as well
I'm not on my record not on my back
track box I'm on this EP see well my
other machine guess because yours broke
yeah I stepped on it or Kirby stepped on
it I don't know
Goodman Kirby it could have been mm-hmm
but you rollin up to it now
I don't know but I'm on an EPC
temporarily so I'm back to Lubuntu and
it's okay you're accident-prone I know
things happen guess what
what the duck is here oh I know right um
Wow it has been just so long coming
really and I'm so happy to finally be
debuting this it's because it's really a
project that kind of I don't know it's
the evolution of the Switchblade that
came out in six so we're talking about
like five years evolution yes it's been
a long time the concept and wait and the
prototype boards and then shipping them
out and then developing you stuck a USB
nice but yeah anyway in typical hak5
fashion though we figured that we would
explain all the fun new awesome stuff
about this custom developed rubber duck
hid attack quackity quack
by doing it right and doing it with a
cartoon so when I first we're do its
ducky time
if there's one thing about computers
it's always interested me it's how the
deeper you get the more secure things
are the four Way handshake some wpa
signing with open PGP authentication
protocols like Kerberos another highly
complex schemes keep data tight and yet
studies have shown that if you give the
right person a chocolate bar they'll
give you a password it seems that the
computer the computer network stuff is
actually highly scrutinized
but contrast that with the fundamentals
the basic input/output of your local
computer comes with and honestly has
since the beginning of computing
implicit trust the human trust the
display to be the computer and the
computer trust the keyboard to be the
human but what if the keyboard wasn't
human not to say we're somehow flawed I
mean 100 words per minute is pretty good
but a computer surely could type faster
or more accurately I mean if a computer
could sit at a keyboard and type yeah
what's interesting in this scenario is
that the inherent trust is broken on
such a fundamental i/o level that any
presumption of computer security based
on the concept that a human can never
type as fast as the bus supports think
fast enough to generate brute force
dictionaries or be so persistent as to
never need a coffee a nap or a pee break
are ultimately flawed it's these kinds
of violations of inherent trust that
fascinate me mostly because they take
advantage of often overlooked mainstays
of computing implemented for user
friendliness like auto run code on
cd-rom drives the hak5 community misused
the trust Windows has an autorun de INF
files on the root of optical media back
in 2006 with a tool we dubbed the USB
switchblade named after the u3 enabled
sanders cruiser that made the attack so
convenient on a single USB Drive the
tool was so popular as to have garnered
a community of payload developers it was
so popular in fact that it and the USB
hacksaw took up a significant portion of
the syngress published book titled the
seven deadliest USB attacks well now
it's time to introduce the eighth
following up with the USB switchblade I
became fascinated with human interface
devices and by 2009 was playing with
Arduino like development boards before
heading out on the hack Across America
trip in 2010 I introduced the concept
and kick-started the crowdsource
development by shipping a hundred teensy
kits to interested developers around the
world for free the response was
overwhelming the things you can get a
program
human interface to do are absolutely
astounding since then we've been working
on something I guess you can say a
little more turnkey something that
didn't require a development environment
C programming or firmware modification a
device is easy to customize as the USB
switchblade and even more deadly with
the help of Applied Security a man by
the name of Adam and our guy Jason
Applebaum I seriously can't thank these
people enough that solution is finally
here introducing the USB rubber ducky
1.0 continuing with the original concept
of developing the script files and
loading payloads by micro SD media a
penetration tester is able to carry
multiple payloads on one USB rubber
ducky additionally the board has been
fitted with a standard type a USB plug a
7 pin JTAG interface which can
alternatively be used for i/o and more
importantly a whopping 60 megahertz
32-bit admiral chip yeah proudly made in
the USA these boards are bangin to say
the least and what's more the scripting
language has me developing some pretty
wicked payloads let's run through the
first one this one's great for when your
mates distracted for a few seconds upon
plugging the USB rubber ducky into a
Windows 7 OS it'll automatically install
the generic drivers necessary to accept
keystrokes no intervention necessary the
duct deploys its payload in a matter of
seconds starting with a couple of key
combos like the windows candy to show
the desktop then print screen to take a
screenshot the duct then hits the Menu
key followed by V and D to disable the
desktop icons then windows are to pull
up the run line and open mspaint paste
the picture of the desktop with the
icons still there control s save the
file and then alt K and then F to set it
as the background all f4 closes paint
and then finally the windows key D will
show the desktop again now you can sit
back and watch as your coworker
furiously double clicks on icons that
aren't there oh yes of course the USB
rubber ducky isn't just for pranks a
more crafty payload will actually inject
executables for little a remote
administration this payload for example
fires up a Windows 7 command prompt
bypassing the user access control and
creating a few crafty files begins by
writing a visual basic script
you blow on all Windows machines that
converts base64-encoded ascii into
binary follow that up with a 1.2
kilobyte payload written out into an
ASCII file and then converted to binary
with the first run it with a host name
and a port number and you've got
yourself a little reverse shell running
with system privileges props go to ill
will on the hack five forms for that
little gem the beautiful thing about
these types of attack is that the host
isn't actually doing anything they
wouldn't normally be allowed to do
they're just doing it at a much faster
pace you may not have an hour to fiddle
with a free computer at a client site
but if you can get discrete for 10
seconds that may be all you need
what's more things like local
brute-force attacks are finally possible
load up a word list on a microSD card
and then go to town or soon will be
using the onboard CPU to generate
passwords on the fly and with the same
scripting language that anyone can write
for and any text editor like notepad you
can see why we're really proud of this
little quacker of course this is only
the beginning and we have big plans and
of course are interested in your
feedback
the first USB rubber duckies are in a
hack shop and you can email us at
feedback at hack 5 org we put together a
forum for scripting development and we
think you're going to love what we have
in store for the future of exploiting
the inherent trust of local i/o I'm
really interested in seeing what kind of
craft UK load you can come up with and
if one thing's for damn sure
this makes hack time so much fun no it
needs to be something more like
straightforward like USB rubber ducky
calm no it should be more hardcore like
like tactical salt duck call I'm leaning
towards for Grandville human interface
device calm so absolutely got is that
you typing Kirby Kirby
