by domain.com hello welcome back 5 my
name is Gerren kitchen
my name is Shannon Morse let's stick
that at me daily week that you're look
at my amazing antenna hey the AMT 500 is
pretty badass yeah like it I agree it's
pretty cool I can alright I want to make
it do all the things yes I hear that you
are getting down with the kitchen sink
I'm just pretty much yeah I'm getting
down with sinks audio sinks I'm getting
down with some WX f of T sliders you
just go to these letters and just is so
through they make sense okay they make
yeah I am - I'm I really want to get my
ham license is they replacing the Bay
Area's already and this didn't make the
cut in last week's episode when we've
non it but I know was it episode it was
fun it was fun we went out flying and
one of the things that didn't make the
cut is we were kind of chopping it up
was I went into talking about how what
was it that first person view flying but
the quadcopter is you know I do it
actually is been the number one biggest
thing that's really pushing me to get my
ham license as well just because then
you can use the 1.3 gigahertz frequency
which travels a lot better than the 5.8
gigahertz frequency that I use for my
video transmission now and the only way
to legally is it is with ham license and
so it's like as much as I have qualms
with the whole public database thing and
the restrictions on what you can't say
and stuff like that I think it might be
the thing that pushes me over the edge
so I just want to get the ham radio
license in case like the apocalypse
comes and there's an EMP and you know
and then I'll have a way to contact
people on the outside world or you know
what you're right and most of my
concerns regarding the content
restrictions and things of that nature
the things where you can't use
encryption over packet radio and stuff
are kind of one of those things where
you know if there were to be a
revolution things like that would be
important but at which point I guess
they wouldn't really apply
also I Love You FCC he does and I love
you FAA so I'm having lots of fun with
the hacker
ruff today awesome super fun times mike
has been doing a fantastic series as
well we should probably point that out
Mike Osman does a terrific job with the
great sky gadget stuff too over tooth
one the hack RF one you have seen his
gear and we want to promote his amazing
series on SDR absolutely it is way more
in-depth than we could ever yeah he's an
expert I've taken his course in person
the lady
I took the three-day course at torque on
two years ago it was amazing I've been
doing I've been watching his tutorials
on his web site and this is pretty much
where I got the idea for this for this
segment but he goes so far into depth
like stuff we don't have time for here
but so great really really really good
stuff um ooh there was something else
related to that oh oh yes but I have
lost my train of thought the thought
train has lost I left the station well
pick it up at the end of the show how
about that all right with that see you
on the other side I am so excited
because we finally got these hack RFS
and of course this one is just a like
the prototype model I think this one was
Darren's from the Kickstarter project
but the hacker f is on sale now it's
like 300 bucks in the hack shop and
there's a few other sites that you can
get it from as well some of our good
friends too so definitely check it out
if you're interested the hacker f it is
basically a radio that you can plug into
your computer very similar to the little
twenty dollar one that we've been
selling for like ever
the little rtl-sdr dongle but this one
has the ability to transmit as well as
receive and you can also pick up several
different frequencies at once and it has
a much much wider frequency that it can
handle to up to like six gigahertz and
way down to I think it's like a hundred
megahertz or something anyway it can
pick up lots and lots of signals as
compared to the teeny tiny one that we
used to play with a lot so I'm hoping
that I can get a whole bunch of segments
out of the hacker F but just to get
started I went ahead and followed Mike
Osmonds tutorials over on his website
Great Scott gadgets comm he has a lot of
really good tutorials over there and he
started out with showing one about GNU
radio so I wanted to break it down a
little
and basically give you guys an overview
if you've already purchased one of your
error if you're interested in one just
to give you an idea of one of the many
possibilities that you can do with it so
for this example I'm using the hacker f
obviously and just the simple antenna
that comes with it and it's really big
but you can also just use it like so if
you don't want to stretch it out all the
way it works easily either way I'm also
using a program a distro of Linux called
pen to sew pen to is basically the
hacker of Linux distro it's it already
has full support for the hacker F and
GNU radio companion which we're also
going to be using today so if you would
never use pen two before it works pretty
similar to any other ISO file you just
download it from pen to CH slash
download I got the version that's I
think it's a 14-point O 3 or the some
version like that anyway and you just
use unetbootin to install the ISO onto a
little USB flash drive so I've got my
handy little USB flash drive right here
and you boot off of it yay so nothing
new there when you first start up pen 2
you're going to want to type in start X
in the terminal that'll go ahead and
start it into the regular desktop
environment and you'll get a couple of
choices as far as what kind of config
you want to use just use the default
config and it works just fine so after
that you want to open a terminal window
so let's go ahead and jump onto my
computer over here so now I have pen 2
running I have my terminal open there's
a specific bug in 2014 dot o /r c 3
version of pen 2 linux which requires
you to type in this command e select la
pact set 1 before you want run gnu radio
companion this basically just fix a
teeny tiny little bug so now that I have
that I'm going to type in GNU radio
companion hit enter and that's going to
go ahead and open up GNU radio companion
ok now now that we have this open I'll
go ahead and move it on to the screen so
you all can see it better y'all and I'm
going to
up another terminal window just to make
sure that my hacker f is being seen by
the program so to do this I type in hack
RF underscore info alright so we see it
so it's going to say found hacker F
board it'll give you the ID number and
then I'll say whatever kind of hacker f
you have what version of your firmware
so I'm running 2014 Giro 4.1 and then
down here some serial numbers you'll
also notice on your hacker F there's
four different LEDs up here and each of
those are labeled USB RF one v8 and 3 V
3 so 3 V 3 should be green 1 v8 should
be orange RF is red and USB is green so
that basically means it's working so
we're ready to go yes so from my example
I'm basically going to use GNU radio
companion to create a whole script
that's going to make the hacker F pick
up two different FM radio stations at
once and hopefully it works correctly
and we will know that our hacker F is
working awesomely as it should
yay ok so I'm going to go ahead and go
into GNU radio Companion now since I've
already done this before just to test it
out I'm going to open up the specific
dock that I need this is called LS 1 GRC
now so probably look familiar if you've
gone through Michael Osmonds tutorial
Dada it's huge by the way it's very very
large so I'm going to go ahead and make
this a little bigger on here so I can
show you everything that's going on
alright so what's going on here well
there's two different parts to this
entire map you'll see all this going on
up at the top and then down at the
bottom you see a second section so each
of the sections looks very familiar up
on the top half we have a signal source
low-pass filter going into a rational
resampler this goes over to WB FM
receives or receiving FM multiplied
constant ad into an audio sync and then
we have down at the bottom pretty much
the same thing we have the signal source
multiplied low pass filter rational
ample wbf em receive multiply constant
add to the sink at the very end and then
over at the side we have a bunch of
different variables so the variables are
basically going to give you options to
change throughout the entire mapping so
instead of going through and changing a
certain segment in each and every
different graph that I have on here I
can just create a variable that can
change automatically throughout the
graph so for example under variable this
is going to be the sample rate you see
mine is pretty low I'm going to actually
change that to 10 so you can see what
happens so 10 million is what that
stands for I hit enter so that means
that it's picking up 10 million samples
every time that it's receiving some kind
of feedback through the hacker F into my
computer so that's a lot of samples and
my specific CPU might not be able to
receive all of those samples without
pretty much blowing up so I might have
to change that a little bit lower if I'm
using a whole bunch of different
frequencies at once for example to FM
frequencies when I change that sample
rate since its ID is si MP underscore
rate if I go into something like this
and I have this set to si MP underscore
rate as well that means that any time I
change
samp rate to 10 million or 4 million or
whatever it might be this is also going
to change to 10 million or 4 million or
whatever it might be so under the actual
graph right here we see 10m instead of
4m so if I change this variable now to
let's do 6m then you'll notice this also
changes to 6m and you'll notice several
other little pieces like that as well
now another really cool thing about GNU
radio companion that I learned from my
Cosman is that you can add in different
pieces to the actual GUI that you'll
receive when you run this script so what
I mean is say you want to create a
channel slider for your actual frequency
so instead of just being stuck on one
frequency you can move it from one
channel to another so if I want to skip
four
like 96.2 Rock FM or whatever it might
be to 102.5 I could just use this slider
in the GUI instead of having to change
it in the actual script that I created
in GNU radio companion so for this I
created channel frequency 2 and I have
it set to a default value of 98.5 but I
can obviously change this to be anything
between 87.9 and 107.9 so the bottom of
the FM frequency scale in the very
highest top part hit OK and you can go
back to you here and I also have this
one for audio gain so this is a really
cool one this is basically just going to
let you change your audio from being 0
all the way to the top so you can
totally blow out your speaker's yeah so
I just hit OK for that now if I run this
entire graph up here this is the little
execute button we'll probably hear a
whole bunch of noise oh yeah ok so I'm
going to turn that down a little bit so
you'll notice up here that I have two
sliders so I have channel frequency 2
starting at 98.5 and I have channel
frequency 1 96.5 so I could change the
top one to be like 102 I think there's a
102.5 around here and then the bottom
one I can keep the same so now if I turn
that all the way down we hear nothing
I'll turn up audio game 2 so this is for
my second channel frequency so this but
should be 102.5
I don't even know if there's anything on
there oh there is hey it works and then
I can set up the second one
are they playing the same song I think
are they playing the same song this one
change it to it's a good one let's see
ninety-nine point seven so that's four
one no there we go that sounds horrible
but we pick up two frequencies I don't
know why you would do that unless you
decided to be a DJ and start creating
your own mixes off of the FM radio
stations but I could think of one way
you could do this so say you want to
create a frequency or use the hacker
have to create a GNU radio companion
chart where you're picking up two
different trucker stations so you can
listen to two different truckers talking
back and forth to each other or this
could be good for radio stations but of
course I think you would have to turn
off squelch or turn it on when it one or
the other remind me guys what which one
it is offer on so that you wouldn't hear
all these static in between there
talking okay so you just hit the X to go
ahead and close out of it whenever
you're actually executing the file so
what I thought this was really cool I
was really happy that I feel an Osmonds
tutorial about how to use the hacker F
with G and your radio companion inside
of pen 2 because it's a really fun way
to first test out your hacker F and kind
of get used to working inside of GNU
radio companion because it's really easy
to break
pretty much anything inside the map once
you create it so you got to go through
and make sure that all your variables
are set correctly and everything like
that I think we can upload the file to
hack 5 if you guys want to check out my
own map but there's a pretty similar one
over on Mike Osmund website as well and
there was one last thing that I wanted
to share with you so I'm going to go
down here and I'm going to change this
because I mentioned sample rates earlier
and I thought those was kind
of interesting it shows you a big
difference in if your hardware is an i3
processor like mine is you might not be
able to handle 10 million samples per
second or whatever that might be so I'm
going to hit OK for this change it to 10
million hit execute so I don't know if
you hear that very well but there's a
huge jump in between all the data coming
through so you can't really hear this FM
frequency really well and also down here
you notice all these O's news and A's so
it's having trouble picking up all the
data that's coming through the hacker up
so to fix this I would go down here to
sample rate and then change it down to
I'll put it at 4 million instead hit
execute again and we shouldn't see any
of those zeros down here ok so we saw a
little a you but now it's it's perfectly
fine pretty cool hey it works
yay the other thing I wanted to show you
as well was a very simple little map if
I hit execute on this one quite simply
just shows one large feed right there so
not very much going on there kind of
boring I can execute and close that it's
basically just taking a signal source
throttling it at the same some sample
rate and then executing it at the same
sample rate kind of boring but it's one
of the many things that you can do
inside of GNU radio companion to make
sure that you're figuring out how to use
it correctly
anyway let me know if you guys have
created any map maps and if you want to
share them with me I would love to see
what you guys have created so that I can
learn more about GNU radio companion as
I test out my hacker ruff because it's
super fun and hopefully I can figure out
some other really cool segments that we
can do with this guy as I get more
educated on how to use one of these
amazing little radios yay I love SDR and
I hope you guys do too because I want to
continue doing this and hopefully get my
ham radio license soon email me over at
feedback at hack 5 org with your
thoughts and coming up next one more fun
bye
I was thinking the other day of a
clothespin say this blue clothespin here
was like I got a great idea for
something on the Internet well then the
white clothespin would come by and say
well then you need to grab it on many

I remember that one from way back when I
was in like seventh grade this week's
question is the element first discovered
and recorded by modern science was what
you can answer that question at hak5 org

awesome hack five goodies that just
about wraps up this week's episode of
hack five and sadly I have sadness to
report what we're not right now you know
where we aren't we're Louisville
Kentucky oh I know guys just so
depressing I know we're in the middle of
the move to the warehouse and so we
weren't made able to make it out - in
fact this may be 101 I'm sure everybody
had an awesome during dr. V Connor yeah
so sorry we didn't make it out we're
sending our hacker hugs as it were thank
you for the yang Ling that we didn't get
oh yeah yeah I know mr. protocol brought
it next year right next year to receive
so sorry about that I know we we strive
for excellence here and and we failed
