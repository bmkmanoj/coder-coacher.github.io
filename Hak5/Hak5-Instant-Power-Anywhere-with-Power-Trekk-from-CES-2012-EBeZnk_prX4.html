for hak5 i'm darren kitchen here at CES
2012 and as you guys know we are all
slaves to our batteries whether it's a
smartphone a GPS a camera those
batteries are gonna die and what lithium
ion is interesting what about sodium
Mesilla sodium what now liz is going to
explain it to me Liz I so sodium
silicide we work with the company sing
the chemistry we create a hydrogen
solution that goes into fuel cells which
we have on demo here at CES on what I'm
holding is a power truck this will be
our first product on the market comes
spring of 2012 you'll be available in
rei stores nationwide and canada and
japan okay so this is a hydrogen fuel
cell generator do iki it is yeah so to
give you a quick download we have our
little cartridges here they're called
power pucks what is this power park ave
in it so that has our sodium suicide in
that sodium suicide when you combine
that with water that's going to create
hydrogen on demand so we have a little
pouch right here you can put any type of
water in there I can be saltwater muddy
water here beer you know anything you
want you just snap this top back on and
what you're gonna do is an instant start
stop stop so I turn it on you wait like
one second for it to juice up a little
bit we're good to go you'll see your
arrow come on you have a USB port here
so the product comes with a number of
interchangeable heads so any type of
newer electronic that you have that's a
small device it seems like everything is
USB these days so this is pretty cool
now I've just put these chemicals in
here in water and it's now created I
dream creating electricity it's
outputting one amp five volts it's got
fifteen hundred milliamps so as you can
imagine that's probably about one I
phones worth of battery what do i as the
cartridge spent after I have charged my
phone it is so we're selling power pucks
and packs of three they'll retail for
right around twelve dollars and one puck
will give you five watts of power so if
you think about it in terms of charging
your iPhone if your iphone is completely
dead you'll get to full recharges from
one power puck well that's interesting
so four dollars for each recharge and as
opposed to like a rechargeable battery
that will eventually degrade is this
since it is just a chemical compound
that is waiting to be mixed with water
is it going to lose its ability to
charge over time it will not the shelf
life is however long you want it to be
and no end okay so what about when i'm
done with this though what do i do with
the spent puck um right now you can
throw it away but we're hoping to do um
you know we're hoping by the time that
these products are our market ready and
consumers can go out and buy them we're
hoping to have retail places like REI
you know which would be selling the
products where consumers can bring a
number of the cartridges back and they
would send them back to us and we would
refill them with sodium silicide and
then ship them back to the consumer
