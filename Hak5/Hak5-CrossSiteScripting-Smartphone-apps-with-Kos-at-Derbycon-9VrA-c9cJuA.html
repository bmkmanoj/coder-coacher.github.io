by goto assist Express character becomes
2011 with Brad year from level 1
hackerspace are you Brad I'm doing great
so tell me about you guys after space
well we've got a two thousand square
foot warehouse in downtown Louisville
Kentucky
we've got about 36 members in our hacker
space and we've been around for a little
over a year now I gotta say the whole
movement has just blown up in these last
couple of years what really inspired you
well I found out about these guys on the
internet after they had already started
meeting in bars and coffee shops and I
just met up with them and they're all
really cool guys so I started hanging
out and I've been with them ever since
nice well tell me about your project cuz
this looks wicked well what I've got
here is a demo model of our
transatlantic balloon payload we're
trying to become the first amateur group
to cross the Atlantic Ocean with an
unmanned robotic balloon so here is the
the demo model it's stripped down so you
can see all the guts on the inside we've
had to design everything from flight
controllers and embarrassed ballast
controllers to cryogenic chambers to
test all our stuff in we've got lots of
software on the back end to test
everything we've run Mission Control
simulations so ok I gotta say first off
the FAA they're probably not gonna like
this
we are actually an exempt balloon by FA
are 101 regulations I'm not familiar
excellent so Noah launches lots and lots
of weather balloons all the time every
day and this isn't in the same category
as a weather balloon even though it
behaves a little bit differently so we
fall in that same category but we still
want to be responsible you know we don't
want to be hackers that are menaces in
the sky
you're not gonna pack it sniff across
the Atlantic what did you find a really
cool access point somewhere in the
middle of the ocean we're flying
we've already spent enough money just
trying to get it there so but we are
going to try and be safe about this
whole thing so we are going to be
talking to air traffic control the whole
time letting them know where we are
where we're going and anything else they
want to know we also have control over
this balloon so we can actually aboard
our mission and cut it out of the sky if
we need to how do you get access to it I
mean how are you talking to it we're
talking to it with a satellite link the
whole time it's in the sky you guys that
a satellite link how do you how do you
swing that
well there are commercial satellite
networks out there that for a for a
small fee you will give you some few
kilobytes of data that you can transmit
from anywhere in the world and how do
you go about transmitting it I mean is
this right running Linux is a standard
modem how does it work well it's
actually all 8-bit microcontrollers are
Arduino is honestly we've got like five
Arduino is on this thing and one of them
is controlling the satellite modem the
satellite modem just talks a weird
binary serial protocol and if we talk to
it in a language it like us it'll uplink
that data to the satellite network and
then the balloon will actually email us
it'll send us an email that we can then
read and decode the data and figure out
where it is that's that's wicked that
sounds expensive - it is it is if you
have to go through if you have to if you
have to go through commercial cables but
if you just buy the parts our satellite
modem there's only a hundred and fifty
dollars each as a part and then we can
develop on top of that and the satellite
networks we've actually had to take
great lengths to reduce our data
consumption at our rate it's not going
to be that expensive at all what kind of
telemetry are you gonna be getting back
in addition to things like position and
speed where it's going where it's been
and diagnostic information from the
inside we're also collecting scientific
information such as external temperature
and humidity we've got a cloud sensor on
here to detect whether or not we've
blown into a cloud so if we fall out of
the sky we know whether it's because of
ice in the atmosphere we've also got a
helium temperature sensor in the very
top of our balloon which is really
important because no one has collected
this data on a balloon like ours before
not even NASA wow that's really
intriguing how ok so I get that the idea
is to cross the pond how do you change
like your altitude and things like that
I'm these are probably really newbie
questions but you know as a hacker and
not a balloon engineer or something how
does that all work well eventually what
come what goes up must come down so we
we drift down over a period of many days
but we've got ballast on here so we can
drop ballast and then head back up but
we are limited by the amount of ballast
that we have so once we were on a
ballast it's all down is there like a
limit to the size of the payload that
you can launch and still be under
the criteria of this FAA regulation yes
we are limited to twelve pounds of
payload okay so I guess I understand why
it's with all these little micro
controllers around we knows it needs to
be really really light so you can put
your 12 pounds or as much of it as
possible into the into the ballast so
you can stay up for as long as possible
how do how do you know where you're
gonna go it's not like you've got a
engine on this thing with propellers or
anything and even if you did not like
you could really go anywhere how how do
you can how do you have any idea where
you're going to land well the government
fortunately releases global wind data
sets like every four hours so we just
used government provided tools to run
the data and it'll tell us exactly where
we're going to go so we just run those
models until it ends up that we can let
it go and it'll be in Europe somewhere
somewhere in Europe and so you just kind
of have an idea of like when like what
time of day to launch it or something
like that yep we've got well we all have
day jobs so we're only looking at launch
opportunities that are that are in the
evening so we we look at launch
opportunities in the evening and we get
about a weeks notice before we're able
to launch that's really cool so I gotta
ask will people be able to follow this
I'm like Twitter and other social media
and stuff like that absolutely we've got
a Twitter feed lvl1 white star we've
also got our own website is white star
balloon calm and when you go there you
can sign up for a mailing list get
announcements when we're going to launch
and when we do on you'll be able to
track it live across the ocean we've got
an application that will show you the
line of where it's going and where we
think it'll and where we think it'll be
and and it'll also tell you all our
telemetry values live yeah and then some
hacker space and France is all like hey
we retrieved your balloon we're gonna
send it back around the other way
absolutely that would be great and
actually once we achieve the goal of
transatlantic we're gonna work on the
goal of global circumnavigation Wow are
you gonna go around the world in 80 days
something hopefully it won't take 80
days but it sure it will sure take a lot
longer than that to build the next model
what an elegant way to go around the
world by balloon I'm truly fascinated I
didn't meet anybody from the
hackerspaces
it's just amazing the kinds of creative
project actors always come up with thank
you so much I hope that you inspire like
kids at home that are just thinking
about getting into this stuff where can
they find out about the the hacker space
well our hacker space is the level 1
hacker space in Louisville Kentucky and
they can find out about it at lvl 1 org
thank you so much Brad there are two
things IT professionals and their

again for the nibble and this week you
sent in by anonymous not that anonymous
who writes that this is an awesome way
to download and extract archives without
having to permanently store that target
GZ file which you don't really need you
just need what's inside of it so check
this out W get TAC capital o space TAC
space and then your URL in this case I'm
getting stuffed Atari and then we go
ahead and pipe that into Tarzi xvf space
TAC there we go
resolving our domain and voila it is
downloading and extracting at the same
time and we don't have to keep the
target out GZ how awesome is that if
you've got a nibble go ahead and send it
over to us at hack 5 org slash never get
yourself some free swag while you're at
