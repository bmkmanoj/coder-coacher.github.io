array and picking up beacons from
aircraft 170 miles away all that more
this time on hack 5 this episode of hack
5 is brought to you by domain.com hello
welcome to hack 5 my name is darren
kitchen i'm shannon moore your weekly
dose of Technol us it is we have so much
fun things planned yes we are going to
GTFO of the studio and have fun with
these guys oh lord what did you do well
no as you remember last week we built a
coaxial a linear you get apart these are
so the through the magic of television
we measured wrong and oh those are that
yeah so was his fault I know but we
didn't air that because you know but I'm
owning up to it now because you should
measure twice cut once you shouldn't say
it wasn't air it's unless you were the
one that edited it yeah well that long
good stuff so yeah we are going to the
top of a mountain we're going to stick
this antenna on top of a van and it will
be fun times yes and we're going to find
out if a six-foot antenna can get better
signal than a 6 inch hmm what do you
think will happen let's find out you
know what we have a gift from a fan we
do have a good form of fun we should
check it
that is logistic yeah it is it is here
so uh here is the tournament put my
mustache down your mustache here's the
note
Shannon Darren hak5 crew you a fan of
the show and met you guys at Def Con
last year oh cool
now at BitTorrent we are
what is this a sync we are working
working on sync we saw your episode on
it from last September let us know if
you guys decide to cover sync again
sweet in the future we got BitTorrent
t-shirts oh hey check this out
see you guys at DEFCON what does it say
protecting you from the NSA that's soda
but I really appreciate that we will
close ourselves with this so we
will no longer be naked Aaron and thank
you for the stickers and patches and
stuff and so keep doing the good work
that you guys are doing because we know
we've got a couple of friends over there
and I knew that you guys really care
about we likes the BitTorrent yeah Oh
stickers bit torn ting is not a crime
guys oh my gosh all right a teeny chef
yes let's go to the place with the thing

we are off like a like a truck is gonna
say like a turn of wrongs like a turtle
hurdles put the rubber gird no we used
to say we're off like a herd of turtles
that's cute yeah
so let's recap let's recap yeah Sun
antenna we built the antenna this planes
on the sky
yes antenna will see the planes that way
this is a dinky antenna oh that teeny
tiny one yes yes so this is what comes
with it it's not really tuned for our
frequency we know we can pick things up
with it though which is nice but it's
almost a few things this magnetic Hey it
is alright cool so what do you say we
just stick this on the roof okay plug it
into your laptop we'll see how many
planes we can see then we do the same
thing within a minute yeah let's do it
to see kind of the same airspace yeah
and see how many but what is it they're
they're beacons so they're frames so the
measured in frames per second times per
second which is weird because this is
not a video game no well what we want is
a high F we make it a video game yes
cool all right then we get to fly them
into so first off we need to Wow all
right so the antenna the way we get out
here's our giant PVC pipe and here's our
coaxial collinear okay and I've got our
SMA adapter on there and the necklace
with pigtail and a little cheap real
tech SDR yep so what do you say we just
break out the hacksaw cut this to length
oh boy
shove the coax in the tube tape it all
up and we don't have to make it like
super pretty because this isn't going to
be permanent yet yeah I have a feeling
we may be changing some elements of this
later
but why don't you hold that I'm gonna
grab a hacksaw a hacksaw yeah so whose
idea was it to give you a hacksaw well
this is the hack across America van huh
but no I mean in all honesty break a leg
you can't travel without tools of course
so should have something in here yeah
there we go oh boy we're literally going
to hack yeah the thing yeah go ahead
wait wait I'll drink all the booze you
can hack all the yes
all right and this is kind of great
we've got these nice little end cap
pieces what we're not actually going to
use today however if we're trying to
make this watertight we most definitely
would okay all right but we don't really
need what you hold I'd I'll at the very
out here okay got it actually a little
bit higher than that because what we're
gonna do is create like a little bone
okay so we're gonna just wrap a whole
bunch of electric tape around there at
the top so it doesn't fall through yep
and that looks about right so we need to
cut here I'm just gonna say that's it so
measure once cut twice tip it that's how
it's supposed to work good I did good
how do I do it you do it
have you ever heard solved anything no
okay well first of all you need a horse
but we don't have any of those like a
name a horse
yes no well we for you here
yay huh we got it
PVC is awesome okay that's fun
can I do it again sure I'll let you take
the excess home okay all right at this
point well this is our end so I'm gonna
go ahead and send the end of this
through okay and then we'll cap it okay
cool almost this is really good stuff
it's a half-inch outer diameter PVC and
you can see even with ax this fits
almost perfectly right there we're just
going to put a little bit of electric
tape around the end and then on our
other side Hey look at that I knew it
would come out perfectly that's what we
want just the tip just the tip yes as
usual
so we're kin yep sweet
all right feels pretty steady down here
I don't feel like it's gonna fall out
yeah I don't either
not not shaking or anything awesome you
want to tape up that too just a bit okay
and actually get this what we're gonna
do here is we're going to tape our real
tech dongle on to the bottom again this
isn't permanent so if this were we would
want to get like a Pelican case or some
cases we need to use it with this right
oh yeah well you know what we can do is
this pigtail we can try both ways okay
okay so mmm yeah yeah no we can do that
we'll do it with the pigtail both ways
there we go
so the reason that we're doing this is
because I don't want to have to have a
long feed line which means have a lot of
cable loss right yeah that makes sense
so if I can get my radio really close to
the antenna yeah I'm gonna have better
signal okay uh in this case my feed line
is literally just a what is that like a
10 centimeter the pigtail so really not
much of anything okay
okay all right so this is about ready
this is about ready the next step though
you want to set that down yeah sure is
I'm gonna need you to use the Force oh
that sounds fun yeah take it off trade
you what do I do
huh did you oh it comes out yeah whoa no
that's really heavy all right try it
again just go whoosh well here I'm gonna
grab the end of it haha that is really
long and I'm gonna twist off each end
okay okay so this thing this is a
fiberglass pole Wow or uh hanging all
sorts of stuff cool you use it for kites
yeah a lot of things and we're gonna be
using it for our radio we're already up
about 700 feet elevation well every
little bit counts and if we can clear
this tree line yeah but you can't see
but there's trees then
we'll get even further okay all right
okay one second gladiator
yeah that looks good I can't wait to
whack people with this thing slap so you
got it yep okay it's not that heavy
luckily well it's really tall yeah
do you feel proud of yourself yeah God
right now
Wow okay so we are going to take the PVC
pipe yes and we're going to attach it to
the top up there
okay so plug that guy in and we need to
plug in the USB extension so that's the
thing we're gonna actually have to use
blob whoa I got it all right I got two
for you okay I think I'm going to use
the longer one okay all right so this is
actually a what is it it's a 10 meter so
this is a I believe it is a 10 meter USB
2 extension and so that's actually out
of spec as far as the USB specifications
and stuff go however its active in that
there's actually essentially it's a 1
port USB hub and so that's how it's able
to actually give us the juice we need to
be able to get it this far sweet
yeah nicely I should do the trick ok so
how about we lay this down we secure it
to it and then uh okay no see what
happens you do you think this might be a
little too heavy for the top of the
fiber yes
pull it could be a very well could be I
guess we'll find out won't we
yes if it is we can just move it down a
bit
yeah I mean I work just fine we're
already 700 feet up but yeah probably
should push them in the middle too
why don't you do the honors oh well we
on here
this thing is going to lean and fall
over that's I'm hoping it doesn't but
you've got a very good point in which
case we might actually need to come back
and try this again with like guy-wire so
you just we could just move it down on
the whole bit
uh-huh see how that works the idea is
since this is not permanent we use a
fiberglass pole because you know we can
mount this to the van we can take it
anywhere yeah
that is pretty cool
are you ready to erect the antenna yes I
am let's go come on all right
help me okay Oh hold on oh man you got
it yeah there we go
I feel like it's gonna break
oh no no it it seems okay right now
let's just until I have any wind until a
breeze this is the most perfectly still
day okay so maybe if this was a
permanent structure there's a bit of a
UH I don't know beefier fiberglass pole
with some yeah guy wire or something but
it's not so horrible okay well you ready
yeah I'm ready
do you want to let's uh boost it up and
then test it yeah let's mount it
something to permanently okay then and
then run the ethernet or one run the USB
and then test all right let's do it
so let's use this ladder to our
advantage that sounds good so I'll bring
it up to you and then just feed it back
down to me got it
yeah I've got it totally got it great
perfect we can feed it all the way down
to the ground awesome
here it comes all right we're good cool
all right it's looking good up there
how's it up here all right so I booted
it up uh-huh I'm gonna go all right I
think we're ready I'm pretty sure it's
working oh I I would say wow we're okay
if this is San Francisco if this is San
Francisco here which is five miles away
with a blue flies Francisco huh way down
there a San Jose yep so we're already
wound up here is Richmond where where's
this guy who's he where what's this guy
this guy's heavy on oh I think that's
Monterey down here that's Jael down here
that's Margaret so Jael Japan yeah yeah
it's Japan Airlines okay okay it's a na
it's from Japan it's out of altitude of
39,000 feet and we're seeing it on those
please you know
can do we can look up that latitude and
longitude and see how far it is from us
no way that is a massive difference that
is cool how many planes do we have jeez
I'm just in the map we have about Hannah
yeah yeah and then how many here will
ready series seven cost
what about frames per second what are we
getting Wow let's see 30 - boom 3000 on
this one I usually get woody I'll
usually get like five five to eight mmm
with this Wow
we should definitely test it though
because this you know maybe this is a
little wonder so how about you shut it
all down
okay I'm gonna go ahead just to be fair
will magnetically stick this to the roof
okay and then we'll do the same thing
all right sounds good so okay I pulled
up ATSB
sharp I'm gonna pull up the other ATSB
scope profile okay so it's right there
alright so hit start and it's always
slow at the beginning and you see a
boost up okay so we'll give it a few
seconds until it actually hits its
frames per second one one okay great
okay all right we have one well - okay
so but these are beaconed out about once
per second so that means that we have
one plane right okay so I'm gonna set my
location we're right next to the water
awesome and localhost ADSP sharp is the
program we're using and setup client
active okay let's see what we get
there's one no that's that's just the
menu the menu okay so we have the menu
oh come on it should pick something up
we're okay we have three there we go
we have three in the menu but it hasn't
picked up any well you don't have it oh
it's fine hey there he is
Wow one so and that's also a lot closer
I mean we're talking about 10 miles
maybe uh this is about how far out we
were yeah we were looking at stuff from
way past I am I'm no longer good it's
good where we see the circles cuz that's
we were seeing at the edge of this
see within this edge we're now picking
up and now we're faking yeah was pretty
bad okay so yes we absolutely need to
you know what you're going to love this
okay first of all to two huge points
this is not even the best a DSP antenna
we could build right because there's
conflicting information about what the
right way to do it is as far as 16
elements yeah versus more elements or
less elements as well as whether or not
you need to have a quarter wavelength
whip at the top and two quarter
wavelength sections at the bottom as
well as whether or not you should short
these there's just so much I would say
conflicting wisdom but I think what it
is is differences of opinion so I would
like to actually try some variations on
this and see what the differences are I
mean it's obvious right here that this
little uh sorry this little guy is just
it's cool it's cool
very cool but it's not the end-all
be-all when it comes to 1090 Wow you see
that guy right there that's the one
that's flying right there we actually
Paul look I'm pointing at him that right
there you're never gonna get it with
your with your wedding elaborate lines
yeah that is American Airlines yeah
American Airlines flight 666 oh that's
kind of like the ICAO designation of
that plane is a af 666 glad I'm not on
that plane
well it's also November zero-eight
zero-five whiskey Bravo that's really
cool we are just starting to geek out
with all the fun practical bits that oh
look you just took a right sorry I'm so
loving this in geeking out here umm we
should definitely like in the end of
this okay yeah let's switch over to that
we're gonna switch over to the other one
and enjoy watching the skies for a
little bit but we absolutely want to
hear your feedback so remember to hit up
feedback at hak5 org you can also follow

oh I like the Moses yeah and and we're
selling off str projects and we'd love
to see your code in your projects yeah
so you know shun tell geeky bits that's
not fun to me yeah we can do that let's
see did you mention the email
yeah the feedback at hack 5 org is my
favorite email that's where they can
send you mention a store I did not know
where we do a check a shop comm you can
buy your own yeah you know what yes the
end you know you can get what at the
shop one of the 80s p.m. gems whoa
no it's a deal yeah you get the SDR
dongle with the one that picks up two
airplanes and the near-end around that
picks up two hundred and we can sorry
I'm totally getting into this right now
and then you can geek out on the forms
we've got it a complete SDR forum at
forms a hack five org where you can
share what you're picking up and what
you're learning is we're all learning
this together and so much fun it's
exciting yeah I think so I think we're
skipping techni loader for the week so
we will pick it up again next week but
thank you guys for tuning in thank you
for your support

subscribing on YouTube or buying
something from the store we absolutely
love it that you can join us in this
awesome quest that is hack five and and
without further entitled we're reminding
