Trump is under fire from Congress
representatives and connected car apps
are vulnerable to hacks all that coming
up now on threat wire greetings I'm
Shannon Morse and this is threat wire
for tuesday February 21st 2017 your
summary of the threats to our security
privacy and Internet freedom this show
is now on iTunes as well as your
favorite podcasting app thanks to our
patrons over at patreon.com last threat
wire so make sure to subscribe and now
on to the news the security firms cyber
ex researched and discovered strong
malware that was used to steal
information from over 70 infrastructure
media and scientific research outlets
and what seems to be a very large cyber
reconnaissance operation cyber ex found
the malware in the wild and reverse
engineers the data to start an analysis
now while the installation of the
malware was rather simple all the
hackers had to do was send a phishing
email to the target with infected
Microsoft Word documents attached and of
course people open them the actual
malware itself was quite advanced it's
able to steal audio by activating the
microphone on machines to listen in on
conversations along with taking
screenshots stealing documents and
passwords and uploading it all to
dropbox of all places now once the data
was on dropbox the attackers could
download it they coined this operation
bug drop in this malware tallied to have
stolen more than 600 gigs of data from
specific targets cyber x pointed out in
a blog post that microphones are
virtually impossible to block from
surreptitiously recording as on many pcs
you would need to physically access the
hardware and disable it the targets were
mostly in Ukraine and while cyber X has
not named any potential attackers they
do consider this to be a state-sponsored
attack given the sophistication and the
manpower that it would actually take to
analyze all of the data a few also
appeared in Russia Saudi Arabia and
Austria now many of the targets were in
separatist states that the Ukrainian
government labeled as terrorist
organizations now so far no ransomware
or viruses or infrastructure shutdowns
have happened
as an effect of operation bug drop but
since reconnaissance is usually a first
step this could happen in the near
future today in this week in the Trump
administration a server associated with
president Trump's website aka server to
Donald J Trump calm was hacked and
defaced by a hacker calling him or
herself promaster and that's a three
instead of an e in the name the server
has now been taken offline and has not
taken down their regular comm website
now while this was occurring Trump has
also been under fire for continuously
using a personal Android device instead
of a secured phone that the Secret
Service issued around the time of his
inauguration along with other cyber
security shortcomings congressman ted
lieu signed along with 14 other
congressmen and women a letter to the
house oversight committee to investigate
Trump's cyber security measures in
practices since this phone is most
likely an older model Android that no
longer receives updates to the Android
operating system it could put him and
the u.s. at risk this along with
discussing sensitive information in the
same room as by standards and reading
confidential materials by the way of a
cell phone camera flashlight brings
concern representative lose letter asked
for proper training on security and
privacy for the White House staff along
with checking into what devices Trump
uses day to day and if any monitoring
has happened to government
communications RSA happened last week in
San Francisco it's basically an annual
security conference where researchers
will speak and then the companies will
vend Kaspersky Labs malware researchers
Victor chebyshev's in Mikhail kuzin I am
terrible with european names by the way
so I'm sorry if I'm pronounce those
incorrectly they gave a talk about
several Android apps for connected cars
and how they all had pretty big security
holes android apps for connected
vehicles can be used to locate the car
unlock the doors start the engines do
over-the-air updates for car software
connect to the entertainment systems and
a lot more the researchers found two of
the apps ask users to log in with
unencrypted credentials meaning that
they are plain text and could easily be
stolen spearfishing could also allow for
fake malware versions of the car apps to
be installed on a user's phone the
researchers have not released info on
which apps are susceptible to hack but
they hope that their research sends a
clear message to the industry worst case
scenario you download a malware written
copy of your vehicle app it allows an
attacker to unlock your car door and
they steal your car if your car doesn't
need a key to start the engine of course
or they could just tote it off on a tow
truck it's not that bad right before I
go I want to give a huge thanks to
