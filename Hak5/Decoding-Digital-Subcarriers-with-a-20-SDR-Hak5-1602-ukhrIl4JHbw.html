modulating some carriers and talking
about the radio data system all that and
more and him this time on Michelle this
episode of hack five is brought to you
by domain.com hello everybody and
welcome to this episode of hack five my
name is Shannon Morris i'm darren
kitchen and we're talking radios right
or Oh a little mini ducks
so how tiny ducky for you I love these
ducks they're so strange their eyes are
all derpy it's true hey we hit
everything we're talking about radios
this week and it's really fun and
exciting because we like radios I did we
do segments not work out right before
the shoot so I'm a little bit no but
actually when you figured out is so I
don't want to save it for next week
because we've got some parts on the way
that are going to know we need we need a
high-gain yagi and then it's going to
get awesome yes more about that later
today we're actually demodulating
modulated modulations with radio it's
math man last week we've actually been
getting a lot of great feedback long
yeah we have I actually I should
actually do a short review next week
about this video that somebody sent in
he we have a fan who does a podcast all
about ham radio and he sent me like a
specific segment that was directed at me
and it was all about basically kind of a
beginning tutorial to get you into SDR
and radio and I was like oh my god is so
cool I totally fangirled out and now I'm
subscribed to their YouTube channel hey
it was exciting
but yes thank you to everybody you
expect all of those emails like I'm
enjoying all of it so thank you so much
and I'm glad so many people are enjoying
it and we have a new forum that's
talking oh yeah that's right yes right
in addition to the real tech dongles in
the hack shop we also have an SDR forum
on forms a hack five org just get a
credit or clicking the whole thing at
the top and uh yeah
join us as we figure out some cool stuff
in fact a little smoke was just in there
talking about you know this awesome app
that allows you to with the realtek
dongle find planes and it
it's a local webserver and it's kind of
like a DSP sharp except Linux II it's
pretty cool awesome tool and we've got
some other fun projects he works with
this but today I wanted to follow up
with what we were talking about last
week you know as we build these building
blocks no pun intended with GRC here
we're going to go ahead and like so thus
far we've really been talking to analog
stuff I mean except for the a DSP where
we do mode s and we kind of have a
program just go ahead and demodulate
that for us and turn it into something
that we can actually like use on our
computers and put into a database and
plot on a map um but so far we've just
been dealing with FM because FM is cool
but FM is not it's not digital it's
basically just a bunch of things long
channels well it's frequency modulated
tell Alexa whoo yeah but there's
actually more to it than that
you see in the 90s some cool stuff came
about as far as putting some digital
information in the frequency in the FM
stream yes I started to notice this in
my car you get that you've got the thing
in your car with the Dozen thing yeah
yeah you've just whatever I listen to
like a FM channel I look at the little
monitor that's in my car I have a Ford
Focus and it will show me the name the
title and the name of the song that's
coming up and it's kind of cool so it's
nice I can just look over instead of
having to like Shazam it every time I
want to find a song and it'll just tell
me exactly what I'm listening to
so not only have you outed yourself for
listening to the radio terrestrially
listen sometimes my friend dog just
sometimes my phone dies and I have to
listen to the radio you've also added
yourself Ravin for bit more over RDS is
the name of this system here it reads me
text messed with you data system RDS and
it was started by the Europeans because
because you guys are cool the European
broadcasting Union kina came up with the
specification and later became an
international specification and
essentially what it does is it mixes in
about a 1200 to kill a bit or not even
killaby I'm sorry a 1200 bit per second
stream of data I didn't get a little bit
error correction in there and if 57
kilohertz subcarrier and so with that
essentially
means is a like modulated data like
we're used to in this case we've been
talking to FM as a frequency modulation
inside of that so we're it's kind of
like encoding outside your modulation yo
dawg i heard you like modulation so we
modulated him so think of it like when
you do like a VPN tunnel right so now
you're sending all of your TCP traffic
inside of another stream you're sending
you know this I don't know say HTTP
stream and then it goes inside of a PPTP
stream or an IPSec stream or whatever
your VPN protocol may be yeah okay we do
the same thing when we SSH tunnel and
use it to you know okay yeah exactly
when we send like other things over
another thing you know that you could
continue gonna be doing the same thing
with FM yes we're gonna do the same
thing with FM and we're gonna do it with
new radio companion are the GNU radio
suite which was the program that we
showed off last week and last blocks and
last week we were doing it with pen too
awesome
Linux distribution I should also mention
give some love to Kali Linux or Kali
Linux or however you want to pronounce
it Cali Lewis it's an awesome distro
that has all of the pen testing tools
built in and including GRC organ Radeon
companion and I'm not using that this
week oh really
yeah they have they don't have the most
up-to-date version of new radio
companion and we need 2.7 for this so
what are you using I'm actually this is
so cool new radio companion has their
own distro we take a look here under new
Radio org you can actually grab the new
radio live DVD and in this case I've
just used unetbootin to burn it to a USB
Drive but essentially it's you know it's
it's based on Ubuntu 1204 so you already
get a TLS version it is 64-bit so keep
that in mind and it has the latest new
radio release 372 and in this case is
also really cool I need to break out my
hack RF it's got a hack RF snapshot it's
got at its research stuff if you know
for when we break out the the ettus as
well as the RTL SDR that we need
so awesome tools all done for us and I'm
running right here as you see I mean in
Ubuntu it's just like it's just like
every other one - yeah except - has
those built in and I do mention I can't
stress enough how painful it is so you
can compile this from source yourself it
will take forever and it is - lately I
like to make things easier for me I'm
just going to throw it out there that
you probably use this because it's easy
that said I wanted to go ahead and you
know show you how to get started with an
app called gr RDS this is found over at
github at Bastable
and it's essentially a fork of some of
the other projects that do decoding of
the digital or the radio digital system
okay so these are TS demodulators are
going to be able to provide us not just
like what we did last week of listening
to the FM radio but also seeing what
song is playing what the name of the
station is some like that and it's a
good example of how complex it can get
to start saying okay cool so we can
listen to you know we can pull stuff out
of the out of the stream and we can say
hey this is something easily modulated
like FM yes a.m. or whatever have you
now we can actually take a look at sort
of what kind of blocks it takes to
decode digital data and I think looking
at this will make you really have a lot
of respect for something that we take
for granted all the time Wi-Fi and
typically we work on such an abstraction
so far removed from what it actually
takes as far as like all of the filters
and all of the crazy stuff it takes to
actually make this work
so we're not going to pick this apart
because this is not a signal show as
much as I would like it to be and as
much as I could spend my life reading
Wikipedia articles and books on on that
stuff this early what's going to happen
after the episode yeah it's gonna go
read Wikipedia but mind you it this is
pretty simple to get started with all
you need to do is clone the git or in
this case I just downloaded the zip from
those gr - RDS project and so what you
end up with is I've already got here and
simply you know all you have to do is
build it and move CD to you make it
build directory CD to that you do see
make dot dot I've already done this in
fact the instructions are right down
here basically run those and you'll be
good to go
I did in this instance actually realized
that I had to I was missing one
dependency I forget which one it was it
was just a standard library but it told
you what library it was and it was a
matter of sudo apt-get install whatever
the library name was it was off to the
races so aside from the live DVD of
canoe radio that's the only other thing
that I needed really okay but when you
go to build it it'll be really obvious
and after you've done that it's simply a
matter of opening the GRC file so let's
go ahead and do that it's under that see
a CD two dot and I went for CD two apps
and you'll see we have the RDS rxg RC
file so let's open that up in new radio
companion ampersand okay yeah we'll do
it that way so ampersand boom runs it
the process I'm making around here for
you
nope not at all okay cool let me go
ahead and open this you see IDs
underscore rx Jesse okay that's it
that's just slightly complicated and it
goes on for awhile my gosh there's a lot
of stuff that goes into this and I'm not
going to pick this apart but essentially
this is going to provide us with oh I
mean a lot of this is the GUI elements
but let's go ahead and just run this off
the bat to get a sense of it I'll go
ahead and generate this or I'm sorry
execute it and I just need a radio
station now we have static yeah let's do
98.1
that's kiss-fm here in San Francisco
there you go okay so it already says
KISS FM or love 'litham now and
and as happy as we all know it Love
Shack b-52s right there at the bottom
Wow that great I mean it's like I said
it's it's only 112 or I'm sorry 1,200
bits per second that's so cool but it uh
it's just enough to be able to swoop in
and give you all that data it happens
pretty pretty consistently and it has an
error correction in there which is nice
so now not only are we getting C not
planned whatsoever to but I just love
that this is actually kind of like an
easter egg
if you ever watched hack 5 season 1
think it may have been like episode 3 or
something there's a reference here to
the Love Shack so how weird is that um I
have to go back and watch ok we can also
come in and see all of the different
stuff like we've got like a nice little
waterfall and yeah yeah the waterfall we
have the frequency yeah going up and
down and now we also have and I have to
turn this down before we get a copyright
complaint otherwise yeah it's so cool
that is pretty cool I wanted to and I
bring this up though as as we continue
this series and I want to get into some
more practical that's especially next
week with some fun hacky stuff we are
going to I want to show a demonstration
of some of the other parts of the new
radio suite that we can use with this
particular application ok so as you saw
well let me close this out ok and I'm in
fact I'm going to go ahead and exit out
of new radio companion ok and back to my
terminal and you'll see I have this GRC
file here right well I can actually open
this up without first opening a new
radio companion and then opening it and
they're executing it it's pretty simple
there's actually a new radio companion
compiler oh so kind of like GCC except
it's GRC - everything from the terminal
yes which is beautiful but it's still
going to pop up that nice GUI so grcc
you want to use the tacky option that's
going to go ahead and execute it right
after you're done and in this case it's
RDS underscore rx GRC
and after a few seconds there we go and
all just those don't we the same perfect
tune back over to that station now it
always shows up at that default station
I'm assuming you can just change that in
d-block
yeah I mean just like we did last week
well yeah just like we did with the last
week and we had set that variable yeah
to start out at whatever was 96.3 FM and
then we created a slider so that we
could change that up and down that
variable does have what the default is
and so you're right if we wanted to
change that we can go ahead and close
this and instead of opening it using
grcc we can do Janene radio companion
and that file okay
and you'll see in here there's a
variable for the audio rate there's a
variable for the sample rate yeah and
okay there we go it's frequency tune and
the value is actually frequency offset
so there's going to be another remember
you can set a variable to have the value
of the variable is actually the value of
the slider so if we look around here
very well we look around here we'll find
the slider
I'm not going to dissect this program
too much but but it is really cool to
see how all of this stuff works and
there will have links in the show notes
if you're interested in dissecting this
protocol because it is really cool but I
just wanted to use this as an example of
you know how to get some digital stuff
out because next week that's what we're
going to be doing and how to kind of
combine the disk with command line with
grcc Kathy has some fun in a plant but
really stoked for next week I can't wait
but of course we have a we would love to
hear your feedback so hit us up feedback
a hak5 org or just leave a comment or
post in the forums over it forms that
hak5 org yes
go into the STR forums they're awesome
yes I need to go in there and play yeah
do that and while she does that we will
be right back
domain names are like islands of land
and the sea is where you're floating
without land and you have a killer idea
you're like I could really use some land
right now as opposed to floating around
at the sea and that's why you're going
to want to snag a domain name when you
have that killer ID and you you're going
to want it fairly quickly in fact there
are sharks out there mind you and
domain.com has this really quick
discovery system so you have your idea
you plug it into there and then you
easily check out with what you want the
next thing you know your websites up and
running in no time and you don't even
have soggy sneakers nobody wants soggy
sneakers they want domain.com
