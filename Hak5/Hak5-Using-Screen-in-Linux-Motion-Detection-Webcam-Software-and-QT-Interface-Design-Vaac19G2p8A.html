world of screen motion-detecting webcam
software and interface design using the
cube f ck all that more this time on
hack 5
this episode of pack five is brought to
you by domain.com got a great idea it
all starts with a great domain domain
calm Nakia and go to assist express
support smarter with go to assist
express hello and welcome to act 5 my
name is darren kitchen and this year
weekly dose of techno less than a book
hold and i'm sick and i just want to
stay in bed and there are your shoes on
my feet see yoshi am I done yet
I guess not we got a great show for you
guys this week
Shannon and Jason I hear totally helped
me because I could not run this show
solo today but but yeah that's that's
what's going on so Jason's doing some
more fun SDK stuff building some
application goodness with cute and
Shannon's checking out some nifty
software for Windows and I figured we'd
get in some UNIX stuff since like I
don't feel like leaving my bed right now
so let's talk UNIX yeah okay how about I
read you a story
that sounds like fun I read your story
alright okay mm-hmm now our story begins
as many do in a small town of blocks and
bits not too unlike Los Angeles or Miami
this paradise of plastic is home to the
obligatory UNIX geek area comes our
protagonist now hello mister minifig off
to work I see yes you get your briefcase
and a perma smile and something
resembling a smart car how convenient
now like many UNIX geek minifig here
loves to work in terminals so when he
arrives at the office well after getting
a cup of coffee of course he fires up an
SSH session to one of the various
servers he's been working on and
everything's going fine he's hacking
away and it's called Terminal 9000 when
suddenly his screen goes completely
blank it turns out someone figured that
they go ahead and try to cook a pizza by
placing it on the company satellite dish
and thus kicking off their internet
connection no matter the fire department
really doesn't have much else to do in
this
so you know the pizzas removed in
moments but what a little mini fig he
reconnects and he's greeted with a blank
bash prompt not the Emacs terminal that
he had like all of his work going on in
it's all lost could have been alleviated
too by using the command screen now
screen is essentially a terminal
multiplexer I think of it as like tabs
in Firefox but for UNIX shells you don't
need a graphical environment SSH will
work just fine
now if minifig were to have first run
the command screen after logging in
it would have been greeted by another
UNIX prompt and from there he could work
all day long and if you were
disconnected from the machine all they'd
have to do is when he reconnects is
ready activate that screen session and
all of his work would be there inside of
it now to list all of the running screen
sessions on a machine is type screen
attack LS and to reconnect to a screen
session that you've previously run you
type screen tak R and then the number of
the screen session now if there's only
one screen session running typically
just a single tak R will suffice now
this is great not only for just you know
connection troubles but situations where
you'd like to maintain sessions across
multiple devices like for example if
minifig were running a report on this
desktop at work then he could asks us
the same session from the SSH client in
a smart phone when he's like on the bus
and from there there are like three
other really important shortcuts that
you should probably be aware of that
will like blow minifigs little brick
brain and make them so much more elite
and productivity miss that's a word
first of all you hold down control and a
release them and press C and that will
create a new screen window if you will
so if you were doing like I don't know
just some stuff and you ran top and then
you're like oh yeah and then hit control
AC you'd be at a blank pump well top is
still running in a different window
you're now in a new tab so how do you
get back to the previous tab control a
let go and then hit P for previous and
control I let go and hit and for next
you can make control AC to
as many windows as you'd like and use
nmp to go back and forth between them
all and then all of those will stay in
sync between your laptop and your
desktop and your smartphone and wherever
you want to connect so you could be
total hero so whether you're working
from home or on the bus on the Wi-Fi in
the sky we could be saved by the little
command screen and then you kiss the
princess and she turned into a frog and
they live happily ever after that's
that's my that's my story for you guys
today
okay I'm gonna drink another bajillion
gallons of orange juice and eat some
more chicken noodle soup and then like
crawl like under these covers so I'll
see you guys next week we've got a
d-block that was previously recorded
with Shannon from back before I was sick
last week's trivia question was once
called Phoenix and Firebird this open
source web browser claims 23% of the
worldwide browsers market share and the
answer is Firefox if you want to win
some hack 5 swag this week go over to
hack $5 slash trivia and answer the
following question certified by the fair
trade foundation this soft-drink shares
its name with an african philosophy an
open-source operating system we'll be
right back after a brief word from our
sponsor as you know by now I am a huge
fan of go to assist Express as an IT
consultant that does a lot of remote
support it has been an invaluable tool
over the last 6 months of using it
exclusively and it's allowed me to work
smarter instead of harder it's reduced
my travel time and expenses and I
greatly love it for that now there are a
few features that have already talked
about about how it can easily reboot the
computer and stay connected or how you
can instantly transfer files get
connected very quickly with clients
there's one other that I thought was so
cool I had to tell you about the
unattended support sure it's real simple
to tell your client to go over to fast
support calm and enter in a nine-digit
key and get connected like that but if
they're at lunch and you need to install
a patch unattended support is where it's
at in just a few clicks you can set up a
computer so
you can connect to it without the person
needing to be there at the keyboard now
this has helped me a lot in situations
where you have a troublesome user who is
constantly calling you so rather than
walk them through that boom just pop on
and help them with whatever it may be
I've also used it in a situation where a
print server actually didn't have remote
desktop service went down and I was able
to connect to it using go to assist
Express and take care of that issue
awesome for that now there's another
really nifty thing about this is under
the tools menu here you can actually
install it to run as a service so when
the machinery starts before even needing
to log in you can get access to that
machine really killer features and this
is what go to assist Express is all
about they go that extra mile it's that
extra ten percent that really polishes
it for example I can connect two Mac
clients or if someone has multiple
monitors like I do I can easily switch
between those I'm not just limited to
screen sharing on the primary desktop I
highly encourage you guys to check out
go to assist Express it's fast it's easy
its 128-bit secure and you can try it
free for 30 days at go to assist comm
slash hak5 again for this special offer
you do need to use that URL go to assist
com /h ak5 there's one thing that's
always been really important for me and
that's my house in my safety and making
sure that you know none of my stuff gets
stolen I'm like super conscious about it
and I make sure to lock my door all the
time but you know stuff can happen and I
want to make sure that I know when I'm
away that nothing's happening to my
household luckily there's webcams that
are available and they're software
available that make it a lot easier for
people like me who like to travel a lot
to keep track of what's going on in our
house and actually see it like live and
this guy named Dennis one of our viewers
he emailed this software to us it's
called a yawl cam and you can download
it over at y'all cam comm right here
yell cam is written by Magnus Lundvall
and it stands for yet a number another
web cam software yeah
yet another web cam software I know it's
free but you can make a donation and
it's a
available only for Windows yeah I know
I'm sorry and it stands out because well
to me it has a whole bunch of really
cool features so all the features
include video streaming so you can you
know stream online to whoever you want
to it has image snapshots it has a
built-in web server and motion detection
which is really cool an FTP upload so
you can upload photos or images you know
anything you want online to whatever
site you want to it has text and image
overlays password protection for your
video streaming online announcements for
any kind of webcam communities that
you're a part of you can schedule for
your webcam to be online at certain
times on certain days and you can also
choose your language all right so I
wanted to show you a quick demo of how
it works so you can download this over
at ya'll cam comm and once you have it
downloaded you just open it up and you
get this nifty little main window and it
holds all this stuff and it all has
little you know stop signs next to them
and the stop signs mean that everything
is disabled right now so the first thing
on the list is file and that basically
just lets you save images onto a local
computer which would be for me this
computer the second thing is ftp uploads
for an ftp server so you can upload you
know all your photos to an FTP server
wherever you want HTTP can start a
stream of the webcam images the stream
lets you start a stream of video images
and then motion obviously is for motion
detection up here under your toolbar
first is file that has all the same
stuff and then you have images to movie
now images to movie I don't know if I
would ever use that but it basically
just converts images into a movie and
then you can choose this to upload
images into a video file that you can
play in QuickTime under the View tab you
can have access to view the control
panel tab or the console tab or you can
click on them right there you can always
have it on top or you can hide
everything at startup if you hide in an
startup that means that the window is
hitting that startup as well as the tray
icon
and then I could also hide now and then
I would have to go find it down here
under settings is where you can detect
your webcam and if it doesn't always
detect your webcam you can always go to
a device and then change to and choose
your webcam and then it'll change the
name of it right here in the parenthesis
also edit settings this is where all of
your settings take place this lets you
do everything from changing your
language camera your connections etc so
file output takes a photo and saves it
to a local computer at a given interval
so for example I can choose JPEG save it
right there and then I can choose the
image quality so I can choose that up
and down how many seconds to take and
then the image array wizard next is the
ftp output that uploads images to an ftp
of your choice at certain intervals
again so you choose it and then you put
in your username and the directory the
file name that you won't want it to be
called and how many seconds every time
under HTTP is the output that lets you
view images on a dedicated web page and
then stream lets you stream your video
online so under stream you have these
additional settings right here maximum
connections I'm going to change mine to
two you can do your data limit time
limit you can play a sound alert every
time of you are connects and then you
have your page designer so I'm going to
type in hak5 snubs and for the heading
I'll put welcome and it says that I need
to enable it for it to work so I hit yes
and you can preview it now I did set it
up earlier to have a password so I'll
put that in there you go now if you
don't want to use the page designer you
can also edit the HTML template files if
you want more functionality and then
this is cool
so under password you can choose for
your users that decide to view your
webcam you can choose what kind of
username and password that they have to
have whenever they go on to view your
webcam and the last but not least we
have this scheduler you have to enable
the scheduler at first
then you can choose what times you have
certain things start up at on certain
days so for this one I'm going to do the
file upload and I'm going to choose to
have pictures uploaded on Monday Tuesday
and Wednesday now I'll go ahead and
disable that and I also wanted to show
you motion detection which is really
cool so this little window over here
shows you what kind of motion detection
is going on and then if it ever triggers
the motion detector to take a picture
every 30 seconds or whatever limit you
have that it'll take a photo and then
tell you what percentage of the screen
was having a motion under actions you
can save a file to any certain path you
can upload photos to an FTP site an FTP
server you can run a dot exe play any
kind of sound that you want or you can
send yourself an email with the photo
attached okay so nifty software you can
hide it whenever you're not at home so
people can't see that it's detecting
their motion whoo you can make it take
pictures and email them to you when
you're away from home
you can choose to stream a video online
all of these I really like and I can I
can't do them right now with my webcam
at home cuz I didn't have the software
for it but I like y'all cam although I
know there's other software out there
that does the exact same same kind of
stuff so if you know about those send
them to me because I do want to find the
best one for myself especially when I'm
traveling abroad like I recently did to
Italy I didn't know what was going on at
home the entire time and I would have
loved to have this software back then so
email me what you think over at feedback
at HEC five org and we'll be right back
after a word from our sponsor hey buddy
why the long face my friends rain from
the evil darkness wait there's an evil
dark net I don't know what we're getting

private servers and hosting or even the
nude on me domain and enjoy domain coms
blistering fast DNS and hosting
infrastructure simply check out with
coupon code hak5 got a great idea it all
starts with a great domain domain com
want a chance to win a new phones how
about a quarter million dollars no key
and ATT have launched the ten million
dollars
calling all innovative North America
contest challenging mobile app
developers and game developers to create
the next level of apps for the Nokia n8
and Obi store using a new Nokia cute SDK
the contest will have two phases and
winners was selected by a performance
new movies store by a panel of judges
winners will receive Nokia devices cash
prizes up to $250,000 and potentially
even inclusion and a 1.9 million dollar
marketing campaign for their app so over
the next few weeks we're going to be
running down the ins and outs of the
Nokia cute SDK showing you how to get
started developing for Nokia Symbian
devices and this week we're gonna show
you how to get started with that SDK so
last week we covered the ins and outs of
the cute SDK and you know how to get it
set up how do you get going
and this week I thought I'd cover the
basic first kind of run application just
to get you started so that we can work
on our long-term project throughout this
series of the time-lapse camera so let's
dive right into this let's go ahead and
look at the UI file after you created
your new project from last week so in
the UI file it's pretty straightforward
we're in a drop the vertical layout into
this so that we can set the main layout
to grid so once it's integrated things
will snap and go expand the entire width
of the item so then we're gonna do is
we're going to add a vertical layout
first to be the spacer
allow room for the camera view later and
then what we're going to do is put uncle
spacer in it then what we're going to do
is put a horizontal layout right
underneath that put a spacer a button a
textview or shoot me a label another
button and then another spacer this will
allow it to take the entire width and be
able to fit and look nice just like this
so on our label I went ahead and filled
it with some just simple text you know
15 seconds and then set the text on the
buttons one plus one minus this will
allow us to set the duration in between
the pictures that are going to be taken
but like I said we're to cover all that
next week this week we're just going to
set up the basic UI here let's go ahead
dive straight into the code so in the
code we're going to open the main window
dot CA main window dot H we got to
declare some stuff first we're gonna
need to under private we're going to
need to declare seconds variable it will
just maintain how many seconds in
between the images captured then we're
going to need to give out an entire new
block we're in a new private slots these
are essentially slots for when the
signals come in it says hey you know
where do I go you don't have to tie them
together later it's it's basically
saying on click what do I call
so let's declare the slots the slots
being void because that's the return
type of this it's void Inc count and Dec
count so we're just incrementing and
decrementing accounts really
straightforward really simple then we're
gonna head into the main dot CPP first
thing we're going to need to do is
declare an initial value not really
necessary just good to do seconds equals
15 once you've done that go ahead and
down and set the text of the label in
order to access it it's UI
and then the point over to the label
because that's what label is well that's
what the label we call that's the
default name of the label inside the UI
file and then use the function set text
we're going to use cue string which
provides a whole bunch of string
manipulation libraries in this case it
converts an integer to a second and
then append it second to it that's going
to be the context for or content for our
label then what we're going to do is
connect the signals and slots back we're
going to connect the push-button one
which is the first push button the plus
on click go ahead and set where who what
it's going to be called this it's going
to be calling the main window and then
the slot it's gonna be eight count you
know push the plus gets larger then
we're gonna do the exact same thing for
the second button second button you know
is just on click deck then we're going
to define Inc
and deck so void main window you know
Inc count seconds plus plus so increment
the seconds by one and then set the text
exact same thing except we're
decrementing by one pretty easy nice and
simple so let's go ahead hit the big
green shiny green button here once you
click that it's gonna run it's really
straightforward really simple and there
you have it you can hit the plus you get
the minus works great next week we're
going to be covering more on this we're
gonna be covering more in depth we're
gonna be using the camera we're gonna
really be getting into this and
finishing this time-lapse application
time lapse camera application you know
for any more questions you guys have on
this head on over to the forms at Nokia
forms Nokia comm or any questions
specifically on this segment you know me
Jason and AK v dot org the Nokia q SDK
brings the popular cute creator IDE from
the desktop and embedded world to mobile
application developers and enabling them
