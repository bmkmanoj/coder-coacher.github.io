you by domain.com hello welcome to hack
5 my name is darren kitchen and I'm
Shannon Morse
you didn't change your shirt last week
did you no okay it's dirty and it smells
bad that's how you steward since last
week either quiet I just
we got perhaps back from DEFCON a week
and a half ago mm-hmm in recording time
and I just haven't had time to do my
laundry yet obviously clothesline yes
some fun hijinks from DEFCON that you
probably aren't aware of if you didn't
go is that they like to make the hotel
keys actually like DEFCON themed and one
of them was fantastic in it it was a
reminder to babe there was also another
one that was for sleep it said like four
plus hours nobody here got four hours of
sleep I wish we've got four seriously
before Sebastian in my talk like we were
up until 5:30 working on crazy it was
awesome
if we have a totally burned out version
of that actually we go to the Wi-Fi
pineapple forums you'll find the
embedded YouTube thing for the launch
their first night that we were there it
was the night that you guys were
studying until 5 a.m. I actually got
sleep I went to bed at like 11 o'clock
and then I woke up for the vendor area
like 8 a.m. it was amazing 9 hours
asleep that never happens at Def Con I
feel like I'm getting really old or
something you are you're you can tell
just by looking at your face it's it's
part of the this is a service we provide
here like five we've got a fantastic
show coming up and before I get my ass
kicked we're gonna just take a break and
when we get back we got Brent with PAD
with social engineering we got Jason or
some stuff and then there's airplanes
that can't be packed with filth whoa hey
Ron I know where you live
what yeah I don't make it on this side
this is horrible how can you do the show
like this alright we'll be right back
I'm here with Dustin Hoffman from
exigent systems and here's some pretty
interesting information about mesh
networks public mesh networks the ones
that are watching you on the roads it's
so it's kind of creepy to me because I'm
all about like let's not do any Big
Brother best thing I don't like being
survey all the time either yeah it's not
cool but I understand that when you're
in public it can happen especially if a
city is trying to keep itself safe right
potentially I mean I think we've already
given up our right to be what privacy in
public okay I'm pretty sure someone's
already decided that I'm not a lawyer so
your talk that you gave what was it
yesterday it's Friday Friday so that was
all about some vulnerabilities that you
were able to find in the loose mesh
networks so tell me a little bit about
the city that you are in and how you
figured this out sure so the city we
operate out of is a small municipality
it's about 70,000 people so it's not a
big city by any means since the
mid-2000s like a lot of other cities
they faced a shrinking budget right for
police and on municipal services I've
seen that happen sure right so they've
been deploying many many committee meat
cameras all over the city all over the
city it makes sense because they won't
have to suppose it it could make sense
with a shrinking police force so beyond
that in certain places we noticed a
camera pods and directional antennas
going up and then in certain other
places you would actually see on you
know your iPhone or your Android device
you'd see hey open open wireless network
available like
than just coffee shop more than coffee
shop Starbucks a lot and you would see
things like police department your
city's police department open and
unsecured unencrypted in broadcasting
seriously seriously
so being a curious sort that we were and
looking around and you can see the
equipment from the ground so we took
some pictures and we went on eBay and
bought some similar equipment set up a
lab for ourselves I mean it's common
off-the-shelf parts actually really
really great technology great great I
really like the equipment they chose
I've been a eBay and equipment they
chose so in in in setting it up in the
default manner we encountered a bunch of
a bunch of vulnerabilities some of which
are that could be concerning ought to be
concerning I think especially as
taxpayers people we came for this and
you know I don't blame the city I don't
blame the the technology itself I think
was just a failure my human failure like
a lot of IT projects that go awry right
do they not I t's hard yeah I think of
Obamacare where a government contract
was awarded a product was delivered was
it a great product I probably laugh or
the website I would think a lot of
people would say no we didn't get a
great part we didn't get a great product
so some of the things we discovered were
I mean obviously like all wireless
networks it's vulnerable to jamming and
everything perhaps the two most
concerning were that you could easily
become a malicious node on the network
and masquerade as as a trusted node all
the nodes trust each other so you could
join in and through various messages
sent you could have all all the all the
Misha's traffic routed through your
malicious node presumably you could
eavesdrop on all the traffic that's
scary that's gonna scary
I mean that's gonna wear the name of the
talk came from what the Watchers see
yeah conceivably you could see what all
the other cameras could see which we're
not probably intended for public
consumption
probably not and worse you could craft
specific packet streams that you could
actually inject your own video into the
videos
so like I'm sitting there watching the
safe out of police place I always think
oh Sh ins 11 yeah right no I'm looking
at the vault and everything nobody is it
no one's in there and in the meantime
some of these stealing and there's
someone in there right yeah that's very
scary so gonna be able to fix this well
the thing is is all the equipment
selected offers really great its I
really like it after buying it and
playing with it off eBay I would use it
for our own projects yeah well they
could they could encrypt it that would
be a nice strong encryption with the
exits right the products actually
support each node but actually through
PK I would actually authenticate
themselves you could actually go this is
a this is a note I should trust versus
this is a note that I can't authenticate
yeah there's probably some people here
who could do it did you run into any
problems with the city when you were
doing all these different tests did they
come to you and be like oh you can't
talk about this no no no being aware and
how sensitive things like this are you
know we talked about it and really we
limited ourselves strictly to to what
we'd what we could do in the lab you
know it's just like you see the guys
here doing work on cell phones buzzing
other GSM things yeah strictly doing it
in a lab environment you don't want to
disrupt public services you don't want
to do that so I want to get a little bit
of an opinion piece from you okay I'm
saying you know we have some hackers
down
Francisco where I live and they find
similar issues in their City how can
they go to this
and explain this without getting in
trouble well that was that that's a
thing right we looked around for like a
hey if you find a security flaw within
our products like Google or other other
tech companies have there's a there's a
published means for contacting them who
didn't see anything like that honestly I
think a safe bet for anyone in the
community is to probably talk to the ffs
or the experts operating in this area
excellent well thank you so much is
there anything else that you want to
mention to our audience about these
issues with open mesh networks you know
I would say it's probably a failure of
the government contracting process it's
just it's just a blindside there in the
end all security problems are really
people problems they're not gonna be
solved for more technology they're gonna
be solved maybe through the community
yeah being able to participate in our do
a post install QA maybe we could look to
we could have an uninterested party
examine things after install our cities
ought to get reasonably secure products
from the vendors I absolutely agree
thank you so much for chatting with us
is there a place online where people can
find more information about what you do
know we don't really tweet or anything
you know we have other day jobs exigent
comm awesome thank you so much thanks
enjoy the rest of you definitely she ate
it Brett welcome to the hacker abduction
van at DEFCON Thank You Def Con VIN man
that's been pretty good you know busy as
usual yeah I had a packed talk at the
social engineering village yeah it was
great we actually when I heard how to
still had a line outside maximum
capacity at people sitting in the floor
right in front of us sitting in the
aisles everything so it was it was great
so what's the name of the talk it was
corporate espionage gathering actionable
intelligence via covert operations that
just sounds all sorts of like yeah
spying
yeah totally he's got a very ominous
military vibe to it yeah what kind of
what kind
well does social engineering have in a
modern ped test oh it's it's I think
well because I am a social engineer it's
a huge part if you have a target you
know they're they're pretty secure
obviously their network is secure people
are usually obviously the weakest link
in the system so if you're able to sort
of manipulate them enough to get into to
get Hardware access without them knowing
that's sort of what the point of the
talk was about yeah would you believe me
we've always said that as soon as you
have physical access all bets are off
yeah absolutely all you need is just a
few minutes to you know to plug into USB
or you know it run any sort of payload
or just all sorts of things that you can
do within a matter of minutes with
physical access so what are some of your
techniques for gaining physical access
you know well besides social engineering
you know obviously you want to do your
open source intelligence gathering
before so you can understand the target
you want to be familiar enough based on
what industry they're in you want to
know that industry so you can you know
have shop talk with whoever you might
encounter throughout the buzzword yeah
that way you want to be convincing that
you want people to trust you you got to
be able to build trust and once you've
got a convincing story you know most
people want to help you out by nature so
once you sort of exploit them that way
what do you mean by that most people
want to help you out by nature well what
I found out in my experience and then
too through other research from others
people naturally you know are good
hearted so like say for example you're
trying to get into a door that you
clearly don't have access to but you
have a fake badge you go to the door
with a box that's heavy just you know
the box is really full just you're
stressed out you're trying to get into a
room go to the door it's shut you were
trying to piggyback it didn't work just
set that up and so the door shuts in
front of you you're trying to get it
with a leg someone's gonna see you hey
that guy is struggling he's got a heavy
box you need some help I'm gonna help
him out
regardless of the security awareness
training that's been given you have that
intuition of hey someone's in trouble
I'm gonna do something about this
interesting because in that scenario
then that person who may not be an
InfoSec person may not be you know on
the IT department never have any idea of
you know kind of the dangers of this
doesn't may not want to then become like
the police
absolutely the company and there's even
cases to where let's say someone is you
know they actually do remember their
security awareness training and whatever
role you're doing you do set off an
intuition alarm and they ask well who
are you let me see your badge and they
actually get suspicious there are
several ways to counteract that where
you can still maintain your guys for you
know your engagement without giving up
the operation if you call it that and a
simple way of doing that is hey I'm in a
hurry I don't know who you are but I
have a meeting with so-and-so I've got
to get there right now you've got to let
me just make it very uncomfortable you
just you know you you bring that comfort
level where it's just something someone
doesn't want to be around and they're
gonna say oh it's their problem now and
now it's their problem and hey this is
weird I don't know this guy I'm
uncomfortable I'm gonna help him out
just so the problem can be over and
that's and that's a pretty common thing
so so what are some of the other
techniques that you found to be
successful well some of the things that
we use you know we we talked about the
Wi-Fi pineapple quite a bit that's great
for a drop device in a Dropbox also for
gathering information at if you're not
inside of the target you know just being
around the target using that even as an
external drop to gather those you know
Wi-Fi or the luggage place across the
street from the joint exactly if you're
able to get roof access dropped on the
roof just there's so many things you can
do and then as I mentioned earlier as
long as you have just a minute for
physical access you know run a payload
with the rubber ducky
so getting physical access what is it
what has been successful for you most of
the time it's just trying to be charming
you know getting your story straight and
being convincing we've had people
actually vouch for us that worked in the
company just because we built a rapport
with them hey I'm new I'm supposed to
meet so-and-so today and they say well
his office is in the other building but
you probably need to get into this room
first for the rest of your paperwork
that room happened this is actual some
of something that happened and we
actually mentioned this in our talk the
room was part of the server room they
actually had armed guards and everything
in the facility and a co-worker was able
to get them to vouch the lady to vouch
back to the guard hey he's new he
probably doesn't have access yet can you
try it he scans this fake badge of
course it doesn't work here let me it
wouldn't let you in the armed guard then
export you know escorts him into the
thing the the guy that was aware of the
test going on his office was in there so
the co-worker was actually able to walk
up to his desk and lay his business card
essentially saying you know hey we got
you so and that's all just from the
trust building a rapport and just
knowing people targets yeah it's not
solutely security it's nothing door
alarms it's not the security cameras no
yeah you could you know a lot of people
who have ways of bypassing those things
and that's sort of a last resort but
there are so many ways that you don't
even have to actually touch the the
technical side of things because of you
know people will do it for you basically
so yeah cool drop them Oh days on people
yeah exactly
all the time can people follow you on
twitter at brent w design is the twitter
handle
awesome pitch down go and check out yeah
I really appreciate it right yeah and
also wanna mention I on the co-worker
Tim Roberts who gave the talk with me
you can find him it's zanshin hats and
h4x is how you spell hacks so of course
make sure to follow him great great guy
I'd only appreciate what you're doing
thank you good deal thanks Aaron

chance to win some awesome PAC 5 goodies
there's a lot of information out there
about hackers but what is right and what
is wrong and how people feel about
hackers well everyone feels a little bit
different and it kind of depends on
needs or - so I'm talking to Jason E
Street from stratagem 1 solutions Jason
thank you so much for joining me you're
giving a talk on Sunday about right it's
a really weird talk this is one of the
weirdest ones I've ever done I started
off about to the 2012 it's like I was
actually the next time with dark tangent
except you know it was far more like how
the hacking cultures are different
around the worlds like how it like in
Kuala Lumpur they've got a really good
makerspace and then like in Germany
they're very big on privacy ride and
cryptography Brazilians are like
Carter's and bankers activities and like
America's got a whole conglomeration
available to everything and so it just
shows that there's different variations
and it's and I was thinking that would
be a great talk to explain to people hey
this is what it's like somewhere else
and so that was what my talk was
supposed to be about and that's what I
wanted it to be about I really did and
then I started doing the research and
then I started sending out
questionnaires to hackers all over the
world tell me about your culture don't
just get it from my perception do it
from your perception what you perceive
it to be
because because in the whole thing it's
basically I talk about perception and so
they started sending these in and I
started reading them and I was like
there was one underlying theme and it
was that hackers or criminals we're not
I know and that's it you know it I mean
I'm serving a villa it enraged me it's
like a nice still getting that thing
about it cuz it's like we are not
criminals we come from Tesla from the
Vinci from Turing we are creators we are
artists we are inventors we are the ones
that go and say we're told that it's
supposed to go from here to here to here
what after we do this wide if we look at
it and look at the world differently
that's what we are and it's like and to
see something that I love it's something
that I'm a part of just be maligned like
that I was just so upsetting so I
started changing the talk I started
doing the research and on this and why
this is like this and it just and yes
and that's what I went into my talk the
McDonald's lady the hot coffee lady
she's limits four to twenty nine million
dollars yes they said that she was
driving and she spilled her coffee and
their Jay Leno make jokes about her
there was comic strips meetings whenever
she's a sweet blue old lady who burned
15% of her body third-degree burns
required skin grafts to fix it
McDonald's was serving the coffee at a
hundred and eighty to one hundred and
ninety degrees so it would stay warm
during the transit there's also and I
got a picture my slide of all these
people highlighted in pink over fifty of
them that were admitted to the emergency
room for the same thing for scalding
because of the coffee and I tell people
it's like it's like I have seen the
McDonald's coffee lady and she is us
it's like because I was a hypocrite I
made fun of her I thought that was
hilarious because I didn't bother to
find out what the truth was
and and that media is telling people
hackers or criminals hackers the ones
that are getting in and stealing your
credit cards and taking down your planes
and doing cyber pearl harbors going
through your tubes
if we don't stop and change that voice
it's not the the populace is fault if
that's what they believe because that's
what they're being told it's it's like
mind washing exactly it's like it's
propaganda anything so in that we've got
people Dave Kennedy Evan fort booth evan
booth tree fort
1c Dan Kaminsky Brian Krebs as a
reporter and stuff you know it's like
your show it's like we're getting that
message out there it's getting better
and that's the part that I talk about I
talk about what we've done wrong what's
gone wrong in the media and then I talk
about what there's always I never end on
just the negative is there's always got
to be something positive well how can we
make it better how can we make people
think that hackers are the good guys
we're trying to help you
we're not trying to scare you by talking
it's like by going to the InfraGard
meetings that it's the meetings the
local meetings and not just talking
within our community because that's just
the echo chamber when heartbleed came
out when there's a thing about open SSL
when people are talking about android
hacking go and contact your local press
go and tell your local TV station hey
I'm familiar with this topic I'm willing
to talk to you everybody thinks is like
well I can't talk to the press
I'm not Dan Kaminsky I'm not dead candy
it doesn't matter they're looking for
factual information don't go in there if
you don't know what you're talking about
stuff you know but go in there if it's
something that you're familiar with if
you were able to say hey I can talk on
that then do it stop just looking and
screaming at the TV angry and stuff you
know like they got that wrong that's so
stupid
change it call them up and say I know
what this is let me inform you and tell
you what it is and let them know that
you're a hacker trying to do it is there
any other way that people can help out
Icom I think basically just getting
together and starting to spread the
voice Josh Corman has got something
called I am the Calvary where he's
trying to get more people involved in it
exactly and I think the way I look at it
is they don't mean just chrome have been
like little antique because like I'm not
waiting for the Calvary it's like I
think everybody should be that roaming
night and stuff you know the Danka who
do that tips of the windows cuz I'm
gonna still be that dong Cody I think it
can get better
I believe this community I believe and I
have seen the awesomeness that is our
community and I'm going to keep fighting
that and I'm gonna keep showing that and
I'm gonna keep taking that out there
thank you thank you so much it's so good
to see somebody else out there who is as
passionate about this as I am there's so
many that are in there yeah and being
part of a hacker is having that passion
is that you have to have that passion to
keep battling your head saying this
isn't working
okay nine hundred times this isn't
working and like Thomas Edison said oh
you know you was a jerk it's like he
actually said it's like he tried
thousands of ways to make the filament
work for the light bulb until he got it
right so so I mean that's what happens
he said I don't start at Tesla Edison
Gordon here but but exactly but but yeah
it's like that's what happens is that
you've got to have that passion to keep
knocking at something until it works
alright thank you so much no problem
where can we find information about you
and
you can go to Dyson it's in the hack
comm it's a actually online community
for people that are getting interested
in information security if you don't
have a place to write your blog if you
don't have a place to actually get
involved it's like it's a community that
doesn't allow flames it's just for
people to provide information and get
out there also oh that's all I'm on it's
like it's like I like tweet my life
so at jys o NS TR ET on Twitter and I
try to respond to every single person
that replies to me stuff you know and
it's just get out there and it's not
just about me so just get out there and
be part of the community and stuff
you'll go to these kind of conferences
go to these situations it's an awesome
blast but I'm a speaker here right so
it's like I'm supposed to be speaking to
the audience I'm learning from the
audience it's up you know I am meeting
people in the hallway and talking and
learning something new and that's what
it is it's not about just giving to
accept another it's getting something
back from it and you I get so much from
this community and stuff you know and I
don't give enough back from what I've
been receiving I think you give a lot
back and thank you so much for being on
that fight today thanks for having me oh
my god
awkward handshake there we go I got the
super super exciting chance to talk to
you dr. Phil Cole strut Bloomsburg
University
you got some fun airplane stuff going on
huh so I'm a little scared because I
think that I might die on my way home to
San Francisco am I gonna die well it's
pretty short flight probably okay but
whole hour and a half the short answer
is no but I'm flying with like all my
hacker friends and are they gonna be
able to like you know hack the plane and
through the gogo in-flight sand and just
take it down and turn off all the lights
and make all the oxygen medics come out
again the short answer would be no and
the slightly longer answer
is that if you look at how that
in-flight system is connected or not
connected to ever the other interesting
things in the plane it's really not
possible to go from that in-flight
network over to the a beyond its network
occasion even if it were possible you
still have some challenges because
anything that came in like let's say a
new flight plan or something like that
has to be validated by the pilots and
entered into the flight computers and
executed by the closets interesting ok
so let's go down this path of all the
systems that are in an airplane and why
this is not going to work for me when
can I take sample plane all right well
you can't take down a plane using the
in-flight Wi-Fi because of what we just
said yeah because it's not really
connected plus there are tests and some
other things that people have talked
about in the past we've talked about a
DSB yeah IDs be hawking various raki is
something you can really do you can send
out bogus ADSP messages it's unsecured
that's you know a totally legit thing to
do you can buy boards probably here at
Def Con yep and things like that and the
only issue is that you send those
messages out and those messages are not
directly used by any aircraft really so
are they just sent to the traffic
control they're sent to air traffic
control now air traffic control has a
service called T's be try
traffic information service be that
small aircraft use where they will get
information on traffic in their area but
that information comes from ATC now ATC
if they receive a bogus transmission
that doesn't have a corresponding radar
blip will likely just ignore that okay
so they're gonna recognize it as being
fake
yes okay so it's not gonna appear on
your screen and when it comes to the big
guys they have what's called a t caste
system a traffic collision avoidance is
don't owe and it doesn't use that system
at all it actually uses the old-school
transponders and so what it does is
those systems will send out active
interrogations
of other transponders in the area and
then based on where those signals come
back from they have an antenna array so
they can see distance directions set etc
they will have a display that shows
other airplanes so those fake messages
will just go completely by you they just
pass through nobody's even gonna pay
attention to him so basically the entire
time that a pilot is working with air
traffic control and everything they have
humans behind everything verifying that
what the technology is telling them is
actually in legit that's correct
okay so what about what other technology
is in an airplane that I can't hack into
there's been a lot of talk about SATCOM
satellite communications recently a
couple days ago there is a talk here in
Las Vegas about hacking vulnerable comm
systems it's scary it's a little scary
and it's certainly true that you could
send out bogus information again you
could send things like a bogus flight
plan you can get hey why don't you you
know we had a nice little video in our
talking we did
here at Def Con where there was a
message that comes out says emergency
reroute to Cuba and so any of those
kinds of messages reroutes etc are going
to get validated by the pilots and how
do they validate it they will call their
airline ok call them on his radio and
they will validate anything especially
suspicious yeah and then once that's
been validated they have to input that
information into the flight computer and
depending on the airplane sometimes
manually sometimes they can
automatically move it but in all cases
they have to authorize it and execute it
so there are a lot of checks and
balances there so you can't just send a
bogus flight plan and have a plane just
why of course so why do you feel like
people have been so paranoid about this
recently
you know I think every time there's a
major tragedy like the Malaysian flight
370 and of course more recent shooting
down the plane which it's not just
hacking but is horrible you know in
general you know aviation accidents are
rare so when they do happen you know
there's a lot of attention there's a lot
of people get scared but you know if you
look at the safety of flying because
flying is just so safe you're getting
bitten by a shark you know I don't know
about you but a lot of times people are
like oh you're flying somewhere call me
come with you get there but if I drove
there I'd be much more likely to die
yeah that's very very truth well thank
you so much what is there is there
anything else of importance in your talk
that you would like to mention to our
audience as far as airplanes and your
security I would say that there's no
need to be afraid you know there's a lot
of fear-mongering
out there and a lot of people going oh
well be afraid be afraid and I would say
today I don't think there's reason to be
afraid I do think that we need to be
mindful as we go toward more and more
automation going forward and certainly
we need to consider these kinds of
issues you know some people have said we
should have a switch in the cockpit that
you can say okay hijackers I can't
control this plane anymore it's remotely
controlled which in my mind would be the
worst possible thing yeah this is a day
you cannot remotely hack into a plane
and that's exactly what that would allow
no no who are making these plans
hopefully no one may call you dr. Phil
you may call me doctor where can people
find you online doctor soon they can
find me on Twitter at people sprout just
pee pee oh well Stra they can also find
me at Phil Paul's 4.com
that's probably the best place and here
you have a book coming out I do have a
book coming out should be out really
soon it's all about building your own
hacking hardware on the cheap it's
called packing and penetration testing
with low-power devices should be out
here very soon and syngress
congratulations thank you so much again
to you for speaking with me about
airplanes and how we can stop worrying
about everything involving those I hope
you enjoyed the race to go deaf on
YouTube that just about wraps up this
week's episode of hack 5 before we get
going I am excited to make a little tiny
announcement what and that is if you are
in Vienna in November
