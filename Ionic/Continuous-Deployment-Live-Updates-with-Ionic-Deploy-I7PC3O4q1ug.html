team and today I wanted to talk with you
about continuous deployment and live app
updates using our ion ik - ploy service
I'm Matt I am the product manager on the
ionic pro team and today I'm gonna be
walking you through not only the setup
of our Cordova plugin for deploy but
also a full setup using our new deploy
API now ionic deploy gives you the
capability to push hot code updates
right to your apps users bypassing the
app stores this allows you to fix bugs
on the fly or launch new features
without any sort of delay it all happens
on your time now before we dive in I
wanted to talk a little bit about the
traditional software development
lifecycle that you use for any software
development not just mobile first off
you're developing a new feature or
you're fixing a bug that you want to get
out into the public
then you're testing it with customers
maybe you're using something like ionic
view then you're deploying that into
production you're getting it lime for
you're getting it into your users hands
and after that you're monitoring for
errors now this you know looks like a
rather simple software development
lifecycle the problem comes when you're
trying to use this in a quick manner and
you're developing for mobile right not
only does generating native binaries
kind of a time consuming process you've
got to launch it on Android you have to
launch it on iOS you have to make sure
all your certs are up to date but on top
of that especially on iOS you need
approval from the App Store's and that
takes time right it could be a matter of
days for your app or you're just an app
update to get approval from the App
Store that means that these bugs can
actually sit in production for extended
periods of time
your new features can go a longer
duration of time without getting into
users hands and really that's just not
the most ideal scenario now ionic apps
actually have multiple layers here
they're kind of like onions right on the
red layer here you can see that Cordova
plugins native dependencies or native
settings like whether or not somebody
can use your app in landscape mode and
all native level permissions like
whether or not your app is talking to
the camera all of that is updated
through the normal app store process
right you have to go through apple's
approval
in order to change any native layer of
code however 99% of your code exists in
kind of this non native layer that
includes angular ionic HTML CSS
JavaScript images icons any assets
basically 99% of your app you're allowed
to update on the fly per Apple and
androids Terms of Service ionic deploy
is a service that allows you to update
that entire top layer on the fly it's
even send different versions of your app
to different users so today I wanted to
walk you through a demo on how to use
ionic deploy we're gonna set up a new
project with deploy then we're gonna
send some live updates directly to your
users instantly with the Cordova plugin
no code required and then after that
with some custom code we're actually
going to allow our users to opt into a
special beta Channel that gives them
access to only things they might find
that you want to get out to early access
users so we're gonna go through some
simple setup steps and I'm gonna walk
through all of this live so you guys get
to see it but let's just go over it
really quickly first we're going to
install the ionic Cordova plugin that's
what actually allows you to perform
these updates we're gonna hook that up
to a production Channel then we're gonna
put the app on our phones through Xcode
and then after that we're gonna push up
some new code to pro and reload our
phone using deploy using that new code
that we wrote then we're gonna set up
the pro Client SDK that's what gives us
access to the deploy API and we're gonna
program a custom beta toggle with our
update logic that can check for an
update right when the user clicks the
toggle then we're gonna show off some
updates and allow people to switch
between production and beta and show you
guys kind of how that works so without
further ado let's dive into the demo so
I actually already have an entire app
set up locally I've already gone through
ionic start I didn't want to make you
guys sit through that but I haven't
really done any other setup I haven't
even added this app to pro so the first
thing I want to do is add this app to
pro here we're going to call it deploy
video we're going to create a new app
we're just at dashboard Yanik jess comm
just our standard ionic pro dashboard
here so we're going to create that new
app and then we're going to follow along
with the simple setup instructions
now I'm already on the latest version of
the ioniq lie so I'm not going to run
that and I have already created an app
locally so I'm going to choose to
connect an existing app using ionic link
so let's copy that real quick go to our
command line terminal you can see I'm in
this deploy video app that I've been
working on and we're gonna run ionic
link this is going to set up the git
remotes so that I can push code up to
pro I'm not gonna go in deep on kind of
everything that's happening here if you
want to check that out I've got other
videos over on the pro documentation to
show you this getting started process
alright so we are all linked and ready
to go as you can see we've added the
remote ionic now there is already going
to be some code here so let's push that
up to pro let's do get status we can see
a couple files were changed when I ran
that antic link so let's add those let's
commit initial commit here and you get
push ionic master that's gonna send the
code up to a annika pro and it's gonna
allow us to see our codebase channels as
well so let's refresh the dashboard now
for any build that you sent up to pro
you could click on the little commit
hash here and you could see that build
in progress so it's already picked up
our build it's already working on
running it it's going to do a full build
of our code in the cloud you can also
see all of our channels are listed here
we've got master and we've got
production master is automatically going
to update any time you do get push ionic
master that is configurable if you click
on one of these channels and go to
settings you can change that today we're
going to be hooking up some code to
production as well as a new beta Channel
so let's go ahead right now just while
we're here and create a beta channel
that we're going to use later and then
let's start to actually set up the ionic
deploy native plugin so they're going to
start pulling in these updates right
this we set up on a channel so today
we're going to choose production I'm
going to choose set up deploy here and
it's gonna give us a few different
options that we can choose from here on
how deploy is going to act
these options are deploy updates in the
background so as your user is playing
with your app it's going to be
downloading those updates and the next
time they load your app will apply that
update for you automatically
second option is to download updates in
the splash screen and install them
immediately that kind of prevents your
user from
and forth unless they have the latest
version of your app and then the third
version is don't do either of those
things but perform everything in the
JavaScript layer it's customizable by
you guys I don't necessarily advise that
you pick that you should pick one of
these top two
you can still program JavaScript layer
API updates and you know do fancy stuff
like check for updates on login and
apply them on logout even if you're
using one of the two native layer
updates here these just protect you so
if you push like a white screen of death
to your users but you've chosen one of
these you can still update that on the
fly even if your custom JavaScript isn't
loading today I'm gonna choose to
download updates in the splash screen
and install them immediately and it's
gonna give me the piece of code I need
to run to install that Cordova plugin if
you guys want a little bit more detail
here and you know what's going on what
this Cordova plugin is doing you can go
over to ionic framework comm slash doc
slash pro click on deploy click on
installation and it will show you kind
of a little bit more in depth what these
different options are on this plugin the
different methods of applying updates
we've got full paragraphs here and kind
of how each of these update modes works
and then a little bit of usage and we'll
go through some of that today as well so
I'm going to copy this Cordova plug-in
code here over to my command line but
I'm going to want to add two different
flags I just want to show you that these
flags exist here so if we go back to our
documentation one of the flags is Maxtor
that's available by default Macs store
is set to two that's just how many
versions of code we're going to keep on
the device that you've sent to your
users as like a history right so if you
needed to rollback those would be
immediately available on the user's
device as opposed to redownload them I'm
going to go ahead and set the max Store
to zero just for the purposes of this
demo so it's going to read download code
every time that it is needed here the
other kind of optional flag is something
related to debug mode so if you don't do
this it's gonna ask you to apply updates
if you've got a binary running in debug
mode I'm gonna go ahead and turn that
off
just so we can stay in debug mode today
but I can still show you kind of how
deploy works so I am also going to add
variable warned
underscore debug equals false and we're
gonna hit enter and let that Cordova
plug-in install yet again this Cordova
plug-in is what actually allows the
updates to be performed on the device
it's what's checking in with our servers
to get new versions of code and apply
them locally so we're just gonna sit and
wait for this to install and we'll be
right back awesome so it looks like our
plug-in installed fairly quickly now
what I'm gonna want to do is I'm gonna
want to do a full build of this code and
we're gonna get the app on to my phone
so that we can start working with the
actual update system so let's do ionic
Cordova build iOS that's going to give
us a full Xcode project this might take
a second while you're working on this
but this will give us a full Xcode
project that we're going to them sign
and put on my device so that we can
start playing with this today awesome
now that we've got that archived I know
we said it failed that's just because I
haven't set up the code signing for this
project yet so what we're going to do is
open up Xcode here and I am going to
open another project and I'll show you
guys where this is located here if you
go back and just find your actual app
here so I'm in the webinar folder for
the deploy video here you can see we've
got a platform's directory iOS and in
here there's a workspace file we're
gonna want to open that workspace file
in Xcode and this is what's going to
allow us to sign the app and put it on
my phone so that we can play with it
today
so we're gonna click over here on our
main projects here that's gonna bring up
the project editor it's angry that it
requires the development team I'm going
to choose my work development team and
just let it automatically sign that for
me and as you can see here we've got our
deploy video project and I want to put
it on my phone so lex's go ahead and
click Play here and this is going to go
ahead and put the app on my phone so we
can watch my phone it's connected to my
computer right now as it's putting this
on here and we're gonna see that app
come up on my phone with that Cordova
plugin installed that we we did just a
moment ago alright so we went ahead and
that app has indeed installed on our
phones here and it's
be running the version of the code that
was just right off my system right we
haven't actually deployed any updates
yet to this version of code so as you
can see it's just the default tabs app
so let's go ahead and let's actually
make a modification this could be you
know a new feature it could be a fix of
a bug today I'm just going to change the
text that's kind of shown up here and
we're going to deploy that to production
and see the update happened live on the
device so let's switch over to our code
here and we are going to see right now
I've just got a few files already open
our app dimaggio that's yes we're gonna
be working with later our home dot HTML
and home dot typescript so let's go
ahead and kind of remove these
paragraphs and just say you know new
production code and we are gonna save
that change and we are going to push it
up to an expresso I'm gonna do get
status we're gonna add all of those
changes commit them new production text
get push ionic master and that is gonna
go up to ionic pro and it's gonna build
so let's go back to our dashboard here
go over to builds you can see there's
our new production test and we're gonna
wait for this build to finish and then
we'll put it on our phones alright so
this build has indeed finished we're
gonna go back to the builds tab and now
you can see we've got that nice deploy
and package as well so let's click
deploy on our new production test we're
gonna choose that production channel hit
deploy and then you'll see this little
tag shows up that's how you know this
version of code is active on production
now so if I go back to my phone here we
are going to kill this app really quick
because I chose the splash screen update
method and then when I open this app
it's gonna check for an update from us
in the splash screen and it's going to
apply that update immediately so let's
try that
awesome so went to our servers
downloaded the new version of code and
showed us that new production code so if
you don't need to customize kind of how
the updates happen or anything like that
at this point you've got fully working
ionic deploy inside your app pulling
from this production channel now we're
going to take time now to actually
customize how this works using the
deploy API and pull from an optional
beta channel so we are going to actually
code this and to do that we are going to
start by setting up the pro client SDK
so if you go over here kind of in our
documentation to the deploy API section
you'll see we've got two prerequisites
right we've already installed the ionic
Cordova plugin we just need to also set
up the pro client that gives us access
to the API and you want to make sure
that's at least on 1.0 point nineteen if
you've already got it installed but I'm
gonna show you the full install process
today so let's click pro client setup
guide here and let's walk through this
really quick so the first thing it wants
us to do is install the latest version
of ionic app scripts and the ionic Pro
client SDK so I'm gonna copy that we're
gonna go back over here to my command
line and we're gonna install these two
dependencies so let's go ahead and wait
for this to finish really quick
all right so app scripts and the ionic
Pro Client SDK are now both installed in
my project but we're not done yet we
need to do a little bit of setup and
this differs depending on whether or not
you're on ik 2 or 3 or an ik one I'm
using ionic 3 today so we're gonna make
some modifications to our app module
that TS file ok so here is kind of the
new code that we want to import I'm
gonna copy this top section and we'll
manually modify this ng module section
in just a minute here so I'm gonna copy
this
we're gonna go to our code go to app
module a TS and between our imports and
our ng model is where I'm gonna put this
code now you'll notice there are a few
kind of syntax errors and that's because
I've already imported both error handler
and ionic error handler so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just going to remove
those imports and we're gonna leave the
injectable and injector here for angular
core that's the most common way to set
this up next thing you're going to want
to do is replace the information in
protein it that needs your app ID and
your app version your app ID is really
easy to find if we go back to our anak
dashboard you can see here I'm an ACME
code employee video this is the ID right
next to that so we're going to put our
ID and proton in it and then the app
version is something you're going to
want to
keep up to date with kind of any native
versioning that you're using like in
config.xml so if I pull up config.xml
you can see right now I'm out in zero
point zero point one this is what allows
ionic monitoring to keep your kind of
source maps in sync I'm not going to go
through a full monitoring demonstration
today but you're going to want to keep
that up to date if you're using the
monitoring service so there we go we've
got that set up we've got our injectable
now we need to go back and make that
final modification from the
documentation here where we provide the
ionic air handler as and our my custom
error handler here into ng module so
let's copy that real quick let's replace
this bottom line here with that code
let's click Save and we should be good
to go so this is how you set up the pro
client now it's accessible in all other
areas of your project so today I want to
add a new feature in my app right I want
to add the ability to toggle between the
production and the beta channels and
allow my user to kind of pick that I'm
gonna use the home page here as kind of
a settings page so let's go ahead and
change this here to settings and then
we're gonna add a little bit of code
here to give ourselves a form that
allows users to do that so let's add a
paragraph first that says I'm connected
to thee and then we're gonna use a
variable deploy channel channel so
that'll pull in whatever channel the
user is currently connected to just to
show that in the UI then we're gonna
also want some download progress for any
of our updates so let's do download
progress download progress and this is
out of 100 just so we can show that on
the screen as well and then we're gonna
want that toggle that allows people to
switch so let's use an eye on item for
that and there we're gonna want an eye
on label we're gonna call this opt-in to
beta features and then under this we are
going to want an eye on toggle we're
going to give that a model so that we
can check the setting in our code here
so we're going to just call that is beta
and then we're also going to want to on
the eye on change event here calls call
the toggle beta function so that we can
actually
change the channel we're checking into
in our code right so overall this is all
the work I'm gonna do in the template
now we're gonna move over to the home
dot type script file and start to
actually program the ability for this
thing to work first thing I'm going to
want to do is at the top of my file
we're going to do an import pro from at
anionic slash pro it's going to give us
access to that full pro client then
we're going to want to set up those
variables that we're going to use so
deploy channel is equal to nothing right
now we're gonna do is beta is equal to
false and we're going to do download
progress is equal to zero okay now the
next thing I'm going to want to do is
I'm gonna write a function that checks
the channel in the deploy plugin and see
it gets more information about it so I'm
gonna call that async so async just
means that we are going to wait for
things that are normally promises to
come back before going to the rest of
our code I'll show you that in two
seconds here so let's do check a channel
and we are going to do constant result
equals a weight pro dot deploy and this
is that the deploy API in the pro
clients if I click dot you can see all
of the different functions that are
available here I just want to get the
info so that info is going to return the
current settings of the deploy plugin
cool so now I've got this response
objects right because we async await by
here result is already equal to the
results of this promise that came back
so let's do this dot deploy channel is
equal to res dot and you can see we've
got binary version channel and deploy
hood I just want the channel and we're
gonna set this dot is beta equal to this
deploy channel whether or not it's equal
to beta that will give us a boolean
value right now because I've used async
await there could be errors that happen
in there right maybe we had an error
kind of getting the data or we're not
running in Cordova so I'm gonna wrap
this thing in a try-catch and then if we
get an error for right now I'm just
going to send it up to the monitoring
service so we're gonna send up just an
that exception right to our pro
dashboard if anything happens there
now when this code runs or when this
page runs rather in the constructor here
we're going to want to call this dot
check channel and that's going to set us
up with the initial data we need the
initial setting for whether or not you
know is beta whether or not the toggle
should be on and whether or not we have
that deploy channel so that's our check
channel function we're also going to
need that toggle beta function so let's
write that async as well to toggle beta
here and here we need to pass the deploy
plug in some config so let's do Const
config equals an object there we're
gonna pass it what channel we want to
connect to so whether or not is beta is
on we're either going to change this to
beta or it's going to say production
okay and then we're gonna do another try
catch block here prota
monitoring that exception and we're just
gonna pass there that error and here's
where we're gonna do a couple things
right the first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna wait pro dot deploy unit and
we're gonna pass at that config so
that's going to update the settings for
the deploy plugin to either be pulling
from the beta channel or the production
channel right then we are going to check
the channel just to make sure that
happened appropriately and after that
we're gonna want to actually perform a
full update here so let's write a
separate function for that let's do a
sync perform automatic update and this
one also we're going to put in a
try-catch block here okay and then in
here we're going to want to do a full
update now if you've used the pro
deploy API before you know you have to
go through all these steps right you
have to do a check to see if there's an
update you have to download it you have
to instruct it and then you have to
redirect to that update in the new
version of our API we've written one
function if you don't need to customize
that you can just call one function so
let's do response equals a wait pro dot
deploy dot check and apply is going to
do the full thing for us so the first
thing it's going to want is that
redirect
and true or false whether or not you
want to redirect the update after it's
been downloaded and we do then it's
gonna take a progress function here to
show us the actual download progress so
here's where we're gonna set that
download progress variable equal to the
progress that we get back and then down
here if rest dot
update then you know we got an update
and we're redirecting otherwise no
update was found here you could update
the UI
I'm not going to right now I'm just
gonna leave it as it is we're gonna
click Save and this is kind of all of
our update logic right so you could
customize this you could change check
and apply to do the kind of full version
for you so if we go back to our Doc's
here back to the deploy API you'll
actually see I put two versions of code
in the docs here one is perform
automatic update that's the one that we
just programmed and then the other is
perform manual update here you can see I
call each individual function
back-to-back so we do check we do
download we extract we do redirect this
is what you'd kind of blow out that code
too if you needed to customize what
happens so you might do check download
and extract whenever a user logs in and
then log out you might do a redirect you
might check for an update every 30
minutes of this app but never close
closes this kind of allows you to
customize that flow if you want to split
it out into those functions but we're
not going to do that today so right now
we should be good to go this should be
all the code we need to have our
toggleable beta Channel we imported pro
we set it up and then we made our
template we made all the functions that
we need here so what I am going to do
first of all is I'm just gonna run ionic
serve make sure I didn't have any kind
of crazy errors happen or any syntax
errors with this code and then we're
gonna push it up to pro and we're gonna
watch this live on the device we're
gonna be able to toggle through these
channels so let's make sure that we
didn't have any errors writing this code
all right so it looks like we've got our
settings page we've got that toggle no
any no syntax errors or anything like
that should we should be good to go
let's bring up our terminal here we're
gonna close out of that serve get status
we're gonna do git add dot get commit
this is going to be the production
toggle code get push ionic master and
now what we're gonna want to do is I
want to toggle between two versions of
code right I need something to put on
the beta Channel so let's go back to our
code really quick here and we're gonna
just do something simple we're gonna add
in h2 that says you know these beta
features are awesome okay we're gonna
save that and we're gonna go back add
those changes this is going to be the
beta toggle code get push ionic master
and we're gonna wait for both of those
things to build we're gonna set them on
their respective channels and then we're
going to watch this work live on the
device so let's go ahead here and
refresh our builds list you can see the
production toggle code and beta toggle
code both got set up a few seconds ago
this one's almost done building already
so we're just gonna let that finish all
right so this build finished
successfully so that's production so
we're going to deploy this code to
production in turn that's actually going
to send it to our device because
remember our device right now is
checking into the production channel
whenever you open the app in that splash
screen but we're also gonna wait for
this beta toggle code to finish real
quick and I'm going to set this to the
beta channel and we are gonna watch it
flip-flop back and forth to having that
h2 tag we put in there and not having it
as we show it to you on the phone all
right so this build is finished let's go
back and deploy it to our beta Channel
so now we've got our production toggle
code running on production our beta
toggle code running on the beta Channel
and now we're gonna want to bring up our
phones here and test this so right now
remember we're on that new production
code text way back from C 3 C ba T over
here so I'm going to close the app on my
phone open it it's going to download
that new version of code in the
background that has our toggle form
sitting on production
right so here we can see I'm connected
to the production channel our download
progress is zero out of 100 opt into
beta features right now is turned off so
when we turn that on it's going to set
the channel check the channel and make
sure we are good and then it's actually
not going to apply the update because we
forgot one important piece so let's go
back to our code quick here we just have
it checking the channel so you know what
let's show this off let's show this off
real quick if I click on the toggle now
it says I'm connected to the beta
Channel if I click off the toggle it
says I'm connected to the production
Channel awesome what we actually did is
we forgot to await here this dot perform
automatic update so we're gonna save
that then we are going to comment out
this line of code we're gonna do get add
dot git commit dash M this is our
production toggle code to get push ionic
master now we are going to uncomment
that we're gonna do get add dot git
commit dash M this is beta toggle code V
to get push attic master and now we're
gonna wait for these to update and we'll
show you guys kind of how it's going to
work now that we have that perform
automatic function update in there so
let's go back to our dashboard let's
refresh we got to wait for these to
build again we're gonna set them as
active and we're gonna play with it on
the phone
and actually you know what while this is
building let me show you something cool
so even though we didn't have that
perform automatic update function set in
there
this is sweet so let's toggle on to the
beta Channel right let's close our app
and now our app is actually connected to
that beta Channel so if I open it it's
going to show me that beta text because
it's going to update it right now in the
splash screen and say these these beta
futures are awesome so it didn't it
didn't follow along with our automatic
update function but it did still work
for forming that update in the native
layer in that splash screen so now let's
close it let's go back here deploy this
to production this has that automatic
code in it
let's wait for this one to finish that
one finished let's deploy that to our
beta Channel let's go back to our phone
and now this will perform the update
checks right when I click toggles right
now it's going to download the new
version these beta features are awesome
it's got the new version the v2 with the
automatic update function so if I toggle
this back to production it's gonna go
download production in the background
refresh to not have that h2 right now if
I toggle it back on it's gonna go to
perform the check to the download give
us that this beta features are awesome
so now every time your user clicks
toggle we're performing that automatic
update it's not just happening in the
splash screen layer it could still
happen in the splash screen layer if you
deploy you know right now we're
connected to production if my user's app
was closed I deployed something new to
production they'd get it in that native
layer they don't need to click the
toggle we just check when they toggle
whether or not we want have an update
that needs to be performed so that allow
you to allow your users to connect to
that opt in beta features branch cool so
let's do a quick recap here let me pull
up my slides we're going to talk a
little bit more just some follow up
about how this whole things work so yet
again
step one we added that Cordova plugin we
put the app on our phone we push some
new production code to pro and reload it
it right on the phone then we installed
a pro client SDK we programmed our
custom beta Tuggle we forgot to put in
the update logic but we still use that
native update layer we went back and we
added that update logic and then anytime
we click toggle it automatically
downloaded the code from the respective
beta or production channel that the user
was checked into and then we showed off
that whole system working so kind of the
life cycle that we programmed here
I wanted to create it in a picture so
you guys can see what's going on here so
you know you're in the bottom left here
the user you get push up to us you've
got a built version of code we had to
built versions of code that we assigned
to the production channel and the beta
Channel and then you've got two users on
the right-hand side here one does not
have the beta toggle that we made they
have it turned off and the other user
has it turned on so the top user is
checking in for updates from our server
on the production Channel and downloads
any updates off of that channel and then
the beta user at the bottom is checking
in to updates on the beta Channel and
downloading those weather
not when they need those updates so
overall that's an active play it is just
one piece of ionic pro ionic Pro is that
complete suite of tools and services
around are always free framework that
allows you to use creator for
prototyping and AK view for app testing
with your users deploy we went over
today for those updates you can package
your native binaries in the cloud you
can use our monitoring service for
real-time error reporting and later in
the spring we're also going to launch
with progressive web app hosting so hope
you enjoyed our deep dive into attic
deploy today I'll catch you guys next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
