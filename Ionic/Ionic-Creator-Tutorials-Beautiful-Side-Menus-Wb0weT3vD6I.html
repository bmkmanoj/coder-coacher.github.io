creators weekly workshop this week I
want to show you how to make a beautiful
looking side menu over the past week
we've actually got a lot of requests on
how to take our side menus customize
their look and feel maybe remove the
backgrounds from the list items or even
make those lists items highlight
depending on the current state so I
wanted to show you how to do all that
and more in a quick tutorial to show you
how to make a really awesome looking
side menu for your app so the first
thing we're going to do is we are going
to start a new project and we're just
going to call this beautiful side menu
choose side menu as a type and create
that project and here it's just going to
bootstrap our standard side menu project
so we're going to have three pages that
are automatically hooked up to three
different list items in our side menu
just like that now the first thing we're
going to want to do is I want to just
change the header color overall for the
app so we are going to change the header
background to positive and change the
theme color positive to be a nice red
color so as we save that here and we
close we'll see that the overall menu of
our app is that red and our side menu
still maintains that stable but we're
actually going to want to select this
page hide header and so we can get rid
of that header option now as you can see
these list items have been pushed all
the way up to the top so let's grab our
space or component here
add something the top just to give us a
little bit of room we're going to make
that fairly small we're actually going
to duplicate it and then throw an image
in between there and this image is what
we're going to kind of use as a profile
image starter so here we're going to
want to upload an image and I'm just
going to choose an image from over here
that I already have of myself right and
then we're going to change this to be
like a 40% with to give us kind of a
little bit size there and you know what
maybe I do want to add just a little bit
more spacing that top maybe just a
little bit more spacing at the bottom so
overall we're not looking too good yet
but we're getting there so now I want to
do two different things
are going to get a background gradient
on this page and then we're going to
turn this profile image into something
circular with a nice border
so let's on our page ad here we're going
to do side menu gradient as a class on
our side menu here and over here we're
going to open up our custom s CSS and
I'm just going to copy over a gradient
that I already have programmed now as I
add code to s CSS and other places
throughout this app you can find all the
code for this at github use creator comm
this is going to be the beautiful side
menu tutorial so that's the section
where you can find all the code for this
so now as you can see though in this
side menu gradient I actually use some
variables so we are going to grab side
menu top and side my new bottom and put
them up here so this is actual s CSS so
we will actually take these variables
and we're going to recompile all the
sass for you you just have to remember
to hit save to trigger that compile so
now that that's compiled you can see we
have our nice background gradient coming
from here so now the next thing I want
to do is turn this profile image to
something that looks just a little
better so we are going to go over to our
profile image and we are going to add a
class of profile - image and go back to
our themes and we are going to start
working with profile image and then
profile image is actually container
round the image so if you would use the
chrome inspector for instance you can
see that in order to get some CSS on the
actual image you're going to have to
include an image tag there now here the
first thing I'm going to want to do is a
border radius of 50% to make that thing
round we're going to give it just a
little bit of margin around the image
and then give it a border of 4 pixels
solid and here we're going to want to
start working with another variable side
menu transparency and this transparency
variable is just going to be another
variable that I set here that's an RGBA
of white with a 40% opacity so what this
is going to give us right here
is a round profile image with a little
bit more space and you can see this nice
little transparent effect that we have
around this image here that looks pretty
good
now let's say you also wanted to add a
name so let's pull up here and we are
going to do Center on that we're going
to change it to white we're going to do
a 300 light here make it an h3 and we
are going to change this to many just so
we get a nice little little text there
to see you know whose profile it is we
can see what account we're logged into
automatically so now we're starting to
kind of come together a little bit but
we still have to work on these list
items now list items as well as a couple
other things that ionic already have
styles built into them for instance one
of the more complicated Styles here is
the background color of these these tags
here so if I were to inspect this what
we can see is on this a okay we have a
background color but it's on item
content so if I was to add a background
color to for instance the a tag that
wouldn't work so the custom code I need
here is going to be item content not the
a to override the background color so
back here we are going to go to all
three of these we're actually going to
add a class just to kind of make sure
everything stays legit so we're going to
add side menu item to all three of these
just so we can work on a separate class
for these fancy styles and so they don't
override anything else in our app so
here we can do side menu item and first
thing we're going to want to do is do a
background none now if you have
something if the site side menu item is
not linked that's what this background
none is going to fix if it is linked we
are going to want to override that item
content and make that a background of
none now the click state is an activated
class so we're going to do and that
activated and we're going to put some
code that we're going to make the
background into that side menu
transparency if it's the activated one
okay the other thing we're going to want
to do is just change a little bit of the
style on here so let's do color white
for the text color let's do that same
font way 300 that we did for the h3 tag
and set the border to zero pixels so as
we save that and preview now we're
getting these a nice-looking side menu
items here now this might look a little
bland
so I like to go ahead and I'm actually
going to rename these and add some icons
to them just to give you guys a look and
feel that looks good so this one let's
call my profile and let's change the
type to icon and make that left icon a
person okay let's change this one to my
photos change it to an icon change that
icon to be a camera and let's change
this one to be my favorites and that is
also going to be a type of icon in that
we're going to use a heart so overall I
just like the look of those icons on
this style of side menu the best so
there you go as you can see our active
state when we click is that same
transparency that's around our profile
image up here now
kind of the last thing I want to show
you guys is the ability to add an active
state to this so for instance our home
or my profile page is currently active
maybe we want this style to change a
little bit now that's not something
that's built directly into ionic one we
do have to use a custom directive for
that so I am just going to open up our
directives j/s okay and I'm going to
copy over a directive I already wrote it
again you can find this directive over
at github dot use creator comm where you
can find all the code that we use in our
tutorials now let me just explain this
directive real quick this is active pay
highlight directive so what I'm going to
do is go to each of these items add a
directive called active - page -
highlight and I'm not going to set a
value this directive doesn't need one
I'm going to add that to all three of
our list items here and what this is
going to do is when it loads and
whenever the state change success it's
going to call this check UI srf function
so it's going to look at where the pages
or where that link is going and check it
versus the current state of the app if
it is the current state we're going to
add the class active page highlight to
it if it's not we're going to make sure
to remove that class in case it already
existed so now you know we have to save
the changes to this code and we also
have to add some style for that active
page highlight so let's open our theming
back up ok and we are going to go to our
theme s CSS here and right in here we're
going to do end dot active page
highlight we are going to do that item
contents because these are linked items
and we're going to add that background
side menu transparency and we are going
to save those changes so recompiles RS
CSS and we are going to open that up and
see that home or my profile in this case
we open my profile select it I can
switch it maintains that switch switch
again it maintains that switch so now
we've got a really nice-looking side
menu complete with a background gradient
a nice round profile image as well as
state that is actually remembered in our
side menu items so this is a great start
for you guys to start making apps that
look and function beautifully now I want
to start doing these weekly creator
things every single week but I need
ideas from you guys so if you've got an
idea or you've got something that you've
put into your app that you think other
people would like to know how to do hit
me up at Twitter at Matthew Kramer and I
might wind up making the weekly workshop
about your idea so until next time guys
I will catch you later thanks for tuning
