and today I want to talk with you a
little bit about where we're at with
ionic to support now we get this
question a lot that's when is it going
to be ready all these things and I'm not
going to lie I addict to a lot of stuff
changed which means a lot of things in
creator also need to change so it's
going to be a bit of a larger
development effort for us but with that
being said ionic 2 is an amazing amazing
piece of software built to help you guys
out and make your lives a lot easier
I've already enjoyed playing with it as
much as I have to build creator 2 and I
want to bring all that joy to you guys
but we also want to do it in a way where
we get ionic 2 support to you as fast as
we possibly can so that means in the
beginning we're going to be taking a
phased approach to creator 2 development
so that means instead of started with
all of the features you know and love
about the current version of creator
we're going to launch our version of
ionic 2 support with a little bit less
features just so we can get it into your
hands faster so now one of the other big
things that we get asked is are we still
going to maintain support for ionic 1
and the answer is a resounding yes ok
we're going to keep ionic 1 in the tool
for you guys you're always going to be
able to create new ionic 1 projects get
those off the bat use all the components
use all the features that you know and
love in the current version of creator
another question we often get is whether
or not there's going to be an easy
migration path between creator 1
projects and creator 2 projects and the
answer to that is actually we don't
quite know yet and we're still figuring
out what kind of transition path that we
can offer you guys so be on the lookout
in the future for more news about that
now I want to talk a little bit more in
depth about the first phase of ionic to
support that Creator is going to be
launching with not ready quite yet but
we are in heads-down active development
to get this phase in your hands as quick
as humanly possible and that phase is
going to be support for a zip
export that exports ioniq to code so
everything in the tool is still going to
be like the the tool that you use that
you login to the designer okay is still
going to be based in ionic 1 the preview
tab is still going to be based in ionic
1 creator mobile is still going to be
based in ionic 1 but you'll get the
option to have an I addict to export for
your project now launching this so
quickly to you guys does mean we're
going to have to cut a few corners so
that means right off the bat we are not
going to launch it with custom CSS
support we're not launching it with our
custom code support we're also not going
to support package quite yet we really
wanted to just get you a zip export
functional in your hands as soon as
possible
so we're heads down developing that zip
export and then from there we're going
to pile on additional phases to
development that yet again we'll talk
with you guys are going to be very open
about this whole process phase 2 is kind
of the phase where we're going to have
to write an actual transpiler for those
of you that are kind of in attic 2
development you know that we have to
take your code transpile it down to
something that a browser can understand
so phase 2 as we do that we launch
preview support ton other things so
overall we're breaking up development so
that those that want to really be on the
forefront and create an attic 2 apps can
still use creator just maybe - one or
two features that are currently in the
ionic 1 version of the tool but don't
worry we're going to bring everything
you know and love eventually will hit
there or developing as soon as we
possibly can to get this release in your
guys exams so as always we're very open
about this let us know if you have any
questions or comments also one final
note we also are going to have ionic
abuse support coming soon which means
we're going to be able to get you better
support for native plugins as well as
it's the new documentation on native
plugin usage in the annex one version of
the tool as well as set us up for great
victories with plugins supports in the
attic - version
so until next time I hope you guys you
know are ready for an active sport as
fast as we're trying to get it to you
I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
