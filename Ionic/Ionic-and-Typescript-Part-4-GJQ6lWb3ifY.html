going to pick up exactly where we left
off in our last video where we converted
all of our controllers to use typescript
es6 style classes so as a quick recap
we'll convert this angular 1 factory to
use an es6 style class so what we'll
start off doing is creating a class of
chats right above our angular module
definition this class will have a
constructor with no dependencies and
then we will copy the fake data from our
old factory and just paste it inside of
our new constructor from here we will
remove the VAR keyword and replace it
with this and then we will create chats
property on this class this property
will have a type of any kind of array
then we'll take our methods and then
paste them right below our newly created
constructor then we'll select all the :
and function keywords and just delete
them a last bit of cleaning up is we
will replace all the instances of the
variable chats with the new this dot
chats property from our constructor will
remove the commas between the methods
since they are no longer needed and
replaced them with semicolons then we
can finally remove the anonymous
function down in our Factory and replace
it with the newly created class chats
now the Taipings from TSD expect a
factory to return data using dollar HTTP
so we'll change this factory to use a
generic service method instead now if we
want to use a service in our controllers
the editor couldn't give us any kind of
hints about the methods on this class
what they accept or just how to use this
code in general to get code completion
we need to use something called
typescript interfaces these are
essentially code contracts that say this
bit of code expects these properties in
has these methods on them so we'll
create two interfaces one for the chat
service and then another interface
describing each of the objects that we
have inside of our chat array what we're
also going to do is add export in front
of our two interfaces as well as our
class then we'll wrap the interfaces and
the class in a new es6 module definition
all the modules services close up the
bottom and then will come down to our
angular services and change name from
chats to services dot chats now the
reason for doing this is so that way
when we go inside of our controller and
actually start adding type annotations
we can properly pull in the code that we
need and have everything available to us
so to get started we'll create the
interface for the chat user object and
what we can do is copy the data from the
object and just paste it inside of our
interface now we can use the values from
this data and actually get hints about
what kind of types we should be adding
to this code we have a ID property here
and this has a number value so we can
assume that it will have a type of
number the last three are all returning
strings so we can assume that these
properties will all have a type of
string now inside of our class we can
change the type for our chats property
from any kind of array to an array of
eye chats users the interface that we
just created
now to add type annotations to these
methods we can take the names of all the
methods that we have in our class and
start copying them and moving them over
to our interface for our first type will
work with The Awl method so we can
expect this to do nothing but just
return an array of I chats users the
interface for our users object for our
remove method we need to pass a chat
object and this chat object is going to
be typed with a type of I chest user the
interface for our single user object so
that way we know we're actually passing
in the correct thing
for our get method it's going to expect
hid to get passed in and we can add the
type of string to that and then call
this method complete
now the last thing we need to do is to
tell typescript that our class should
have this kind of functionality so what
we'll do is come down to our class and
add implements a chat service to finish
things in his file so let's open our
controller dot ES file and start using
this interface first we'll add a
reference to thee services the TS file
right below the main TSD file reference
now anywhere we're injecting the chat
service we can add the proper type
annotation from the interfaces we just
wrote let's look at our chats controller
we can go to the chats in our
constructor and add the type of services
a chats service
now we can go into our constructor and
write this dot chats equals chats dot
and we can get code completion from the
interface that we just this case we want
all add the closing brace semicolon and
we are done
if we wanted to use this remove method
we can use the this chats dot remove and
we can see that it expects a chat object
to get passed along
now we're interfaces get really
interesting is when you need to extend
an already existing interface and create
your own that has custom properties that
you want added to it in this case we
have this dollar state params and when
we give it a type of ng UIDAI state
params we'll get a warning that the
property of chat ID does not exist on
dollars state params
to resolve this will create our own
interface and we're just going to call
this eye state params and this will
extend the interface for NG UIDAI state
params so we'll just add a chat ID
property and give it a type of string
then we'll come down to our constructor
and change the type of dollars state
params to eye state params and our
warning will go away so we have
inherited everything from the original
interface but now we have our own custom
property in our next video we'll take
all of this code that we just converted
and look at how we can migrate this over
to a brand new ionic to app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
