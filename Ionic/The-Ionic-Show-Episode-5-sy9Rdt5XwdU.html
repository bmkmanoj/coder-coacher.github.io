of the ionic show my name is Ben and I'm
max and today we have a ton of things to
talk about we took a break so to speak
not really we were working really hard
and kind of fell behind during an ionic
 we procrastinated a little bit a
little bit but it's just because we were
working so hard we literally have like
twice as many things to talk about today
as we normally do so we hope you have
twice the amount of time to watch a show
and twice the fun so let's get into it
today we're going to start with the
reflection of 2014 yeah it was a huge
year our first year in existence pretty
much so we're gonna talk about
everything that happened especially
we're going to highlight the community
we have pet just we love our community
we love you guys we love these awesome
meetups that are popping up all over the
world we're gonna get into that we're
going to talk about how you can start
your own ionic meet up or community
wherever you are um we're going to
highlight some cool ionic apps yep we've
got the Electronic Frontier Foundation
just released in ionic app yes we have a
game so if you if you ever wanted to
build a game with ionic will show you
someone that did yep and we're going to
talk about one of our own apps that we
built in-house the ionic view app which
lets you preview your ionic apps inside
of an ionic ass it's pretty sweet and
then we're going to talk about a
deception I on exception beta 14 the
latest beta the current beta the last
beta that's what they're saying that's
what they're saying and then ionic lab a
new service that lets you test cross
platform design tweaks all in the
browser is really sweet crosswalk we
thought you basically but put chromium
in your Android apps actually make them
fast and then finally a really cool
splash an icon generated tool that helps
you just build all the like assets for
all the different phone sizes that you
need so we've we've helped you out there
yeah um I think that's about it will
probably get into a few other things
we're also drinking tea today switching
up a little bit we're relaxing
let's get the show started all right
let's talk about 2014 yeah crazy year so
2014 was basically ionix first year in
existence and it was a huge year we went
from zero to one of the top 50 most
popular open source projects in the
world on github nearly 13,000 stars like
were so many it we never expected that
to happen we're super proud we're super
happy that's incredible not only that
but there were over 340,000 ionic apps
built from from you guys in the
community just it's just nuts yeah and
and just jumping off of that it's all
because of you guys I mean it it's
because of you the community that has
that has sprung out this year and and
built meetups and done talks and Ghana
conferences and built apps share them
with people wrote blog post I mean like
I've learned I've learned just as much
from you guys as you know hopefully
you've learned from building with ionic
I'm yeah i think we joke sometimes that
like the ionic community are better
ionic developers and we are and it shows
what you guys have built some great apps
you pushed the limits with of what we
thought was possible with the framework
and that's like all we could hope for um
and we're being blown away by where all
of these like community meetups are
starting up and we have like over 30 I
think it's approaching 30 international
like official ionic meetup groups we
have me an ionic Argentina we have ionic
Belgium Brazil Canada colombia germany
ireland italy anna kenya netherlands
paris philippines puerto rico the list
goes on and on and on i mean there's
just so many meetups and meetup groups
and what we're doing is if you want to
start up your own meetup just get in
touch with us you can tweet at us you
can email us hide a nick framework calm
and we'll help you get started will
usually give you some logo assets where
you'll build them a sick but i will
build you your own ionic logo for
whatever city or country you're starting
your ionic meet up from it will help you
out with point you to where to get some
swag we're gonna be building that's
another thing yeah we've gotten an ionic
store coming up and we'll
have a not only will we have some cool
shirts and all that stuff but we'll have
actually like swag box like a starter
kit for like a meet-up so that would be
really cool hmm so thank you we're so
humbled by everything that you guys do
you are the reason you are the the
backbone to why ionic is so so amazing
so thank you yeah so we think 2015 and
Beyond is really the year for hybrid
apps and ionic ends we are we've got so
many things planned we're excited to
have you guys along for the ride and we
look forward to learning a lot from you
and being humbled by what you built so
yeah so let's talk about some some new
ionic apps yeah so one of the really
cool ones that just came out last week
it's built by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and this is a great a great
company that has basically tried to
protect our rights in the digital era
and i've done' donated to them in the
past i'm super humbled and proud that
ionic was was picked by them yeah this
one was near and dear to your heart yeah
so basically the apt just helps you get
notified when there's a events going on
that you can help spread the word on how
to protect your digital rights and they
wrote a great blog post about how they
ended up only deploying the app to
android because there were some terms
and conditions in the apple developer
license that they didn't agree with and
i think it's a really good discussion
that we should be having you know I
think we all love the native
distribution model like it the great
market it's great way to get your apps
out there but it's not all roses and we
should always be thinking about how we
can improve the system I mean that's
what we're doing here with hybrid apps
we're trying to take back some of the
control and put it in our hands so we
don't have to kind of get stuck in each
platform but can work across all of them
so so they've they wrote a great blog
post you can see it at eff dot org I
think it's definitely required reading
for any mobile developer yeah and we're
against proud and honored that they used
ionic yeah so um next app is one of the
first although first that I'm aware of
games bill with ionic at least it's the
first time we feature one here so the
game is called convergence and it's an
apple with ionic from
one of our I onic developers on the UK
and it's really really simple it's
really really fun i play it pretty often
I should play it when I'm like traveling
it's kind of a mindless fun game
basically what they did is they stripped
out all of the ionic like you I like SDK
components that you get and they built
their own little system of like blocks
basically that converged to a point and
then you have to guess where all these
like blocks are going to converge to and
I've gone I've gotten pretty far in it
it's really frustrating when you don't
get the right spot and you have to start
back at zero but like it makes you want
to play it even more so it's one of
those games or so you kind of get hooked
I'm trying to see how far you can get
yeah I like super simple but really
simple rich it's got really cool colors
it's really fun design really well done
kudos to the to Greg who made the appt
on Britain yeah yes so that's a great
app if you've ever thought about billing
in game with ionic it's it's definitely
one to check out to show you how it's
done called convergence convergence yep
so the other one isn't actually an app
that we built called the ionic view app
and the core idea behind the ionic view
app is it lets you preview and actually
share ready to go ionic apps with other
people around the world so so that's
like the core feature set but i think
it's it's also a in example of what's
possible with ionic so definitely go and
check out the ionic view app the beta is
on the on the apple app store right now
just because we had some native plugins
we're working on but the cool thing
about the app is is you can go and have
a client or a friend check out the app
even if they don't have any SDKs
installed so so if you're testing
locally and you're developing on the
device it's like it's not super useful
for that process but it's really better
for getting like you know a client to
check out the app to test out the user
experience test out functionality we
actually load all the plugins that you
need locally so we're expanding the
plug-in set but we should support
everything it's still in beta so we're
still adding lots of stuff yeah you
might find some bugs and we do have a
repo for for submitting issues you can
just I think it's just called ionic view
issues repo on github so if you find a
bug with it submit it we're actively
working on it fixing it like max
it is in beta but it's really fun i mean
like bouncing off what you were saying
like you can do all these fun things but
really where at least where i get the
value out of it is it's actually just
you're previewing it in a phone as
though it were a native running app you
have access to all these things and it
just feels like it feels like a nap yeah
like imagine you even if you use like
build an ionic prototype you can just
send it and have like everyone on the
team playing with it as if it's a real
app and not only is it like a quick
prototype but you can actually then go
build the full thing from your ionic app
so it's a great tool for for just doing
that even so yeah so check out the yonk
view app it's only in the iOS store yeah
yeah I mentioned that work the Android
ones coming soon we use these apps that
we've built like the ionic view apt to
make ionic better so sometimes it take a
long time or they only come out on on
iOS first because we are actually using
it to improve our android support which
is why the other ones been a little bit
slow but uh ionic gets better when we
build these things and they add value to
you guys so definitely check it out cool
so I think we should talk about paid 14
yeah the last the last of the betas the
beta to end all betas yes so where do we
start there's so many changes that have
happened it was a long time coming we
know everyone was really anxious about
it coming out I think we took a good
month or two to get it out but it's it
was for a good reason we worked so hard
on it we we should start with angular we
updated angular 1.3 yeah so we updated
to 1.3 which just adds some good
performance improvements I and there's
just some changes some minor changes
that you might need to look into if
you're migrating from 1.2 to 1.3 but in
general everything should work the
biggest change is probably the new
transition and navigation system caching
yes so we've made ionic feel much more
native by not destroying previous pages
so when you navigate forward and you're
in a list and you keep going further and
further and further down the navigation
chain you go back and you're everything
was like how you left it so the scroll
position is the same whatever you're
looking at the same this is how native
apps work and it's how we should have
done from the beginning so we redesigned
it it's much faster
performances much improve the
transitions are better so that's been a
huge improvement and then and then swipe
to go back is coming soon as I guess
because of that feature so we've also
dramatically improved platform styles so
Android will look more like the new
android l style and iOS will just you
know be iOS because that's kind of how
we started and to jump off that a bit
like as far the way that we're looking
at like platform styles is we're not
trying to make it look like your
standard Android app or your standard
iOS app we want it to just feel at home
in whatever platform it's in so we're
not going to be making crazy changes to
ionic proper we're going to be doing
little things that make your app just
feel at home if it's displayed in an
Android device right so you can add your
brand's edger styles and it will fit
into the native like kind of look but
it's not just gonna be the native kid
looks like we don't think app should
look like that you should have our
colors you should have your own touch
because that's what the biggest best
apps do they customize it yeah so we
always want to make that easy and focus
on that yeah platform styles transitions
caching lots of stuff tons of stuff read
the release notes we are working quickly
on going to one point oh the release
candidate for that after this so there
won't be any other betas this is the
final release and we hope you enjoy it
awesome so let's talk about ionic lab so
ionic lab is a new feature that we
released about a month ago which
basically gives you access to in chrome
or whatever your web browser is we like
chrome to preview your ionic apps as you
build them as what they would look like
as an iOS device and as in an Android
device just all in the browser and it
kind of allows you to see all the cool
little platform tweaks that ionic is
doing between between Android and iOS so
for instance you'll see your header text
move to the left of the screen on the
Android whereas on the iOS like screen
you'll see it in the center which is
what iOS prefers I'm so really really
useful and you can access it through the
command line tool yeah yeah and it's
it's kind of like a easier way to do the
like device emulation chrome has divided
simulation which is which is nice but
the cool thing about this is actually
does too
Isis at the same time and you don't need
to like you know set the device in the
resolution it just happens automatically
so if you want to do this you basically
run ionic serve and then dash dash lab
you get all the live measurable live
reload stuff that we added but this one
loads and kind of like a separate tool
and this is just the beginning of ionic
lab it's probably going to become this
like really really cool kind of in
browser development environment yeah and
so this is really just feature one like
to be very beginning what we're doing
one of the things that we want to add is
like um like mocking so like if you
clicked on like an input it I would
actually like show you a fake little
like keyboard or like things like that
that actually make it feel like you're
actually interacting with a with
something that's on a phone but it's
just in your browser yeah like
geolocation camera stuff well this stuff
should be like developed like you should
be able to use those features even
though you're not running on the phone
just make developments so much easier so
that's really just the beginning try it
out download the new command line tool
and run that cool um so we need to talk
about crosswalk integration huge huge
update to ionic just that happened this
past week yep so crosswalk is basically
chromium that runs on Android so instead
of the crappy old you know I'm sorry I'm
going to say it's crappy because it's
just terrible the old Android webview
which is the bane of every mobile
developers existence we've gotten rid of
that you can use crosswalk with chromium
for your for your ionic apps now so we
released a huge blog post about this
last week and it covers all the details
it's still in beta so follow the blog
because it tells you how to get up and
running and trying this out everyone
that tries it is just blown away by how
much faster their android apps are so we
want to kind of move beyond the old kind
of myth that android slow well it wasn't
a myth because it was true with a
terrible webview sorry I'm kind of tell
I've got a little resentment build up so
the new Android webview with chromium is
so much faster it'll make your Android
apps way better so definitely use it
yeah and check out the blog for the full
details we're really excited about that
yeah it's a huge release
so speaking of releases we also release
this is with the command line tool this
new splash screen generator and icon
generator free apps which like holds a
special place in my heart because as a
designer I'm constantly designing splash
screens for mobile apps that we're
building here and icons for them and if
you've done it before then I don't need
to tell you how absurdly confusing and
annoying and difficult it is to get your
splash beans to look right and to export
them right all the different sizes all
the different icon types for between iOS
and Android like it's a mess and so what
we did is we built a service that
basically generates them for you yeah
you just run a command you put the
source file it sends it up to our server
we splice and dice and do all the
magical stuff and you get back a full
set of images that fit all the phones so
you probably don't want to use this if
you've got like a really like specific
design that you'd be like cut yeah but
most apps should have like a simple
splash screen where the image is in the
center and we're just going to fit the
rest of it to match so it perfect for
that for generating app icons which can
be kind of annoying it does all of that
for you for both iOS and Android so huge
time saver at least and especially if
it's you know your first version that
you just want to get out and you need to
go through this whole process of doing
the apps app icons doing the splash
screens like this just does it for you
much quicker to get that proof of
concept out get it in the app store
quicker you don't have to worry about or
think about it so that was kind of the
point that we were trying to help that
gained there so and then again this is
in the command line tools so I
definitely go and update to the new
version I think you also need the new
version for crosswalk and you need it
for lab so definitely go an update if
you haven't tons of new features in
there so that is pretty much it for the
splash and icon generator yeah and I
think I think that's about it for today
that those are the big things we wanted
to talk about yeah so we are gonna hold
off on talking about ionic io because we
talked about it last time we're still
working on it I was getting closer some
people are using it we're just polishing
things up and making sure that we've got
the kind of back-end infrastructure in
place so we don't have to make big
changes there in the middle of like
people using it so we are we're also
hiring some people to help us build that
out
some back-end developers python django
go you know Heroku so if you like any of
that stuff definitely check out our jobs
page because we're hiring for those
roles right now and that's going to be
sweet so we'll probably dedicate the
whole next one to that and you'll be
able to play with it and we can finally
stop you know stringing you along about
how awesome it's going to be cool well I
think that wraps it up for today again
just to reiterate it's been a great year
Thank You the community for for
supporting us and for making ionic what
it is we're humbled by you we're excited
by all the things that you're building
keep sharing it with us keep teaching us
and and yeah it's just yeah I mean like
you know we we are going to focus on
trying to make you guys as successful as
possible so we want to share every blog
post you're right every cool app you
build we really want to make sure that
when you work with ionic and you build
cool things with it you are more
successful because of its oh yes that's
going to be a focus of ours we started
doing a little bit of this with the
trusted partner program so trying to
make sure that there's if there's ionic
work out there that we get you know
group of people who are really good at
ionic and get you work which has been a
pretty successful this year yeah so
we're going to be doing way more stuff
like that yeah so um thank you to the
community thank you thank you to ionic
