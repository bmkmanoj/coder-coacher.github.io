team and today I want to show you two
how to use our brand new feature Google
Maps integration now this is super
simple so all you're going to do is
start a new project or have a project
that you're currently editing so I'm
going to name this one testing maps and
we're gonna call this just a blank
regular old project and right in this
page we can actually drag over our Maps
component and we're gonna see this
default placeholder now in the editor
this placeholder is never gonna change
you're only going to see a change in
preview when we actually load your map
now the first step is on the right-hand
side you can see that we have to install
the Google Maps add-on first so what
this does is it's actually going to put
all the code that Google Maps needs to
run inside of your app so that we can
actually get that run for you now to
start out you're going to need to get a
Google Maps API key right here the
second link you just click here we're
going to wait for that to load and if
you're logged in you should just see a
get a key button and from that get a key
button sometimes Google Maps takes a
second to load here you can do it all
right so we're gonna select or create a
project so I've already created this
Where's Waldo project I'm just going to
click that click enable the API and it
is going to generate me a my own API key
that I can use for this integration
alright so you can just click this copy
button go back over here give us this
key at Google Maps to your project and
now we're already set to use our Google
Maps components so right now you can
ignore all of this if you'd like just
click off of this and exit and now you
can see that we've got our Google map
already set up for the Madison Capitol
zoom level of 12 default map type and if
we preview that map just works right off
the bat so if you come back here and
let's say you wanted to change this to
something like Milwaukee Wisconsin with
the zoom level a little bit further out
let's go down to 8 and we don't want to
show a marker anymore or the default UI
or make a draggable we can just preview
that and now we're in Milwaukee now
another cool thing you can do is if you
go over to your page and turn off
padding and go back into the maps come
and make this 100% height as well you
can actually get some really cool
effects like full with full height maps
that take up your entire app now that's
the first way to do it this is the EZ
Maps component way you can also add a
code based example that gives you full
control over the entire map so if you
want to add for instance functionality
that maybe isn't available in our
properties or you want like a list of
markers backed by your own API you might
have to do that via code so if we open
up our code bar here and go back to
add-ons and back to Google Maps here's
where we kind of tell you the different
things that we installed to make Google
Maps possible and we also let you add a
code based example so if I just click
this button it's going to add that code
based example for me okay and you can
see we added a Maps example page with an
HTML component now as you can see this
HTML component is not taking up any
space right now and that's because the
way Maps works is we have to have an NG
if on a your location that you give the
map before it can actually be rendered
so here it shows nothing if I preview we
are actually going to show you that
location now there's also a Maps example
in our code editor down here and this is
the code that you're going to use and
modify to change the contents of this
map so overall two ways to use our new
google maps component you can use it the
easy way with the component or you can
jump in to all the code and edit this
stuff yourself so I know this has been a
highly requested feature and I hope you
guys really enjoy Google Maps I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
