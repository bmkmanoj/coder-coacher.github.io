creator team and today I want to talk
with you a little bit about our lists so
there are two easy ways to create a list
the first is scrolling all the way down
over here and dragging an entire default
list over the right-hand side of your
page which as you can see in the pages
drop-down creates not only your
overarching list element but also three
different list items that you can edit
link up things like that
now we also made it a lot easier in this
new version to create lists so if you
just want to drag like a list item with
thumbnail over we will automatically
create that parent list for you so let's
start off with our default list here and
we are just going to drag that over and
as you can see the first kind of list
component is just a standard list item
that can be given a title and link to a
page external URL phone number email
address all that sort of stuff the
second type is a list item with
thumbnail and with this one you can
upload an image change a title I have
some content and link it up to something
we also have lists dividers which can be
dragged anywhere in between list
elements above list elements where you
can say look you know here's this list
item and now this is an actual divider
so we can get our nice division as you
can see here that looks a lot better
with the divider in my opinion but the
cool thing about lists is those are the
three standard parts but you can also
put any form element into a list that
you want as well so you want to drag
over a toggle you can have a toggle on
that list text area select search ranges
radio buttons inputs checkboxes the
whole shebang anything you want to put
in this list from forms as well will
work in that list for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
