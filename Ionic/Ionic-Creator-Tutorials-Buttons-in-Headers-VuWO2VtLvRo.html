team and today i want to show you how to
use buttons and headers so to get
started here real quick we are just
going to create a new project i'm gonna
call this one buttons in headers I'm
gonna use a blank project type for this
and then right off the bat as always I'm
gonna start making this app look a
little bit how I want it to so the first
thing I'm going to start to do here is
we're gonna change the header color of
our page by clicking theming up in the
top right and changing the background
color to positive and as always if you
want to change positive to a different
color or any of these different themes
to different color you can manage that
in themed colors as well but for now I
like this blue color so we're just gonna
save that and leave now buttons and
headers are actually managed from the
page they have to select the page in the
controller here and we are gonna have
our left header button and a right
header button show up in the page
properties so first let's make a nice
looking icon button so we're gonna
enable this and we are gonna pick an
icon for this one let's do a minus
symbol okay so that is a nice large icon
style button okay and for the right-hand
side let's do text so let's enable the
right header button and call that edit
and yet again we've got a nice large
section of text here that looks like
it's taking up a majority of the header
space for this edit button now there are
two different types of styles of button
and headers as well so this is kind of
the full style if you wanted to style
something more as a button you can turn
on style this button and you're gonna
see one change right off the bat is that
the icon over here got a lot smaller and
that's because there's actually a button
around it so if we hit preview here we
can see that the click target the whole
square turns dark behind it that's the
area of this button now if I wanted to
for instance change the colors button we
could change that to one of our themes
so we could change it to balance which
makes that button a lot more visible by
default you can do the same thing with
textile button so you could style that
as a button it gets a lot smaller we
could change it to balanced and then
have it appear as an actual button now
the other quick thing I want to show you
guys is let's see here if we're taking
this no theme we have an icon you can
also have text combined with that
so you could have a double icon and text
button if you really want it to so
that's overall how you kind of setup
these buttons but let's actually go and
add some functionality to them now you
can add any kind of functionality you'd
like with our angular directives and
just for lack of something better for
this demo we're going to show an alert
so I'm going to bring up our code here
and we're going to do scoped alert
equals function alert testing save that
just to give us a function to work with
here and then we are gonna add an
angular directive to our page so we're
gonna click Add and we're gonna do ng -
click alert is a function now right now
nothing's gonna happen if I do this okay
because this directive isn't actually
assigned to the button so a cool feature
about our directives is if you click
this little icon right here you can
actually get a full HTML view so as we
could see this directive actually got
put on the whole page we don't want it
the whole page we only want it on our
left button so we can move it to our eye
on that button side equals left to this
inner button so that's the actual button
here save and close and now when we
click this button we're going to wind up
getting an alert there you go we got an
alert so overall we can customize our
buttons they can be icon text we can
style them it's button or have them be
that more fully featured full height
rather style and then you could add any
kind of functionality like those using
our angular directives property so
that's buttons and headers if you guys
have any questions let me know in the
comments but overall it's pretty simple
and easy to use now so have a good one
I'll catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
