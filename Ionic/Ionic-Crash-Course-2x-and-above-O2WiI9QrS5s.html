creators of ionic today we're going to
walk through building our very first
mobile app with the new version of ionic
ionic 2 we'll walk through installing
all the dependencies needed to build
apps with ionic will start a new ionic
app and make some small modifications
we'll talk about documentation and
resources that you'll need when you
build your app and then we'll talk about
where to go from here for those new to
ionic ionic is an open source html5 in
native mobile app development framework
that helps developers build mobile apps
for all the major platforms and even the
mobile web and desktop using the exact
same codebase
we built ionic for web developers who
were new to mobile or wanted to use
their existing skill sets to build
mobile apps building apps with ionic is
very similar to building a traditional
website we use HTML Javascript and CSS
and instead of getting a traditional
site out of it we get what looks and
feels more like a mobile app that users
are familiar with one of the big reasons
we built ionic was to empower web
developers to become mobile developers
without having to learn a totally new
technology stack
additionally ionic comes with some very
useful tool to help you build test and
scale your app the command-line tool is
how you start new projects build tests
and actually work on your app ionic
Creator is a visual design tool that
helps people who aren't comfortable
coding or want to really quickly build
UI using our drag-and-drop tool ionic
cloud services help you easily add
things like user authentication and push
notifications to your ionic app an ionic
native helps you add the full power of
the native SDKs to your app including
things like Bluetooth fingerprint
scanning and a whole lot more
finally the ionic View app helps you
test and share your app with clients
co-workers friends you name it without
requiring them to deal with complicated
beta provisioning and testing you just
share the app with them they install
ionic view and they test it it also is
an easy way for you to test your app on
your device without having to install
the SDKs definitely check out ionic view
it's totally free
let's install ionic and get started
building our first mobile app open your
browser to ionic framework comm and then
click get started the first thing that
we need to do if we haven't done it
already is install node.js if you're not
familiar with nodejs its a popular and
fast-growing project that enables
developers to build command-line tools
web servers and libraries using
javascript once you have it installed
you'll be able to use it for a ton of
projects not just ionic as it's quickly
becoming the de facto standard for
JavaScript utilities and libraries
when installing node.js pick the LTS or
long term support version same thing if
you're upgrading generally ionic always
supports the latest LTS version and it's
the most stable and widely used
unfortunately we can't always guarantee
that we support the current version due
to large changes that aren't yet
supported so once we've installed nodejs
the next thing that we need to do is
install cordova and ionic so we'll just
go and copy this command it will go to
our terminal
it will type it in note if we're on
linux or mac we need to add sudo first
in order to install these utilities
globally sudo is not required nor will
it work on Windows so please leave it
out when you run that command great
Cordova and ionic are now installed so
the ionic CLI is what we use to start
test and run our ionic apps so now that
we have it installed let's go ahead and
create our very first onic app to do
this we'll use the start option for the
ionic CLI along with the name of the app
that we want to create ionic start my
app and then we need to add the special
v2 flag which is two dashes and then v2
which tells us tells ionic that we're
going to be creating a version 2 project
if we leave that out it will create a
version 1 project so make sure you put
it in soon this will become the default
but either way it'll work
this command takes a little bit as it's
downloading all the initial app code as
well as installing the dependencies that
our app needs like angularjs
great it's finished so once that command
completes we will have a full ionic app
in the directory with the name that we
just gave our app above so we type ll or
LS we can see that we have a my app
directory we need to CD into that
directory CD means change directory it's
equivalent to say navigating to a folder
in finder or Windows Explorer so once
we're in there we can just do a quick LS
L to see the files in the app structure
that we have so before we dig in let's
just run our app and see it live type
ionic lab which will run ionic in a
special testing environment that lets us
preview various device platforms side by
side you can also substitute the word
lab for serve to just run the app
fullscreen with the default platform so
here we have lab it's running and we're
previewing the iPhone version but we all
we can also go and toggle Android or
Windows to see how ionic adapts the UI
for different platforms automatically
okay now our app is running let's go and
take a look at the code that's been
generated for our app so you'll want to
go and open your text editor to the
folder that we just created so I use
atom we also recommend visual studio
code is a great option either way you'll
want to go and open that folder in your
text editor so if you're using atom just
go in the directory and type atom space
period it will open atom and use that
current directory as the project folder
so here we have the default project
structure for an ionic 2 app let's walk
quickly through each one of these files
and just explain them the first folder
is the hooks folder these are scripts
that are run before during and after
building and testing your app generally
unless you're doing some advanced work
you don't need to really mess with those
but they can be useful for preparing a
Cordova build for example the next
folder is node modules this is where
nodejs
and NPM store all the JavaScript depend
these are app is going to use like
angular 2 and ionic the platform's
directory is where Cordova generates
platform-specific code so for example
for iOS we actually have objective-c
code here in an Xcode project so we can
actually open up this Xcode project and
cast directly on a device or emulator
the plugins directory is where Cordova
stores native plugin code for example if
we have a Bluetooth plug-in or a health
kit plug-in to access health kit data
those plugins will be in here the
Resources directory stores our icon and
splash screen that get generated with
Cordova to actually become our splash
screens and icons in the app the source
directory is where most of our app code
runs and this is where we're going to
spend most of our time working in the
source directory the www folder
dub-dub-dub is some people call it is is
basically the static output folder for
our app every time ionic builds our app
and generates it that code goes into
this directory so you can kind of think
of it as a static the roots of a static
web server so really it's just running
index.html and accessing a few files
you're free to put other files in here
but generally avoid putting files in the
assets and build directory because ionic
overrides those with with the build
assets from generating your app looking
at some of these files down here the
editor config is simply an editor config
to help you better format your code
using ionic code standards get ignore
the default get ignore so you don't
check in files that we generally want
you to ignore like node modules for
example which is not necessary nor
should it be stored in your git repo
config dot XML is a configuration file
for Cordova that lets you configure the
actual quarter of app so for example we
disabled a few things in the actual
native runtime and we store the plugins
that were using ionic config JSON you
generally don't need to mess with this
but it stores some configuration that I
am
like Reed's package.json is a node
metadata file that says what
dependencies your app has so you can see
in here we've got some dependencies on
angular and ionic TS config specifies
some configuration for a typescript
ionic provides a default one generally
you shouldn't modify this file but we
may require it to be updated down the
road should changes be necessary
finally TS lint is a linter rule and
linters are basically tools that help
format your code or tell you about code
that's not properly formatted this helps
work with other team members on bigger
teams because you know that you're all
writing code that looks the same and
follows the same standards like making
sure you're using this space after an if
statement feel free to modify this but
we provide you some default ones out of
the box so that's the default high-level
structure of an ionic app we're going to
spend most of our time in the source
folder that's where the actual code for
our app lives before it's built into a
highly compressed minified javascript
file by ionic so the first folder inside
the source folder is the app folder now
the app folder runs basically the
initial code that jump starts your app
bootstraps your app so the first file in
here is the app component es so in
angular 2 in ionic 2 your app is just a
tree structure of components and that
means that there is one component at the
top called the root component or the app
component that is basically the first
component that runs the app so in this
case that component is my app it's got a
reference to a template file here and
then in the constructor when it runs
it's waiting for platform ready changing
the style of the status bar and then
hiding the splash screen and then it's
also setting this root page variable to
be a reference to tabs page which we'll
talk about in a second but if we follow
and take a look at the template that app
uses it consists of one component I on
nav
I on nav is a navigation controller that
lets you push and pop pages to navigate
between them generally you'll want this
to be the root component because it lets
your app navigate around and then in
here we're setting the root element on
ion nav to this root page variable that
we defined here which is taps page so
basically this is saying that inside the
ion navs the root page is going to be
the tabs page the next file is apt multi
s angular 2 requires every single app to
have an NG module declaration and inside
here we define our ng module we have to
list out all the components that we're
using we import the ionic module so so
all of ionic can run and then we specify
some other entries and providers here
below app dot s CSS is global CSS and
sass to phim your app we're not going to
use that for this example and then main
dot es is a small entry point for the
app that tells angular to bootstrap and
actually run your app using the app
module that we defined an app dot module
the next folder here is the assets
folder and the assets folder is where
you will store static assets like images
that get bundled in the build process in
output in the WWF's folder pages will
dig more into this soon but this is
where the code for every single one of
our pages live so if we go back to our
app we'll see a home page in about page
and a contact page and then this whole
tabs UI is a tabs page so by default our
app comes with four pages we'll talk
about each one of those in a second the
next page is a themes page which
contains some colors we can customize so
if we want to go in here and quickly
change the look and feel of our app we
could change a few color settings and a
wrap would automatically update so it's
a very quick way to quickly brand your
app
declarations DT TS is a file that
typescript uses to type external modules
that don't come with their own typing's
unless you know what you're doing you
can safely ignore that file index.html
is the route to index.html file that
gets put into www it's very important
this is actually the starting point for
your app from a visual standpoint and
this kicks off your entire app the next
file is manifest.json this is a
progressive web app file that identifies
your app as a standalone app for chrome
in mobile web browsers that support it
so if you're building a progressive web
app you'll want to use this file it's
not relevant for this example
serviceworker same thing it's a feature
for progressive web apps which isn't in
the scope of this demo great so that's
the high-level structure of the app
let's actually go and try to modify and
actually build some functionality really
quickly into our app so if we go back to
the app we've got these three pages in
these three tabs let's try making the
home page actually list out a list of
items that we can tap on and navigate to
a detailed view of the item that's
commonly called a master detail view so
the first thing that we'll want to do
because this home page comes with some
filler text it's just open up the view
or template for this page so we'll go
into the source pages home home dot HTML
file which is the view the visual part
of the page we'll just go in the content
here and just delete this content and
then one other thing we can do is remove
this padding attribute which adds a
default padding around the page notice
this is inside here we don't want that
when we're building a list UI so we're
just going to remove it so notice we
save in the app automatically updates
and reflects those changes so generally
what we want to do when we're building
an ionic app is go to the documentation
to look at all the components that we
have
so go to ionic framework comm slash Docs
get UI components and you'll notice that
we've got tons of high quality
components that we can add to our app in
many cases we can just come here and
copy and paste code directly into our
app and that's the intention that we
have with this with this documentation
so don't feel bad about doing it we all
do it so here is if we click lists we
see a simple example for a basic list
that just renders a list of items over
here that's going to work for us so I'm
just going to go and copy this code and
I'm gonna go back to my home template
and paste it in and just make sure it's
formatted right so this uses ion list to
create a list and then it has button I
on item which is a list item that it
renders for every single one of the
items in our list so those of you who
are familiar with angular 1 will notice
ng 4 which is the same as ng repeat this
ng 4 statement says we're going to
iterate through this list of items and
for every single item here we're going
to create a variable called item and
we're going to render this so if we had
10 items here this would look like 10
items being printed so that's that's
basically what ng4 does and then we have
a click handler here which also works
for taps it's just a holdover from the
desktop era that when there's a click
event here we're going to call the item
selected method on our home page and
we're going to pass in the item that was
clicked so let's go back to our
typescript file for this page so if home
dot HTML is a template that makes the
page look like something home dot TS is
the typescript page the typescript code
that makes our page do something so
we're going to go back here and the
first thing that we're going to do is
just create a reference for that item
selected event so I'm just going to
create an item selected method that
takes one parameter of item because
that's what's being passed in here on
the click event and I'm just going to
leave it empty because we don't do
anything with it just yet so the next
thing I need to do is create a list of
items so in Thai script when we create
new variables on our component we need
to define them first
so I need to define this list of items
as an array of any type basically any
object can be in this array and
typescript will be happy with it
so in this constructor I'm just going to
create a set of ten initial items so I'm
creating I'm doing a for loop from zero
to ten and I'm inserting a simple object
with a tax field an ID field and then
down here when when item is selected I'm
just going to do a simple alert and
print out the actual item text I was
selected just to show so we hit save our
app probably updated by now and we've
got a list of items here so we notice
that we're printing object objects
because our template was just printing
the object so we need to tell the
template to render item dot text which
is the string inside that item that
we've created so now we have it printing
properly if we tap on one we'll see that
item printed out so that's great but now
we need to navigate and actually display
one of the items we need the detail page
so creating pages in ionic we can do it
two ways we can just go and create a new
folder here and copy and paste let's say
another page just create a new and
easily but ionic 2 comes with generators
that help us automatically generate new
pages based on the name of the page
so we use generators by using the G
command so we'll run ionics G page so
we're going to say ionic generate a new
page and we're going to call it the
detail page so ionic will go and just
generate this page for us and you can
ignore this warning here we don't need
to deal with that just yet
so we'll notice back in our pages list
that we now have a detail page so just
like the home page we have a template
file we have a sass file for this page
then we have a type script file so what
we're going to do is when in a user taps
one of these items we're actually going
to go and navigate and render this
detail page so to do that we need to do
a few things first of all instead of
doing an alert here what we're going to
do is we're going to use this nav
controller that was injected to our home
page and we're going to tell that nap
controller to push a new instance of our
detail page into the navigation stack so
in typescript when we see this
constructor public nav controller that's
the shorthand that typescript uses to do
this dot nav control equals nav control
for us automatically
so in item selected we have access to
the NAP controller by just doing this
nav control so it's very convenient way
to automatically assign a constructor
argument to the current instance of the
class that we're in so when this item is
selected we're going to call this nap
controller and we're you can only use
the push command to push an instance of
detail page onto the stack we're going
to pass this item into it as a parameter
so this won't work just yet if we
refresh our app is building we're going
to get a typescript error and that error
says we cannot find the name detail page
and that makes sense because we haven't
actually imported detail page into our
class so to do that we need to add an
import statement here
we're going to import the detail page
reference from this type script file we
need to access this type script file
from this tetra kripp file so to do that
we need to go one directory up because
we're in the home folder here so dot dot
flash brings us up one directory to the
pages directory and then we need to go
back down into the detail page and then
reference the detailed ts file now you
don't use TS because typescript just
knows that you're referring to the
typescript file it doesn't necessarily
know about these other files ok so let's
go back to our app which should work now
and if we tap something we'll get a
different error runtime error caused by
no component factory found for detail
page so angular requires us to declare
every single page that we use so we need
to go back to that app dot module ts
where our angular module lives and
you'll notice that we were importing
these other pages here this tells
angular about our page so it knows that
it can render it this is really useful
and important when we use ahead of time
compiling which helps angular take our
app and really tightly pack it together
and it needs you to declare these things
so it can find them when it does that
pre build process so we've added our
detail page here to both declarations
and entry components now if we go back
or app is rebuilding and if we tap on
the items we navigate to the detail page
now you'll notice that it's not printing
any information about our item so to do
that we need to go back to the detail
touch there file and in here this item
that we were looking for will be
available on nav prams
and we'll call NAB prams getitem to grab
it now just like in the other class we
need to declare what item is and it's
just in any type and in any type is
really just an empty anonymous
JavaScript object sorry not empty but
anonymous so item is any we call this
out item equals Knapp Rams get so if
this page is navigated to with a
parameter of item we'll be able to
access it from the net presence now to
make it make the user know that we got
this item we need to render it back to
them in the template so to do that we
can do item text and then just add some
nice message so you'll notice that ionic
is just like any other HTML framework we
can use all the HTML and JavaScript and
CSS that we already know like P tags and
h2 tags and just write things out just
like we're used to so now we have a
template that actually renders the item
text and now if we navigate we'll see
item 2 welcome number 2 great job it's
as simple as that
think of every single page in ionic as
standalone so you can navigate to any
page at any time so when we see this
tabs layout and we see these three tabs
inside the tabs component these are just
references to instances of different
pages so if we go to the tabs typescript
we see that tab 1 root is a reference to
homepage tab 2 root is a reference to
about page and tab 3 root is a reference
to contact page if I wanted to change
that
and do 3 references to homepage just as
an example we'll see now that every
single page has an individual instance
its own instance unique instance of
every single page so if we navigate
inside of each one of these tabs
you'll notice they preserve their
navigation state but we have a back
button here on the first one and we
don't have it there maybe we're
selecting item nine here in item four
here but these pages they aren't tied to
where they live
so unlike ionic one we don't have to
deal with brittle routing where this
page had to be defined by this one URL
and instead we think of pages of
something that can just be navigated to
from anywhere at any time
much more native programming style
that's much more flexible okay so that
was just a simple example just to kind
of prove a point we'll go back to the
way things were okay so we built this
really great app and now why don't we
test it on an actual device that's
always really fun or a simulator so what
we need to do is we'll go back to the
command line
and we will run Cordova run iOS so this
tells Cordova that we're going to run
our app on iOS so something else you
could do instead is Cordova prepare and
then open Xcode and actually run it but
but if all we're just going to do the
court of a run process that does that
for us automatically so this will run
our app in an actual simulator and here
we have the app that we're just building
it looks and feels just like any other
native app we can navigate it back and
forth
everything works and this is our app
running on a simulator so if we had a
phone connected that would work just the
same and as I mentioned we can go and
actually open up the platforms iOS open
the my app Xcode project and that will
actually load up Xcode so we can run our
app from there if we like some people
really prefer using the the IDE flow and
others prefer using just the
command-line tools so I personally
prefer using Xcode because I can just go
and configure everything and something
to keep in mind for iOS is that you
actually have to load up Xcode once in
the beginning too
configure provisioning profiles so for
example you need to set the team so we
can load and configure your app that's
just something that you need to do but
this makes it easy to kind of build and
test on all the different simulators
right from the IDE but like I said many
people have preferred just to use
quarter of a run and it's really up to
you yeah so just remember Cordova run
and then the platform name to just run
it or you can do a Cordova preparer iOS
and then actually open Xcode and run it
well there you have it that's how to go
from installing all of the ionic
dependencies to creating our first
project running the app in our browser
and actually testing it on an actual
simulator so the next steps that I
recommend are to go down to the getting
started page and check out the deploying
guide for the different platforms here
so we have information about Android and
iOS and you'll want to follow these so
you actually have everything configured
for running every single platform that
you care about also take a look at the
cordova platform guide for each platform
that you care about so the Android
platform guide will help you install
everything that you need for Android the
iOS guide will help you install
everything you need for that and this is
just part of mobile development we can
only get you so far at the point that
you actually run into play rap on the
phone Google and Apple lock that down so
you'll need to go and install their
tools but once you do that Cordova works
perfectly with them and you'll find that
it works really well so if all these
platform guys will save you a lot of
time and that's really what you need to
do what you need to do to go to the next
level so beyond that and beyond
installing your different dependencies
we recommend taking a look at some of
the additional things that we have
available so ionic native is a
collection of over 70 native components
for doing pretty much anything that you
need to do from a native standpoint so
people often ask can ioniq do
x y&amp;amp;z native in my answer is always yes
you have full access to all the SDKs
underneath and if there's something that
we don't have that Cordova doesn't offer
you you can go and write your own plugin
and it's really not a scary thing to do
but the nice thing is you can kind of
build these plugins that are
cross-platform
so you just treat it as a black box you
don't need to know all the api's but
they underneath will access the native
code required for each platform so for
example here is the Bluetooth Low Energy
plugin so a lot of people are billing
Bluetooth stuff with ionic is a plugin
that helps you do that make sure to dig
into all the different components that
we have because we have a lot of them so
we having components list here that
lists some components like the action
sheet and every single one of these
components has a more in-depth API dock
that lists all the different options and
all the different features so that's
what the API Doc's are for the actual
components list are more for the really
quick straight-to-the-point demos copy
and paste we're not going to dig into
every single option for you we're just
going to show you some of the core usage
finally take a look at the steaming to
learn how to customize your app and
change the look and feel of your app in
many cases all you need to do is change
some colors and that's in that core
theme file and you'll be and you'll be
set so those are some of the core next
steps for ionic chances are many of the
things that you'll want to do bump up on
more angular specific issues so for that
we have some resources for common things
that people will want to do so check out
our forms resource because forms are
always something that are really
important for apps but can be a little
complicated so we've got some
documentation on forms we talk about
building progressive web apps how to use
NPM and typescript and things like that
we also recommend the angular home page
and the angular home page we'll have
documentation angular do will have
documentation for everything that
angular can do so if you're trying to
figure out how do I do an HTTP call or
add a REST API
go to the angular documentation and take
a look at what they have really anything
that you want to do beyond UI and in
native code is probably in angular world
great so to some of the most important
resources you have available make sure
