of ionic and today I'm really excited to
do a deeper dive into ionic basically go
start to finish walk through installing
everything show you how you create some
of the starter apps and then talk a
little bit about how the development
process and then you know the
development life cycle works for an
ionic app alright so if we go to iron
framework comm and click this button get
started we have a few steps that you'll
need to follow in order to get going so
I'm going to start walk through each one
so for step 1 first of all we need to
install node.js if you don't have node
installed yet you'll you'll want to
install it anyways because it's becoming
one of the most popular ways to build
command-line utilities and I'm sure
you'll end up using it a lot more in the
future so go ahead and install node so
once nodes installed we can start
running some of these commands to
install ionic and cordova and other
tools that we're going to use so first
of all go to your terminal and we'll run
sudo npm install g-- Cordova ionic gulp
ok everything is installed and we're
ready to go to step two step two we can
start a real ionic project and we give
you three simple starting projects one
is a blank one if you just want you
notice from scratch app another is a tab
space interface and the other is a side
menu based navigation so let's try the
tabs on so we're just going to type
ionic start my app tabs
that's going to go in to fetch our core
ionic project and then also the starting
tabs template and combine them into one
project that you can build from so that
might take a little bit here it's just
downloading dependencies that we use
okay we're just about done here there we
go okay so our app is ready to go
we basically downloaded all the
dependencies Cordova all the utilities
that the ionic command-line tool needs
that the gulp tool needs and basically
created a folder for our project that's
a quarter of a project that we can start
building with so first of all we need to
CD into that app directory so we call
that my app so the seed into my app if
we list the directory we see several
files here I'll kinda just walk through
each one and and talk a little bit about
what it does and whether or not you need
to care about it
so the readme that's just for the
repository if you have if you turn this
into a git repo you'll have your own
readme file Bower JSON specifies some of
our script dependencies so we use the we
use Bower right now to load the ionic
codes which also makes it easy for you
to update ionic without having to change
your project then we use a they've got a
config file here which will be the
config file for Cordova we've got a gulp
file and gulp is basically a JavaScript
build tool if you're familiar with grunt
gulp is is another one of those tools
it's kind of a newcomer it's getting
some popularity and we really like it so
we decide to add gulp to this project
and we'll talk about that in a bit hook
so you can ignore that it's a quarter of
a folder ionic type project ionic top
project is something that you can also
ignore which is a settings file
node modules is where our local node
packages have been installed you can
also ignore that package JSON specifies
the dependencies that this project has
as a node package and it kind of comes
with the starter project so you can
ignore that as well it just so we got a
package of JSON file which specifies the
dependencies that we have on 4 node
packages you can probably ignore that
right now just assume that it gives you
everything you need if you're if you're
using node modules for any other reason
you'll you'll add them in there
platforms and plugins those are both
Cordova folders platforms will end up
containing the actual native app
projects for the platform's you've
installed so if we're building an iOS
app and an Android app you'll have two
folders in there one will be iOS and one
will be Android inside the iOS folder
will be an Xcode project so you can
actually build the iOS version in Xcode
if you like and then then we've got a
plugins folder which is where Cordova
will still store the plugins that we've
installed scss folder is a way for you
to customize the look and feel of the
actual ionic themes if you want to use
it we'll talk about that in a second the
www folder is the most important folder
here that's the root of your entire
application so let's just CD in there
and take a look so we've got a
configurable XML XML file which is a
Cordova config file that we may or may
not use if you're if you're really
digging deep into your app and adding
plugins adding configuration options for
Cordova you'll use it for now we'll just
assume that it's set up correctly the
index.html file is the starting point of
your entire project so this sets up the
entire shell it loads all vionic
all of angular it loads our CSS
basically everything but you'll notice
that down here it's actually kind of
small in the body that's because we're
using our navigation system which will
end up loading the content of each page
in the navigation stack from external
templates and that's a standard way of
doing it in angular you can include them
locally if you want inside the file
using script tags but we've externalized
them to make it a little easier to have
a lot of them
so this gives us a nav bar and then a
nav view which will inject the content
here so let's just take a quick look at
what this looks like so if you go down
to step three run it we can use these
commands actually build the project and
start running it so let's just type
Bionic platform add iOS so if you're on
our own a Mac building for iOS is a lot
easier and I recommend it because the
build tests process is a lot faster
using the iOS simulator than it is with
Android so if you can do it it's a great
way to just kind of start developing so
we're going to build a project that
should take just a second and then ionic
emulate will actually open a simulator
and run this project inside of it there
we go we've got our simulator here
loaded pretty quickly and we're just
loading the app right now
there we go great so we've got a very
simple tabbed interface this is a
starting point for building a common UI
view if you're on your iPhone and you
use like the app store this is the type
of structure you'll use and the cool
thing about the tabs layout is actually
allows for sub navigation inside each
tab so here is your friends list you're
in the friends tab but you can actually
navigate inside of each portion and this
is a very simple app so it doesn't do a
lot but you could imagine each tab has
its own history which makes it pretty
powerful even though it looks very
simple you can actually do a lot of
really powerful stuff great so now we
have the app let's talk a little bit
about what the development cycle would
be like so the first thing you probably
want to do is take a look at the
structure of the JavaScript specifically
app touch is kept up j/s is the starting
point of the actual application and this
sets up for this example it sets up all
the URL routes so we're going to use and
that basically means that we are
specifying each page of the app and
linking to them with URLs so if you go
down to the config section you'll see we
have this state provider with multiple
states that we specified so ionic
actually uses angular UI router
underneath and it's a powerful way to
map URLs and States to a template in a
controller so you can imagine back in
the in the running app that we've got a
entire state for the whole tabs so
that's here the first state tab which
loads the tabs template and renders this
entire tabs interface so just taking a
look at templates
tabs
so you'll see the tabs interface here
this basically creates this entire tabs
layout and creates three separate tab
sections so the way you specify tabs
with ionic is you actually specify the
content of the tab and then the I on
tabs directive will generate the actual
tab bar so for this example we have the
dashboard tab uses the in icon the Home
icon it sets this ref to tab / - so when
we link to that URL it will show that
tab inside of it we've created a sub nap
you which where we'll store more
templates so that's the nice thing about
do RI ui-router angular UI routers it
lets you have sub navigation stacks so
we do the same thing for friends and
account so we take a look at the dash
template so all the templates are in WW
templates and then the name of the
template so this is the dash template
it's very very simple it's it's just
trying to be a simple starting point for
you to add your own content so this
creates an eye on view an eye on view is
basically a you could think of it as a
page in a navigation stack so this page
sets its title to be dashboard and so
this will set the tab title actually
we'll set the header title the tab title
comes from another place and then also
add a Content section so pretty simple
here same thing with friends friends is
a little more involved because we
actually have a list so we open the list
the friends template will see that we've
got a list of all our friends and
this basically creates content creates
an ion list which is a convenient way to
create a list and then does an ng-repeat
friend in friends will iterate through
each friend in the friends variable on
scope and create a new item in the list
and then we're also linking saying that
to open this friend and view details
about them here's the URL we'll use to
link to it so this is the most involves
tab so if we look at the controller so
we have specified basically none of
these controllers do anything except for
the friends page and the friend detail
so the friends controller just really
ease really quickly sets the friends
your array to the results of friends dot
all so friends is a angular service
which for this example simply returns an
array of this mock-up data for your
friends and if we click one of these
will navigate to actual detail friend
detail control which gets passed a
friend ID and we call the friends
service to basically look up that friend
and bind it to the scope so if we look
back to templates tab friend detail
you'll see it's just setting the friends
name from the scope here and not much
else
so that's basically the structure of how
the app is defined and how it works you
start with a BAS you specify the routes
the routes end up specifying the
templates to load and then the
controller's run when the templates are
loaded and shown with data and you can
kind of you know follow the the tree
there when you're building your app okay
so that's a very very high-level
overview of how an ionic app is
structured I want to talk a little bit
about how you can use your own sass to
customize the look and feel of ionic so
right now we have this gulp file here
and we haven't talked about that at all
yet but basically it's a build tool for
running certain utility tasks and will
probably be adding more to this over
time but the first thing that we have
here is is a task for compiling the
ionic sass and generating a custom CSS
file from that sass so by default we
actually don't use sass we use the
built-in ionic CSS and you can see that
if you open the index file again so here
we've got live ionic CSS ionic CSS and
then CSS slash style so you would use
these includes if you're not using your
own sass and this basically is including
the core pre-built ionic CSS file that
we've downloaded from Bower in the
beginning and then you have you would
add your own style here so this is fine
if you're not planning on over writing a
lot of ionic if you're just doing your
own custom app stuff and you're you want
to use CSS I recommend just using these
two files but for this example we're
actually going to use sass and when we
use sass we're going to be building
ionic alongside our own stuff so you
actually just end up with one single CSS
file and if you see this comment here
we're basically saying if you're using
sass
then we just need the CSS file so we can
uncomment that one and then go back so
to run gulp we're just going to do gulp
sass which is going to load a s CSS file
which is a syntax that SAS uses and it's
going to load this ionic app dot s CSS
file and we can set some configuration
options here some variables and then we
include all of ionic so let's say we
wanted to change the default header bar
color to let's say a custom color to
match our brand so all we'd have to do
is first of all just find the color so
I've got a little color picker here and
I'm just going to just randomly pick a
color that I like like let's say orange
so let's pick orange and then we have
set this bar to use bar stable so we
open up
the index or the template for the tabs
or sorry sorry the index file which will
have our nav bar we see we're using ion
NAB bar and then class bar stable and
bar stable is just kind of a light gray
it's just a simple color so if we want
stable to actually use our orange color
all we have to do is override it here
and then if we go back and run gulp sass
again I'm just going to create a new tab
if we run gulp sass that will build our
new CSS file using that color as a
default so if we actually kill the
running app and start it up again first
we need to build so that it updates the
code in the binary file that we're going
to run and then if we emulate this we
should see the orange header bar
sometimes it takes a little bit there
you go so it took all the stable colors
and made it this orangish color and of
course we want to do a little more work
on making it look good but that's how
you would start to customize the style
of vionic for your brand so some people
have asked why we use our own command
line tool instead of using Cordova and
the reality is you can use the Cordova
command line tools as much as you like
and in fact there are some things that
the Cordova tool uses has that we don't
have inside of our tool specifically
building release builds and ionic is
actually just using Cordova underneath
and the reason that we created our own
tool was because we are going to be
adding a lot of really really
interesting features to that tool over
time and so we want to get a head start
on getting people to use it and these
are things that are going to be released
over the next year including some
back-end services we've got to build
service that will generate binaries so
you can build an iOS app even if you
don't have a Mac things like that and
those will really come in handy when
when you're building more complicated
applications so we're going to be
rolling those out but that's kind of
what you can expect to see inside that
tool that will go above and beyond the
court of a command line itself so that's
a pretty high-level overview of an ionic
app and how you might get started with
it some of your next steps might be
creating a git project out of your app
which I recommend so this whole project
can be bundled up and put into a git
repo and github for example so I
definitely recommend that as you're
building your app and if you were going
to do that we could pretty much just
I'll show you how you might do that
create a new repository and just going
to make it public call them a test app
okay so we need to go back here we need
to initialize this as a repo we're going
to add basically everything that we have
we should see that we have got a lot of
files here and then we can commit say
initial commit and then add this new
github repo as a remote remote repo and
then push to it
okay great so we've created a git repo
and it uploaded everything and if we
refresh this page we should see our
entire app here so this is a great way
to build the project and have it stored
in a safe place I highly recommend
creating a git project on github as soon
as you create your app structure and
then once you have everything running
the process for building an ionic app is
really just you know spend a lot of time
on the documentation so we totally
revamped the the Java Script guides for
the beta so now we have a lot more
information on how to use basically
every piece of code that's available to
you through the Java Script
and angular extensions so I recommend
taking another look at the docs if you
haven't for example we have basically
every directive automatically documented
including all the options that you would
use we've got for example all the
attribute all the attributes that you
might use on a tab if you're going to
customize it side menus same thing we've
got a lot of information here now so I'd
take another look and these will be
updated for every release so they're
going to stay in sync with what the
codes actually doing so that we spend a
lot of time trying to make that awesome
because the docs needed a lot of work
and so we so we put a lot of effort into
that so that's how you might use the
Java Script section so if you want to
you know load a modal window you can
just go in and take a look at some of
these demos the API which should show
you how to do that and then if you want
to just use some of our CSS components
like cards just go to the CSS section
basically copy and paste this and you've
got you know a card interface so we just
went and add that this to the templates
tab - just add this card here
and then go back and build our project
build iOS
should see this loading
and we've got a card here so that's a
very very legitimate way to build an
ionic gap is to go the docks copy and
paste something change the content if
you see an ionic demo anywhere feel free
to copy and paste and when you have
something you'd like to show we are
starting to build out a really
comprehensive showcase page we have a
few examples right now that we've
launched but we're going to be totally
revamping this and these are some of the
best apps that have been made with ionic
so many of these are in the app stores
you can play with them and we've got a
lot more in the queue that we're going
to be adding so if you want some help
promoting your app if you want some
coverage we're going to be pushing the
community projects a lot more so I
highly recommend submitting your app to
us through the submit page and we will
definitely put it up and and if you're
interested even do an interview and talk
a little bit more about what you're
doing and you know what how you liked
ionic and how you used it and things
like that and finally there's a ton of
developers on the forum right now so if
you have any questions visit the forum
post messages we have people that are
basically Manning the forum full time
and that's that's a new thing so we've
expanded the team there and we are here
to help so please post on the forum if
you have any issues please post it on
the github repo in the issues page we
love when there's a lot of explanation
of you know what type of app what type
of device you're using you know are you
on Android are you on iOS do you have a
code pen or a snippet that kind of shows
the issue and can reproduce it all those
things really really help and we will
fix them we've fixed over 800 bugs
already that have been filed and we're
fixing
them very quickly so just you know feel
free to post an issue and also follow us
on Twitter because we post most of our
messages there and there's a lot of
great stuff that the communities
building that we often share and also
join our mailing list at the bottom here
we will send periodic updates about the
beta about new features things like that
and if you're developing an ionic apps
you'll want to know when things are
going on so thanks so much for watching
this video I really hope that helps you
get up and up and running with ionic and
please please let us know if you're
building anything with it we'd love to
see it and let us know if we can help
